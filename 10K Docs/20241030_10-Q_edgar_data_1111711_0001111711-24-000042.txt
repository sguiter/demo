 All forward-looking statements are expressly qualified in their entirety by the foregoing cautionary statements. We undertake no obligation to, and expressly disclaim any such obligation to, update or revise any forward-looking statements to reflect changed assumptions, the occurrence of anticipated or unanticipated events or changes to the future results over time or otherwise, except as required by law.

Balance as of September 30, 2024 
 Utility revenues are billed to customers monthly on a cycle basis. We expect that substantially all customer accounts receivable will be collected following customer billing, as this revenue consists primarily of periodic, tariff-based billings for service and usage. We maintain common utility credit risk mitigation practices, including requiring deposits and actively pursuing collection of past due amounts. Our regulated operations also utilize certain regulatory mechanisms that facilitate recovery of bad debt costs within tariff-based rates, which provides further evidence of collectibility. It is probable that substantially all of the consideration to which we are entitled from customers will be collected upon satisfaction of performance obligations. 
 Allowance for Credit Losses. To evaluate for expected credit losses, customer account receivables are pooled based on similar risk characteristics, such as customer type, geography, payment terms, and related macro-economic risks. Expected credit losses are established using a model that considers historical collections experience, current information, and reasonable and supportable forecasts. Internal and external inputs are used in our credit model including, but not limited to, energy consumption trends, revenue projections, actual charge-offs data, recoveries data, shut-offs, customer delinquencies, final bill data, and inflation. We continuously evaluate available information relevant to assessing collectability of current and future receivables. We evaluate creditworthiness of specific customers periodically or following changes in facts and circumstances. When we become aware of a specific commercial or industrial customer's inability to pay, an allowance for expected credit losses is recorded for the relevant amount. We also monitor other circumstances that could affect our overall expected credit losses including, but not limited to, creditworthiness of overall population in service territories, adverse conditions impacting an industry sector, and current economic conditions.

 MW and MW of nameplate capacity, respectively. NIPSCO is also a member of JVs that own two solar facilities, Indiana Crossroads Solar and Dunns Bridge I, which have a nameplate capacity of MW and MW, respectively. We have determined that these JVs are VIEs. NIPSCO controls the decisions that are significant to these entities' ongoing operations and economic results. Therefore, we have concluded that NIPSCO is the primary beneficiary and have consolidated all four entities. 
 Members of each respective JV include NIPSCO (who is the managing member) and a tax equity partner. Earnings, tax attributes and cash flows are allocated to both NIPSCO and the tax equity partner in varying percentages by category and over the life of the partnership. NIPSCO and each tax equity partner contributed cash to the respective JV. Once the tax equity partner has earned their negotiated rate of return and the JV has reached a stated contractual date, NIPSCO has the option to purchase the remaining interest in the respective JV from the tax equity partner. NIPSCO has an obligation to purchase of the electricity generated by each commercially operational JV. 
 We did not provide any financial or other support during the quarter that was not previously contractually required.

 Series A Preferred Stock. There were no dividends declared per share for the Series A Preferred Stock during the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. Dividends declared per share for the Series A Preferred Stock were and during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. 
 
 On June 15, 2023, we redeemed all outstanding shares of Series A Preferred Stock for a redemption price of per share or million in total. 
 
 Series B and B-1 Preferred Stock. Dividends declared per share for the Series B Preferred Stock were and during the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively.

 On March 15, 2024, we redeemed all outstanding shares of Series B Preferred Stock for a redemption price of per share and all outstanding shares of Series B-1 Preferred Stock for a redemption price of per share or million in total. Following the redemption, dividends ceased to accrue on the shares of Series B Preferred Stock, shares of the Series B Preferred Stock and Series B-1 Preferred Stock were no longer deemed outstanding and all rights of the holders of such shares of Series B Preferred Stock and Series B-1 Preferred Stock terminated. In conjunction with the redemption, we recorded a million preferred stock redemption premium, calculated as the difference between the carrying value on the redemption date of the Series B Preferred Stock and Series B-1 Preferred Stock and the total amount of consideration paid to redeem, which was recorded as a reduction to retained earnings during the first quarter of 2024. We have not recognized an excise tax liability under the IRA in connection with this redemption as we issued common stock in 2024 in excess of the fair value of the Series B Preferred Stock and Series B-1 Preferred Stock redeemed. 
 
 In March 2024, we filed a Certificate of Elimination to our Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation with the Secretary of State of Delaware to eliminate from the Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation all matters set forth in the Certificate of Designations with respect to the Series B Preferred Stock and the Certificate of Designations with respect to the Series B-1 Preferred Stock. As a result, the shares that were previously designated as Series B Preferred Stock and the shares that were previously designated as Series B-1 Preferred Stock were returned to the status of authorized but unissued shares of preferred stock, par value per share, without designation as to series. The Certificate of Elimination does not change the total number of authorized shares of capital stock of NiSource or the total number of authorized shares of preferred stock. We voluntarily delisted the preferred stock from the New York Stock Exchange.

 Accounts Receivable Transfer Programs. Columbia of Ohio, NIPSCO, and Columbia of Pennsylvania each maintain a receivables agreement whereby they transfer their customer accounts receivables to third-party financial institutions through consolidated special purpose entities. The agreements expire between May 2025 and October 2025 and may be further extended if mutually agreed to by the parties thereto. 
 All receivables transferred to third parties are valued at face value, which approximates fair value due to their short-term nature. The amount of the undivided percentage ownership interest in the accounts receivables transferred is determined in part by required loss reserves under the agreements. 
 Transfers of accounts receivable are accounted for as secured borrowings resulting in the recognition of short-term borrowings on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets (unaudited). As of September 30, 2024, the maximum amount of debt that could be borrowed related to our accounts receivable programs was million. 
 We had and million of short-term borrowings related to the securitization transactions as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, million and million, respectively were recorded as cash flows used for financing activities related to the change in short-term borrowings due to securitization transactions. For the accounts receivable transfer programs, we pay used facility fees for amounts borrowed, unused commitment fees for amounts not borrowed, and upfront renewal fees. Fees associated with the securitization transactions were million and million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, and million and million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Columbia of Ohio, NIPSCO and Columbia of Pennsylvania remain responsible for collecting on the receivables securitized, and the receivables cannot be transferred to another party.

 Regulatory deferral related to renewable energy investments 
 In accordance with the accounting principles of ASC 980, we recognize a regulatory liability or asset for amounts representing the timing difference between the profit earned from the JVs and the amount included in regulated rates to recover our approved investments in consolidated JVs. The amounts recorded in income will ultimately reflect the amount allowed in regulated rates to recover our investments over the useful life of the projects. The offset to the regulatory liability or asset associated with our renewable investments included in regulated rates is recorded in "Depreciation and amortization" on the Condensed Statements of Consolidated Income (unaudited). NiSource recorded depreciation expense of million and million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, and a decrease to depreciation expense of million and million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively. Following the implementation of the NIPSCO electric base rate case implemented in August 2023, we began recognizing amounts to recover our investments of projects that have been placed in service.

 Risk Management Assets and Liabilities. Risk management assets and liabilities include exchange-traded NYMEX futures and NYMEX options and non-exchange-based forward purchase contracts. 
 Level 1- When utilized, exchange-traded derivative contracts are based on unadjusted quoted prices in active markets and are classified within Level 1. These financial assets and liabilities are secured with cash on deposit with the exchange; therefore, nonperformance risk has not been incorporated into these valuations. These financial assets and liabilities are deemed to be cleared and settled daily by NYMEX as the related cash collateral is posted with the exchange. As a result of this exchange rule, NYMEX derivatives are considered to have no fair value at the balance sheet date for financial reporting purposes, and are presented in Level 1 net of posted cash; however, the derivatives remain outstanding and are subject to future commodity price fluctuations until they are settled in accordance with their contractual terms. 
 Level 2- Certain non-exchange-traded derivatives are valued using broker or over-the-counter, on-line exchanges. In such cases, these non-exchange-traded derivatives are classified within Level 2. Non-exchange-based derivative instruments include swaps, forwards, and options. In certain instances, these instruments may utilize models to measure fair value. We use a similar model to value similar instruments. Valuation models utilize various inputs that include quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active, other observable inputs for the asset or liability and market-corroborated inputs, (i.e., inputs derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data by correlation or other means). Where observable inputs are available for substantially the full term of the asset or liability, the instrument is categorized within Level 2.

 material transfers between fair value hierarchies. Additionally, there were no changes in the method or significant assumptions used to estimate the fair value of our financial instruments. 
 NIPSCO and Columbia of Pennsylvania have entered into long-term forward natural gas purchase instruments to lock in a fixed price for natural gas customers. We value these contracts using a pricing model that incorporates market-based information when available, as these instruments trade less frequently and are classified within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy. For additional information, see Note 11, "Risk Management Activities." 
 Available-for-Sale Debt Securities. Available-for-sale debt securities are investments pledged as collateral for trust accounts related to our wholly owned insurance company. We value U.S. Treasury, corporate debt and mortgage-backed securities using a matrix pricing model that incorporates market-based information. These securities trade less frequently and are classified within Level 2. 
 Our available-for-sale debt securities impairments are recognized periodically using an allowance approach. At each reporting date, we utilize a quantitative and qualitative review process to assess the impairment of available-for-sale debt securities at the individual security level. For securities in a loss position, we evaluate our intent to sell or whether it is more-likely-than-not that we will be required to sell the security prior to the recovery of its amortized cost. If either criteria is met, the loss is recognized in earnings immediately, with the offsetting entry to the carrying value of the security. If both criteria are not met, we perform an analysis to determine whether the unrealized loss is related to credit factors. The analysis focuses on a variety of factors that include, but are not limited to, downgrade on ratings of the security, defaults in the current reporting period or projected defaults in the future, the security's yield spread over treasuries, and other relevant market data. If the unrealized loss is not related to credit factors, it is included in other comprehensive income. If the unrealized loss is related to credit factors, the loss is recognized as credit loss expense in earnings during the period, with an offsetting entry to the allowance for credit losses. The amount of the credit loss recorded to the allowance account is limited by the amount at which the security's fair value is less than its amortized cost basis. If certain amounts recorded in the allowance for credit losses are deemed uncollectible, the allowance on the uncollectible portion will be charged off, with an offsetting entry to the carrying value of the security. Subsequent improvements to the estimated credit losses of available-for-sale debt securities will be recognized immediately in earnings. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we have million and million, respectively, recorded as an allowance for credit losses on available-for-sale debt securities as a result of the analysis described above. Continuous credit monitoring and portfolio credit balancing mitigates our risk of credit losses on our available-for-sale debt securities.

 The cost of maturities sold is based upon specific identification. At September 30, 2024 there were no U.S. Treasury debt securities or Corporate/Other debt securities with maturities of less than a year. At December 31, 2023, approximately million of U.S. Treasury debt securities and approximately million of Corporate/Other debt securities had maturities of less than a year. 
 Non-recurring Fair Value Measurements 
 We measure the fair value of certain assets, primarily goodwill, on a non-recurring basis, typically when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable. 
 B. Other Fair Value Disclosures for Financial Instruments. The carrying amount of cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash, notes receivable, customer deposits and short-term borrowings is a reasonable estimate of fair value due to their liquid or short-term nature. Our long-term borrowings are recorded at historical amounts. 
 The following method and assumptions were used to estimate the fair value of each class of financial instruments. 
 Long-term Debt. The fair value of outstanding long-term debt is estimated based on the quoted market prices for the same or similar securities. Certain premium costs associated with the early settlement of long-term debt are not taken into consideration in determining fair value. These fair value measurements are classified within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy. As of September 30, 2024, there was no change in the method or significant assumptions used to estimate the fair value of long-term debt.

These effective tax rates differ from the federal statutory tax rate of primarily due to renewable partnership income, amortization of excess deferred federal income tax liabilities, as specified in the TCJA, tax credits, state flow through, and other permanent book-to-tax differences. 
 The increase in the three-month effective tax rate of in 2024 compared to 2023 was driven by higher renewable partnership income in 2023 resulting from HLBV allocation of earnings due to solar projects going into service, offset by higher non-taxable AFUDC equity recorded on higher construction work in process balances in the current quarter. 
 As of September 30, 2024, there have been no material changes to our unrecognized tax benefits or possible changes that could reasonably be expected to occur during the next twelve months.

While the amounts claimed may be substantial, the Company is unable to predict with certainty the ultimate outcome of such claims and proceedings. The Company establishes reserves whenever it believes it to be appropriate for pending litigation matters. However, the actual results of resolving the pending litigation matters may be substantially higher than the amounts reserved. If one or more matters were decided against us, the effects could be material to

C. 
 million and million, respectively, to cover environmental remediation at various sites. This liability is included in "Other accruals" and "Other noncurrent liabilities and deferred credits" in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets (unaudited). We recognize costs associated with environmental remediation obligations when the incurrence of such costs is probable and the amounts can be reasonably estimated. The original estimates for remediation activities may differ materially from the amount ultimately expended. The actual future expenditures depend on many factors, including laws and regulations, the nature and extent of impact and the method of remediation. These expenditures are not currently estimable at some sites. We periodically adjust our liability as information is collected and estimates become more refined. 
 CERCLA. Our subsidiaries are potentially responsible parties at waste disposal sites under CERCLA and similar state laws. Under CERCLA, each potentially responsible party can be held jointly, severally and strictly liable for the remediation costs, as the EPA, or state, can allow the parties to pay for remedial action or perform remedial action themselves and request reimbursement from the potentially responsible parties. Our affiliates have retained CERCLA environmental liabilities, including remediation liabilities, associated with certain current and former operations. At this time, we cannot estimate the full cost of remediating properties that have not yet been investigated, but it is possible that the future costs could be material to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (unaudited). 
 MGP. We maintain a program to identify and investigate former MGP sites where our subsidiaries or predecessors may have liability. The program has identified such sites where liability is probable. Remedial actions at many of these sites are being overseen by state or federal environmental agencies through consent agreements or voluntary remediation agreements. 
 We utilize a probabilistic model to estimate our future remediation costs related to MGP sites. The model was prepared with the assistance of a third party and incorporates our experience and general industry experience with remediating MGP sites. We complete an annual refresh of the model in the second quarter of each fiscal year. We recorded an million increase to the estimated future remediation costs as a result of the refresh completed in the second quarter of 2024. No material changes to the estimated future remediation costs were noted as a result of an internal quarterly review of environmental reserves completed as of September 30, 2024. Our total estimated liability related to the facilities subject to remediation was million and million at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. The liability represents our best estimate of the probable cost to remediate the MGP sites. Our model indicates that it is reasonably possible that remediation costs could vary by as much as million in addition to the costs noted above. Remediation costs are estimated based on the best available information, applicable remediation standards at the balance sheet date and experience with similar facilities. 
 CCRs. NIPSCO continues to meet the compliance requirements established by the EPA for the regulation of CCRs. The CCR rule requirements currently in effect required revisions to previously recorded legal obligations associated with the retirement of certain NIPSCO facilities. The actual asset retirement costs related to the CCR rule may vary substantially from the estimates used to record the increased asset retirement obligation due to the uncertainty about the requirements that will be established by environmental authorities, compliance strategies that will be used and the preliminary nature of available data used to estimate costs. As allowed by the rule, NIPSCO will continue to collect data over time to determine the specific compliance solutions and associated costs and, as a result, the actual costs may vary.

 million to cover probable and estimable compliance activities associated with the Legacy CCR Rule. Applicability determinations for legacy impoundments are due when the rule becomes effective on November 8, 2024. Facility evaluations for CCRMUs are required by February 2026 and 2027. NIPSCO continues to assess whether existing legal obligations associated with the retirement of certain facilities must be revised and to estimate probable additional required asset retirement costs. NIPSCO expects to receive recovery of any such costs through existing and future depreciation rates.

 million payment to the developer. In May 2024, Cavalry achieved substantial completion and commencement of commercial operations, resulting in NIPSCO making a million payment to the developer. In August 2024, the IURC approved full ownership of the Gibson and Fairbanks projects and modification of the cost of the Fairbanks project as contemplated in the contractual actions referenced above. In September 2024, Dunns Bridge II achieved mechanical completion, resulting in NIPSCO making a million payment to the developer. NIPSCO will file a future request to modify the ownership structure for the Templeton wind project to become a wholly owned project.

 NiSource Inc. 

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 

This Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations ("Management s Discussion") includes management s analysis of past financial results and certain potential factors that may affect future results, potential future risks and approaches that may be used to manage those risks. See "Note regarding forward-looking statements" at the beginning of this report for a list of factors that may cause results to differ materially. 
 Management's Discussion is designed to provide an understanding of our operations and financial performance and should be read in conjunction with our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023. 
 We are an energy holding company under the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 2005 whose utility subsidiaries are fully regulated natural gas and electric utility companies serving customers in six states. We generate substantially all of our operating income through these rate-regulated businesses, which are summarized for financial reporting purposes into two primary reportable segments: Columbia Operations and NIPSCO Operations. Refer to ''Note 17, "Business Segment Information," for further discussion of our business segments. 
 Our goal is to develop strategies that benefit all stakeholders as we (i) focus on long-term infrastructure investment and safety programs to better serve our customers, (ii) align our tariff structures with our cost structure, and (iii) address changing customer energy demand. These strategies focus on improving safety and reliability, enhancing customer experience, pursuing regulatory and legislative initiatives to increase accessibility for customers currently not on our gas and electric service, ensuring customer affordability and reducing emissions while generating sustainable returns. The safety of our customers, communities and employees remains our focus. Serving as a guiding practice for our SMS, NiSource is certified in conformance to the American Petroleum Institute Recommended Practice 1173, which is the foundation to our journey towards operational excellence. We continue to make advancements in key strategic initiatives, described in further detail below. 
 Energy Transition: We are advancing our energy transition strategy, primarily through the continuation and enhancement of existing programs, such as retiring and replacing remaining coal-fired electric generation by 2028 with a balanced mix of low- or zero-emission electric generation, ongoing pipe replacement and modernization programs, and deployment of advanced leak detection and repair. Our electric generation transition, initiated through the NIPSCO 2018 Integrated Resource Plan ("2018 Plan") is well underway, and we are continually adjusting to the dynamic energy landscape. As of September 30, 2024, we have executed and received IURC approval for BTAs and PPAs for wind, solar and solar plus storage projects, with a combined nameplate capacity of 1,950 MW and 1,400 MW, respectively, under the 2018 Plan. In January 2024, the IURC approved full ownership of the Cavalry and Dunns Bridge II projects. In August 2024 the IURC approved full ownership of the Gibson and Fairbanks projects and modification of the cost of the Fairbanks project as contemplated in the contractual actions. Full ownership of these projects allows NIPSCO to leverage provisions of the IRA, monetize renewable tax credits more effectively, and provide enhanced benefits to customers as compared to the previous tax equity partnership structure approved by the IURC. In May 2024, the Cavalry project was placed in service. We remain on track to retire R.M Schahfer's remaining two coal units by the end of 2025. For additional information, see "Results and Discussion of Segment Operations - NIPSCO Operations," in this Management's Discussion. 
 
 In 2021, we announced and filed with the IURC the Preferred Energy Resource Plan associated with our 2021 Integrated Resource Plan ("2021 Plan"). The 2021 Plan affirms plans to retire the coal unit at the Michigan City Generating Station by the end of 2028. The 2021 Plan calls for the replacement of the retiring units with a diverse portfolio of resources including demand side management resources, incremental solar, stand-alone energy storage and upgrades to existing facilities at the Sugar Creek Generating Station, among other steps. In the first half of 2024, Sugar Creek completed an Advanced Gas Path Tech upgrade that enhanced its overall production capabilities by an estimated 68 MW. Additionally, the 2021 Plan calls for a new natural gas peaking facility to replace existing vintage gas peaking facilities at the R.M. Schahfer Generating Station to support system reliability and resiliency, and upgrades to the electric transmission system. In September of 2023, we filed a request for issuance of a certificate of public convenience and necessity for an approximately 400 MW natural gas peaking generation facility with the IURC, which was approved in October of 2024. The planned retirement of the two vintage gas peaking facilities at the R.M. Schahfer Generating Station is also expected to occur by the end of 2028. Final retirement dates for these units, as well as Michigan City, will be subject to MISO approval. 
 
 NIPSCO s 2024 Integrated Resource Plan ("2024 Plan") is currently in-progress and formal stakeholder engagement began in the second quarter. The 2024 Plan will inform future generation investments needed to ensure reliability for NIPSCO s customers and will incorporate factors such as anticipated load growth from data centers and other economic development 
 41

 NiSource Inc. 

opportunities, new EPA emissions rules, and evolving MISO resource accreditation rules. The 2024 Plan will be submitted to the IURC in December 2024 and will include an updated Preferred Energy Resource Plan. We have seen an acceleration of customer interest in our northern Indiana service territory in the form of data center development. We believe data center development can enhance our local tax base, diversify the employment base across the state of Indiana, and provide greater value to existing customers and shareholders. We are evaluating the potential for data center development in our service territory, including ways to effectively manage the potential power demand, generation sources, and transmission capabilities to meet potential load growth from any data center customer, while at the same time focusing on our environmental goals. We expect that management of load growth would require new generation and transmission capabilities. We plan to move as efficiently as possible while maintaining the integrity of our commercial, planning, regulatory, procurement and operational execution processes. 
 
 We continue to enhance safety and reduce methane emissions on our gas systems through modernization programs and utilization of advanced leak detection and repair. In addition, we plan to advance other low- or zero-emission energy resources and technologies, such as hydrogen and renewable natural gas. 
 
 NIPSCO Minority Interest Transaction: On December 31, 2023, contemporaneously with the closing of the NIPSCO Minority Interest Transaction, Blackstone, NIPSCO Holdings I, NIPSCO Holdings II, and NiSource entered into an Amended and Restated Limited Liability Company Agreement (the "LLC Agreement") of NIPSCO Holdings II. On January 31, 2024, BIP transferred a 4.5 equity interest in NIPSCO Holdings II to BIP Blue Buyer VCOC L.L.C., a Delaware limited liability company and also an affiliate of Blackstone. Effective upon the closing of this transfer, the members of NIPSCO Holdings II entered into a Second Amended and Restated Limited Liability Company Operating Agreement of NIPSCO Holdings II (the "Amended LLC Agreement"). The two affiliates of Blackstone must vote their equity holdings under the Amended LLC Agreement as one investor. Refer to Note 4, "Noncontrolling Interests," for more information on this transaction. 
 Transformation: Our enterprise-wide transformation roadmap focuses on operational excellence, safety, operation and maintenance management, and unlocking efficiencies. We are committed to identifying and implementing initiatives that will enable us to streamline work and improve logistics company-wide. These efforts include investments in proven technologies backed with standardized processes that will change the way we plan, schedule, and execute work in the field and how we engage and provide service to our customers. Taken together, all of our optimization initiatives will prioritize safety and continue to optimize our long-term growth profile. We are making progress towards our transformation goals with a successful completion of the first phase of our WAM program, an enterprise resource planning system that will optimize the scheduling, dispatch, and execution of our field operations. This phase of the program implemented the solution within our electric distribution operations, while our second phase for gas distribution operations is anticipated to be completed by the third quarter of 2025. 
 Economic Environment: We continue to monitor risks related to increasing order and delivery lead times for construction and other materials, potential unavailability of materials due to global shortages in raw materials, and decreased construction labor productivity in the event of disruptions in the availability of materials. We continue to see increasing prices associated with environmental remediation services and certain materials and supplies. To the extent that work delays occur or our costs increase, our business operations, results of operations, cash flows, and financial condition could be materially adversely affected. 
 We are faced with increased competition for employee and contractor talent in the current labor market which has resulted in increased costs to attract and retain talent. We are ensuring that we use all internal human capital programs (development, leadership enablement programs, succession, performance management) to promote retention of our current employees along with having a competitive and attractive employee value proposition for potential recruits. With a focus on workforce planning we continue to evaluate talent needs and flexible work arrangements where possible to support a broader talent footprint for sourcing needed talent. 
 We continue to evaluate our financing plan to manage interest expense and exposure to rates. For more information on interest rate risk, see "Market Risk Disclosures".

Summary of Consolidated Financial Results 
 A summary of our consolidated financial results for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 are presented below: 
 Three Months Ended September 30, 
 Nine Months Ended September 30, 
 (in millions, except per share amounts) 2024 2023 Favorable (Unfavorable) 2024 2023 Favorable (Unfavorable) Operating Revenues 1,076.3 1,027.4 48.9 3,867.3 4,083.4 (216.1) Operating Expenses Cost of energy 165.9 181.3 15.4 755.6 1,198.3 442.7 Depreciation expense

 0.19 0.19 1.15 1.05 0.10 Diluted Earnings Per Share 0.19 0.17 0.02 1.14 0.98 0.16 
 The majority of the cost of energy in the Columbia Operations and NIPSCO Operations segments are tracked costs that are passed through directly to the customer, resulting in an equal and offsetting amount reflected in operating revenues. 
 The increase in net income available to common shareholders for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily due to higher revenues, net of cost of energy, driven by our continued investment in safety, reliability and low or zero emission generation as well as increased AFUDC Equity, reported in Other Deductions, Net, primarily related to the mechanical completion of NIPSCO's Cavalry and Dunns Bridge II projects. Additionally, net income available to common shareholders increased due to the elimination of the preferred stock dividends following the redemption of both the Series A and B preferred stock. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, the increase in net income available to common shareholders is primarily offset by higher depreciation expense attributed to our planned capital expenditures and higher interest expense. Increased net income attributable to noncontrolling interest following the consummation of the NIPSCO Minority Interest Transaction reduces net income available to common shareholders for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 . See Note 6, "Equity," in the Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (unaudited) for additional information. 
 For additional information on operating income variance drivers see "Results and Discussion of Segment Operations" for Columbia Operations and NIPSCO Operations in this Management's Discussion. 
 Income Taxes 
 Refer to Note 13, "Income Taxes," in the Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (unaudited) for information on income taxes and the change in the effective tax rates. 
 We continue to monitor and evaluate the impacts of final or proposed income tax regulations issued on provisions of the IRA including but not limited to renewable energy tax credits.

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION OF SEGMENT OPERATIONS 
 Presentation of Segment Information 
 In response to the NIPSCO Minority Interest Transaction, our operations are now evaluated through two primary reportable segments, Columbia Operations and NIPSCO Operations. Our historical segment disclosures have been recast to be consistent with the current presentation. Columbia Operations aggregates the results of the fully regulated and wholly owned subsidiaries of NiSource Gas Distribution Group, Inc. Each Columbia distribution company is an operating segment which we aggregate to form the Columbia Operations reportable segment. NIPSCO Operations aggregates the results of NIPSCO Holdings I, and its majority-owned subsidiaries, including NIPSCO, which has both fully regulated gas and electric operations in Northwest Indiana. The remainder of our operations, which are not significant enough on a stand-alone basis to warrant treatment as a reportable segment, are presented as "Corporate and Other" within the Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (unaudited) and primarily are comprised of interest expense on holding company debt, and unallocated corporate costs and activities.

 Columbia Operations 

 The underlying reasons for changes in our operating revenues for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023 are presented below. 
 Favorable (Unfavorable) Changes in Operating Revenues (in millions) 
 Three Months Ended September 30, 2024 vs 2023 
 Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 vs 2023 
 New rates from base rate proceedings and regulatory capital programs 19.1 71.3 The effects of customer usage 
 (1.5) 7.9 The effects of customer growth 1.4 5.0 The effects of weather in 2024 compared to 2023 
 (1.0) (6.3) Other (0.2) (3.6) Change in operating revenues (before cost of energy and other tracked items) 17.8 74.3 Operating revenues offset in operating expense Lower cost of energy billed to customers (10.3) (157.8) Higher (lower) tracker deferrals within operation and maintenance, depreciation, and tax 
 5.2 (33.0) Total change in operating revenues 12.7 (116.5) 
 Weather 
 In general, we calculate the weather-related revenue variance based on changing customer demand driven by weather variance from normal heating degree days, net of weather normalization mechanisms. Our composite heating degree days reported do not directly correlate to the weather-related dollar impact on the results of Columbia Operations. Heating degree days experienced during different times of the year or in different operating locations may have more or less impact on volume and dollars depending on when and where they occur. When the detailed results are combined for reporting, there may be weather-related dollar impacts on operations when there is not an apparent or significant change in our aggregated composite heating degree day comparison. 
 Throughput 
 The increase in total volumes for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same period in 2023, is primarily attributable to increased industrial usage offset by off-system sales. 
 The increase in total volumes for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same period in 2023, is primarily attributable to increased industrial usage offset by off-system sales. 
 Commodity Price Impact 
 Cost of energy for the Columbia Operations segment is principally comprised of the cost of natural gas used while providing transportation and distribution services to customers. All Columbia Operations companies have state-approved recovery mechanisms that provide a means for full recovery of prudently incurred gas costs. These are tracked costs that are passed through directly to the customer, and the gas costs included in revenues are matched with the gas cost expense recorded in the period. The difference is recorded on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets (unaudited) as under-recovered or over-recovered gas cost to be included in future customer billings. Therefore, increases in these tracked operating expenses are offset by increases in operating revenues and have essentially no impact on net income. 
 Certain of the Columbia Operations companies continue to offer choice opportunities, where customers can choose to purchase gas from a third-party supplier, through regulatory initiatives in their respective jurisdictions.

 (5.0) (284.9) Lower tracker deferrals within operation and maintenance, depreciation and tax 
 (12.8) (33.2) Total change in operating revenues 36.3 (99.1) 
 Weather 
 The results of operations for the NIPSCO Operations segment include income from both electric and gas service lines. In general, we calculate the weather-related revenue variance based on changing customer demand driven by weather variance from normal cooling degree days and normal heating degree days, net of weather normalization mechanisms. Our composite cooling and heating degree days reported do not directly correlate to the weather-related dollar impact on the results of NIPSCO Operations. Cooling and heating degree days experienced during different times of the year or in different operating locations may have more or less impact on volume and dollars depending on when they occur. When the detailed results are combined for reporting, there may be weather-related dollar impacts on operations when there is not an apparent or significant change in our aggregated composite cooling and heating degree day comparison. 
 Sales 
 The increase in total volumes sold to electric customers for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023 was primarily attributable to increased usage across all customer classes. 
 The increase in total volumes sold to electric customers for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023 was primarily attributable to increased usage by wholesale, residential and commercial customers offset by decreased usage by industrial customers. 
 The decrease in total volumes sold to gas customers for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023 was primarily attributable to decreased usage by industrial and residential customers. 
 Commodity Price Impact 
 Cost of energy for the NIPSCO Operations segment's electric activities is principally comprised of the cost of coal, natural gas purchased for internal generation of electricity, and the cost of power purchased from generators of electricity for its generation and transmission activities. For its gas distribution activities, NIPSCO Operations' cost of energy is principally comprised of the cost of natural gas used while providing transportation and distribution services to customers. NIPSCO Operations has state-approved recovery mechanisms that provide a means for full recovery of prudently incurred costs of energy. The majority of these costs of energy are passed through directly to the customer, and the costs of energy included in operating revenues are matched with the cost of energy expense recorded in the period. The difference is recorded on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets (unaudited) as under-recovered or over-recovered fuel and gas costs to be included in future customer billings. Therefore, increases in these tracked operating expenses are offset by increases in operating revenues and have essentially no impact on net income.

 Electric Supply and Generation Transition 
 NIPSCO continues to execute on an electric generation transition consistent with the 2018 Plan and 2021 Plan, which outlines the path to retire the remaining two coal units at R.M. Schahfer by the end of 2025 and the remaining coal-fired generation at Michigan City by the end of 2028, to be replaced by lower-cost, reliable and cleaner options. 
 NIPSCO continues to await EPA decision on an administrative approval associated with the operation of R.M. Schahfer s remaining two coal units until 2025. In the event that the approval is not obtained, future operations could be impacted. We cannot estimate the financial impact on us if this approval is not obtained. Refer to Item 1A. Risk Factors, "Operational Risks," of the 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K for further detail. 
 The current replacement plan is aligned with the Preferred Energy Resource Plan outlined in the 2021 Plan and primarily includes renewable sources of energy, including wind, solar, battery storage, and flexible natural gas resources to be obtained through a combination of NIPSCO ownership and PPAs. NIPSCO has sold, and may in the future sell, renewable energy credits from its renewable generation to third parties to offset customer costs. NIPSCO has executed several PPAs to purchase 100 of the output from renewable generation facilities at a fixed price per MWh. Each facility supplying the energy will have an associated nameplate capacity, and payments under the PPAs will not begin until the associated generation facility is constructed by the owner/seller. NIPSCO has also executed several BTAs with developers to construct renewable generation facilities. 
 Since 2020, two wind PPA projects, two wind BTA projects and three solar BTA projects have been placed into service, totaling 1,665 MW of nameplate capacity plus additional battery energy storage system capacity at Cavalry. NIPSCO has executed commercial agreements for each of the seven remaining identified projects. Dunns Bridge II, Fairbanks, Gibson, GreenRiver, Appleseed, Carpenter and Templeton have received IURC approval. In January 2024, the IURC approved increases to the project costs as well as the full ownership of Cavalry and Dunns Bridge II. In August 2024, the IURC approved full ownership of Gibson and Fairbanks as well as increases to the cost of the Fairbanks project. NIPSCO has also contracted with a developer to convert the previously approved Templeton PPA to a BTA and has provided a notice of intent to file with the IURC. In October 2024 the IURC approved the certificate of public convenience and necessity for NIPSCO's planned gas peaking facility to be located at the R.M. Schahfer Generating Station. See "Executive Summary - Energy Transition" in this Management's Discussion for additional information. We expect the majority of our remaining BTA and PPA projects to be placed in service between 2025 and 2027.

 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 
 We continually evaluate the availability of adequate financing to fund our ongoing business operations, working capital and core safety and infrastructure investment programs. Our financing is sourced through cash flow from operations and the issuance of debt and/or equity. External debt financing is provided primarily through the issuance of long-term debt, accounts receivable securitization programs and our 1.85 billion commercial paper program, which is backstopped by our committed revolving credit facility with a total availability from third-party lenders of 1.85 billion. Sources of financing activities for the current year are as follows: 
 On December 31, 2023, we consummated the NIPSCO Minority Interest Transaction in exchange for a capital contribution of 2.16 billion in cash. 
 On January 3, 2024, we applied the proceeds from the NIPSCO Minority Interest Transaction and repaid in full our 1.0 billion term credit agreement and our 650.0 million term credit agreement. 
 On February 22, 2024, we entered into an ATM equity program that provides an opportunity to issue and sell shares of our common stock up to an aggregate issuance of 900.0 million through December 31, 2025. As of September 30, 2024, the ATM program (including the impact of open forward sale agreements) had approximately 297.7 million of equity available for issuance. 
 On March 14, 2024, we completed the issuance and sale of 650.0 million of 5.350 senior unsecured notes maturing in 2034, which resulted in approximately 642.6 million of net proceeds after discount and debt issuance costs. 
 On March 15, 2024, we redeemed all 20,000 outstanding shares of Series B Preferred Stock for a redemption price of 25,000 per share and all 20,000 outstanding shares of Series B-1 Preferred Stock for a redemption price of 0.01 per share or 500.0 million in total. 
 On May 16, 2024, we completed the issuance and sale of 500.0 million of 6.950 fixed-to-fixed reset rate junior subordinated notes maturing in 2054, which resulted in approximately 493.4 million million of net proceeds after debt issuance costs. 
 On June 24, 2024, we completed the issuance and sale of 600.0 million of 5.200 senior unsecured notes maturing in 2029, which resulted in approximately 593.7 million of net proceeds after discount and debt issuance costs. 
 On September 9, 2024, we completed the issuance and sale of 500.0 million of 6.375 fixed-to-fixed reset rate junior subordinated notes maturing in 2055, which resulted in approximately 493.6 million of net proceeds after debt issuance costs. 
 We believe these sources provide adequate capital to fund our operating activities and capital expenditures in 2024 and beyond. See Note 4, "Noncontrolling Interests," Note 6, "Equity," Note 7, "Short-Term Borrowings," and Note 8, "Long-Term Debt," in the Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (unaudited) for more information on our financing activities.

 Operating Activities 
 The decrease in cash from operating activities was primarily driven by year over year change in accounts receivable collections, inventory and exchange gas receivables due to the impact of lower gas prices, partially offset by higher accounts payables and net income.

 Investing Activities 
 Year over year decrease in investing activities was primarily comprised of lower capital expenditures spending. 
 We remain on track to make capital investments totaling 3.3 billion to 3.5 billion during the 2024 period. We also expect to invest approximately 19.3 billion during the 2025-2029 period, including capital investments to support our generation transition strategy. These forecasted capital investments are subject to continuing review and adjustment. Actual capital expenditures may vary from these estimates. 
 
 Regulatory Capital Programs. We are in the process of upgrading and modernizing our electric system to enhance safety and reliability by addressing aged infrastructure and deploying advanced grid technologies. We are also upgrading and modernizing our gas infrastructure to enhance safety and reliability by reducing leaks. An ancillary benefit of these programs is the reduction of GHG emissions. In 2024, we continue to move forward on core infrastructure and environmental investment programs supported by complementary regulatory and customer initiatives across all six states of our operating area.

 Certain of our subsidiaries have agreements that contain ''ratings triggers'' that require increased collateral if our credit rating or the credit ratings of certain of our subsidiaries are below investment grade. These agreements are primarily for insurance purposes and for the physical purchase or sale of power. As of September 30, 2024, the collateral requirement that would be required in the event of a downgrade below the ratings trigger levels would amount to approximately 112.4 million. In addition to agreements with ratings triggers, there are other agreements that contain ''adequate assurance'' or ''material adverse change'' provisions that could necessitate additional credit support such as letters of credit and cash collateral to transact business. 
 Equity. Our authorized capital stock consists of 770,000,000 shares, 0.01 par value, of which 750,000,000 are common stock and 20,000,000 are preferred stock. As of September 30, 2024, 466,707,452 shares of common stock were outstanding. 
 Contractual Obligations. A summary of contractual obligations is included in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. Except for our 2024 debt issuances, there were no additional material changes from year-end during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. Refer to Note 8, "Long-Term Debt," in the Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (unaudited) for additional information regarding the debt issuances.

 Regulatory, Environmental and Safety Matters 

Cost Recovery and Trackers 
 Comparability of our line item operating results is impacted by regulatory trackers that allow for the recovery in rates of certain costs such as those described below. Increases in the costs that are subject to approved regulatory tracker mechanisms generally lead to increased regulatory assets, which ultimately result in a corresponding increases in operating revenues and expenses and, therefore, have essentially no impact on total operating income results. Certain approved regulatory tracker mechanisms allow for abbreviated regulatory proceedings in order for the operating companies to quickly implement revised rates and recover associated costs. 
 A portion of the Columbia Operations and NIPSCO Operations revenue is related to the recovery of gas costs, the review and recovery of which occurs through standard regulatory proceedings. All states in our operating area require periodic review of actual gas procurement activity to determine prudence and to confirm the recovery of prudently incurred energy commodity costs supplied to customers. 
 We recognize that energy efficiency reduces emissions, conserves natural resources and saves our customers money. Our gas distribution companies offer programs such as energy efficiency upgrades, home checkups and weatherization services. The increased efficiency of natural gas appliances and improvements in home building codes and standards contributes to a long-term trend of declining average use per customer. While we are looking to expand offerings so the energy efficiency programs can benefit as many customers as possible, our Columbia Operations and NIPSCO Operations have pursued changes in rate design to more effectively match recoveries with costs incurred. Columbia of Ohio has adopted a straight fixed variable rate design for residential customers that closely links the recovery of fixed costs with fixed charges. Columbia of Maryland, Columbia of Virginia and NIPSCO Gas have regulatory approval for weather and revenue normalization adjustments for certain customer classes, which adjust monthly revenues that exceed or fall short of approved levels. Columbia of Pennsylvania continues to operate its pilot residential weather normalization adjustment and also has a fixed customer charge. This weather normalization adjustment only adjusts revenues when actual weather compared to normal varies by more than 3 during the winter heating season. Columbia of Kentucky incorporates a weather normalization adjustment for certain customer classes and also has a fixed customer charge. 
 A portion of the NIPSCO Operations revenue is related to the recovery of fuel costs to generate power and the fuel costs related to purchased power. These costs are recovered through a FAC, which is updated quarterly to reflect actual costs incurred to supply electricity to customers. 
 While increased efficiency of electric appliances and improvements in home building codes and standards has impacted the average use per electric customer in recent years, NIPSCO Operations expects future growth in residential and commercial customer usage as a result of increasing electric applications, such as electric vehicles becoming more prevalent. These ongoing changes in use of electricity will likely lead to development of innovative rate designs, and NIPSCO Operations will continue efforts to design rates that increase the certainty of recovery of fixed costs.

 PHMSA Legislation and Regulations 
 We are committed to reducing the environmental impact of our business and promoting sustained environmental stewardship. We seek proactive opportunities for improved environmental performance and are committed to complying with environmental laws and regulations. To fulfill our vision of being a trusted energy provider, we follow safety practices recommended by leading industry organizations. These practices help us identify and address potential risks, resulting in improvements to our operational and environmental safety. 
 
 Under the Protecting Our Infrastructure of Pipelines and Enhancing Safety (PIPES) Act of 2020, PHMSA has revised, and continues to revise, the pipeline safety regulations to require operators to update, as needed, their existing distribution integrity management plans, emergency response plans, and operation and maintenance plans. PHMSA has also adopted new requirements for managing records and updating, as necessary, existing district regulator stations to eliminate common modes of failure that can lead to over-pressurization. 
 
 In May 2023, PHMSA proposed numerous regulatory revisions under the PIPES Act of 2020 to minimize methane emissions and improve public safety. Under these proposed revisions, our subsidiaries would be required to detect and repair an increased number of gas leaks, reduce the time to repair leaks, increase leak survey frequency, and expand our existing advanced leak detection program. We continue to evaluate the proposed rule for additional impacts on our business. 
 
 In September 2023, PHMSA proposed additional regulatory revisions under the PIPES Act of 2020 to enhance distribution system safety through equipment and procedural expectations. Operators will be required to incorporate additional protections for low pressure distribution systems that prevent over-pressurization, amend construction procedures designed to minimize the

 risk of incidents caused by system over-pressurization, and update distribution integrity management programs to cover and prepare for over-pressurization incidents. 
 
 On November 30, 2023, the House Transportation Infrastructure Committee introduced new pipeline safety reauthorization legislation known as the PIPES Act of 2023 to reauthorize PHMSA s safety programs for the next four years. The proposed legislation includes several priorities for our company, including excavation damage prevention grants to improve states damage prevention programs, a PHMSA study on blending hydrogen in distribution pipelines, new criminal penalties for intentionally damaging pipeline facilities, and creation of a Voluntary Information Sharing System to allow for industry participants to share learnings and best practices in a protected manner across the pipeline industry. 
 
 Climate Change Issues 
 Physical Climate Risks. Increased frequency of severe and extreme weather events associated with climate change could materially impact our facilities, energy sales, and results of operations. We are unable to predict these events. However, we perform ongoing assessments of physical risk, including physical climate risk, to our business. More extreme and volatile temperatures, increased storm intensity and flooding, and more volatile precipitation leading to changes in lake and river levels are among the weather events that are most likely to impact our business. Efforts to mitigate these physical risks continue to be implemented on an ongoing basis. 
 Transition Climate Risks . We actively engage with and monitor the impact that proposed legislative and regulatory programs related to GHG emissions would have on our business, at both the federal and state levels. 
 
 Regarding federal policies, we continue to monitor the implementation of any final and proposed climate change-related legislation and regulations, including the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act ("IIJA"), IRA, EPA's final methane regulations for the oil and natural gas industry, and EPA's proposed Waste Emissions Charge for Petroleum and Natural Gas Systems. We have identified potential opportunities associated with the IIJA and the IRA and are evaluating how they may align with our strategy going forward. The energy-related provisions of the IIJA include new federal funding for power grid infrastructure and resiliency investments, new and existing energy efficiency and weatherization programs, electric vehicle infrastructure for public chargers and additional LIHEAP funding. The IRA contains climate and energy provisions, including funding to decarbonize the electric sector. 
 
 The United States is a party to the Paris Agreement, an international treaty through which parties set nationally determined contributions to reduce GHG emissions, build resilience, and adapt to the impacts of climate change. The Biden Administration has set a target for the United States to achieve a 50 -52 GHG reduction from 2005 levels by 2030, which supports the President's goals to create a carbon-free power sector by 2035 and net zero emissions economy no later than 2050. There are many potential pathways to reach these goals. 
 The DOE has selected two hydrogen hubs in our territories as recipients of funding designated in the IIJA to support the development of regional clean hydrogen hubs. The two hubs are the Midwest Alliance for Clean Hydrogen Hub (MachH2), with potential projects across Illinois, Indiana, Kentucky, Michigan, Missouri, and Wisconsin; and the Appalachian Regional Clean Hydrogen Hub (ARCH2), with potential investments across West Virginia, Ohio, Kentucky, and Pennsylvania. Work is underway to determine what roles our companies may have with these hydrogen hubs. 
 In May 2024, the EPA published final greenhouse gas standards and guidelines for fossil fuel-fired power plants. The rules are not expected to impact NIPSCO s existing electric generation, but, depending on the outcome of ongoing litigation, may impose certain operational limitations on other existing and new electric generation. We are assessing the potential impacts of these rules through the current 2024 NIPSCO Integrated Resource Planning process.

 Regulatory, Environmental and Safety Matters 

 We also continue to monitor the implementation of any final and proposed state policy. The Virginia Energy Innovation Act, enacted into law in April 2022, and effective July 1, 2022, allows natural gas utilities to supply alternative forms of gas that meet certain standards and reduce emissions intensity. The Act also provides that the costs of enhanced leak detection and repair may be added to a utility s plan to identify proposed eligible infrastructure replacement projects and related cost recovery mechanisms, known as the SAVE Plan. Furthermore, under the Act, utilities can recover eligible biogas supply infrastructure costs on an ongoing basis. The provisions of these laws may provide opportunities for Columbia of Virginia as it participates in the transition to a lower carbon future. 
 The Climate Solutions Now Act of 2022 requires Maryland to reduce GHG emissions by 60 by 2031 (from 2006 levels), and it requires the state to reach net zero emissions by 2045. The Maryland Department of the Environment ("MDE") adopted a plan to achieve its 2031 goal and is required to adopt a plan for its 2045 net zero goal by 2030. In June 2024, Governor Moore signed an executive order to advance Maryland s Pollution Reduction Plan, which directs the MDE to propose a zero-emission heating equipment standard regulation and a clean heat standard regulation. The Act also enacts a state policy to move to broader electrification of both existing buildings and new construction, and requires the Public Service Commission ("PSC") to complete a study assessing the capacity of gas and electric distribution systems to successfully serve customers under a transition to a highly electrified building sector. The PSC released their report on December 29, 2023, and concluded that high levels of electrification can be handled by Maryland's electric systems through 2031. On September 6, 2024, the Maryland Department of the Environment issued updated proposed Building Energy Performance Standards (BEPS), which would require net zero direct greenhouse gas emissions from large buildings by 2040 with interim targets, or payments of an alternative compliance fee. Columbia of Maryland is advocating for compliance pathways that use RNG, hydrogen, and emissions offsets. Separately, the PSC has also initiated a proceeding related to Near-Term, Priority Actions and Comprehensive, Long-Term Planning for Maryland's Gas Companies. Columbia of Maryland will continue to monitor these matters, but we cannot predict their final impact on our business at this time. 
 
 NIPSCO Gas, Columbia of Maryland, Columbia of Pennsylvania, Columbia of Virginia and Columbia of Kentucky have each filed petitions to implement the Green Path Rider, which is a voluntary rider allowing customers to opt in and offset either 50 or 100 of their natural gas related emissions. To reduce the emissions, the utilities will purchase RNG attributes and carbon offsets to match the usage for customers opting into the program. After reaching settlement with other parties in September 2022, NIPSCO agreed to add a third tier to offset 25 of customer usage. The program was approved by the IURC at NIPSCO in November 2022 with a January 2023 start date. Columbia of Virginia received a final order in May 2023, approving the Green Path Rider and began enrolling customers in September 2023. The petitions filed by Columbia of Maryland, Columbia of Pennsylvania, and Columbia of Kentucky were rejected by the state commissions in 2023. Additionally, NIPSCO Electric has a voluntary Green Power Rider program in place that allows customers to designate a portion or all their monthly electric usage to come from power generated by renewable energy sources. 
 
 Net Zero Goal. In November 2022, we announced a goal of net zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2040 covering both Scope 1 and Scope 2 GHG emissions ("Net Zero Goal"). Our Net Zero Goal builds on greenhouse gas emission reductions achieved to-date. We plan to achieve our Net Zero Goal primarily through continuation and enhancement of existing programs, such as retiring and replacing coal-fired electric generation with low- or zero-emission electric generation, ongoing pipe replacement and modernization programs, and deployment of advanced leak-detection technologies. In addition, we plan to advance other low- and zero-emission energy resources and technologies, which may include hydrogen, renewable natural gas, long-duration storage, and/or deployment of carbon capture and utilization technologies, if and when these become technologically and economically feasible. Carbon offsets and renewable energy credits may also be used to support achievement of our Net Zero Goal. As of the end of 2023, we had reduced Scope 1 GHG emissions by approximately 72 from 2005 levels. 
 Our greenhouse gas emissions projections, including achieving a Net Zero Goal, are subject to various assumptions that involve risks and uncertainties, and did not include any assumptions related to data center development and associated load growth. We remain committed to our Net Zero Goal, however, certain of our interim goals may evolve as we assess and respond to business opportunities such as data centers. Achievement of our Net Zero Goal by 2040 will require supportive regulatory and legislative policies, favorable stakeholder environments, advancement of technologies that are not currently economical to deploy, and execution of our business plan, otherwise our actual results or ability to achieve our Net Zero Goal, including by 2040, may differ materially.

 Market Risk Disclosures 
 Risk is an inherent part of our businesses. The extent to which we properly and effectively identify, assess, monitor and manage each of the various types of risk involved in our businesses is critical to our profitability. We seek to identify, assess, monitor and manage, in accordance with defined policies and procedures, the following principal market risks that are involved in our businesses: commodity price risk, interest rate risk and credit risk. We manage risk through a multi-faceted process with oversight by the Risk Management Committee that requires constant communication, judgment and knowledge of specialized products and markets. Our senior management takes an active role in the risk management process and has developed policies and procedures that require specific administrative and business functions to assist in the identification, assessment and control of various risks. These may include, but are not limited to market, operational, financial, compliance and strategic risk types. In recognition of the increasingly varied and complex nature of the energy business, our risk management process, policies and procedures continue to evolve and are subject to ongoing review and modification. 
 Commodity Price Risk 
 Our gas and electric subsidiaries have commodity price risk primarily related to the purchases of natural gas and power. To manage this market risk, our subsidiaries use derivatives, including commodity futures contracts, swaps, forwards and options. We do not participate in speculative energy trading activity. 
 Commodity price risk resulting from derivative activities at our rate-regulated subsidiaries is limited and does not bear signification exposure to earnings risk, since our current regulatory mechanisms allow recovery of prudently incurred purchased power, fuel and gas costs through the rate-making process, including gains or losses on these derivative instruments. These changes are included in the GCA and FAC regulatory rate-recovery mechanisms. If these mechanisms were to be adjusted or eliminated, these subsidiaries may begin providing services without the benefit of the traditional rate-making process and may be more exposed to commodity price risk. For additional information, see "Results and Discussion of Segment Operations" in this Management's Discussion. 
 Our subsidiaries are required to make cash margin deposits with their brokers to cover actual and potential losses in the value of outstanding exchange traded derivative contracts. The amount of these deposits, some of which are reflected in our restricted cash balance, may fluctuate significantly during periods of high volatility in the energy commodity markets. 
 Refer to Note 11, "Risk Management Activities," in the Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (unaudited) for further information on our commodity price risk assets and liabilities as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. 
 Interest Rate Risk 
 We are exposed to interest rate risk as a result of changes in interest rates on borrowings under our revolving credit agreement, commercial paper program, and accounts receivable programs, which have interest rates that are indexed to short-term market interest rates. Based upon average borrowings and debt obligations subject to fluctuations in short-term market interest rates, an increase (or decrease) in short-term interest rates of 100 basis points (1 would have increased (or decreased) interest expense by 1.7 million and 6.9 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 4.8 million and 12.4 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively. We are also exposed to interest rate risk as a result of changes in benchmark rates that can influence the interest rates of future long-term debt issuances. From time to time we may enter into forward interest rate instruments to lock in long term interest costs and/ or rates. 
 Credit Risk 
 Due to the nature of the industry, credit risk is embedded in many of our business activities. Our extension of credit is governed by a Corporate Credit Risk Management Policy which establishes guidelines for documenting management approval levels for credit limits, evaluating creditworthiness, and credit risk mitigation efforts. Exposures to credit risks are monitored by the risk management function, which is independent of commercial operations. Credit risk arises due to the possibility that a customer, supplier or counterparty will not be able or willing to fulfill its obligations on a transaction on or before the settlement date. For derivative-related contracts, credit risk arises when counterparties are obligated to deliver or purchase defined commodity units of gas or power to us at a future date per execution of contractual terms and conditions. Exposure to credit risk is measured in terms of both current obligations and the market value of forward positions net of any posted collateral such as cash and letters of credit. 
 We evaluate the financial status of our banking partners through the use of market-based metrics such as credit default swap pricing levels, and also through traditional credit ratings provided by major credit rating agencies.

 ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS 
 Please refer to the risk factors set forth in Part I, Item 1A of the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. There have been no material changes to such risk factors other than as set forth below. 
 
 We may not be able to execute our business plan or growth strategy, including utility infrastructure investments, or business opportunities, such as data center development and related generation sources and transmission capabilities to meet potential load growth. 
 
 Operational, financial or regulatory conditions may result in our inability to execute our business plan or growth strategy, including investments related to natural gas pipeline modernization and our renewable energy projects, and the build-transfer execution goals within our business plan. Additionally, operational, financial or regulatory conditions may result in our inability to manage the development and implementation connected to the complex business opportunity associated with growing interest in data centers from customers and potential customers. 
 
 Our enterprise-wide transformation roadmap initiatives are designed to identify long-term sustainable capability enhancements, cost optimization improvements, technology investments and work process optimization, has increased the volume and pace of change and may not be effective as it continues. Our customer and regulatory initiatives may not achieve planned results. Utility infrastructure investments may not materialize, may cease to be achievable or economically viable and may not be successfully completed. Furthermore, we are evaluating the potential for data center development in our service territory, including ways to effectively manage the potential power demand, generation sources, and transmission capabilities to meet potential load growth from any data center customer, while at the same time focusing on our environmental goals. We expect that management of load growth would require new generation and transmission capabilities. Natural gas may cease to be viewed as an economically and environmentally attractive fuel. Certain environmental activist groups, investors and governmental entities continue to oppose natural gas delivery and infrastructure investments because of perceived environmental impacts associated with the natural gas supply chain and end use. Energy conservation, energy efficiency, distributed generation, energy storage, policies favoring electric heat over gas heat and other factors may reduce demand for natural gas and electricity. In addition, we consider acquisitions or dispositions of assets or businesses, JVs, and mergers from time to time as we execute on our business plan and growth strategy. As data center opportunities evolve and develop, we may also enter into arrangements and agreements with customers and potential customers that require us to invest capital related to the data center development and related generation sources and transmission capabilities before we receive any potential return. Any of these circumstances could adversely affect our business, results of operations and growth prospects. Even if our business plan, growth strategy, and/or business opportunities are executed, there is still risk of, among other things, human error in maintenance, installation or operations, shortages or delays in obtaining equipment, including as a result of transportation delays and availability, labor availability and performance below expected levels (in addition to the other risks discussed in this section). We are currently experiencing, and expect to continue to experience, supply chain challenges, including labor availability issues, impacting our ability to obtain materials for our gas and electric projects, as well as our ability to ensure timely completion.

ARTICLE I BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE 
 I.1 Background . Effective November 1, 2000, the Bay State Gas Company Key Employee Deferred Compensation Plan (the Bay State Plan was merged into the NIPSCO Plan and the NIPSCO Plan was renamed the NiSource Inc. Executive Deferred Compensation Plan (the Plan ). Effective January 1, 2004, the Columbia Energy Group Deferred Compensation Plan (the Columbia Plan was merged into the Plan. Effective January 1, 2005, the Plan was amended and restated to comply with Code Section 409A, and guidance and regulations thereunder. Deferred Compensation, Discretionary Contributions, and earnings thereon, earned and vested prior to January 1, 2005 shall be administered without giving effect to Code Section 409A, and guidance and regulations thereunder. Effective January 1, 2008, the Plan was amended and restated to incorporate the provisions of amendments to the Plan since the January 1, 2005, amendment and restatement and to allow participants to elect to participate in the Plan only during the applicable enrollment period or at such later date allowed under Code Section 409A for certain performance based bonuses. The Plan was amended and restated again effective as of May 13, 2011 to transfer all administrative authority with respect to the Plan (including the authority to render decisions on claims and appeals and make administrative or ministerial amendments) from the CHC Committee to the Benefits Committee. The Plan was amended and restated again, effective as of January 1, 2012, to (1) change eligibility to defer Compensation under the Plan (2) limit the amount of annual incentive compensation that may be deferred under the Plan to 80 of such annual incentive compensation and (3) clarify other administrative matters related to the Plan. The Plan was amended and restated again, effective November 1, 2012, to eliminate the prime rate of interest, as stated by the Wall Street Journal, as an investment option available only to certain Columbia Plan Participants and instead be available, if so chosen by the Benefits Committee, to all Participants. 
 The Plan is hereby amended and restated again, effective August 12, 2024, to (1) clarify administration of payment timing in relation to the applicable March 15 th valuation date for payment events under the Plan and (2) eliminate the ability of participants to make subsequent deferral elections with respect to in-service distributions on and after the effective date of this restatement. 
 I.2 Purpose . The purpose of this Plan is to provide current tax planning opportunities as well as supplemental funds for retirement or death for selected employees of an Employer. It is intended that the Plan will aid in attracting and retaining employees of exceptional ability by providing them with these benefits.

Further, an election to defer such annual incentive award must be made no later than December 31, of the prior Plan Year. To illustrate these provisions, an election to defer salary payable for services performed in 2013 must be made by December 31, 2012.

 (a) Base Salary Deferral Amount . The amount of Compensation related to base salary that a Participant may elect to defer in an Election Form shall be stated as a whole percentage of base Compensation from 5 to 80 provided, however, that the Company may reduce the amount deferred to the extent necessary to satisfy federal, state, local, or other tax withholding obligations and employee benefit plan withholding requirements. 
 (b) Annual Incentive Deferral Amount . The amount of Compensation related to any annual incentive award that a Participant may elect to defer in an Election Form shall be stated as a whole percentage of the annual incentive award from 5 to 80 provided, however, that the Company may reduce the amount deferred to the extent necessary to satisfy federal, state, local, or other tax withholding obligations and employee benefit plan withholding requirements. 
 No amount of Compensation may be deferred after the date of a Participant s Separation from Service. 
 IV.3 Distribution Options . Each Election Form with respect to a Plan Year shall specify the date on which the applicable deferred amount and earnings thereon shall be distributed. Such date shall be the first to occur of (1) the date of the Participant s Separation from Service or (2) a date selected by the Participant, provided that a selected date must be at least one year after the date the deferred amount would have been paid to the Participant in cash in the absence of the election to make the deferral, except as otherwise provided under Article VII. 
 7 

IV.4 Duration of Election Form . A Participant shall make an election in his Election Form as to the time and form of payment of the Annual Deferral Amount for each Plan Year. A Participant s Election Form for any Plan Year is effective only for such Plan Year. In order to defer Compensation for a subsequent Plan Year, an Eligible Employee must file a new Election Form with respect to such Compensation. A Participant shall not be required to designate the same time and form of payment for each Plan Year. 
 IV.5 Modification of Election Form . Except as provided otherwise in this Plan, Election Forms shall be irrevocable. 
 IV.6 Change in Employment Status . If the Plan Administrator determines that a Participant has experienced a change in job scope level or employment status that no longer is eligible for participation in the Plan, but the Participant s employment with an Employer is not terminated, the Participant s existing Election Form shall terminate at the end of the current Plan Year, and no new Election Form may be submitted by such Participant for any Plan Year. 
 
 ARTICLE V ACCOUNTS 
 
 V.1 Account . The Compensation deferred by a Participant under the Plan, including any Discretionary Contributions and earnings thereon, shall be credited to the Participant s Account.

 V.2 Timing of Credits Withholding . A Participant s deferred Compensation shall be credited to the Participant s Account at the time it would have been payable to the Participant. Any withholding of taxes or other amounts with respect to deferred Compensation that is required by federal, state or local law shall be withheld from the Participant s nondeferred Compensation to the maximum extent possible and any remaining amount shall reduce the amount credited to the Participant s Account. 
 V.3 Discretionary Contributions . An Employer may make Discretionary Contributions to a Participant s Account. Discretionary Contributions shall be credited at such times and in such amounts as the CHC Committee in its sole discretion shall determine.

 ARTICLE VI INVESTMENTS 
 
 VI.1 Investment Options . Amounts credited hereunder to the Account of a Participant shall be invested as such Participant elects among the investment choices provided to the Participant. The investment options shall be determined by the Plan Administrator from time to time in its sole and absolute discretion. As necessary, the Plan Administrator may, in its sole discretion, discontinue, substitute or add an investment option. Each such action will take effect on such date established by the Plan Administrator. 
 VI.2 Special Investment Option for Former Participants in the Bay State Plan and Participants in the Plan . Former participants in the Bay State Plan who became Participants in the Plan, or Participants in the Plan on November 1, 2000, shall have an additional special investment option applicable solely to their Transferred Bay State Account balances, or their 
 9 

Account balances in the Plan, valued as of November 1, 2000, and any subsequent amounts contributed to such Participant s Account. Such Participants may invest their Transferred Bay State Account balances, or their Account balances in the Plan as of November 1, 2000, and any subsequent amounts contributed to such Participant s Account, in a subaccount which shall be credited with earnings equal to one percentage point higher than the effective annual yield of the average of the Moody s Average Corporate Bond Yield Index for the previous calendar month as published by Moody s Investor Services, Inc. (or any successor publisher thereto), or, if such index is no longer published, a substantially similar index selected by the Plan Administrator. A Participant s Transferred Bay State Account balance, or his Account balance in the Plan on November 1, 2000, shall be invested pursuant to this special investment option from and after November 1, 2000, and until such time as another investment choice is designated by him under this Plan with respect to all or a portion of his Transferred Bay State Account, or his Account balance in the Plan on November 1, 2000. Subsequent amounts contributed to any such Participant s Account may be invested pursuant to this option as designated by the Participant pursuant to this Plan. However, any portion of a Transferred Bay State Account, or an Account balance in the Plan, subsequently transferred from the investment option described in this Section to another investment option may not be reinvested under this Section. 
 VI.3 Election of Investment Options . A Participant, in connection with completing his or her Election Form, shall elect one or more of the previously described investment options, as applicable, to be used to determine the amounts to be credited or debited to his or her Account. No Election Form of a Participant shall be effective until such time as the Participant submits his initial investment election to the Company. The Participant may (but is not required to) elect to add or delete one or more investment options to be used to determine the amounts to be credited or debited to his or her Account, or to change the portion of his or her Account allocated to each previously or newly elected investment option. If an election is made in accordance with the previous sentence, it shall apply as of the first business day deemed reasonably practicable by the Plan Administrator, in its sole discretion, and shall continue thereafter for each subsequent day in which the Participant participates in the Plan, unless changed in accordance with the previous sentence. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Plan Administrator, in its sole discretion, may impose limitations on the frequency with which one or more of the investment options elected in accordance with this Section may be added or deleted by such Participant furthermore, the Plan Administrator, in its sole discretion, may impose limitations on the frequency with which the Participant may change the portion of his or her Account allocated to each previously or newly elected investment option. 
 VI.4 Allocation of Investment Options . In making any election related to investment options, the Participant shall specify, in increments specified by the Plan Administrator, the percentage of his or her Account or investment option, as applicable, to be allocated or reallocated. 
 VI.5 No Actual Investment . Notwithstanding any other provision of this Plan that may be interpreted to the contrary, the investment options are to be used for measurement purposes only, and a Participant's election of any such investment option, the allocation of his or her Account thereto, the calculation of additional amounts and the crediting or debiting of such 
 10 

amounts to a Participant's Account shall not be considered or construed in any manner as an actual investment of his or her Account in any such investment option. In the event that the Company, in its own discretion, decides to invest funds in any or all of the investments on which the investment options are based, no Participant shall have any rights in or to such investments themselves. Without limiting the foregoing, a Participant's Account shall at all times be a bookkeeping entry only and shall not represent any investment made on his or her behalf by the Company the Participant shall at all times remain an unsecured creditor of the Company. 
 ARTICLE VII PAYMENTS AND DISTRIBUTIONS 
 
 VII.1 Distributions Events Generally . Participants generally will not be entitled to receive a distribution of their Account balance until they experience a Separation from Service for any reason. A Participant may receive a distribution before Separation from Service, however, in accordance with this Article VII, upon (1) an Unforeseeable Emergency that occurs before Separation from Service, or (2) a year that has been designated by the Participant in an Election Form and that occurs before Separation from Service. 
 VII.2 In-Service Distributions . 
 (a) General Payments . A Participant may elect in his or her Election Form to receive his or her Compensation deferred for a Plan Year, and all amounts credited or debited thereto, in a specified year while employed with an Employer. The Participant, in an Election Form, may elect to receive such an in-service distribution as either a lump sum or annual installments over a period of not more than 15 years. If a Participant does not make such an election, the payment shall be made in a lump sum. 
 If a Participant elects to receive an in-service distribution as a lump sum, the amount of the lump sum payment will be based on the value of the Participant s account as of March 15 of the designated year. The distribution date generally shall be on or as soon as administratively practicable after March 15 of such year, or, if later, within such time frame permitted under Code Section 409A and the guidance and regulations thereunder. 
 
 If a Participant elects to receive installments, the amount of the first installment payment will be based on the value of the participant s Account as of the March 15 of the designated year. The distribution date of the first installment generally shall be on or as soon as administratively practicable after this March 15 of such year, and the distribution date of each subsequent installment generally shall be the anniversary date of the preceding installment provided that payments may be made within such time frame permitted under Code Section 409A, and the guidance and regulations thereunder. The amount of the subsequent installments will be based on the value of the Participant s account on the March 15 on or 
 11 

immediately preceding the distribution of each installment payment. The specific amount of each installment payment will be calculated under the Installment Method. 
 
 (b) Modifying In-Service Distributions . Effective August 12, 2024, Participants are not permitted to modify in-service distributions with respect to either their Pre-2005 or Post-2004 account balances.. Any modified in-service distribution elections that were effective before August 12, 2024, pursuant to the terms of the Plan that were in effect before the Effective Date of this restatement, however, will continue to be governed by the terms of those applicable modified election forms. No further modifications to those forms will be accepted. 
 VII.3 Distributions After Separation from Service . 
 (a) Generally . If a Participant experiences a Separation from Service, the provisions of this Section 7.3 shall apply to the distribution of the Participant s Account. The Participant may elect, in his or her Election Form to receive such benefits as either a lump sum or in annual installments over a period not to exceed 15 years. If no such election is made, payment shall be made as a lump sum. 
 (b) Pre-2005 Account . 
 (1) Lump Sum . If payment of a Participant's Pre-2005 Account is to be made in a lump sum, the amount of the lump sum will be based on the value of the Participant s account as of the March 15 th immediately after the date in which the Participant experiences a Separation from Service. The distribution date for this lump sum generally shall be on or as soon as administratively practicable after such March 15 th date. 
 (2) Installments . If payment of a Participant's Pre-2005 Account is to be made in annual installments, the amount of the first installment will be based on the value of the Participant s account as of the March 15 th immediately after the date in which the Participant experiences a Separation from Service. The distribution date of the first annual installment payment generally shall be made on or as soon as administratively practicable after such March 15 th date. Each subsequent installment payment generally shall be paid on or as soon as administratively practicable after the anniversary of the previous payment date. The amount of each such installment shall be based on the value of the Participant's Account as of the March 15 on or immediately preceding the distribution date of such installment. The specific amount of each installment payment will be calculated under the Installment Method. 
 (3) Modifications to Time and Form of Payment . Notwithstanding any other provision of the Plan, a Participant may modify his election as to the form or time of distribution of his entire Pre-2005 Account, and earnings 
 12 

thereon, by a writing filed with the Retirement Committee at any time prior to the commencement of payment. A Participant s modification of his election as to the form or time of commencement of payment shall be ineffective, unless (1) the modification election is filed with the Retirement Committee more than 12 months prior to the time of commencement of payment, or (2) a Participant elects by written instrument delivered to the Company prior to the time of commencement of payment to have his Pre-2005 Account reduced by 10 . To clarify how these provisions operate with respect to a Participant who originally elected to commence distribution upon Separation from Service, such a Participant may elect to be paid on or as soon as administratively practicable after one of the following permitted times (a) the March 15 th immediately after the one-year anniversary date of the request to modify the election (regardless of whether the Participant experiences a Separation from Service before such date), or (b) the March 15 th immediately after the date of the modified election, provided however, that under this option the Participant's Pre-2005 Account shall be reduced by 10 . This reduction shall be forfeited and used by the Plan to reduce expenses of administration. This reduction is intended to discourage a Participant from modifying his election as to the form or time of commencement of payment within the period set forth in clause (1) above and prevent him from being deemed in constructive receipt of his Pre-2005 Account prior to its actual payment to him. 
 (c) Post-2004 Account . 
 (1) Lump Sum . 
 (i) Non-Specified Employees . If payment of a Participant s Post-2004 Account is to be made to the Participant in a lump sum, and the Participant is not a Specified Employee of any Employer, the amount of the lump sum will be based on the value of the Participant s account as of the March 15 th immediately after the date in which the Participant experiences a Separation from Service. The distribution date for this lump sum generally shall be on or as soon as administratively practicable after such March 15 th date, or such other time frame permitted under Code Section 409A. 
 
 (ii) Specified Employees . If payment of a Participant s Post-2004 Account is to be made to the Participant in a lump sum, and the Participant is a Specified Employee of any Employer, the lump sum payment generally shall be made on or as soon as administratively practicable after the later of (1) the March 15 th immediately after the date in which the Participant experiences a 
 13 

Separation from Service, or (2) the date that is six (6) months after the date in which the Participant experiences a Separation from Service, unless due to such Participant s death, in which case payment generally shall be made to the Beneficiary as soon as practicable after the date of the Participant s death. 
 
 (2) Installments . 
 (i) Non-Specified Employees . If payment of a Participant s Post-2004 Account is to be made to the Participant in annual installments, and the Participant is not a Specified Employee of any Employer, the amount of the first installment will be based on the value of the Participant s account as of the March 15 th immediately after the date in which the Participant experiences a Separation from Service. The distribution date of the first annual installment payment generally shall be made on or as soon as administratively practicable after such March 15 th date. Each subsequent installment payment generally shall be paid on or as soon as administratively practicable after the anniversary of the previous payment date provided that payments may be made within such time frame permitted under Code Section 409A. The amount of each such installment shall be based on the value of the Participant's Account as of the March 15 on or immediately preceding the distribution date of such installment. The specific amount of each installment payment will be calculated under the Installment Method. 
 
 (ii) Specified Employees . If payment of a Participant s Post-2004 Account is to be made to the Participant in annual installments, and the Participant is a Specified Employee of any Employer, the distribution of the first annual installment payment generally shall be made on or as soon as administratively practicable after the later of (1) the March 15 th immediately after the date in which the Participant experiences a Separation from Service, or (2) the date that is six (6) months after the date in which the Participant experiences a Separation from Service, unless due to such Participant s death, in which case such installment payment generally shall be made to the Beneficiary as soon as practicable after the date of the Participant s death. The amount of this first installment payment shall be based on the value of the Participant s Account as of the March 15 on or immediately preceding the distribution date of this installment payment. Each subsequent installment payment generally shall be paid on or as soon as administratively practicable after each subsequent March 15. The 
 14 

amount of each such installment shall be based on the value of the Participant s account as of the March 15 on or immediately preceding the distribution date of such installment. 
 
 (3) Modifications to Time and Form of Payment . The Company, in its discretion, may allow a Participant to modify his election as to the form or time of distribution of his entire Post-2004 Account, and earnings thereon, or of any portion of his or her Post-2004 Account and earnings thereon, if (1) such election does not take effect until at least 12 months after the date on which the election is made, (2) the first payment with respect to which such election is made is deferred for a period of not less than five (5) years from the date on which such payment would otherwise have been made, and (3) any election related to a payment to be made at a specified date is made at least 12 months prior to the date of the first scheduled payment. For purposes of the Plan, the term payment means each separate installment and not the collective group of installment payments. 
 
 VII.4 Unforeseeable Emergency Hardship Distributions . 
 (a) Pre-2005 Account . Upon a finding that a Participant has suffered an Unforeseeable Emergency, the Retirement Committee may, in its sole discretion, make distributions from the Participant s Pre-2005 Account (including his Transferred Bay State Account or Transferred Columbia Account, if applicable). The amount of such a distribution shall be limited to the amount reasonably necessary to meet the Participant s needs resulting from the Unforeseeable Emergency. Any distribution pursuant to this Subsection shall be payable in a lump sum. The distribution shall be paid within 30 days after the determination of an Unforeseeable Emergency. 
 (b) Post-2004 Account . Upon a finding that a Participant has suffered an Unforeseeable Emergency, the Retirement Committee may, in its sole discretion, make distributions from the Participant s Post-2004 Account and or allow a Participant to suspend his Annual Deferral Amount entirely in accordance with the guidance under Code Section 409A. The amount of such distribution shall be limited to the amount necessary to satisfy such Unforeseeable Emergency plus amounts necessary to pay taxes reasonably anticipated as a result of the distribution, after taking into account the extent to which such hardship is or may be relieved through reimbursement or compensation by insurance or otherwise or by liquidation of the Participant s assets (to the extent the liquidation of such assets would not itself cause severe financial hardship). Any distribution pursuant to this Section 7.4(b) shall be payable in a lump sum. The 
 15 

distribution shall be paid within 30 days after the determination of an Unforeseeable Emergency. 
 VII.5 Distribution Provisions Applicable to a Transferred Bay State Account . Notwithstanding any other provision in the Plan, the following provisions shall apply to the form and time of payment of the balance of a Transferred Bay State Account 
 
 (a) General Payment Rules . The portion of a Transferred Bay State Account not paid pursuant to Section 7.2 shall be paid to a Participant following his separation from service, or to his Beneficiary in the case of death, in the form selected by the Participant, by written instrument delivered to the Retirement Committee before November 1, 2000. If no form is selected by the Participant, payment shall be made in a lump sum. The provisions of Section 7.2(b) shall apply with respect to the election of the form of payment of a Transferred Bay State Account and the modification of such election. 
 (b) Modifications to General Payment Rules . Any former employee of Bay State Gas Company who (1) was a participant in the Bay State Plan immediately prior to November 1, 2000, (2) terminated employment with Bay State Gas Company prior to November 1, 2000, for any reason other than Retirement, death or Disability (as such terms were defined in the Bay State Plan immediately prior to November 1, 2000), and (3) as of November 1, 2000, had not commenced payment of his Account shall not commence payment of his Transferred Bay State Account until the earlier of the Participant s attainment of age 65, Disability or death.

 VII.6 Automatic Cash-Out . In the event a Participant s Account balance at the time distribution begins, or following a distribution of an installment payment is 15,000 or less, that balance shall be paid to the Participant or his Beneficiary in a lump sum on the next annual installment distribution date notwithstanding any form of benefit payment elected by the Participant. 
 VII.7 Withholding for Taxes . To the extent required by the law in effect at the time payments are made, an Employer shall withhold from the payments made hereunder any taxes required to be withheld by the federal or any state or local government, including any amounts which the Employer determines is reasonably necessary to pay any generation-skipping transfer tax which is or may become due. A Beneficiary, however, may elect not to have withholding of federal income tax pursuant to Code Section 3405(a)(2). 
 VII.8 Payment to Guardian . The Retirement Committee may direct payment to the duly appointed guardian, conservator or other similar legal representative of a Participant or Beneficiary to whom payment is due. In the absence of such a legal representative, the 
 16 

Retirement Committee may, in its sole and absolute discretion, make payment to a person having the care and custody of a minor, incompetent or person incapable of handling the disposition of property upon proof satisfactory to the Retirement Committee of incompetency, status as a minor, or incapacity. Such distribution shall completely discharge the Company from all liability with respect to such benefit. 
 
 ARTICLE VIII BENEFICIARY DESIGNATION 
 
 VIII.1 Beneficiary Designation . Subject to Section 8.3, each Participant shall have the right, at any time, to designate one or more persons or an entity as Beneficiary (both primary as well as secondary) to whom benefits under the Plan shall be paid in the event of the Participant s death prior to complete distribution of the Participant s Account. Each Beneficiary designation shall be in a written form prescribed by the Plan Administrator (or record keeper, if the Plan Administrator engages a record keeper to provide this form) and shall be effective only when filed with the Plan Administrator or record keeper, as applicable during the Participant s lifetime. 
 VIII.2 Changing Beneficiary . Subject to Section 8.3, any Beneficiary designation may be changed by a Participant without the consent of the previously named Beneficiary by the filing of a new designation with the Retirement Committee. The filing of a new designation shall cancel all designations previously filed. 
 VIII.3 Community Property . If the Participant resides in a community property state, the following rules shall apply 
 (a) Designation by a married Participant of a Beneficiary other than the Participant s spouse shall not be effective unless the spouse executes a written consent that acknowledges the effect of the designation, or it is established that the consent cannot be obtained because the spouse cannot be located. 
 (b) A married Participant s Beneficiary designation may be changed by a Participant with the consent of the Participant s spouse as provided for in Section 8.3(a) by the filing of a new designation with the Retirement Committee. 
 (c) If the Participant s marital status changes after the Participant has designated a Beneficiary, the following shall apply

 (2) If the Participant is unmarried at the time of death but was married when the designation was made 
 17 

(i) The designation shall be void if the spouse was named as Beneficiary, unless the designation is reaffirmed when the Participant is unmarried. 
 (ii) The designation shall remain valid if a nonspouse Beneficiary was named. 
 (3) If the Participant was married when the designation was made and is married to a different spouse at death, the designation shall be void unless the new spouse has consented to it in the manner prescribed above. 
 VIII.4 No Beneficiary Designation . If any Participant fails to designate a Beneficiary in the manner provided above, if the designation is void or if the Beneficiary designated by a deceased Participant dies before the Participant or before complete distribution of the Participant s benefits, the Participant s Beneficiary shall be the person in the first of the following classes in which there is a survivor 
 (a) The Participant s spouse 
 (b) The Participant s children in equal shares, except that if any of the children predeceases the Participant but leaves issue surviving, then such issue shall take, by right of representation and per stirpes, the share such deceased child would have taken if living

 ARTICLE IX PLAN ADMINISTRATION 
 
 IX.1 Allocation of Duties to Committees . The Plan shall be administered by the Benefits Committee, as delegated by the CHC Committee. The Benefits Committee shall have the authority to make, amend, interpret, and enforce all appropriate rules and regulations for the administration of the Plan and decide or resolve any and all questions, including interpretations of the Plan, as may arise in such administration, except as otherwise reserved to the CHC Committee herein, or by resolution or charter of the respective committees. Members of the Retirement Committee or Benefits Committee may be Participants under the Plan. 
 In its discretion, the Plan Administrator may delegate to any division or department of the Company the discretionary authority to make decisions regarding Plan administration, within limits and guidelines from time to time established by the Plan Administrator. The delegated discretionary authority shall be exercised by such division or department s senior officer, or his her delegate. Within the scope of the delegated discretionary authority, such officer or person shall act in the place of the Plan Administrator and his her decisions shall be treated as decisions of the Plan Administrator. 
 18 

Specifically, the Plan Administrator hereby delegates certain of its discretionary authority with respect to the Plan to the Retirement Committee. Pursuant to the foregoing sentence, the delegation by the Plan Administrator to the Retirement Committee includes, but shall not be limited to, the ability to solicit and receive deferral elections, establish enrollment periods, distribute account statements, receive distribution elections and any permitted modifications thereto, make distributions, and determine claims under the Plan. 
 IX.2 Agents . The Retirement Committee, Benefits Committee or CHC Committee may, from time to time, employ agents and delegate to them such administrative duties as it sees fit, and may from time to time consult with counsel who may be counsel to the Company. 
 IX.3 Information Required by Plan Administrator . The Company shall furnish the Plan Administrator with such data and information as the Plan Administrator may deem necessary or desirable in order to administer the Plan. The records of the Company as to an employee s or Participant s period or periods of employment, Separation from Service and the reason therefore, reemployment and Compensation will be conclusive on all persons unless determined to the Plan Administrator s satisfaction to be incorrect. Participants and other persons entitled to benefits under the Plan also shall furnish the Plan Administrator with such evidence, data or information as the Plan Administrator considers necessary or desirable to administer the Plan. 
 IX.4 Binding Effect of Decisions . The decision or action of the Retirement Committee, Benefits Committee and or the CHC Committee (or any duly authorized delegate of any such committee) with respect to any question arising out of or in connection with the administration, interpretation and application of the Plan and the rules and regulations promulgated hereunder shall be final, conclusive and binding upon all persons having any interest in the Plan. 
 IX.5 Section 16 Compliance . 
 (a) In General . This Plan is intended to be a formula plan for purposes of Section 16 of the Securities Exchange Act (the Act ). Accordingly, in the case of a deferral or other action under the Plan that constitutes a transaction that could be covered by Rule 16b-3(d) or (e), if it were approved by the CHC Committee Board Approval ), it is intended that the Plan shall be administered by delegates of the Board, in the case of a Participant who is subject to Section 16 of the Act, in a manner that will permit the Board Approval of the Plan to avoid any additional Board Approval of specific transactions to the maximum possible extent. 
 (b) Approval of Distributions This Subsection shall govern the distribution of a deferral that (i) is being distributed to a Participant in cash, (ii) is made to a Participant who is subject to Section 16 of the Act at the time the interest in phantom Company Common Stock, if any, would be liquidated in connection with the distribution, and (iii) if paid at the time the distribution would be made without regard to this subsection, could result in a violation of Section 16 of the Act because there is an opposite way transaction that would be matched with the 
 19 

liquidation of the Participant s interest in phantom Company Common Stock (either as a discretionary transaction, within the meaning of Rule 16b-3(b)(1), or as a regular transaction, as applicable) Covered Distribution ). In the case of a Covered Distribution, if the liquidation of the Participant s interest in the phantom Company Common Stock in connection with the distribution has not received Board Approval by the time the distribution would be made if it were not a Covered Distribution, or if it is a discretionary transaction, then the actual distribution to the Participant shall be delayed only until the earlier of 
 (1) In the case of a transaction that is not a discretionary transaction, Board Approval of the liquidation of the Participant s interest in the phantom Company Common Stock in connection with the distribution, or 
 (2) The date the distribution would no longer violate Section 16 of the Act, e.g., when the Participant is no longer subject to Section 16 of the Act, or when the time between the liquidation and an opposite way transaction is sufficient. 
 
 ARTICLE X CLAIMS PROCEDURE 
 X.1 Claim . Claims for benefits under the Plan shall be made in writing to the Retirement Committee. The Retirement Committee shall establish rules and procedures to be followed by Participants and Beneficiaries in filing claims for benefits, and for furnishing and verifying proof necessary to establish the right to benefits in accordance with the Plan, consistent with the remainder of this Article. 
 X.2 Review of Claim . The Retirement Committee shall review all claims for benefits. Upon receipt by the Retirement Committee of such a claim, it shall determine all facts that are necessary to establish the right of the claimant to benefits under the provisions of the Plan and the amount thereof as herein provided within 90 days of receipt of such claim. If prior to the expiration of the initial 90 day period, the Retirement Committee determines additional time is needed to come to a determination on the claim, the Retirement Committee shall provide written notice to the Participant, Beneficiary or other claimant of the need for the extension, not to exceed a total of 180 days from the date the application was received. If the Retirement Committee fails to notify the claimant in writing of the denial of the claim within 90 days after the Retirement Committee receives it, the claim shall be deemed denied. 
 X.3 Notice of Denial of Claim . If the Retirement Committee wholly or partially denies a claim for benefits, the Retirement Committee shall, within a reasonable period of time, but no later than 90 days after receiving the claim (unless extended as provided above), notify the claimant in writing of the denial of the claim. Such notification shall be written in a manner reasonably expected to be understood by such claimant and shall in all respects comply with the requirements of ERISA, including but not limited to inclusion of the following 
 20 

(a) the specific reason or reasons for denial of the claim 
 (b) a specific reference to the pertinent sections of the Plan on which the denial is based 
 (c) a description of any additional material or information necessary for the claimant to perfect the claim and an explanation of why such material or information is necessary and, where appropriate, 
 (d) an explanation of the Plan's review procedures. 
 X.4 Reconsideration of Denied Claim . Within 60 days after receipt of the notice of the denial of a claim or within 60 days after the claim is deemed denied as set forth above, if applicable, such claimant or duly authorized representative may request, by mailing or delivery of such written notice to the Benefits Committee, a reconsideration by the Benefits Committee of the decision denying the claim. If the claimant or duly authorized representative fails to request such a reconsideration within such 60 day period, it shall be conclusively determined for all purposes of the Plan that the denial of such claim by the Benefits Committee is correct. In connection with the claimant s appeal of the denial of his or her benefit, the claimant may review pertinent documents and may submit issues and comments in writing. 
 After such reconsideration request, the Benefits Committee shall determine within 60 days of receipt of the claimant s request for reconsideration whether such denial of the claim was correct and shall notify such claimant in writing of its determination. In the event of special circumstances determined by the Benefits Committee, the time for the Benefits Committee to make a decision may be extended by an additional 60 days upon written notice to the claimant prior to the commencement of the extension. The notice of decision shall be in writing and shall include specific reasons for the decision, written in a manner calculated to be understood by the claimant, as well as specific references to the pertinent Plan provisions on which the decision is based. If the decision on review is not furnished within the time period set forth above, the claim shall be deemed denied on review. 
 If such determination is favorable to the claimant, it shall be binding and conclusive. If such determination is adverse to such claimant, it shall be binding and conclusive unless the claimant or his duly authorized representative notifies the Benefits Committee within 90 days after the mailing or delivery to the claimant by the Benefits Committee of its determination that claimant intends to institute legal proceedings challenging the determination of the Benefits Committee and actually institutes such legal proceedings within 180 days after such mailing or delivery. 
 X.5 Employer to Supply Information . To enable the Retirement Committee or the Benefits Committee to perform its functions, each Employer shall supply full and timely information to the respective committee of all matters relating to the retirement, death or other cause for Separation from Service of all Participants, and such other pertinent facts as the respective committee may require.

 (a) Partial Termination . The CHC Committee may partially terminate the Plan by instructing the Retirement Committee not to accept any additional Annual Deferral Amounts.

Employers shall pay out each Post-2004 Account in a manner consistent with Treasury Regulation Section 1.409A-3(j)(4)(ix) or any successor guidance under Code Section 409A. 
 
 ARTICLE XII MISCELLANEOUS 
 XII.1 Unfunded Plan . The Plan is an unfunded plan maintained primarily to provide deferred compensation benefits for a select group of management or highly-compensated employees within the meaning of Sections 201, 301 and 401 of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended ERISA ), and therefore is exempt from the provisions of Parts 2, 3 and 4 of Title I of ERISA. Nothing contained in the Plan shall constitute a guaranty by the Company or any other Employer or any other entity or person that the assets of the Company or any other Employer shall be sufficient to pay any benefit hereunder. 
 XII.2 Company and Employer Obligations . The obligation to make benefit payments to any Participant under the Plan shall be a joint and several liability of the Company and the Employer that employed the Participant. 
 XII.3 Unsecured General Creditor . Participants and Beneficiaries shall be unsecured general creditors, with no secured or preferential right to any assets of the Company, any other Employer, or any other party for payment of benefits under the Plan. Any life insurance policies, annuity contracts or other property purchased by the Employer in connection with the Plan shall remain its general, unpledged and unrestricted assets. Obligations of the Company and each other Employer under the Plan shall be an unfunded and unsecured promise to pay money in the future. 
 XII.4 Trust Fund . Subject to Section 12.3, the Company may establish separate subtrusts for deferrals by employees of each Employer, pursuant to a trust agreement entered into with such trustees as the Benefits Committee may approve, for the purpose of providing for the payment of benefits owed under the Plan. At its discretion, each Employer may contribute deferrals under the Plan for its employees to the subtrust established with respect to such Employer under such trust agreement. To the extent any benefits provided under the Plan are paid from any such subtrust, the Employer shall have no further obligation to pay them. If not paid from a subtrust, such benefits shall remain the obligation of the Employer. Although such 
 23 

subtrusts may be irrevocable, their assets shall be held for payment of all the Company s general creditors in the event of insolvency or bankruptcy. 
 XII.5 Nonalienation Nonassignability . Neither a Participant nor any other person shall have any right to commute, sell, assign, transfer, pledge, anticipate, mortgage, or otherwise encumber, transfer, hypothecate, or convey in advance of actual receipt the amounts, if any, payable hereunder, or any part thereof or rights to, which are expressly declared to be unassignable and nontransferable. No part of the amounts payable shall, prior to actual payment, be subject to seizure or sequestration for the payment of any debts, judgments, alimony, or separate maintenance owed by a Participant or any other person, nor be transferable by operation of law in the event of a Participant s or any other person s bankruptcy or insolvency. 
 Notwithstanding the preceding paragraph, the Account of any Participant shall be subject to and payable in the amount determined in accordance with any qualified domestic relations order, as that term is defined in Section 206(d)(3) of ERISA. The Retirement Committee shall provide for payment in a lump sum from a Participant s Account to an alternate payee (as defined in Code Section 414(p)(8)) as soon as administratively practicable following receipt of such order. Any federal, state or local income tax associated with such payment shall be the responsibility of the alternate payee. The balance of an Account that is subject to any qualified domestic relations order shall be reduced by the amount of any payment made pursuant to such order. 
 XII.6 Indemnification . 
 (a) Limitation of Liability . Notwithstanding any other provision of the Plan or any trust established under the Plan, none of the Company, any other Employer, any member of the Retirement Committee, the Benefits Committee or the CHC Committee, nor an individual acting as an employee or agent or delegate of any of them, shall be liable to any Participant, former Participant, Beneficiary, or any other person for any claim, loss, liability or expense incurred in connection with the Plan or any trust established under the Plan, except when the same shall have been judicially determined to be due to the willful misconduct of such person. 
 (b) Indemnity . The Company shall indemnify and hold harmless each member of the Retirement Committee, the Benefits Committee and the CHC Committee, or any employee of the Company or any individual acting as an employee or agent of either of them (to the extent not indemnified or saved harmless under any liability insurance or any other indemnification arrangement with respect to the Plan or any trust established under the Plan) from any and all claims, losses, liabilities, costs and expenses (including attorneys fees) arising out of any actual or alleged act or failure to act made in good faith pursuant to the provisions of the Plan, including expenses reasonably incurred in the defense of any claim relating thereto with respect to the administration of the Plan or any trust established under the Plan, except that no indemnification or defense shall be provided to any person with respect to any conduct that has been judicially determined, or agreed by the parties, to have constituted willful misconduct on the part of such person, 
 24 

or to have resulted in his or her receipt of personal profit or advantage to which he or she is not entitled. In connection with the indemnification provided by the preceding sentence, expenses incurred in defending a civil or criminal action, suit or proceeding, or incurred in connection with a civil or criminal investigation, may be paid by the Company in advance of the final disposition of such action, suit, proceeding, or investigation, as authorized by the Retirement Committee, the Benefits Committee or the CHC Committee in the specific case, upon receipt of an undertaking by or on behalf of the party to be indemnified to repay such amount unless it shall ultimately be determined that the person is entitled to be indemnified by the Company pursuant to this paragraph. 
 XII.7 No Enlargement of Employment Rights . The Plan shall not constitute a contract of employment between an Employer and the Participant. Nothing in the Plan shall give any Participant or Beneficiary the right to be retained in the service of an Employer or to interfere with the right of an Employer to discipline or discharge a Participant at any time. 
 XII.8 Protective Provisions . A Participant shall cooperate with his Employer by furnishing any and all information requested by the Employer in order to facilitate the payment of benefits hereunder, and by taking such physical examinations as the Employer may deem necessary and taking such other action as may be requested by the Employer. 
 XII.9 Governing Law . The Plan shall be construed and administered under the laws of the State of Indiana, except as preempted by federal law. 
 XII.10 Validity . In case any provision of the Plan shall be held illegal or invalid for any reason, said illegality or invalidity shall not affect the remaining parts hereof, but the Plan shall be construed and enforced as if such illegal and invalid provision had never been inserted herein. 
 XII.11 Notice . Any notice required or permitted under the Plan shall be sufficient if in writing and hand delivered or sent by registered or certified mail. Such notice shall be deemed as given as of the date of delivery or, if delivery is made by mail, as of the date shown on the postmark on the receipt for registration or certification. Mailed notice to the Retirement Committee or the Benefits Committee shall be directed to the Company s address. Mailed notice to a Participant or Beneficiary shall be directed to the individual s last known address in the applicable Employer s records. 
 XII.12 Successors . The provisions of the Plan shall bind and inure to the benefit of the Employers and their successors and assigns. The term successors as used herein shall include any corporate or other business entity that shall, whether by merger, consolidation, purchase, or otherwise, acquire all or substantially all of the business and assets of an Employer, and successors of any such corporation or other business entity. 
 XII.13 Incapacity of Recipient . If any person entitled to a benefit payment under the Plan is deemed by the Plan Administrator to be incapable of personally receiving and giving a valid receipt for such payment, then, unless and until a claim shall have been made by a duly appointed guardian or other legal representative of such person, the Plan Administrator may 
 25 

provide for such payment or any part thereof to be made to any other person or institution then contributing toward or providing for the care and maintenance of such person. Any such payment shall be a payment for the account of such person and a complete discharge of any liability of the Company, any other Employer, the Plan Administrator and the Plan. 
 XII.14 Unclaimed Benefit . Each Participant shall keep the Plan Administrator informed of his or her current address and the current address of his or her Beneficiaries. The Plan Administrator shall not be obligated to search for the whereabouts of any person. If the location of a Participant is not made known to the Plan Administrator within three years after the date on which payment of the Participant's benefit may first be made, payment may be made as though the Participant had died at the end of the three-year period. If, within one additional year after such three-year period has elapsed or within three years after the actual death of a Participant, the Plan Administrator is unable to locate any Beneficiary of the Participant, then the Plan Administrator shall have no further obligation to pay any benefit hereunder to such Participant, Beneficiary, or any other person and such benefit shall be irrevocably forfeited. 
 
 XII.15 Tax Compliance and Payouts . 
 (a) It is intended that the Plan comply with the provisions of Code Section 409A of the Code, so as to prevent the inclusion in gross income of any amounts deferred hereunder in a taxable year that is prior to the taxable year or years in which such amounts would otherwise actually be paid or made available to Participants or Beneficiaries. This Plan shall be construed, administered, and governed in a manner that affects such intent, and neither any Participant, Beneficiary, nor Plan Administrator shall not take any action that would be inconsistent with such intent. Any installment or payment under the Plan shall be considered a separate payment from any other installment or payment for purposes of Code Section 409A. 
 
 (b) Although the Plan Administrator shall use its best efforts to avoid the imposition of taxation, interest and penalties under Code Section 409A, the tax treatment of deferrals under this Plan is not warranted or guaranteed. Neither the Company, the other Affiliates, the Plan Administrator, the Retirement Committee, nor any designee shall be held liable for any taxes, interest, penalties or other monetary amounts owed by any Participant, Beneficiary or other taxpayer as a result of the Plan. 
 
 (c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in the Plan, (1) in the event that the Internal Revenue Service prevails in its claim that amounts contributed to the Plan for the benefit of a Participant, and or earnings thereon, constitute taxable income under Code Section 409A, and guidance and regulations thereunder, to the Participant or his Beneficiary for a taxable year prior to the taxable year in 
 26 

which such contributions and or earnings are distributed to him, or (2) in the event that legal counsel satisfactory to the Company, and the applicable Participant or his Beneficiary, renders an opinion that the Internal Revenue Service would likely prevail in such a claim, the Post-2004 Account, to the extent constituting such taxable income, shall be immediately distributed to the Participant or his Beneficiary. For purposes of this Section, the Internal Revenue Service shall be deemed to have prevailed in a claim if such claim is upheld by a court of final jurisdiction, or, if based upon an opinion of legal counsel satisfactory to the Company and the Participant or his Beneficiary, the Plan fails to appeal a decision of the Internal Revenue Service, or a court of applicable jurisdiction, with respect to such claim to an appropriate Internal Revenue Service appeals authority or to a court of higher jurisdiction within the appropriate time period.
