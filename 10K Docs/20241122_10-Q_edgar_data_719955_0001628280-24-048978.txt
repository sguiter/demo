 NOTE A. 
 Beginning in fiscal 2021 and continuing through fiscal 2022, global supply chain disruptions caused delays in inventory receipts and backorder delays, increased raw material costs, and higher shipping-related charges. These disruptions improved in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022. However, the costs from these supply chain challenges impacted our Condensed Consolidated Statement of Earnings in the first half of fiscal 2023. 
 Common Stock Split 
 On July 9, 2024, the Company effected a -for-1 stock split of its common stock through a stock dividend. All historical share and per share amounts, excluding treasury share amounts, in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q have been retroactively adjusted to reflect the stock split. The shares of common stock retain a par value of per share. Accordingly, an amount equal to the par value of the increased shares resulting from the stock split was reclassified from additional paid-in capital to common stock. 
 Out-of-Period Adjustment 
 Subsequent to the filing of our Form 10-K, in April 2024, the Company determined that it over-recognized freight expense in fiscal years 2021, 2022 and 2023 for a cumulative amount of million. The Company evaluated the error, both qualitatively and quantitatively, and determined that no prior interim or annual periods were materially misstated. The Company then evaluated whether the cumulative amount of the over-accrual was material to its projected fiscal 2024 results, and determined the cumulative amount was not material. Therefore, the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for the thirty-nine weeks ended October 27, 2024 include an out-of-period adjustment of million, recorded in the first quarter of fiscal 2024, to reduce cost of goods sold and accounts payable, which corrected the cumulative error on the Consolidated Balance Sheet as of January 28, 2024.

 million unsecured revolving line of credit (the Revolver ). Our Revolver may be used to borrow revolving loans or to request the issuance of letters of credit. We may, upon notice to the administrative agent, request existing or new lenders, at such lenders option, to increase the Revolver by up to million to provide for a total of up to million of unsecured revolving credit. 
 During the thirteen and thirty-nine weeks ended October 27, 2024 and October 29, 2023, we had borrowings under our Revolver. Additionally, as of October 27, 2024, issued but undrawn standby letters of credit of million were outstanding under our Revolver. The standby letters of credit were primarily issued to secure the liabilities associated with workers compensation and other insurance programs. Our Revolver matures on September 30, 2026, at which time all outstanding borrowings must be repaid and all outstanding letters of credit must be cash collateralized. We may elect to extend the maturity date, subject to lender approval. 
 The interest rate applicable to the Revolver is variable and may be elected by us as: (i) the Secured Overnight Financing Rate ("SOFR") plus basis points and an applicable margin based on our leverage ratio, ranging from to or (ii) a base rate as defined in the Credit Facility, plus an applicable margin based on our leverage ratio, ranging from to . 
 Our Credit Facility contains certain restrictive loan covenants, including, among others, a financial covenant requiring a maximum leverage ratio (funded debt adjusted for operating lease liabilities to earnings before interest, income tax, depreciation, amortization and rent expense), and covenants limiting our ability to incur indebtedness, grant liens, make acquisitions, merge or consolidate, and dispose of assets. As of October 27, 2024, we were in compliance with our financial covenants under our Credit Facility and, based on our current projections, we expect to remain in compliance throughout the next 12 months. 
 Letter of Credit Facilities 
 We have unsecured letter of credit facilities for a total of million. Our letter of credit facilities contain covenants that are consistent with our Credit Facility. Interest on unreimbursed amounts under our letter of credit facilities accrues at a base rate as defined in the Credit Facility, plus an applicable margin based on our leverage ratio. As of October 27, 2024, the aggregate amount outstanding under our letter of credit facilities was million, which represents only a future commitment to fund inventory purchases to which we had not taken legal title. On August 16, 2024, we renewed of our letter of credit facilities totaling million on substantially similar terms. The letter of credit facilities mature on August 18, 2025, and the latest expiration date possible for future letters of credit issued under these facilities is January 15, 2026. of the letter of credit facilities totaling million matures on September 30, 2026, which is also the latest expiration date possible for future letters of credit issued under the facility.

 , the majority of which is recognized within of the card issuance. Breakage revenue is not material to our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. 
 We have customer loyalty programs, which allow members to earn points for each qualifying purchase. Customers can earn points through spend on both our private label and co-branded credit cards, or can earn points as part of our non-credit card related loyalty program. Points earned through both loyalty programs enable members to receive certificates that may be redeemed on future merchandise purchases. This customer option is a material right and, accordingly, represents a separate performance obligation to the customer. The allocated consideration for the points or certificates earned by our loyalty program members is deferred based on the standalone selling price of the points and recorded within gift card and other deferred revenue within our Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet. The measurement of standalone selling prices takes into consideration the discount the customer would receive in a separate transaction for the delivered item, as well as our estimate of certificates expected to be issued and redeemed, based on historical patterns. This measurement is applied to our portfolio of performance obligations for points or certificates earned, as all obligations have similar economic characteristics. We believe the impact to our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements would not be materially different if this measurement was applied to each individual performance obligation. Revenue is recognized for these performance obligations at a point in time when certificates are redeemed by the customer. These obligations relate to contracts with terms less than , as our certificates generally expire within from issuance. 
 We enter into agreements with credit card issuers in connection with our private label and co-branded credit cards, whereby we receive cash incentives in exchange for promised services, such as licensing our brand names and marketing the credit card program to customers. These separate non-loyalty program related services promised under these agreements are interrelated and are thus considered a single performance obligation. Revenue is recognized over time as we transfer promised services throughout the contract term. 
 As of October 27, 2024, January 28, 2024 and October 29, 2023, we had recorded million, million and million, respectively, for gift card and other deferred revenue within current liabilities in our Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. The increase in our gift card and other deferred revenue balance as of October 27, 2024 compared to October 29, 2023 was primarily due to advance payments collected on certain product categories.

 The following discussion and analysis of financial condition, results of operations, and liquidity and capital resources for the thirteen weeks ended October 27, 2024 third quarter of fiscal 2024 ), as compared to the thirteen weeks ended October 29, 2023 third quarter of fiscal 2023 and thirty-nine weeks ended October 27, 2024 ("first thirty-nine weeks of fiscal 2024"), as compared to the thirty-nine weeks ended October 29, 2023 ("first thirty-nine weeks of fiscal 2023"), should be read in conjunction with our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements and the notes thereto. All explanations of changes in operational results are discussed in order of magnitude. 
 Third Quarter of Fiscal 2024 Financial Results 
 Net revenues in the third quarter of fiscal 2024 decreased 53.0 million or 2.9 , with company comparable brand revenue ("company comp") decline of 2.9 . This decrease was driven by continuing customer hesitancy towards furniture purchases, partially offset by strength in our emerging brands and our children's home furnishings business. 
 In the third quarter of fiscal 2024, Pottery Barn, our largest brand, saw 7.5 comparable brand revenue ("brand comp") decline driven by reduced furniture sales, partially offset by relative strength from our decorating, entertaining, and seasonal holiday categories. The Pottery Barn Kids and Teen brands saw 3.8 brand comp growth in the third quarter of fiscal 2024 driven by strength in decor, seasonal products, textiles and collaborations.

West Elm saw 3.5 brand comp decline in the third quarter of fiscal 2024, driven by the continuing impacts of the customer pull back in furniture as a result of the brand's high percentage of its assortment in the furniture category, partially offset by strength from new product introductions across categories including textiles, kids and furniture. 
 The Williams Sonoma brand saw 0.1 brand comp decline in the third quarter of fiscal 2024 with strength in the brand's kitchen business driven by high ticket electrics and tabletop. 
 For the third quarter of fiscal 2024, diluted earnings per share was 1.96, compared to 1.83 in the third quarter of fiscal 2023. 
 As of October 27, 2024, we had 827 million in cash and cash equivalents and generated operating cash flow of 726.7 million in the first thirty-nine weeks of fiscal 2024. In addition to our cash balance, we also ended the third quarter of fiscal 2024 with no outstanding borrowings under our revolving line of credit. Our liquidity position allowed us to fund the operations of the business by investing 154.4 million in capital expenditures in the first thirty-nine weeks of fiscal 2024, and to provide stockholder returns of 916.3 million in the first thirty-nine weeks of fiscal 2024 through stock repurchases and dividends. 
 Out-of-Period Adjustment 
 Subsequent to the filing of our Form 10-K, in April 2024, the Company determined that it over-recognized freight expense in fiscal years 2021, 2022 and 2023 for a cumulative amount of 49.0 million. The Company evaluated the error, both qualitatively and quantitatively, and determined that no prior interim or annual periods were materially misstated. The Company then evaluated whether the cumulative amount of the over-accrual was material to its projected fiscal 2024 results, and determined the cumulative amount was not material. Therefore, the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for the thirty-nine weeks ended October 27, 2024 include an out-of-period adjustment of 49.0 million, recorded in the first quarter of fiscal 2024, to reduce cost of goods sold and accounts payable, which corrected the cumulative error on the Consolidated Balance Sheet as of January 28, 2024. 
 Looking Ahead 
 As we look forward to the balance of the year, we are focused on three key priorities, which include (i) returning to growth, (ii) elevating our world-class customer service and (iii) driving earnings. We believe these key priorities will set us apart from our competition and allow us to drive long-term growth and profitability. We believe we have a powerful portfolio of brands, serving a range of categories, aesthetics, and life stages and we have built a strong omni-channel platform and infrastructure, which will position us well for the next stage of growth. However, the uncertain macroeconomic environment with the slow housing market, elevated interest rates, layoffs, inflationary pressure, political uncertainty and global geopolitical tension may continue to impact our results. For information on risks, please see Risk Factors in Part I, Item 1A of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended January 28, 2024. 
 
 NET REVENUES 
 Net revenues primarily consist of sales of merchandise to our customers through our e-commerce websites, retail stores and direct-mail catalogs, and include shipping fees received from customers for delivery of merchandise to their homes. Our revenues also include sales to our business-to-business customers and franchisees, incentives received from credit card issuers in connection with our private label and co-branded credit cards and breakage income related to our stored-value cards. Revenue from the sale of merchandise is reported net of sales returns. 
 Third Quarter of Fiscal 2024 vs. Third Quarter of Fiscal 2023 
 Net revenues in the third quarter of fiscal 2024 decreased 53.0 million or 2.9 , with company comp decline of 2.9 . This decrease was driven by continuing customer hesitancy towards furniture purchases, partially offset by strength in our emerging brands and our children's home furnishings business. 
 
 First Thirty-nine Weeks of Fiscal 2024 vs. First Thirty-nine Weeks of Fiscal 2023 
 Net revenues for the first thirty-nine weeks of fiscal 2024 decreased by 222.4 million, or 4.1 , with company comp decline of 3.7 . This was driven by continuing customer hesitancy towards furniture purchases, partially offset by strength in our emerging brands and children's home furnishings.

Comparable Brand Revenue 
 Comparable brand revenue includes comparable e-commerce sales, including through our direct-mail catalog, and store sales, as well as shipping fees, sales returns and other discounts associated with current period sales. Comparable stores are defined as permanent stores where gross square footage did not change by more than 20 in the previous 12 months, and which have been open for at least 12 consecutive months without closure for more than seven days within the same fiscal month. Outlet comparable store revenues are included in their respective brands. Business-to-business revenues are included in comparable brand revenue for each of our brands. Sales to our international franchisees are excluded from comparable brand revenue as their stores and e-commerce websites are not operated by us. Sales from certain operations are also excluded until such time that we believe those sales are meaningful to evaluating their performance. Additionally, comparable brand revenue for newer concepts is not separately disclosed until such time that we believe those sales are meaningful to evaluating the performance of the brand.

GROSS PROFIT 
 Gross profit is equal to our net revenues less cost of goods sold. Cost of goods sold includes (i) cost of goods, which consists of cost of merchandise, inbound freight expenses, freight-to-store expenses and other inventory related costs such as replacements, damages, obsolescence and shrinkage; (ii) occupancy expenses, which consists of rent, other occupancy costs (including property taxes, common area maintenance and utilities) and depreciation; and (iii) shipping costs, which consists of third-party delivery services and shipping materials. 
 Our classification of expenses in cost of goods sold may not be comparable to other public companies, as we do not include non-occupancy-related costs associated with our distribution network in cost of goods sold. These costs, which include distribution network employment, third-party warehouse management and other distribution-related administrative expenses, are recorded in selling, general and administrative expenses ("SG A").

 Gross profit increased 19.4 million, or 2.4 , compared to the third quarter of fiscal 2023. Gross margin increased to 46.7 from 44.4 in the third quarter of fiscal 2023. The increase in gross margin of 230 basis points was driven by (i) higher merchandise margins of 130 basis points and (ii) supply chain efficiencies of 100 basis points, including reductions in returns, replacements, accommodations and damages as well as limiting out-of-market and multiple shipments. Occupancy rate was flat compared to the third quarter of fiscal 2023.

The decline in gross margin of 170 basis points was primarily driven by (i) higher input costs resulting from ocean freight, detention and demurrage in the first half of fiscal 2023, which improved in the third quarter of fiscal 2023 and (ii) higher occupancy costs resulting from incremental costs from our new distribution centers on the East and West Coasts to support our long-term growth, partially offset by (iii) higher pricing power of our proprietary products and our focus on full-price selling.

 SG A increased 13.8 million, or 2.7 , compared to the third quarter of fiscal 2023. SG A as a percentage of net revenues increased to 28.9 from 27.4 in the third quarter of fiscal 2023. This increase of 150 basis points was primarily driven by (i) an increase in employment expense of 160 basis points due to higher performance-based incentive compensation and employee benefits costs and (ii) an increase in advertising expenses of 20 basis points; partially offset by (iii) lower general expenses of 30 basis points from timing of administrative expenses. 
 
 First Thirty-nine Weeks of Fiscal 2024 vs. First Thirty-nine Weeks of Fiscal 2023

SG A as a percentage of net revenues increased to 29.3 from 26.8 for the first thirty-nine weeks of fiscal 2023. This increase of 250 basis points was primarily driven by (i) an increase in employment expense of 150 basis points due to higher performance-based incentive compensation, which does not include a benefit from the out-of-period freight adjustment and (ii) an increase in advertising expenses of 110 basis points, partially offset by (iii) exit costs of 15.8 million and reduction-in-force initiatives of 8.3 million recorded in the first thirty-nine weeks of fiscal 2023 which did not recur in the first thirty-nine weeks of fiscal 2024. 
 
 INCOME TAXES 
 The effective tax rate was 24.3 for the first thirty-nine weeks of fiscal 2024, and 25.8 for the first thirty-nine weeks of fiscal 2023. The decrease in the effective tax rate was primarily due to (i) higher excess tax benefit from stock-based compensation in first thirty-nine weeks of fiscal 2024 and (ii) the tax effect of earnings mix change, partially offset by (iii) the expiration of the statutes of limitations related to uncertain tax positions in fiscal 2023. 
 Since the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development ("OECD") announced the OECD/G20 Inclusive Framework on Base Erosion and Profit Shifting ("Framework") in 2021, a number of countries have begun to enact legislation to implement the OECD international tax framework, including the Pillar Two minimum tax regime. To mitigate the administrative burden for Multinational Enterprises in complying with the OECD Global Anti-Base Erosion rules during the initial years of implementation, the OECD developed the temporary Transitional Country-by-Country Safe Harbor ("Safe Harbor"). This transitional Safe Harbor applies for fiscal years beginning on or before December 31, 2026, but not including a fiscal year that ends after June 30, 2028. Under the Safe Harbor, the top-up tax for such jurisdiction is deemed to be zero, provided that at least one of the Safe Harbor tests is met for the jurisdiction. 
 In the regions in which we operate, Canada, United Kingdom, Netherlands, Italy and Vietnam have implemented Pillar Two frameworks effective January 1, 2024. The Company's subsidiaries are not subject to Pillar Two minimum tax in the first thirty-nine weeks of fiscal 2024 under the Safe Harbor rules. 
 Pillar Two minimum tax will be treated as a period cost in future periods when it is applicable. We are continuing to evaluate the potential impact on future periods of the Pillar Two Framework, and monitoring legislative developments by other countries, especially in the regions in which we operate.

Table of Contents 

Liquidity Outlook 
 For the remainder of fiscal 2024, we plan to use our cash resources to fund our inventory and inventory-related purchases, employment-related costs, advertising and marketing initiatives, stock repurchases, property and equipment purchases, dividend payments, rental payments on our leases and the payment of income taxes. 
 We believe our cash on hand, cash flows from operations and our available credit facilities will provide adequate liquidity for our business operations as well as stock repurchases, dividends, capital expenditures and other liquidity requirements associated with our business operations over the next 12 months. We are currently not aware of any other trends or demands, commitments, events or uncertainties that will result in, or that are reasonably likely to result in, our liquidity increasing or decreasing in any material way that will impact our capital needs during or beyond the next 12 months. 
 Sources of Liquidity 
 As of October 27, 2024, we held 826.8 million in cash and cash equivalents, the majority of which was held in interest-bearing demand deposit accounts and money market funds, and of which 82.7 million was held by our international subsidiaries. As is consistent within our industry, our cash balances are seasonal in nature, with the fourth quarter historically representing a significantly higher level of cash than other periods. 
 In addition to our cash balances on hand, we have a credit facility (the "Credit Facility") which provides for a 500 million unsecured revolving line of credit (the Revolver ). Our Revolver may be used to borrow revolving loans or to request the issuance of letters of credit. We may, upon notice to the administrative agent, request existing or new lenders, at such lenders option, to increase the Revolver by up to 250 million to provide for a total of up to 750 million of unsecured revolving credit. 
 During the thirteen and thirty-nine weeks ended October 27, 2024 and October 29, 2023, we had no borrowings under our Revolver. Additionally, as of October 27, 2024, issued but undrawn standby letters of credit of 12.1 million were outstanding under our Revolver. The standby letters of credit were primarily issued to secure the liabilities associated with workers compensation and other insurance programs. 
 Our Credit Facility contains certain restrictive loan covenants, including, among others, a financial covenant requiring a maximum leverage ratio (funded debt adjusted for operating lease liabilities to earnings before interest, income tax, depreciation, amortization and rent expense), and covenants limiting our ability to incur indebtedness, grant liens, make acquisitions, merge or consolidate, and dispose of assets. As of October 27, 2024, we were in compliance with our financial covenants under our Credit Facility and, based on our current projections, we expect to remain in compliance throughout the next 12 months. 
 Letter of Credit Facilities 
 We have three unsecured letter of credit facilities for a total of 35 million. Our letter of credit facilities contain covenants that are consistent with our Credit Facility. Interest on unreimbursed amounts under our letter of credit facilities accrues at a base rate as defined in the Credit Facility, plus an applicable margin based on our leverage ratio. As of October 27, 2024, the aggregate amount outstanding under our letter of credit facilities was 0.8 million, which represents only a future commitment to fund inventory purchases to which we had not taken legal title. On August 16, 2024, we renewed two of our letter of credit facilities totaling 30 million on substantially similar terms. The two letter of credit facilities mature on August 18, 2025, and the latest expiration date possible for future letters of credit issued under these facilities is January 15, 2026. One of the letter of credit facilities totaling 5 million matures on September 30, 2026, which is also the latest expiration date possible for future letters of credit issued under the facility. 
 Cash Flows from Operating Activities 
 For the first thirty-nine weeks of fiscal 2024, net cash provided by operating activities was 726.7 million compared to 1.0 billion for the first thirty-nine weeks of fiscal 2023, and was primarily attributable to net earnings adjusted for non-cash items, partially offset by higher spending on merchandise inventories as a result of timing of seasonal receipts and a decrease in income taxes payable. Net cash provided by operating activities compared to the first thirty-nine weeks of fiscal 2023 decreased primarily due to higher spending on merchandise inventories, a decrease in accounts payable (as a result of supplier payment timing) and a decrease in income taxes payable, partially offset by an increase in net earnings adjusted for non-cash items. 
 Cash Flows from Investing Activities 
 For the first thirty-nine weeks of fiscal 2024, net cash used in investing activities was 154.0 million compared to 134.4 million for the first thirty-nine weeks of fiscal 2023, and was primarily attributable to purchases of property and equipment related to technology, store construction and supply chain enhancements.

Cash Flows from Financing Activities 
 For the first thirty-nine weeks of fiscal 2024, net cash used in financing activities was 1.0 billion compared to 538.7 million for the first thirty-nine weeks of fiscal 2023, primarily driven by repurchases of common stock, payment of dividends and tax withholdings remittance related to stock-based awards. Net cash used in financing activities for the first thirty-nine weeks of fiscal 2024 increased compared to the first thirty-nine weeks of fiscal 2023, primarily due to an increase in repurchases of common stock. 
 Seasonality 
 Our business is subject to substantial seasonal variations in demand. Historically, a significant portion of our revenues and net earnings have been realized during the period from October through January, and levels of net revenues and net earnings have typically been lower during the period from February through September. We believe this is the general pattern associated with the retail industry. In preparation for and during our holiday selling season, we hire a substantial number of additional temporary associates, primarily in our retail stores, distribution facilities and customer care centers. 
 
 CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES 
 Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations is based on our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The preparation of these Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. These estimates and assumptions are evaluated on an ongoing basis and are based on historical experience and various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results could differ significantly from these estimates. During the third quarter of fiscal 2024, there were no significant changes to the critical accounting estimates discussed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended January 28, 2024.

ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 
 We are exposed to market risks, which include significant deterioration of the U.S. and foreign markets, changes in U.S. interest rates, foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, and the effects of economic uncertainty which may affect the prices we pay our vendors in the foreign countries in which we do business. We do not engage in financial transactions for trading or speculative purposes. 
 Interest Rate Risk 
 Our Revolver has a variable interest rate which, when drawn upon, subjects us to risks associated with changes in that interest rate. During the third quarter of fiscal 2024, we had no borrowings under our Revolver. 
 In addition, we have fixed and variable income investments consisting of short-term investments classified as cash and cash equivalents, which are also affected by changes in market interest rates. As of October 27, 2024, our investments, made primarily in interest-bearing demand deposit accounts and money market funds, are stated at cost and approximate their fair values. 
 Foreign Currency Risks 
 We purchase the majority of our inventory from suppliers outside of the U.S. in transactions that are primarily denominated in U.S. dollars and, as such, any foreign currency impact related to these international purchase transactions was not significant to us during the third quarter of fiscal 2024 or the third quarter of fiscal 2023. Since we pay for the majority of our international purchases in U.S. dollars, however, a decline in the U.S. dollar relative to other foreign currencies would subject us to risks associated with increased purchasing costs from our suppliers in their effort to offset any lost profits associated with any currency devaluation. We cannot predict with certainty the effect these increased costs may have on our financial statements or results of operations. 
 In addition, our businesses in Canada, Australia and the United Kingdom, and our operations throughout Asia and Europe, expose us to market risk associated with foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. Substantially all of our purchases and sales are denominated in U.S. dollars, which limits our exposure to this risk. However, some of our foreign operations have a functional currency other than the U.S. dollar. While the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations was not material to us in the third quarter of fiscal 2024 or the third quarter of fiscal 2023, we have continued to see volatility in the exchange rates in the countries in which we do business. Additionally, the effect of a hypothetical 10 change in foreign currency exchange rates applicable to our business would not have a material impact on our historical or current Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. As we continue to expand globally, the foreign currency exchange risk related to our foreign operations may increase. To mitigate this risk, we may hedge a portion of our foreign currency exposure with foreign currency forward contracts in accordance with our risk management policies. 
 Inflation 
 While it is difficult to accurately measure the impact of inflation due to the imprecise nature of the estimates required, we have experienced varying levels of inflation, resulting in part from various supply chain disruptions, increased shipping and transportation costs, increased product costs, increased labor costs in the supply chain and other disruptions caused by the pandemic and the uncertain economic environment. We believe the effects of inflation, if any, on our financial statements and results of operations have been immaterial to date. However, there can be no assurance that our results of operations and financial condition will not be materially impacted by inflation in the future, including by the heightened levels of inflation experienced globally during the third quarter of fiscal 2024 and the third quarter of fiscal 2023. Global trends, including inflationary pressures, are weakening customer sentiment, negatively impacting consumer spending behavior and slowing down consumer demand for our products. However, our unique operating model and pricing power helped mitigate these increased costs during the third quarter of fiscal 2024 and the third quarter of fiscal 2023. Our inability or failure to offset the impact of inflation could harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.

ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 As of October 27, 2024, an evaluation was performed by management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer CEO and our Chief Financial Officer CFO ), of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures. Based on that evaluation, our management, including our CEO and CFO, concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures are effective to ensure that information we are required to disclose in reports that we file or submit under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our CEO and CFO, as appropriate, to allow for timely discussions regarding required disclosures, and that such information is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the Securities and Exchange Commission. 
 Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
 There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the third quarter of fiscal 2024, that materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
