 Business Environment Recent Events Beginning in 2022 and continuing through 2023 and through most of 2024, inflation negatively impacted our input costs and pricing, primarily for labor and materials. We, our customers, and our suppliers also experienced the effect of a higher interest rate environment in those periods. Gross domestic product growth slowed throughout 2022 largely due to the widespread impacts of inflation, increasing interest rates, and more restrictive financial conditions. While gross domestic product began to rebound in 2023, the factors contributing to supply chain disruptions, labor shortages, and global inflation remained persistent into 2023, along with elevated geopolitical uncertainty. There were varying degrees of impact on our customers, and thus our business around the world, with Europe experiencing the greatest amount of stress in 2023 and into 2024. The current geopolitical conflicts, the condition of sovereign finances, and the outcome of the U.S. Presidential election are creating higher levels of economic uncertainty and increased volatility with respect to energy prices, interest rates, our supply chain, and certain customer ordering patterns. We have been closely monitoring the developments and continue to adjust our production platform to react to changing customer ordering patterns and realize efficiencies. The ordering patterns of our aerospace and defense customers have been particularly impacted by changes in sovereign governments priorities and budgets. The impact of the conflicts on our operational and financial performance will depend on future developments that cannot be predicted. Changing order patterns, supply chain disruptions, and the evolution of our business required us to carry larger inventories in 2024 and 2023 to meet the needs of our customers, especially as they began to return to a new normal after the disruptions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. Starting in the second quarter of 2024, there were more abrupt and larger changes to order patterns as our customers reacted to elevated inventory levels and slowing customer demand. Several customers, particularly in the Vehicle and Industrial markets, reduced demand or pushed out delivery dates for their orders, and we experienced an acceleration of these customers actions starting in the second quarter of 2024, and continuing through the third quarter of 2024. As the pace of our customers actions increased, we recently advanced our Simplify to Accelerate NOW strategy. This strategy is being implemented to reduce costs and help create earnings momentum as the Company seeks to enhance efficiency, reduce working capital requirements and strengthen cash flow through realignment and rationalization of our resources. The Simplify to Accelerate NOW strategy is centered on three high-level strategic initiatives: 
 1. Realign and right-size the Company s footprint to better align with its markets and customers. Initiatives are already underway and are expected to continue with earnest throughout 2024 and beyond.
 2. Reinforce lean manufacturing disciplines throughout the Company to accelerate margin expansion.
 3. Focus on working capital reduction to drive additional cash generation and de-lever the balance sheet.
 
 Beginning in the second quarter and continuing into the third quarter of 2024, we began to implement our Simplify to Accelerate NOW strategy. We executed certain actions that streamline our operations to enhance efficiency as well as drive profitability. Expected cost savings of this initiative are anticipated to be approximately 10 million annually. As part of this program, the Company will continue to realign production and rationalize our footprint through the remainder of 2024 . In addition, the Company has implemented reductions to its workforce in many operations throughout the world, to reflect the reduction in sales it is forecasting for the remainder of 2024. The costs associated with this program are expected to be between approximately 1.9 million and 2.4 million, primarily related to severance and related expenses. The Company completed the acquisition of SNC in the first quarter of 2024 and the acquisition of Sierramotion in the third quarter of 2023. These acquisitions are important to executing on the Company s strategic plan, and we remain focused in the near term on successfully integrating these acquisitions and leveraging the synergies that will be important drivers of our future growth and profitability.

 REVENUES: The decrease in revenues during the third quarter 2024 reflects decreases in each of the target markets, most significantly within Vehicle and Industrial markets. Decreases in revenues compared to the prior year period are largely impacted by elevated shipments during the prior year period as supply chains normalized , combined with elevated inventory levels and slowing demand at our customers which began in the second quarter of 2024 and continued into the current period, partially offset by revenue contributed from the 2023 and 2024 acquisitions. Our revenue for the third quarter of 2024 was comprised of 56 to U.S. customers and 44 to customers primarily in Europe, Canada, and Asia-Pacific. The overall decrease in revenue was primarily due to a 14.3 volume decrease slightly offset by a foreign currency increase of 0.4 . The acquisitions completed in 2023 and 2024 contributed an incremental 10,473 of revenue in the three months ended September 30, 2024 . Organic revenue decreased 21.5 during the third quarter 2024. ORDER BOOKINGS AND BACKLOG: Bookings decreased in the third quarter 2024 compared to 2023, due primarily to a 34.2 decrease in volume slightly offset by a 0.5 increase in foreign currency impact. The decrease in bookings from the prior year quarter is in large part due to a large 31 million order in the defense market received during the third quarter of 2023, as well as continued impacts of changes in customer order patterns in reacting to elevated inventory levels and customer demand. GROSS PROFIT AND GROSS MARGIN: Gross profit decreased to 39,264 in the third quarter of 2024 from 47,498 in the third quarter of 2023 driven by lower sales volume, and gross margins decreased to 31.4 for 2024, compared to 32.7 for 2023. The decrease in gross margin percentage was driven by lower fixed cost absorption on lower sales volumes, as well as the gross margin impact of our most recent acquisition. SELLING EXPENSES: Selling expenses increased 5 during the third quarter of 2024 compared to 2023 primarily due to increased costs in connection with our recently completed acquisitions and to the mix of sales with commissions. Selling expenses as a percentage of revenues were 5 and 4 in the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively.

 GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES: General and administrative expenses decreased 5 during the third quarter 2024 compared to 2023 due primarily to lower incentive compensation as well as cost reduction actions taken reflecting our Simplify to Accelerate NOW strategy. As a percentage of revenues, general and administrative expenses were 11 and 10 in the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. ENGINEERING AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENSES: Engineering and development expenses decreased by 15 in the third quarter of 2024 compared to 2023. The decrease reflects the cost reduction actions taken as part of our Simplify to Accelerate NOW strategy. As a percentage of revenues, engineering and development expenses were 7 for each of the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. BUSINESS DEVELOPMENT COSTS: Business development costs include acquisition and integration related costs as well as restructuring and business realignment costs. The decrease in business development costs in the third quarter of 2024 compared to 2023 primarily reflects a decrease in fair value measurement of contingent consideration liabilities, offset by current year restructuring-related costs associated with our Simplify to Accelerate NOW strategy. AMORTIZATION OF INTANGIBLE ASSETS: Amortization of intangible assets remained consistent compared to the prior year period. INTEREST EXPENSE: Interest expense increased in the third quarter of 2024 compared to 2023 due to higher average debt balances and, to a lesser extent, higher interest rates compared to the prior year period. The increase in interest expense is partially offset by reductions to interest expense realized through our interest rate swaps. INCOME TAXES: The effective income tax rate was 22.6 and 23.0 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The effective tax rate for the three months ended September 30, 2024 includes net discrete tax costs of 1.2 , primarily due to share based awards and provision to return adjustments. The tax rate for the three months ended September 30, 2023 does not include any discrete tax items that had a significant impact on tax rates. The lower effective tax rate in the third quarter of 2024 as compared to the third quarter of 2023 is primarily due to the realization of certain deferred income tax assets that had been reserved in prior years and estimates of tax credits. The Company expects its income tax rate for the full year 2024 to be approximately 21 to 23 . NET INCOME AND ADJUSTED NET INCOME: Net income decreased during the third quarter of 2024 compared to 2023, primarily relating to lower sales volume, including a decrease in organic revenue, partially offset by a decrease in operating expenses, reflecting the actions in our Simplify to Accelerate NOW strategy. Adjusted net income for the quarters ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was 5,068 and 9,980, respectively. Adjusted diluted earnings per share for the third quarter of 2024 and 2023 were 0.31 and 0.61, respectively. Adjusted net income and adjusted diluted earnings per share are non-GAAP measures. See information included in Non GAAP Measures below for a discussion of the non-GAAP measure and reconciliation of net income to adjusted net income and diluted earnings per share to adjusted diluted earnings per share. EBITDA AND ADJUSTED EBITDA: EBITDA was 12,595 for the third quarter of 2024 compared to 18,243 for the third quarter of 2023. Adjusted EBITDA was 14,432 and 20,849 for the third quarters of 2024 and 2023, respectively. EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are non-GAAP measures. EBITDA consists of income before interest expense, provision for income taxes, and depreciation and amortization. Adjusted EBITDA also excludes stock-based compensation expense, foreign currency gain/loss and certain other items.

ORDER BOOKINGS AND BACKLOG: Orders decreased for the year to date 2024 compared to 2023, and included a 12.8 decrease in volume slightly offset by an insignificant increase in foreign exchange impact. The decrease in bookings from the prior year quarter is in large part due to a large 31 million order in the defense market received during the third quarter of 2023, as well as continued impacts of changes in customer order patterns in reacting to elevated inventory levels and customer demand. GROSS PROFIT AND GROSS MARGIN: Gross profit decreased to 127,317 for year to date 2024 from 139,309 in 2023 driven by lower sales volume, and gross margins decreased to 31.2 for 2024, compared to 31.8 for 2023. The decrease in gross margin percentage was driven by lower fixed cost absorption on lower sales volumes, as well as the unfavorable gross margin impact of our most recent acquisition. SELLING EXPENSES: Selling expenses increased 5 during year to date 2024 compared to 2023 primarily due to increased costs in connection with our recently completed acquisitions and to the mix of sales with commissions. Selling expenses as a percentage of revenues were comparable at 5 and 4 during year to date 2024 and 2023, respectively.

EBITDA AND ADJUSTED EBITDA: EBITDA was 42,438 for year to date 2024 compared to 54,042 for year to date 2023. Adjusted EBITDA was 48,404 and 60,255 for year to date 2024 and 2023, respectively. EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are non-GAAP measures. EBITDA consists of income before interest expense, provision for income taxes, and depreciation and amortization. Adjusted EBITDA also excludes stock-based compensation expense, foreign currency gain/loss and certain other items. Refer to information included in Non-GAAP Measures below for a discussion of the non-GAAP measure and a reconciliation of net income to EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA. Non-GAAP Measures Organic revenue, EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted net income and Adjusted diluted earnings per share are provided for information purposes only and are not measures of financial performance under GAAP. Management believes the presentation of these financial measures reflecting non-GAAP adjustments provides important supplemental information to investors and other users of our financial statements in evaluating the operating results of the Company as distinct from results that include items that are not indicative of ongoing operating results. In particular, those charges and credits that are not directly related to operating unit performance, and that are not a helpful measure of the performance of our underlying business particularly in light of their unpredictable nature. These non-GAAP disclosures have limitations as analytical tools, should not be viewed as a substitute for revenue and net income determined in accordance with GAAP, and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of the Company s results as reported under GAAP, nor is it necessarily comparable to non-GAAP performance measures that may be presented by other companies. In addition, the supplemental presentation should not be construed as an inference that the Company s future results will be unaffected by similar adjustments to net income determined in accordance with GAAP. Organic revenue is reported revenues adjusted for the impact of foreign currency and the revenue contribution from acquisitions.

 The Company believes that revenue excluding foreign currency exchange impacts is a useful measure in analyzing sales results. The Company excludes the effect of currency translation from revenue for this measure because currency translation is not fully under management s control, is subject to volatility and can obscure underlying business trends. The portion of revenue attributable to currency translation is calculated as the difference between the current period revenue and the current period revenue after applying foreign exchange rates from the prior period. The Company believes EBITDA is often a useful measure of a Company s operating performance and is a significant basis used by the Company s management to measure the operating performance of the Company s business because EBITDA excludes charges for depreciation, amortization and interest expense that have resulted from our debt financings, acquisitions, as well as our provision for income tax expense. EBITDA is frequently used as one of the bases for comparing businesses in the Company s industry. The Company also believes that Adjusted EBITDA provides helpful information about the operating performance of its business. Adjusted EBITDA excludes stock-based compensation expense, as well as business development costs, foreign currency gains/losses on short-term assets and liabilities, and other items that are not indicative of the Company s core operating performance. EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA do not represent and should not be considered as an alternative to net income, operating income, net cash provided by operating activities or any other measure for determining operating performance or liquidity that is calculated in accordance with GAAP. Management uses Adjusted net income and Adjusted diluted earnings per share to assess the Company s consolidated financial and operating performance. Adjusted net income and Adjusted diluted earnings per share are provided for informational purposes only and are not a measure of financial performance under GAAP. These measures help management make decisions that are expected to facilitate meeting current financial goals as well as achieving optimal financial performance. Adjusted net income provides management with a measure of financial performance of the Company based on operational factors as it removes the impact of certain non-routine items from the Company s operating results. Adjusted diluted earnings per share provides management with an indication of how Adjusted net income would be reflected on a per share basis for comparison to the GAAP diluted earnings per share measure. Adjusted net income is a key metric used by senior management and the Company s board of directors to review the consolidated financial performance of the business. This measure adjusts net income determined in accordance with GAAP to reflect changes in financial results associated with the highlighted expense and income items. The Company s calculation of organic revenue for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 is as follows:

 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the increase in cash provided by operating activities is due to improved cash inflows on collections on accounts receivable, and cash used/provided by inventory, offset by increase in cash used in accounts payable and accrued liabilities, as well as lower net income. The increase in cash used in investing activities in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 relates to 20 million in cash paid for the acquisition of SNC. For the year to date 2024 and 2023, 6,250 of cash was paid relating to the 2022 Spectrum acquisition. Cash used in investing activities in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 includes 6,903 for purchases of property and equipment compared to 7,850 during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Capital expenditures are expected to be between 8,000 and 11,000 for the full year 2024. The increase in cash provided by financing activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 is primarily due to borrowings of 20,000 to fund the SNC acquisition . Debt payments of 9,500 were made during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The 50,000 Notes issued in March 2024 were used to pay down the Revolving Facility. As of September 30, 2024, we had 175,962 of obligations under the Revolving Facility, excluding deferred financing costs. Financial covenants under the 2024 Credit and Note Payable Agreements require the Company to maintain a minimum interest coverage ratio of at least 3.0:1.0 at the end of each fiscal quarter. In addition, the Company s Leverage Ratio at the end of any fiscal quarter shall not be greater than 4.25:1.0 through December 31, 2024 or greater than 3.75 to 1.0 as of the end of any fiscal quarter thereafter; provided that the Company may elect to temporarily increase the Leverage Ratio to by 0.5:1.0 following a material acquisition under the 2024 Credit and Note Payable Agreements. The 2024 Credit and Note Payable Agreements also include covenants and restrictions that limit the Company s ability to incur additional indebtedness, merge, consolidate or sell all or substantially all of its assets and enter into transactions with an affiliate of the Company on other than an arms length transaction. These covenants, which are described more fully in the 2024 Credit and Note Payable Agreements, to which reference is made for a complete statement of the covenants, were modified as of October 22, 2024, and are subject to certain exceptions. The Company was in compliance with all covenants as of September 30, 2024. As of September 30, 2024, the unused Revolving Facility was 104,038. The amount available to borrow may be limited by our debt and EBITDA levels, which impacts our covenant calculations. The Revolving Facility matures March 1, 2029. The Series A Senior Notes, under the 2024 Note Payable Agreement, are due March 21, 2031. On October 22, 2024, the Company entered into a Second Amendment to the Third Amended and Restated Credit Agreement and a Second Amendment to the Note Purchase and Private Shelf Agreement (collectively, the October 2024 Credit and Note Payable Amendments ). These amendments include provisions to increase the maximum Leverage Ratio to 4.5:1.0 for the quarters ending March 31, 2025 and June 30, 2025, 4.0:1.0 for the quarter ending September 30, 2025, and returning to 3.75:1.0 for the quarter ending December 31, 2025 and thereafter. From January 1, 2025 through September 30, 2025, borrowings under the Revolving Facility will bear interest at Term SOFR plus a margin of 2.50 and a commitment fee of 0.325 on the unused portion of the Revolving Facility. Also, from October 1, 2024 through September 30, 2025, the Series A Notes will bear interest at 6.46 . The Company declared dividends of 0.09 per share during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 0.085 per share during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The Company s working capital, capital expenditure and dividend requirements are expected to be funded from cash provided by operations and amounts available under the Amended Credit Agreement. We believe our diverse markets, our strong market position in many of our businesses, and the steps we have taken to strengthen our balance sheet, such as retaining cash to support shorter term needs and amending our revolving credit facility leaves us well-positioned to manage our business. We continually assess our liquidity and cash positions taking geopolitical and other market uncertainties into consideration. Based on our analysis, we believe our existing balances of cash, our currently anticipated operating cash flows, and our available financing under agreements in place will be more than sufficient to meet our cash needs arising in the ordinary course of business for the next twelve months. Item 3. Qualitative and Quantitative Disclosures about Market Risk Foreign Currency We have international operations in The Netherlands, Sweden, Germany, China, Portugal, Canada, Czech Republic, Mexico, the United Kingdom, and New Zealand which expose us to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations due to transactions denominated in Euros, Swedish Krona, Chinese Renminbi, Canadian dollar, Czech Krona, Mexican pesos, British Pound Sterling, and New Zealand

 dollar, respectively. We continuously evaluate our foreign currency risk, and we take action from time to time in order to best mitigate these risks. A hypothetical 10 change in the value of the U.S. dollar in relation to our most significant foreign currency exposures would have had an impact of approximately 4,213 on our sales for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. This amount is not indicative of the hypothetical net earnings impact due to partially offsetting impacts on cost of sales and operating expenses in those currencies. We estimate that foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations during the three months ended September 30, 2024 increased revenues in comparison to the three months ended September 30, 2023 by 641. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we estimate that foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations increased revenue by 155 in 2024 compared to 2023. We translate all assets and liabilities of our foreign operations, where the U.S. dollar is not the functional currency, at the period-end exchange rate and translate sales and expenses at the average exchange rates in effect during the period. The net effect of these translation adjustments is recorded in the condensed consolidated financial statements as comprehensive income. The translation adjustments were a gain of 5,805 and a loss of 2,923 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the translation adjustments were a gain of 235 and a loss of 1,995, respectively. Translation adjustments are not adjusted for income taxes as they relate to permanent investments in our foreign subsidiaries. A hypothetical 10 change in the value of the U.S. dollar in relation to our most significant foreign currency net assets would have had an impact of approximately 17,152 on our foreign net assets as of September 30, 2024. We have contracts to hedge our short-term balance sheet exposure, primarily intercompany, that are denominated in currencies (Euro, Mexican Peso, New Zealand Dollar, Chinese Renminbi, Swedish Krona) other than the subsidiary s functional currency and are adjusted to current values using period-end exchange rates. The resulting gains or losses are recorded in other expense, net in the consolidated statements of income and comprehensive income. To minimize foreign currency exposure, the Company had foreign currency contracts with notional amounts of 24,438 at September 30, 2024. The foreign currency contracts are recorded in the condensed consolidated balance sheets at fair value and resulting gains or losses are recorded in other expense, net in the condensed consolidated statements of income and comprehensive income. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, we recorded losses of 461 and 380 on foreign currency contracts which are included in other expense, net and generally offset the gains or losses from the foreign currency adjustments on the intercompany balances that are also included in other expense, net. Net foreign currency transaction gains and losses included in other expense, net amounted to losses of 1,388 and a loss of 257 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Interest Rates The Series A Notes under our 2024 Note Payable Agreement will bear interest at a fixed rate 5.96 and will mature on March 21, 2031. Interest on the Notes will be payable quarterly on the 21st day of March, June, September and December in each year, commencing on June 21, 2024. As amended on October 22, 2024, the Series A Notes will bear interest at 6.46 from October 1, 2024 through September 30, 2025. Interest will be computed on the basis of a 360-day year composed of twelve 30-day months. Interest rates on our Credit Facility are based on Term SOFR plus a margin of 1.25 to 2.50 (2.125 at September 30, 2024), depending on the Company s ratio of total funded indebtedness to consolidated EBITDA. As amended on October 22, 2024, borrowings under the Credit Facility will bear interest at Term SOFR plus a margin of 2.50 from January 1, 2025 through September 30, 2025. We use interest rate derivatives to add stability to interest expense and to manage our exposure to interest rate movements. We primarily use interest rate swaps as part of our interest rate risk management strategy. Interest rate swaps designated as cash flow hedges involve the receipt of variable amounts from a counterparty in exchange for the Company making fixed-rate payments over the life of the agreements without exchange of the underlying notional amount. In March 2020, the Company entered into two interest rate swaps with a combined notional amount of 20,000 that increased to 60,000 in March 2022 and matures in December 2024. In March 2022 the Company entered into an additional interest rate swap with a notional amount of 40,000 that matures in December 2026. In September 2024, the Company entered into an additional interest rate swap with a notional amount of 50,000 that matures in September 2027. As of September 30, 2024, we had 175,962 outstanding under the Revolving Facility (excluding deferred financing fees), of which 150,000 is currently being hedged. Refer to Note 10, Debt Obligations, of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information about our outstanding debt. A hypothetical one percentage point (100 basis points) change in the Base Rate on the 25,962 of unhedged floating rate debt outstanding at September 30, 2024 would have approximately a 200 impact on our interest expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2024.

 Item 4. Controls and Procedures Conclusion regarding the effectiveness of disclosure controls and procedures Our management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer (principal accounting officer), evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act )) as of September 30, 2024. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives and management necessarily applies its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures. Based on management s evaluation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of September 30, 2024, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that, as of such date, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective. Changes in internal control over financial reporting During the quarter ended September 30, 2024, there were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
