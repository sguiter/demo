 Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operation 

 Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 
 The following discussion and analysis summarizes the significant factors affecting our results of operations and financial condition during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 and should be read in conjunction with the information included under Item 1. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data (Unaudited elsewhere in this report. We prepare our financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States GAAP ). 
 PRESENTATION OF CERTAIN FINANCIAL AND OTHER INFORMATION 
 Non-GAAP Financial Measures 
 We present certain financial measures that are not prepared in accordance with GAAP or the accounting standards of any other jurisdiction and may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies. For a reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to their nearest comparable GAAP measures, see section Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures below. 
 These non-GAAP measures include, but are not limited to, Adjusted EBITDA, Net Working Capital and Capital Expenditures. 
 We define: 
 Adjusted EBITDA Income from operations before depreciation and amortization, stock-based compensation, and non-recurring items (such as, restructuring expenses, legal settlement gain, net loss due to assets misappropriation, etc.) plus Earnings in affiliated companies, net of tax. 
 Net Working Capital Inventories, net plus Accounts receivable, net minus Accounts payable. 
 Capital Expenditures Cash paid for the acquisition of property, plant and equipment. 
 Adjusted EBITDA is used by our chief operating decision maker CODM to evaluate our operating performance and to make decisions regarding allocation of capital, because it excludes the effects of items that have less bearing on the performance of our underlying core business. We use this measure, together with other measures of performance under GAAP, to compare the relative performance of operations in planning, budgeting and reviewing our business. We believe these measures are useful measures of financial performance in addition to Net income, Income from operations and other profitability measures under GAAP, because they facilitate operating performance comparisons from period to period. By eliminating potential differences in results of operations between periods caused by factors such as depreciation and amortization, historic cost and age of assets, financing and capital structures and taxation positions or regimes, we believe that Adjusted EBITDA provides a useful additional basis for evaluating and comparing the current performance of the underlying operations. In addition, we believe these non-GAAP measures aid investors by providing additional insight into our operational performance and help clarify trends affecting our business. 
 However, other companies and analysts may calculate non-GAAP financial measures differently, so making comparisons among companies on this basis should be done carefully. Non-GAAP measures are not performance measures under GAAP and should not be considered in isolation or construed as substitutes for Net sales, Net income, Income from operations, Gross profit and other GAAP measures as an indicator of our operations in accordance with GAAP.

 Operating Results Discussion 
 For the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to three months ended September 30, 2023 
 Net sales 
 Volume for the three months ended September 30, 2024 decreased in aggregate by 20.0 kmt to 225.2 kmt, year over year, due to lower volume in the Americas and Asia Pacific APAC regions, those were partially offset by higher volumes in Europe, the Middle East, and African region. 
 Net sales for the three months ended September 30, 2024 decreased by 2.8 million, or 0.6 , to 463.4 million, year over year, primarily driven by lower volume, partially offset by the favorable pass-through effect of oil prices. 
 Cost of sales 
 Cost of sales for the three months ended September 30, 2024 decreased by 0.1 million year over year. 
 Gross profit 
 Gross profit for the three months ended September 30, 2024 decreased by 2.7 million, or 2.5 , to 107.5 million, year over year. The decrease was driven primarily by higher fixed costs. 
 Selling, general and administrative expenses 
 Selling, general and administrative expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2024 increased by 2.3 million, or 4.1 to 57.9 million, year over year, driven by higher personnel costs.

 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 Historical Cash Flows 
 The tables below present our historical cash flows derived from our unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for the periods indicated. 
 Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 (In millions, except volume) Net cash provided by operating activities 30.8 273.7 Net cash used in investing activities (135.7) (111.0) Net cash provided by (used in) financing activities 119.3 (164.9) 
 2024 
 Net cash provided by operating activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 30.8 million. The cash provided by operating activities primarily reflects changes in working capital, 59.2 million Loss due to misappropriation of assets, net and professional fees of 1.5 million. Change in working capital includes 323.1 million sale of certain accounts receivables, discussed in Note B. Accounts Receivable to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. 
 Net cash used in investing activities in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 amounted to 135.7 million. The expenditures were primarily related to safety, maintenance and growth investments. 
 Net cash provided by financing activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 amounted to 119.3 million. These inflows primarily consisted of 68.7 million related to other short-term debt borrowings and 75.1 million, net borrowings under our ancillary credit facilities. Those were partially offset by scheduled debt repayments, dividend distributions and stock buybacks. 
 2023 
 Net cash provided by operating activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, amounted to 273.7 million. The cash provided by operating activities primarily reflects changes in working capital and higher Net income. Change in working capital includes 300.4 million sale of certain accounts receivables, discussed in Note B. Accounts Receivable to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. 
 Net cash used in investing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, amounted to 111.0 million. These expenditures were composed of a combination of safety, maintenance-related and growth investments, as well as 26.5 million of expenditures associated with our, now completed, installation of emissions reduction technology to meet EPA requirements in the U.S. 
 Net cash used in financing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, amounted to 164.9 million. These outflows primarily consisted of 88.7 million related to the reduction of other short-term debt, 58.9 million for repurchase of common stock under the Stock Repurchase Program and 23.7 million, net related to repayment of our ancillary credit facilities. 
 Sources of Liquidity 
 Our principal sources of liquidity are the net cash generated (i) from operating activities, primarily driven by our operating results and changes in working capital requirements and (ii) from financing activities, primarily driven by borrowing amounts available under our committed multicurrency, senior secured revolving credit facility (the RCF and related ancillary facilities, various uncommitted local credit lines, and, from time to time, term loan borrowings and Accounts receivable factoring. 
 During the third quarter of 2024, we were target of a criminal scheme that resulted in multiple fraudulently induced outbound wire transfers to accounts controlled by unknown third parties aggregating to 59.2 million. The business and operations of the Company were not affected. However, our Net leverage was negatively impacted. 
 We believe our anticipated future operating cash flows, the capacity under our existing credit facilities and uncommitted bilateral lines of credit, along with access to surety bonds, will be sufficient to finance our planned Capital expenditures, settle our commitments and contingencies and address our normal anticipated working capital needs for the foreseeable future.

 Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operation 

 As of September 30, 2024, the company had total liquidity of 209.4 million, including cash and equivalents of 53.2 million, 116.6 million availability under our revolving credit facility, including ancillary lines, and 39.6 million of capacity under other available credit lines. 
 Net working capital (A Non-GAAP Financial Measure) 
 We define Net working capital as the sum total of current Accounts receivable, net and Inventories, net less Accounts payable. Net working capital is a non-GAAP financial measure and other companies may use a similarly titled financial measure that is calculated differently from the way we calculate Net working capital. The following table sets forth the principal components of our Net working capital as of the dates indicated. 
 September 30, 2024 December 31, 2023 (In millions, except volume) Accounts receivable, net 267.9 241.0 Inventories, net 306.7 287.1 Accounts payable (174.7) (183.7) Net working capital 399.9 344.4 
 Our Net working capital position can vary significantly from month to month, mainly due to fluctuations in oil prices and receipts of carbon black oil shipments. In general, increases in the cost of raw materials lead to an increase in our Net working capital requirements, as our inventories and trade receivables increase as a result of higher carbon black oil prices and related sales levels. These increases are partially offset by related increases in trade payables. Due to the quantity of carbon black oil that we typically keep in stock, such increases in Net working capital occur gradually over a period of two to three months. Conversely, decreases in the cost of raw materials lead to a decrease in our Net working capital requirements over the same period of time. 
 Our Net working capital increased from 344.4 million as of December 31, 2023, to 399.9 million as of September 30, 2024. The primary working capital change drivers, year over year, were as follows: 
 Inventories, net Increase in production to meet forecasted demand resulted in increased raw material and finished goods inventory; and 
 Accounts receivable, net This increase was primarily driven by higher sales, partially offset by factoring of certain accounts receivables. Refer Note B. Accounts Receivable for discussion. 
 Those increases were partially offset by: 
 Accounts payable Decrease in accounts payable was primarily due to timing of payments, partially offset by higher production. 
 Capital expenditures (A Non-GAAP Financial Measure) 
 We define Capital expenditures as cash paid for the acquisition of property, plant and equipment. We plan to finance our Capital expenditures with cash generated by our operating activities and/or by utilizing existing debt capacity. We currently do not have any material commitments to make Capital expenditures and do not plan to make Capital expenditures outside the ordinary course of our business. 
 
 Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 
 As of September 30, 2024, we did not have any off-balance sheet arrangements.

 Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 
 Information about market risks for the period ended September 30, 2024 does not differ materially from Item 7A in our Annual Report in Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. 
 
 Item 4. Controls and Procedures 
 As of September 30, 2024, we carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures pursuant to Rule 13a-15 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. Based upon that evaluation, and as a result of the material weakness in internal control over financial reporting described below, our principal executive officer and our principal financial officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of that date. Notwithstanding this material weakness, our management has concluded that the financial statements included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report present fairly, in all material respects, our financial position, results of operations and cash flows in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles. To make that assertion our Audit Committee of the Board of Directors engaged a third-party to perform an investigation into the matter described below to identify the nature, timing and extent of the matter.

 Orion S.A. 

 Other than as reported in this Item 4, there were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the quarter ended September 30, 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 
 Material Weakness in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 We determined a material weakness exists over our control over manual wire transfers. Specifically, although we believe our internal controls, as designed, were adequate to prevent or detect unauthorized wire transfers, the control did not operate effectively to safeguard the Company s assets. 
 Remediation of Material Weakness in Internal Controls 
 To address the identified material weakness, management implemented the following remedial measures: 
 In the third quarter of 2024, we: 
 implemented additional processes and controls over the cash disbursement process, and 
 enhanced management s quarterly sub-certifications related to the cash disbursement process and increasing the certifiers awareness of its financial reporting implications. 
 In the future, we: 
 are improving our training of employees on appropriate cash disbursement practices and procedures, and 
 will continue to promote ethical conduct, timely escalation of concerns and communication with employees. 
 We will continue to assess whether additional control enhancements are necessary. We are actively working to implement effective internal control over financial reporting, which includes implementing these steps to remediate the material weakness. We believe these actions will effectively remediate our internal control over financial reporting and enhance our disclosure controls and procedures. The reliability of internal control processes requires repeatable execution and the identified material weakness will be considered fully remediated when these internal control enhancements have been in operation for a sufficient period of time for our management to conclude that the material weakness has been successfully remediated. However, such remediation is not guaranteed, and we cannot provide any assurance that our internal control over financial reporting will be effective as a result of these efforts.

 PART II 
 
 Item 1. Legal Proceedings 
 We become involved from time to time in various claims and lawsuits arising from special projects or in the ordinary course of our business, such as employment related claims or asbestos litigation. Some matters involve claims for large amounts of damages as well as other relief. We believe, based on currently available information, that the results of the proceedings we are subject to, in the aggregate, will not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, but may be material to our operating results and cash flows for any particular period when the relevant costs are incurred. We note that the outcome of legal proceedings is inherently uncertain, and we offer no assurances as to the outcome of any of these matters or their effect on the Company. 
 Information regarding our litigation and legal proceedings can be found in Note J. Commitments and Contingencies to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements, which is incorporated into this Item 1 by reference. 
 
 Item 1A. Risk Factors 
 There have been no material changes to risk factors associated with our business previously disclosed in Item A. Risk Factors in our Annual Report in Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. 
 
 Item 2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities, Use of Proceeds, and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities. 
 On May 5, 2023, our Board of Directors approved stock repurchase program with authorization to management to purchase up to approximately 6.9 million shares of our outstanding common stock from time to time through open market purchases or privately negotiated transactions or other transactions, including through the use of trading plans intended to qualify under Rule 10b5-1 and or Rule 10b-18 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, in accordance with applicable securities laws and other restrictions, at any time through June 2027 6.9 million of Common Stock Repurchase Program ). 
 The maximum number of shares of our common stock that may yet be purchased under the program is not necessarily an indication of the number of shares that will ultimately be purchased. The authorization may be suspended or discontinued at any time and does not obligate us to acquire any specific amount of common stock.
