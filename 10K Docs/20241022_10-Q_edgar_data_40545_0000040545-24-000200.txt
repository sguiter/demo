FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS. Our public communications and SEC filings may contain statements related to future, not past, events. These forward-looking statements often address our expected future business and financial performance and financial condition, and often contain words such as "expect," "anticipate," "intend," "plan," "believe," "seek," "see," "will," "would," "estimate," "forecast," "target," "preliminary," or "range." Forward-looking statements by their nature address matters that are, to different degrees, uncertain, such as statements about the impacts of macroeconomic and market conditions and volatility on our business operations, financial results and financial position; conditions affecting the aerospace and defense industry, including our customers and suppliers; our expected financial performance, including cash flows, revenues, margins, earnings and earnings per share; planned and potential transactions; our credit ratings and outlooks; our funding and liquidity; our businesses cost structures and plans to reduce costs; restructuring, impairment or other financial charges; or tax rates. 
 
 For us, particular areas where risks or uncertainties could cause our actual results to be materially different than those expressed in our forward-looking statements include: 
 
 changes in macroeconomic and market conditions and market volatility (including risks related to recession, inflation, supply chain constraints or disruptions, interest rates, values of securities and other financial assets, oil, jet fuel and other commodity prices and exchange rates), and the impact of such changes and volatility on our business operations and financial results; 
 global economic trends, competition and geopolitical risks, including impacts from the ongoing conflict between Russia and Ukraine and related sanctions and risks related to conflict in the Middle East; demand or supply shocks from events such as a major terrorist attack, war, natural disasters or actual or threatened public health pandemics or other emergencies; or an escalation of sanctions, tariffs or other trade tensions between the U.S. and China or other countries;

 2024 3Q FORM 10-Q 3 

ABOUT GE AEROSPACE. General Electric Company operates as GE Aerospace (GE Aerospace or the Company). GE Aerospace is a global aerospace leader with the industry's largest and growing commercial propulsion fleet. The Company s installed base of approximately 44,000 commercial and 26,000 military engines supports its aftermarket services business, representing approximately 70 of revenues. Through FLIGHT DECK, the Company's proprietary lean operating model, GE Aerospace is accelerating its lean progress, prioritizing safety, quality, delivery and cost, to drive focused execution and bridge strategy to results. We are focused on delivering against our strategic priorities of today (services and readiness), tomorrow (delivering the ramp) and the future (inventing next generation flight technology). Our global team is building on more than a century of innovation and learning, as we invent the future of flight, lift people up and bring them home safely. 
 
 On April 2, 2024, the Company completed the previously announced separation of its GE Vernova business into an independent publicly traded company, GE Vernova, Inc. (GE Vernova). In connection with the separation, the historical results of GE Vernova and certain assets and liabilities included in the separation are reported in our consolidated financial statements as discontinued operations. See Note 2 for further information. Upon separation, the Company now operates through two reportable segments: Commercial Engines Services and Defense Propulsion Technologies. See the Segment Operations section within Management's Discussion and Analysis and Note 23 for further information. 
 
 GE Aerospace s Internet address at www.geaerospace.com and Investor Relations website at www.geaerospace.com/investor-relations, as well as GE Aerospace s LinkedIn and other social media accounts, contain a significant amount of information about GE Aerospace, including financial and other information for investors. GE Aerospace encourages investors to visit these websites from time to time, as information is updated and new information is posted. 

MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (MD A). The consolidated financial statements of GE Aerospace are prepared in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). Unless otherwise noted, tables are presented in U.S. dollars in millions. Certain columns and rows within tables may not add due to the use of rounded numbers. Percentages presented in this report are calculated from the underlying numbers in millions. Discussions throughout this MD A are based on continuing operations unless otherwise noted. The MD A should be read in conjunction with the Financial Statements and Notes to the consolidated financial statements. 
 
 In the accompanying analysis of financial information, we sometimes use information derived from consolidated financial data but not presented in our financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP. Certain of these data are considered non-GAAP financial measures under SEC rules. See the Non-GAAP Financial Measures section for the reasons we use these non-GAAP financial measures and the reconciliations to their most directly comparable GAAP financial measures. 

CONSOLIDATED RESULTS 
 THIRD QUARTER 2024 RESULTS. Total revenues were 9.8 billion, up 0.5 billion for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023, driven primarily by an increase at Commercial Engines Services. 
 
 Continuing earnings (loss) per share was 1.56. Adjusted earnings per share was 1.15, excluding the results from our run-off Insurance business, separation, restructuring and other, and non-operating benefit costs, gains on retained and sold ownership interests, gains (losses) on purchases and sales of business interests and goodwill impairments. For the three months ended September 30, 2024, profit was 1.9 billion, with margins of 19.2 . Profit was up 1.6 billion compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023, driven by an increase in gains on retained and sold ownership interests of 1.5 billion, related to our GE HealthCare and AerCap investments, an increase in gains on sales of business interests of 0.4 billion, primarily related to the sale of our non-core licensing business, and an increase in segment profit of 0.2 billion. These increases were partially offset by increased restructuring and other charges of 0.3 billion and a goodwill impairment loss related to our Colibrium Additive reporting unit of 0.3 billion. Operating profit was 1.8 billion, with margins of 20.3 . Operating profit was up 0.2 billion, driven by an increase in segment profit of 0.2 billion. 
 
 Cash flows from operating activities (CFOA) were 4.5 billion and 3.4 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Cash flows from operating activities increased primarily due to higher net income (after adjusting for depreciation of property, plant, and equipment, amortization of intangible assets and non-cash (gains) losses related to our retained and sold ownership interests in GE HealthCare, AerCap and Baker Hughes), a decrease in income tax payments and an increase in sales discounts and allowances, partially offset by working capital growth. Free cash flows (FCF) were 4.6 billion and 3.5 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. FCF increased primarily due to higher net income, lower income tax payments and higher sales discounts and allowances accruals, partially offset by working capital growth, after adjusting for an increase in separation cash expenditures, which are excluded from FCF . See the Capital Resources and Liquidity - Statement of Cash Flows section for further information. 
 
 Remaining performance obligation (RPO) is unfilled customer orders for products and product services (expected life of contract sales for product services) excluding any purchase order that provides the customer with the ability to cancel or terminate without incurring a substantive penalty. See Note 23 for further information. 
 
 RPO September 30, 2024 December 31, 2023 Equipment 19,210 16,247 Services 146,879 137,756 Total RPO 166,089 154,003

 2024 3Q FORM 10-Q 4 

As of September 30, 2024 , RPO increased 12.1 billion, or 8 , from December 31, 2023, at Commercial Engines Services, as a result of engines contracted under long-term service agreements that have now been put into service and from equipment orders outpacing revenues recognized, and at Defense Propulsion Technologies, driven by Defense Systems equipment orders outpacing revenues recognized. 
 
 REVENUES Three months ended September 30 Nine months ended September 30 2024 2023 2024 2023 Equipment revenues 2,448 2,298 7,044 6,804 Services revenues 6,495 6,162 18,198 16,608 Insurance revenues 899 842 2,649 2,480 Total revenues 9,842 9,302 27,890 25,893 
 
 For the three months ended September 30, 2024 , total revenues increased 0.5 billion, or 6 , compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. Equipment revenues increased, driven by improved pricing. Services revenues increased, primarily due to an increase in spare parts volume and mix. 
 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 , total revenues increased 2.0 billion, or 8 , compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Equipment revenues increased, driven by favorable mix and improved pricing. Services revenues increased, primarily due to an increase in internal shop visit volume and spare parts, and improved pricing. 
 
 EARNINGS (LOSS) AND EARNINGS (LOSS) PER SHARE Three months ended September 30 Nine months ended September 30 (Per-share in dollars and diluted) 
 2024 2023 2024 2023 Continuing earnings (loss) attributable to common shareholders 1,705 215 4,766 7,970 Continuing earnings (loss) per share 1.56 0.20 4.34 7.25 
 
 For the three months ended September 30, 2024 , continuing earnings increased 1.5 billion compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023, driven by an increase in gains on retained and sold ownership interests of 1.5 billion, related to our GE HealthCare and AerCap investments, an increase in gains on sales of business interests of 0.4 billion, primarily related to the sale of our non-core licensing business, and an increase in segment profit of 0.2 billion. These increases were partially offset by an increase in restructuring and other charges of 0.3 billion and a goodwill impairment loss related to our Colibrium Additive reporting unit of 0.3 billion. Adjusted earnings were 1.3 billion, an increase of 0.2 billion, due to an increase in segment profit. 
 Profit was 1.9 billion, an increase of 1.6 billion. Profit margin was 19.2 , an increase of 1,560 basis points. Operating profit was 1.8 billion, an increase of 0.2 billion. Operating profit margin was 20.3 , an increase of 150 basis points. 
 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 , continuing earnings decreased 3.2 billion compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023, driven by a decrease in gains on retained and sold ownership interests of 4.6 billion, primarily related to our GE HealthCare and AerCap investments, an increase in restructuring and other charges of 0.3 billion and a goodwill impairment loss related to our Colibrium Additive reporting unit of 0.3 billion. These decreases were partially offset by an increase in segment profit of 0.9 billion, an increase in gains on sales of business interests of 0.5 billion, primarily related to the sale of our non-core licensing business, an increase in Insurance profit of 0.3 billion and the nonrecurrence of prior year preferred stock dividends of 0.3 billion. Adjusted earnings were 3.6 billion, an increase of 1.1 billion, due to an increase in segment profit of 0.9 billion and lower Adjusted Corporate Other operating costs . 
 Profit was 5.3 billion, a decrease of 3.4 billion. Profit margin was 19.1 , a decrease from 33.9 . Operating profit was 5.3 billion, an increase of 1.0 billion. Operating profit margin was 20.9 , an increase of 280 basis points. 
 
 Global material availability and supplier delivery performance continue to cause disruptions and have impacted our production and delivery of equipment and services to our customers. We are investing in our manufacturing facilities, overhaul facilities and our supply chain to increase production and strengthen yield in order to improve delivery to our customers. We continue to partner with our suppliers to improve material input, and work with our customers to calibrate future production rates. We are leveraging FLIGHT DECK and partnering with suppliers to improve material input and proactively managing the impact of inflationary pressure by driving cost productivity and adjusting the pricing of our products and services. We expect the impact of supply chain constraints and inflation will continue, and we are continuing to take action to mitigate the impacts. 
 
 Given the significant business we have with airframers and many airlines, challenges affecting the commercial aviation industry or key participants can adversely impact the demand for our products and services, the timing of orders, deliveries and related payments and other factors. We are monitoring the production and other challenges at The Boeing Company, including the ongoing strike, and we continue to align with them on production expectations and assess potential impacts to our business. The impacts from the strike to our revenues, earnings and cash flows for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 have not been significant.

SEGMENT OPERATIONS 
 
 COMMERCIAL ENGINES SERVICES . Our results in the third quarter of 2024 reflect robust demand for commercial air travel with departures up high-single digits year-to-date. We are in frequent communication with our airline, airframe, and maintenance, repair and overhaul (MRO) customers about the outlook for commercial air travel, new aircraft production, fleet retirements and after-market services, including shop visit and spare parts demand. 
 
 Internal shop visit output was relatively flat in the third quarter compared to the third quarter of 2023, while total engine deliveries decreased primarily due to supply chain constraints. We are investing in our manufacturing and overhaul facilities and are deploying engineering and supply chain resources to increase production, expand capacity and strengthen yield. 
 
 Total engineering investments, both company and partner-funded, increased compared to prior year. We remain committed to investing in developing and maturing technologies that enable a more sustainable future of flight. Notably, CFM International's Revolutionary Innovation for Sustainable Engines (RISE) program is a suite of pioneering technologies including Open Fan, compact core and hybrid electric systems for compatibility with alternative fuels. We recently shared that we are beginning to plan for dust ingestion tests on the Open Fan design. This is one of several initiatives underway to help invent the future of flight.

DEFENSE PROPULSION TECHNOLOGIES. Our results in the third quarter of 2024 reflect domestic and international government defense departments focus on modernizing and scaling their forces while continuing flight operations, driving services demand. A key underlying driver of our business is government funding, as most of the revenue in Defense Systems is derived from funding that flows through the U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) budget, or equivalent international budgets. National defense budgets are expected to grow in the U.S. in the low-single digits and internationally in the mid-single digits. In March 2024, Congress passed its defense funding bill for fiscal year 2024, which includes funding that supports our advanced engine development research, classified programs and product procurement and maintenance in other engine lines. 
 
 Additionally, the DoD is focused on advanced combat, enhancing platform capability and groundbreaking technology primarily in classified programs, including support for the next generation T901 turboshaft engine and advanced engine architectures. In June 2024, GE Aerospace delivered two T901-GE-900 engines to Sikorsky for integration and testing aboard a UH-60 Black Hawk as part of the U.S. Army upgrade program. In addition, GE Aerospace was awarded a 1.1 billion contract to provide T700 series turbine engines to the U.S. Army through the first half of 2029.

 For the three months ended September 30, 2024, segment revenues were up 2 and segment profit was down 18 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. 
 Revenues increased in P AT primarily from higher output at Avio Aero and improved pricing. The increase in P AT was partially offset by a decrease in D S revenues where improved pricing was more than offset by unfavorable engine mix and lower engine deliveries due to supply chain constraints. 
 Profit decreased primarily due to inflation in our supply chain, engine mix and incremental investments to support next generation products. 
 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, segment revenues were up 0.4 billion or 6 and segment profit was up 0.1 billion or 22 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 Revenues increased in both D S and P AT. D S revenues increased primarily due to services growth, improved pricing and an increase in development program revenues. This increase was partially offset by lower engine deliveries. P AT revenues increased, primarily due to higher output at Avio Aero and improved pricing. 
 Profit increased primarily due to services growth, improved pricing, more favorable equipment and services mix and prior year impacts from program costs. This increase was partially offset by incremental investments to support next generation products and lower deliveries of new engines. 

CORPORATE OTHER. Corporate Other revenues include our run-off Insurance operations revenues and the elimination of intersegment activities. Corporate Other operating profit includes Corporate functions and operations costs, certain costs of our principal retirement plans, significant, higher-cost restructuring programs, separation costs, insurance profit (loss), U.S. tax equity profit (loss), transition services agreements, environmental health and safety (EHS) impacts and other costs, as well as certain amounts that are not included in operating segment results because they are excluded from measurement of their operating performance for internal and external purposes.

 (a) Included costs of 328 million and 363 million for the settlement of the Sjunde AP-Fonden shareholder lawsuit for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively. See Note 22 for further information. 
 
 Adjusted Corporate Other operating costs excludes gains (losses) on purchases and sales of business interests, gains (losses) on retained and sold ownership interests and other equity securities, higher-cost restructuring programs, separation costs, our run-off Insurance operations, U.S. tax equity profit (loss) and goodwill impairments. We believe that adjusting Corporate Other costs to exclude the effects of items that are not closely associated with ongoing corporate operations provides management and investors with a meaningful measure that increases the period-to-period comparability of our ongoing corporate costs. 
 
 For the three months ended September 30, 2024 , revenues decreased compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023, primarily due to higher intersegment eliminations. Corporate Other operating costs decreased by 1.4 billion due to 1.5 billion of higher gains on retained and sold ownership interests and other equity securities, related to our GE HealthCare and AerCap investments, 0.4 billion of gains on sales of business interests, primarily related to the sale of our non-core licensing business, 0.1 billion of lower separation costs and 0.1 billion of higher Insurance profit, partially offset by 0.3 billion of higher restructuring and other costs and 0.3 billion of goodwill impairments, related to our Colibrium Additive reporting unit. 
 Adjusted Corporate Other operating costs decreased primarily due to a reduction in our structural costs and favorability from higher bank interest, partially offset by higher intersegment eliminations primarily resulting from additional intercompany engine parts sales volume. 
 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 , revenues decreased by 0.2 billion compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023, primarily due to higher intersegment eliminations, partially offset by an increase in our run-off Insurance operations revenues. Corporate Other operating profit decreased by 4.2 billion due to 4.6 billion of lower gains on retained and sold ownership interests and other equity securities, primarily related to our GE HealthCare and AerCap investments, 0.4 billion of higher restructuring and other charges, and 0.3 billion of goodwill impairments, related to our Colibrium Additive reporting unit, partially offset by 0.5 billion of higher gains on sales of business interests, primarily related to the sale of our non-core licensing business and prior year valuation allowance losses related to the planned sale of the Electric Insurance business, 0.3 billion of higher insurance profit and 0.1 billion of lower separation costs. 
 Adjusted Corporate Other operating costs decreased by 0.2 billion primarily due to a reduction in our structural costs and favorability from higher bank interest, partially offset by higher intersegment eliminations primarily resulting from additional intercompany engine parts sales volume. 

OTHER CONSOLIDATED INFORMATION 
 RESTRUCTURING AND SEPARATION COSTS. Significant, higher-cost restructuring programs are excluded from measurement of segment operating performance for internal and external purposes; those excluded amounts are reported in Restructuring and other charges for Corporate Other. In addition, we incur costs associated with separation activities, which are also excluded from measurement of segment operating performance for internal and external purposes. See Note 19 for further information on restructuring and separation costs. 
 
 INTEREST AND OTHER FINANCIAL CHARGES were 0.3 billion for both the three months and 0.8 billion for both the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The primary components of interest and other financial charges are interest on short- and long-term borrowings.

POSTRETIREMENT BENEFIT PLANS . Refer to Note 13 for information about our pension and retiree benefit plans. 
 
 INCOME TAXES. For the three months ended September 30, 2024 , the effective income tax rate was 10.5 compared to 7.8 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. 
 
 The provision for income taxes was 0.2 billion and an insignificant amount for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The increase in the tax provision was primarily due to a decrease in tax benefit associated with separation activities and an increase in tax expense due to higher pre-tax income excluding gains and losses on our retained and sold ownership interests for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. 
 
 For the three months ended September 30, 2024, the adjusted effective income tax rate was 20.3 compared to 19.2 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The adjusted provision (benefit) for income taxes was 0.3 billion and 0.3 billion for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The change in the tax provision was primarily due to the tax effect of the increase in adjusted earnings before taxes for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. 
 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 , the effective income tax rate was 10.6 compared to 5.6 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. See Note 15 for further information. 
 
 The provision for income taxes was 0.6 billion and 0.5 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The increase in the tax provision was primarily due to an increase in tax expense due to higher pre-tax income excluding gains and losses on our retained and sold ownership interests for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023, partially offset by an increase in tax benefits associated with separation activities and equity compensation. 
 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the adjusted effective income tax rate was 20.4 compared to 20.8 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The adjusted provision (benefit) for income taxes was 0.9 billion and 0.7 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The increase in the tax provision was primarily due to the tax effect of the increase in adjusted earnings before taxes partially offset by an increase in tax benefit associated with equity compensation for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 
 DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS primarily comprise our former GE Vernova and GE HealthCare businesses, our mortgage portfolio in Poland (Bank BPH) and other trailing assets and liabilities associated with prior dispositions. Results of operations, financial position and cash flows for these businesses are reported as discontinued operations for all periods presented and the notes to the financial statements have been adjusted on a retrospective basis. See Note 2 for further information regarding our businesses in discontinued operations. 

CAPITAL RESOURCES AND LIQUIDITY 
 FINANCIAL POLICY . GE Aerospace is committed to maintaining strong investment grade ratings with a disciplined capital allocation strategy. The Company will continue to invest in future growth and innovation through research and development and capital expenditures. We intend to return a majority of our free cash flow to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. Merger and acquisition investments will be pursued in a disciplined way and focused on those that offer strategic, operational and financial synergies. 
 
 LIQUIDITY POLICY. We maintain a strong focus on liquidity and define our liquidity risk tolerance based on sources and uses to maintain a sufficient liquidity position to meet our business needs and financial obligations under both normal and stressed conditions. We believe that our consolidated liquidity and availability under our revolving credit facilities will be sufficient to meet our liquidity needs. 
 
 CONSOLIDATED LIQUIDITY. Our primary sources of liquidity consist of cash and cash equivalents, free cash flows from our operating businesses, and access to capital markets. If needed, we can also draw from short-term borrowing facilities, including revolving credit facilities. Cash generation can be subject to variability based on many factors, including seasonality, receipt of down payments on large equipment orders, timing of billings on long-term contracts, timing of customer allowances and market conditions. Total cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash was 13.7 billion at September 30, 2024, of which 4.6 billion was held in the U.S. and 9.1 billion was held outside the U.S. 
 
 Cash held in non-U.S. entities has generally been reinvested in active foreign business operations; however, substantially all of our unrepatriated earnings were subject to U.S. federal tax and, if there is a change in reinvestment, we would expect to be able to repatriate available cash (excluding amounts held in countries with currency controls) without additional federal tax cost. Any foreign withholding tax on a repatriation to the U.S. would potentially be partially offset by a U.S. foreign tax credit. 
 
 Cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash at September 30, 2024 included 0.4 billion of cash held in countries with currency control restrictions. Cash held in countries with currency controls represents amounts held in countries that may restrict the transfer of funds to the U.S. or limit our ability to transfer funds to the U.S. without incurring substantial costs. Excluded from cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash was 1.4 billion of cash in our run-off Insurance business, which was classified as All other assets in the Statement of Financial Position.

As part of the spin-off of GE HealthCare completed in the first quarter of 2023, we retained an approximately 19.9 stake of GE HealthCare common stock upon the spin. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we received total proceeds of 4.1 billion from the disposition of 48.3 million shares of GE HealthCare. As of September 30, 2024, our remaining interest in GEHC investment is 13.3 million shares (2.9 ownership interest). We intend to exit our remaining stake in GE HealthCare in an orderly manner. See Notes 3 and 18 for further information. 
 
 Following approval of a statutory permitted accounting practice in 2018 by our primary insurance regulator, the Kansas Insurance Department (KID), we have since provided a total of 15.0 billion of capital contributions to our insurance subsidiaries, including the final contribution of 1.8 billion in the first quarter of 2024. See Note 12 for further information. 
 
 On March 7, 2024, the Company announced that the Board of Directors had authorized the repurchase of up to 15.0 billion of our common stock, which replaced our previous 3.0 billion share repurchase authorization. Under this program, shares may be repurchased on the open market, under accelerated share repurchase programs, or under plans complying with rules 10b5-1 and 10b-18 as amended. In connection with this authorization, we repurchased 19.6 million shares for 3.3 billion through September 30, 2024. 
 
 BORROWINGS. Consolidated total borrowings were 19.9 billion and 20.5 billion at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively, a decrease of 0.6 billion, mainly due to maturities. In April 2024, the Company replaced its previous 10.0 billion syndicated credit facility with a five-year unsecured revolving credit facility in an aggregate committed amount of 3.0 billion. 
 
 CREDIT RATINGS AND CONDITIONS. We have relied, and may continue to rely, on the short- and long-term debt capital markets to fund, among other things, a significant portion of our operations. The cost and availability of debt financing is influenced by our credit ratings. Moody s Investors Service (Moody s), and Standard and Poor s Global Ratings (S P) currently issue ratings on our short- and long-term debt. Fitch, which previously issued ratings on us, affirmed our BBB+ long term rating and F1 short-term rating and subsequently withdrew its ratings on us on September 13, 2024 at our request. Our credit ratings as of the date of this filing are set forth in the table below. 
 
 Moody's S P Outlook Positive Stable Short term P-2 A-2 Long term Baa1 BBB+ 
 
 Our ratings may be subject to a revision or withdrawal at any time by the assigning rating organization, and each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating. 
 
 Substantially all of the Company's debt agreements in place at September 30, 2024 do not contain material credit rating covenants. Our unused back-up revolving syndicated credit facility contain a customary net debt-to-EBITDA financial covenant, which we satisfied at September 30, 2024. 
 
 FOREIGN EXCHANGE RISK. As a result of our global operations, we generate and incur a small portion of our revenues and expenses in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. Such principal currencies include the euro, the British Sterling pound, and Brazilian real. The effect of foreign currency fluctuations on earnings was immaterial. See Note 20 for further information about our risk exposures, our use of derivatives, and the effects of this activity on our financial statements. 

STATEMENT OF CASH FLOWS 
 CASH FLOWS FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS. The most significant source of cash in CFOA is customer-related activities, the largest of which is collecting cash resulting from product or services sales. The most significant operating use of cash is to pay our suppliers, employees, tax authorities and postretirement plans. 
 
 Cash from operating activities was 4.5 billion in nine months ended September 30, 2024, an increase of 1.1 billion compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023, primarily due to: an increase in net income (after adjusting for depreciation of property, plant, and equipment, amortization of intangible assets and non-cash (gains) losses related to our retained and sold ownership interests in GE HealthCare, AerCap and Baker Hughes) driven by all segments, a decrease in income tax payments, an increase in sales discounts and allowances, primarily due to higher spare parts shipments, partially offset by working capital growth. The components of All other operating activities included: 
 
 Nine months ended September 30 2024 2023 Increase (decrease) in employee benefit liabilities 45 328 Net restructuring and other charges/(cash expenditures) 283 (24) (Gains) losses on purchases and sales of business interests (377) 107 Net interest and other financial charges/(cash paid) 18 (133) Other deferred assets (89) 159 Other 15 6 All other operating activities (105) 444 
 
 2024 3Q FORM 10-Q 10 

The cash impacts from changes in working capital was (0.6) billion, a decrease of 0.9 billion compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023, due to: current receivables of (0.6) billion, driven by higher volume partially offset by higher collections, including increased collections from CFM International; inventories, including deferred inventory, of (0.2) billion, driven by higher material purchases and lower liquidations primarily due to output challenges; current contract assets, contract liabilities and current deferred income were flat, driven by higher revenue recognition, offset by higher billings and net unfavorable changes in estimated profitability; progress collections of 0.2 billion, driven by higher collections; and accounts payable of (0.2) billion, driven by higher disbursements related to purchases of materials in prior periods partially offset by higher volume. 
 
 Cash used for investing activities was 0.9 billion in the nine months ended September 30, 2024, an increase of 5.8 billion compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023, primarily due to: higher cash paid related to net settlements between our continuing operations and businesses in discontinued operations of 3.7 billion, primarily related to the separation of GE Vernova of 2.0 billion in 2024 and lower cash received of 1.1 billion related to the separation of GE HealthCare in 2023 (components of All other investing activities); a decrease in proceeds of 3.0 billion from the disposition of our remaining retained ownership interests in AerCap and Baker Hughes of 4.8 billion in 2023, partially offset by an increase in proceeds of 1.9 billion from GE HealthCare. These increases in cash used were partially offset by lower net purchases of insurance investment securities of 0.5 billion and proceeds from the dispositions of our non-core licensing business and Electric Insurance Company of 0.5 billion. Cash used for additions to property, plant and equipment and internal-use software, which are components of free cash flows , was 0.8 billion and 0.6 billion in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. 
 
 Cash used for financing activities was 4.5 billion in the nine months ended September 30, 2024, a decrease of 5.7 billion compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023, primarily due to: cash paid for redemption of GE preferred stock of 5.8 billion in 2023; lower net debt maturities of 2.5 billion; and an increase in cash received of 1.1 billion from stock option exercises (a component of All other financing activities); partially offset by an increase in treasury stock repurchases of 3.2 billion and higher dividends paid to shareholders of 0.2 billion. 
 
 CASH FLOWS FROM DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS 
 Cash used for operating activities of discontinued operations was 1.1 billion in the nine months ended September 30, 2024, a decrease of 0.2 billion compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023, primarily driven by lower net losses from our former GE Vernova business and disbursements for purchases of materials and separation costs incurred by our former GE HealthCare business in 2023. 
 
 Cash used for investing activities of discontinued operations was 1.1 billion in the nine months ended September 30, 2024, a decrease of 1.5 billion compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023, primarily driven by higher cash received of 3.7 billion from net settlements between our discontinued operations and businesses in continuing operations, due to cash received of 2.0 billion in 2024 related to the separation of our former GE Vernova business and cash paid of 1.1 billion in 2023 related to the separation of our former GE HealthCare business. In addition, there was a decrease in cash used due to the prior year separation of GE HealthCare cash and cash equivalents of 1.8 billion. These decreases in cash used were partially offset by a reduction of cash and cash equivalents of 4.2 billion due to the separation of GE Vernova in 2024. 
 
 Cash used for financing activities of discontinued operations was 0.1 billion in the nine months ended September 30, 2024, a decrease of 2.0 billion compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023, primarily driven by GE HealthCare's long-term debt issuance of 2.0 billion in connection with the spin-off in 2023. 

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES. Please refer to the Critical Accounting Estimates and Other Items sections within MD A and Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 for a discussion of our accounting policies and critical accounting estimates. 

OTHER ITEMS 
 INSURANCE. Our 2024 annual review of future policy benefit reserves cash flow assumptions resulted in an immaterial charge to net earnings, indicating claims experience continues to develop consistently with our models. The sensitivities with respect to the impact of changes of key cash flow assumptions underlying our future policy benefit reserves included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, have not materially changed. See Capital Resources and Liquidity and Notes 3 and 12 for further information related to our run-off insurance operations. 

NEW ACCOUNTING STANDARDS. In November of 2023, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued ASU No. 2023-07, Segment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures . The amendments are intended to increase reportable segment disclosure requirements primarily through enhanced disclosures about significant segment expenses. The ASU is effective on a retrospective basis for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023, and interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024. We are currently evaluating the impact of this guidance on the disclosures within our consolidated financial statements. 
 
 In December 2023, the FASB issued ASU No. 2023-09, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures . The amendments require disclosure of specific categories in the rate reconciliation and provide additional information for reconciling items that meet a quantitative threshold and further disaggregation of income taxes paid for individually significant jurisdictions. The ASU is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024, with early adoption permitted. We are currently evaluating the impact that this guidance will have on the disclosures within our consolidated financial statements.

GE VERNOVA PARENT COMPANY GUARANTEES. To support GE Vernova in selling products and services globally, the Company often entered into contracts on behalf of GE Vernova or issued parent company guarantees or trade finance instruments supporting the performance of what were subsidiary legal entities transacting directly with customers, in addition to providing similar credit support for non-customer related activities of GE Vernova (collectively, GE Aerospace credit support ). Prior to the spin-off in the second quarter of 2024, GE Vernova had been working to seek novation or assignment of GE Aerospace credit support, the majority of which relates to parent company guarantees, associated with GE Vernova legal entities from GE Aerospace to GE Vernova. For GE Aerospace credit support that remains outstanding post-spin, GE Vernova is obligated to use reasonable best efforts to terminate or replace and obtain a full release of the Company s obligations and liabilities under, all such credit support. Beginning in 2025, GE Vernova will pay a quarterly fee to the Company based on amounts related to the GE Aerospace credit support, for which we have recorded a stand ready to perform obligation. GE Vernova will face other contractual restrictions and requirements while the Company continues to be obligated under such credit support on behalf of GE Vernova. While the Company will remain obligated under the contract or instrument, GE Vernova will be obligated to indemnify the Company for credit support related payments that the Company is required to make. 
 
 As of September 30, 2024, we estimated GE Vernova RPO and other obligations that relate to GE Aerospace credit support to be approximately 21 billion, an over 60 reduction since year end, of which, approximately 0.6 billion are financial guarantees. We expect, approximately 12 billion of the of RPO related to GE Aerospace credit support obligations to contractually mature within five years from the date of spin-off and credit support on financial guarantees to not exceed a year beyond separation. The Company s maximum aggregate exposure under the GE Aerospace credit support cannot be reasonably estimated given the breadth of the portfolio across each of the GE Vernova businesses. The underlying obligations are predominantly customer contracts that GE Vernova performs in the course of its business. We have no known instances historically where payments or performance from us were required under parent company guarantees relating to GE Vernova customer contracts. See Note 22 for additional details regarding guarantees. 

NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES. We believe that presenting non-GAAP financial measures provides management and investors useful measures to evaluate performance and trends of the total company and its businesses. This includes adjustments in recent periods to GAAP financial measures to increase period-to-period comparability following actions to strengthen our overall financial position and how we manage our business. In addition, management recognizes that certain non-GAAP terms may be interpreted differently by other companies under different circumstances. In various sections of this report we have made reference to the following non-GAAP financial measures in describing our (1) revenues, specifically, Adjusted revenues, (2) profit, specifically, Operating profit and Operating profit margin; Adjusted earnings (loss); Adjusted earnings (loss) per share (EPS) and Adjusted effective income tax rate, and (3) cash flows, specifically free cash flows (FCF). The reasons we use these non-GAAP financial measures and the reconciliations to their most directly comparable GAAP financial measures follow.

We believe that adjusting profit to exclude the effects of items that are not closely associated with ongoing operations provides management and investors with a meaningful measure that increases the period-to-period comparability. Gains (losses) and restructuring and other items are impacted by the timing and magnitude of gains associated with dispositions, and the timing and magnitude of costs associated with restructuring and other activities. We also use Operating profit as a performance metric at the company level for our annual executive incentive plan for 2024.

(b) Includes tax benefits available to offset the tax on gains (losses) on equity securities. (c) Includes related tax valuation allowances. Earnings-per-share amounts are computed independently. As a result, the sum of per-share amounts may not equal the total. The service cost for our pension and other benefit plans are included in Adjusted earnings , which represents the ongoing cost of providing pension benefits to our employees. The components of non-operating benefit costs are mainly driven by capital allocation decisions and market performance. We believe the retained cost in Adjusted earnings and the Adjusted effective income tax rate provides management and investors a useful measure to evaluate the performance of the total company and increases period-to-period comparability. We also use Adjusted EPS as a performance metric at the company level for our performance stock units granted in 2024.

We believe this measure will better allow management and investors to evaluate the capacity of our operations to generate free cash flows. We also use FCF as a performance metric at the company level for our annual executive incentive plan and performance stock units granted in 2024.

DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS primarily comprise our former GE Vernova and GE HealthCare businesses, our mortgage portfolio in Poland (Bank BPH) and other trailing assets and liabilities associated with prior dispositions. Results of operations, financial position and cash flows for these businesses are reported as discontinued operations for all periods presented and the notes to the financial statements have been adjusted on a retrospective basis. 
 
 GE Vernova. On April 2, 2024, we completed the previously announced separation of GE Vernova. The separation was structured as a tax-free spin-off and was achieved through the Company's pro-rata distribution of all the outstanding shares of GE Vernova to holders of the Company's common stock. In connection with the GE Vernova separation, the historical results of GE Vernova and certain assets and liabilities included in the separation are reported in GE Aerospace consolidated financial statements as discontinued operations. In addition, the Company contributed million of cash to fund GE Vernova s future operations such that GE Vernova s cash balance on the date of separation was million.

million to GE Vernova, primarily related to engine sales and parts. We collected net cash of million related to the transition services agreement and sales of engines and parts. 
 
 GE HealthCare . On January 3, 2023, we completed the previously announced separation of our HealthCare business, into a separate, independent, publicly traded company, GE HealthCare Technologies Inc. (GE HealthCare). The separation was structured as a tax-free spin-off and was achieved through the Company's pro-rata distribution of approximately of the outstanding shares of GE HealthCare to holders of the Company's common stock. In connection with the separation, the historical results of GE HealthCare and certain assets and liabilities included in the separation are reported in GE Aerospace consolidated financial statements as discontinued operations. 
 
 We have continuing involvement with GE HealthCare primarily through a transition services agreement, through which GE Aerospace and GE HealthCare continue to provide certain services to each other for a period of time following the separation, a tax matters agreement and a trademark licensing agreement. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we collected net cash of million related to these activities. 
 
 Bank BPH . As previously reported, Bank BPH, along with other Polish banks, has been subject to ongoing litigation in Poland related to its portfolio of floating rate residential mortgage loans, with cases brought by individual borrowers seeking relief related to their foreign currency indexed or denominated mortgage loans in various courts throughout Poland. As previously reported, a settlement program was adopted and we recorded a charge of million in the quarter ended June 30, 2023. The estimate of total losses for borrower litigation at Bank BPH was million and million as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. In order to maintain appropriate regulatory capital levels, during the year ended December 31, 2023, we made the previously reported non-cash capital contributions in the form of intercompany loan forgiveness of million; incremental contributions from GE Aerospace were required during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. For further information about factors that are relevant to the estimate of total losses for borrower litigation at Bank BPH, see Note 22. Future changes or adverse developments could increase our estimate of total losses and potentially require future cash contributions to Bank BPH. 
 
 The Bank BPH financing receivable portfolio is recorded at the lower of cost or fair value, less cost to sell, which reflects market yields and estimates with respect to ongoing borrower litigation. At September 30, 2024, the total portfolio had carrying value, net of a valuation allowance. Earnings (loss) related to ongoing borrower litigation were in pre-tax charges for both the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, and and million in pre-tax charges for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively.

 The amortized cost of debt securities excludes accrued interest of million and million at September 30, 2024, and December 31, 2023, respectively , which is reported in All other current assets. 
 
 The estimated fair value of investment securities at September 30, 2024 decreased since December 31, 2023, primarily due to share sales of our GE HealthCare equity interest, partially offset by new investments and higher investment values, due to lower market yields at Insurance and an increase in the mark to market effect on our equity interest in GE HealthCare, due to a higher stock price. 
 
 Total estimated fair value of debt securities in an unrealized loss position were million and million, of which million and million had gross unrealized losses of ) million and ) million and had been in a loss position for 12 months or more at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. Gross unrealized losses at September 30, 2024 included ) million related to commercial mortgage-backed securities (CMBS) collateralized by pools of commercial mortgage loans on real estate, and ) million related to asset-backed securities. The majority of our CMBS and asset-backed securities in an unrealized loss position have received investment-grade credit ratings from the major rating agencies. The majority of our U.S. and Non-U.S. corporate securities' gross unrealized losses were in the consumer, electric, technology and insurance industries. For our securities in an unrealized loss position, the losses are not indicative of credit losses, we currently do not intend to sell the investments, and it is not more likely than not that we will be required to sell the investments before recovery of their amortized cost basis.

 The majority of our equity securities are classified within Level 1 and the majority of our debt securities are classified within Level 2, as their valuation is determined based on significant observable inputs. Investments with a fair value of million and million are classified within Level 3, as significant inputs to their valuation models are unobservable at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively.

NOTE 7. 
 Goodwill impairments ) ) Goodwill adjustments(a) Balance at September 30, 2024 
 
 (a) Goodwill adjustments are primarily related to foreign currency exchange. 
 
 Also in conjunction with the GE Vernova separation, the composition of our reporting units for evaluation of goodwill impairment has changed. As a result, we allocated goodwill among new and realigned reporting units using a relative fair value approach and performed assessments for the new reporting units. We assess the possibility that a reporting unit s fair value has been reduced below its carrying amount due to the occurrence of events or circumstances between annual impairment testing dates. We performed an interim impairment test at our Colibrium Additive reporting unit within our Defense Propulsion Technologies segment given declines in the additive manufacturing industry due to slower adoption of technology, which incorporated a combination of income and market valuation approaches. The results of the analysis indicated that the carrying value of the reporting unit was in excess of fair value and therefore we recorded a non-cash impairment loss of million in Goodwill impairments in our Statement of Earnings (Loss). After the impairment charges there is no remaining goodwill in the reporting unit. Colibrium Additive is a critical business for current and future technology at GE Aerospace as we continue to focus on where it can create the most value.

The tax rate for 2024 was reduced compared to the U.S. statutory rate of 21 primarily due to separation income tax benefit associated with an increase in net state deferred tax assets that are likely to be utilized after the spin of GE Vernova, U.S. business tax credit benefits, and gains associated with our retained and sold ownership interests, which we expect to recover without tax. The low tax rate for 2023 was reduced compared to the U.S. statutory rate of 21 primarily due to gains associated with our retained and sold ownership interests, which we expect to recover without tax, U.S. business credits, and net tax benefit related to separation income tax effects including losses on separation-related entity restructuring.

 Assets and liabilities that are reflected in the accompanying financial statements at fair value are not included in the above disclosures; such items include cash and cash equivalents, investment securities and derivative financial instruments. 
 
 DERIVATIVES AND HEDGING. Our policy requires that derivatives are used solely for managing risks and not for speculative purposes. We use derivatives to manage currency risks related to foreign exchange, interest rate and currency risk between financial assets and liabilities, and certain equity investments and commodity prices. 
 
 We use cash flow hedges primarily to reduce or eliminate the effects of foreign exchange rate changes, net investment hedges to hedge investments in foreign operations as well as fair value hedges to hedge the effects of interest rate and currency changes on debt we issued. We also use derivatives not designated as hedges from an accounting standpoint (and therefore we do not apply hedge accounting to the relationship) but otherwise serve the same economic purpose as other hedging arrangements. We use economic hedges when we have exposures to currency exchange risk for which we are unable to meet the requirements for hedge accounting or when changes in the carrying amount of the hedged item are already recorded in earnings in the same period as the derivative making hedge accounting unnecessary. Even though the derivative is an effective economic hedge, there may be a net effect on earnings in each period due to differences in the timing of earnings recognition between the derivative and the hedged item.

NOTE 21. million and million and liabilities of million and million at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively, in consolidated Variable Interest Entities (VIEs).

The increase in investments in unconsolidated VIEs in our run-off insurance operations reflects strategic initiatives to invest in higher-yielding asset classes. Our maximum exposure to loss in respect of unconsolidated VIEs is increased by our commitments to make additional investments in these entities described in Note 22.

Additionally, we have committed to provide financing assistance of million for future customer acquisitions of aircraft equipped with our engines. See Note 21 for further information regarding VIEs. 
 
 GUARANTEES . Credit support and indemnification agreements - Continuing Operations. Following the separation of GE Vernova, we have remaining performance and bank guarantees on behalf of GE Vernova. To support GE Vernova in selling products and services globally, we often entered into contracts on behalf of GE Vernova or issued parent company guarantees or trade finance instruments supporting the performance of what were subsidiary legal entities transacting directly with customers, in addition to providing similar credit support for non-customer related activities of GE Vernova (collectively, "GE Aerospace credit support"). Under the Separation and Distribution Agreement (SDA), GE Vernova is obligated to use reasonable best efforts to replace us as the guarantor on or terminate all such credit support instruments. Until such termination or replacement, in the event of non-fulfillment of contractual obligations by the relevant obligor(s), we could be obligated to make payments under the applicable instruments. Under the SDA, GE Vernova is obligated to reimburse and indemnify us for any such payments. Beginning in 2025, GE Vernova will pay us a quarterly fee based on amounts related to the GE Aerospace credit support. We have recorded a reserve of million for our stand ready to perform obligation. Our maximum aggregate exposure under the GE Aerospace credit support cannot be reasonably estimated given the breadth of the portfolio across each of the GE Vernova businesses except for certain financial guarantees and trade finance instruments with a maximum exposure of approximately million, which are not expected to exceed a year beyond separation. The underlying obligations are predominantly customer contracts that GE Vernova performs in the normal course of its business. We have no known instances historically where payments or performance were required by us under parent company guarantees relating to GE Vernova customer contracts. In connection with the spin-off of GE Vernova, under terms of the SDA, Transition Service Agreement (TSA) and Tax Matters Agreement (TMA), we have an obligation to indemnify GE Vernova for certain of its severance costs, environmental matters and tax matters of million, of which million is reserved. 
 
 We also have remaining obligations under the TMA with GE HealthCare to indemnify them for certain tax costs and other indemnifications of million which are fully reserved. 
 
 In addition, we have million of other indemnification commitments, including representations and warranties in sales of business assets, for which we recorded a liability of million.

 GE Aerospace also has obligations under the TSA and TMA to indemnify GE HealthCare for certain technology and tax costs of million which are fully reserved. 
 
 We also have provided specific indemnities to other buyers of assets of our business that, in the aggregate, represent a maximum potential claim of million with related reserves of million. 
 
 PRODUCT WARRANTIES. We provide for estimated product warranty expenses when we sell the related products. Because warranty estimates are forecasts that are based on the best available information, mostly historical claims experience, claims costs may differ from amounts provided. The liability for product warranties was million at September 30, 2024 and million at December 31, 2023. 
 
 LEGAL MATTERS. The following information supplements and amends the discussion of Legal Matters in Note 24 to the consolidated financial statements in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, Note 23 to the consolidated financial statements in our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2024 and Note 22 to the consolidated financial statements in our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended June 30, 2024; refer to those discussions for information about previously reported legal matters that are not updated below. In the normal course of our business, we are involved from time to time in various arbitrations, class actions, commercial litigation, investigations and other legal, regulatory or governmental actions, including the significant matters described below that could have a material impact on our results of operations. In many proceedings, including the specific matters described below, it is inherently difficult to determine whether any loss is probable or even reasonably possible or to estimate the size or range of the possible loss, and accruals for legal matters are not recorded until a loss for a particular matter is considered probable and reasonably estimable. Given the nature of legal matters and the complexities involved, it is often difficult to predict and determine a meaningful estimate of loss or range of loss until we know, among other factors, the particular claims involved, the likelihood of success of our defenses to those claims, the damages or other relief sought, how discovery or other procedural considerations will affect the outcome, the settlement posture of other parties and other factors that may have a material effect on the outcome. For these matters, unless otherwise specified, we do not believe it is possible to provide a meaningful estimate of loss at this time. Moreover, it is not uncommon for legal matters to be resolved over many years, during which time relevant developments and new information must be continuously evaluated. 
 
 Shareholder and related lawsuits. Since November 2017, several putative shareholder class actions under the federal securities laws were filed against GE and certain affiliated individuals and consolidated into a single action currently pending in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York (the Hachem case, also referred to as the Sjunde AP-Fonden case). The complaint against defendants GE and current and former GE executive officers alleged violations of Sections 10(b) and 20(a) and Rule 10b-5 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 related to insurance reserves and accounting for long-term service agreements and seeks damages on behalf of shareholders who acquired GE stock between February 27, 2013 and January 23, 2018. GE filed a motion to dismiss in December 2019. In January 2021, the court granted the motion to dismiss as to the majority of the claims. Specifically, the court dismissed all claims related to insurance reserves, as well as all claims related to accounting for long-term service agreements, with the exception of certain claims about historic disclosures related to factoring in the Power business that survive as to GE and its former CFO Jeffrey S. Bornstein. All other individual defendants have been dismissed from the case. In April 2022, the court granted the plaintiffs' motion for class certification for shareholders who acquired stock between February 26, 2016 and January 23, 2018. In September 2022, GE filed a motion for summary judgment on the plaintiffs' remaining claims, which the court denied in September 2023, except as to claims arising from disclosures made between November 2017 and January 2018. In April 2024, the court scheduled a trial date for November 2024. In October 2024, we reached an agreement in principle with the plaintiffs to settle the matter for million. Final settlement of the matter is subject to court approval. 
 
 Since February 2018, multiple shareholder derivative lawsuits were filed against current and former GE executive officers and members of GE s Board of Directors and GE (as nominal defendant). These lawsuits have alleged violations of securities laws, breaches of fiduciary duties, unjust enrichment, waste of corporate assets, abuse of control and gross mismanagement, although the specific matters underlying the allegations in the lawsuits have varied. shareholder derivative lawsuits are currently pending: the Lindsey and Priest/Tola cases, which were filed in New York state court. The allegations in these cases relate to substantially the same facts as those underlying the Sjunde AP-Fonden case. The plaintiffs seek unspecified damages and improvements in GE s corporate governance and internal procedures. The Lindsey case has been stayed by agreement of the parties, and GE filed a motion to dismiss the Priest/Tola complaint in March 2021. In August 2024, the plaintiffs in the Priest/Tola case filed an amended consolidated complaint asserting substantially the same claims as in the prior derivative actions, and the Company plans to file a motion to dismiss this amended complaint.

million in the quarter ended June 30, 2023. The estimate of total losses for borrower litigation at Bank BPH was million and million as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. The estimate accounts for the costs of payments to borrowers who we estimate will participate in the settlement program, as well as estimates for the results of litigation with other borrowers, which in either case can exceed the value of the current loan balance, and represents our best estimate of the total losses we expect to incur over time informed by experience since adopting the program. However, there are a number of factors that could affect the estimate in the future; refer to the disclosure about Bank BPH in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. 
 
 ENVIRONMENTAL, HEALTH AND SAFETY MATTERS . Our operations involve or have involved the use, disposal and cleanup of substances regulated under environmental protection laws, including activities for a variety of matters related to GE businesses that have been discontinued or exited. We record reserves for obligations for ongoing and future environmental remediation activities, such as the Housatonic River cleanup, and for additional liabilities we expect to incur in connection with previously remediated sites, such as natural resource damages for the Hudson River where GE completed dredging in 2019. Additionally, like many other industrial companies, we and our subsidiaries are defendants in various lawsuits related to alleged exposure by workers and others to asbestos or other hazardous materials. Liabilities for environmental remediation and worker exposure claims exclude possible insurance recoveries. It is reasonably possible that our exposure will exceed amounts accrued. However, due to uncertainties about the status of laws, regulations, technology and information related to individual sites and lawsuits, such amounts are not reasonably estimable. Total reserves related to environmental remediation and worker exposure claims were million and million at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. 

NOTE 23. 
 
 reportable segments and operating segments. Operating segments are aggregated into a reportable segment if the operating segments have similar quantitative economic characteristics and if the operating segments are similar in the following qualitative characteristics: (i) nature of products and services; (ii) nature of production processes; (iii) type or class of customer for their products and services; (iv) methods used to distribute the products or provide services; and (v) if applicable, the nature of the regulatory environment. We have aggregated Defense Systems and Propulsion Additive Technology into one reportable segment, Defense Propulsion Technologies, based on similarity in economic characteristics, other qualitative factors and the objectives and principals of ASC 280, Segment Reporting . This is consistent with how our chief operating decision maker (CODM) allocates resources and makes decisions. Refer to our quarterly report on form 10-Q for the period ended June 30, 2024 for a description of our segments. Refer to our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, for further information regarding our determination of segment profit for continuing operations, and for our allocations of corporate costs to our segments.
