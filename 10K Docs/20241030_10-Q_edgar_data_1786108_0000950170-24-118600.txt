Trinity Capital s common stock began trading on the Nasdaq Global Select Market on January 29, 2021, under the symbol TRIN in connection with its initial public offering of shares of its common stock IPO ).

of the equity interests of Trinity Capital Holdings. There has been no activity in Trinity Capital Holdings since acquisition. As permitted under Regulation S-X and consistent with the guidance in ASC 946-810-45-3, the Company will generally not consolidate its investment in a company other than an investment company subsidiary or a controlled operating company whose business consists of providing services to the Company. The Company does not consolidate the Adviser Sub because it is not an investment company as defined in ASC 946 and provides investment advisory services exclusively to the Adviser Funds with ownership by one or more unrelated third-party investors ("External Parties"). The Company does not consolidate the JV or EPT 16 as the Company does not hold a majority of the ownership or economic interests of such entities, and the Company's representatives do not comprise

, based on fair value, of the Company s investments in these portfolio companies are considered Level 3 assets under ASC 820 because there is known or accessible market or market index for these investment securities to be traded or exchanged. Transfers between levels, if any, are recognized at the beginning of the period in which the transfers occur. The Company uses an internally developed portfolio investment rating system in connection with its investment oversight, portfolio management and analysis, and investment valuation procedures. This system takes into account both quantitative and qualitative factors of the portfolio companies. Due to the inherent uncertainty of determining the fair value of investments that do not have a readily available market value, the fair value of the Company s investments may fluctuate from period to period. Because of the inherent uncertainty of valuation, these estimated values may differ significantly from the values that would have been reported had a ready market for the investments existed, and it is reasonably possible that the difference could be material. Debt Securities The debt securities identified on the Consolidated Schedule of Investments are secured loans and equipment financings made to growth-stage companies. For portfolio investments in debt securities for which the Company has determined that third-party quotes or other independent pricing are not available, the Company generally estimates the fair value based on the assumptions that hypothetical market participants would use to value the investment in a current hypothetical sale using an income approach.

Escrow balances are measured for collectability on at least a quarterly basis and fair value is determined based on the amount of the estimated recoverable balances and the contractual maturity date.

million and million, respectively, in dividend income. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, the Company recorded million and million, respectively, in dividend income. Fee and Other Income The Company recognizes one-time fee income, including, but not limited to, structuring fees, prepayment penalties, and exit fees related to a change in ownership of the portfolio company, as other income when earned. These fees are generally earned when the portfolio company enters into an equipment financing arrangement or pays off their outstanding indebtedness prior to the scheduled maturity. In addition, fee income may include fees for originations and administrative agent services rendered by the Company to the JV. Such fees are earned in the period that the services are rendered. Non-Accrual Policy When a debt security becomes or more past due, or if management otherwise does not expect that principal, interest, and other obligations due will be collected in full, the Company will generally place the debt security on non-accrual status and cease recognizing interest income on that debt security until all principal and interest due has been paid or the Company believes the borrower has demonstrated the ability to repay its current and future contractual obligations. Any uncollected interest is reversed from income in the period that collection of the interest receivable is determined to be doubtful. However, the Company may make exceptions to this policy if the investment has sufficient collateral value and is in the process of collection. As of September 30, 2024, loans to portfolio companies and equipment financings to portfolio company were on non-accrual status, with a total cost of approximately million, and a total fair value of approximately million, or , of the fair value of the Company s debt investment portfolio. As of December 31, 2023 , loans to portfolio companies and equipment financings to portfolio companies were on non-accrual status, with a total cost of approximately million, and a total fair value of approximately million, or , of the fair value of the Company s debt investment portfolio. Net Realized Gains / (Losses) Realized gains / (losses) are measured by the difference between the net proceeds from the sale or redemption of an investment or a financial instrument and the cost basis of the investment or financial instrument, without regard to unrealized appreciation or depreciation previously recognized, and includes investments written off during the period net of recoveries and realized gains or losses from in-kind redemptions. Net proceeds exclude any prepayment penalties, exit fees, and OID and EOT acceleration. Prepayment penalties and exit fees received at the time of sale or redemption are included in fee income on the Consolidated Statements of Operations. OID and EOT acceleration is included in interest income on the Consolidated Statements of Operations. Net Change in Unrealized Appreciation / (Depreciation) Net change in unrealized appreciation / (depreciation) reflects the net change in the fair value of the investment portfolio and financial instruments and the reclassification of any prior period unrealized appreciation or depreciation on exited investments and financial instruments to realized gains or losses.

 of its investment company taxable income (which generally includes its net ordinary taxable income and realized net short-term capital gains in excess of realized net long-term capital losses) and of its net tax-exempt income (if any). The Company generally will not be subject to U.S. federal income tax on these distributed amounts but will pay U.S. federal income tax at corporate rates on any retained amounts. The Company evaluates tax positions taken in the course of preparing the Company s tax returns to determine whether the tax positions are more-likely-than-not to be sustained by the applicable tax authority in accordance with ASC 740, Income Taxes ASC 740 , as modified by ASC 946. Tax benefits of positions not deemed to meet the more-likely-than-not threshold, or uncertain tax positions, would be recorded as tax expense in the current year. It is the Company s policy to recognize accrued interest and penalties related to uncertain tax benefits in income tax expense. The Company has material uncertain tax positions as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. All the Company s tax returns remain subject to examination by U.S. federal and state tax authorities. Based on federal excise distribution requirements applicable to RICs, the Company will be subject to a nondeductible federal excise tax on undistributed taxable income and gains unless the Company distributes in a timely manner an amount at least equal to the sum of (1) of its ordinary income for each calendar year, (2) of capital gain net income (both long-term and short-term) for the one-year period ending October 31 in that calendar year and (3) any income or gain realized, but not distributed, in the preceding years. For this purpose, however, any ordinary income or capital gain net income retained by the Company and on which the Company paid corporate income tax is considered to have been distributed. The Company, at its discretion, may determine to carry

excise tax on the amount by which it falls short of this calendar-year distribution requirement. If the Company chooses to do so, this generally will increase expenses and reduce the amount available to be distributed to stockholders. The Company will accrue excise tax on estimated undistributed taxable income and capital gains as required on an annual basis. 

s from the original investment date. Certain of the debt securities are covenant-lite loans, which generally are loans that do not have a complete set of financial maintenance covenants and have covenants that are incurrence-based, meaning they are only tested and can only be breached following an affirmative action of the borrower rather than by a deterioration in the borrower s financial condition. The equipment financings in the investment portfolio generally have fixed interest rates. The secured loans in the investment portfolio generally have floating interest rates subject to interest rate floors. Both equipment financings and secured loans generally include an EOT payment. The specific terms of each debt security vary depending on the creditworthiness of the portfolio company and the projected value of the financed assets. Companies with stronger creditworthiness may receive an initial period of lower financing factor, which is analogous to an interest-only period on a traditional term loan. Equipment financings may include upfront interim payments and security deposits. Equipment financing arrangements have various structural protections, including customary default penalties, information and reporting rights, material adverse change or investor abandonment provisions, consent rights for any additions or changes to senior debt, and, as needed, intercreditor agreements with cross-default provisions to protect the Company s second lien positions. Warrant Investments In connection with the Company s debt investments, the Company may receive warrants in the portfolio company. Warrants received in connection with a debt investment typically include a potentially discounted contract price to exercise, and thus, as a portfolio company appreciates in value, the Company may achieve additional investment return from this equity interest. The warrants typically contain provisions that protect the Company as a minority-interest holder, as well as secured or unsecured put rights, or rights to sell such securities back to the portfolio company, upon the occurrence of specified events. In certain cases, the Company may also obtain follow-up rights in connection with these equity interests, which allow the Company to participate in future financing rounds.

Certain Risk Factors In the ordinary course of business, the Company manages a variety of risks, including market risk, credit risk and liquidity risk. The Company identifies, measures and monitors risk through various control mechanisms, including investment limits and diversifying exposures and activities across a variety of instruments, markets and counterparties. Market risk is the risk of potential adverse changes to the value of financial instruments because of changes in market conditions, including as a result of changes in the credit quality of a particular issuer, credit spreads, interest rates, and other movements and volatility in security prices or commodities. In particular, the Company may invest in issuers that are experiencing or have experienced financial or business difficulties (including difficulties resulting from the initiation or prospect of significant litigation or bankruptcy proceedings), which involves significant risks. The Company manages its exposure to market risk through the use of risk management strategies and various analytical monitoring techniques.

(1) The significant unobservable inputs used in the fair value measurement of the Company s debt securities are hypothetical market yields and premiums/(discounts). The hypothetical market yield is defined as the exit price of an investment in a hypothetical market to hypothetical market participants where buyers and sellers are willing participants. The significant unobservable inputs used in the fair value measurement of the Company s equity and warrant securities are revenue multiples and portfolio company specific adjustment factors. Additional inputs used in the option pricing model OPM include industry volatility, risk free interest rate and estimated time to exit. Significant increases (decreases) in the inputs in isolation would result in a significantly higher (lower) fair value measurement, depending on the materiality of the investment. For some investments, additional consideration may be given to data from the last round of financing, merger or acquisition events near the measurement date. 

 (2) Weighted averages are calculated based on the fair value of each investment.

Additional inputs used in the option pricing model OPM include industry volatility, risk free interest rate and estimated time to exit. Significant increases (decreases) in the inputs in isolation would result in a significantly higher (lower) fair value measurement, depending on the materiality of the investment. For some investments, additional consideration may be given to data from the last round of financing, merger or acquisition events near the measurement date.

of its investment company taxable income (which generally includes its net ordinary taxable income and realized net short-term capital gains in excess of realized net long-term capital losses) and of its net tax-exempt income (if any). The Company generally will not be subject to U.S. federal income tax on these distributed amounts, but will pay U.S. federal income tax at corporate rates on any retained amounts. The amount of taxable income to be paid out as a distribution is determined by the Board each quarter and is generally based upon the annual earnings estimated by management of the Company. Net capital gains, if any, are distributed at least annually, although the Company may decide to retain all or some of those capital gains for investment and pay U.S. federal income tax at corporate rates on those retained amounts. If the Company chooses to do so, this generally will increase expenses and reduce the amount available to be distributed to stockholders. In the event the Company s taxable income (including any net capital gains) for a fiscal year falls below the amount of distributions declared and paid with respect to that year, however, a portion of the total amount of those distributions may be deemed a return of capital for tax purposes to the Company s stockholders. Because federal income tax regulations differ from GAAP, distributions in accordance with tax regulations may differ from net investment income and realized gains recognized for financial reporting purposes. Differences may be permanent or temporary in nature. Permanent differences are reclassified among capital accounts in the financial statements to reflect their appropriate tax character. Temporary differences arise when certain items of income, expense, gain or loss are recognized at some time in the future. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, million and million, respectively, was recorded for U.S. federal excise tax.

Our History 
 Trinity Capital Inc. was incorporated under the general corporation laws of the State of Maryland on August 12, 2019 and commenced operations on January 16, 2020. Prior to January 16, 2020, we had no operations, except for matters relating to our formation and organization as a BDC. 
 On January 16, 2020, through a series of transactions, we acquired Trinity Capital Investment, LLC, Trinity Capital Fund II, L.P., Trinity Capital Fund III, L.P., Trinity Capital Fund IV, L.P., and Trinity Sidecar Income Fund, L.P. (collectively, the "Legacy Funds") and all of their respective assets, including their respective investment portfolios, as well as Trinity Capital Holdings, LLC, a holding company whose subsidiaries managed and/or had the right to receive fees from certain of the Legacy Funds. In order to complete these transactions, we used a portion of the proceeds from our private equity offering and private debt offering that occurred on January 16, 2020. 
 On February 2, 2021, we completed our initial public offering of 8,006,291 shares of our common stock at a price of 14.00 per share, inclusive of the underwriters option to purchase additional shares, which was exercised in full. Our common stock began trading on the Nasdaq Global Select Market on January 29, 2021 under the symbol TRIN. Proceeds from this offering were primarily used to pay down a portion of our existing indebtedness outstanding. 
 On December 5, 2022, the Company entered into a joint venture agreement with certain funds and accounts managed by a specialty credit manager to co-manage Senior Credit Corp 2022 LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (the JV ). The JV invests in secured loans and equipment financings to growth-stage companies that have been originated by the Company. 
 On March 16, 2023, the Company formed an unconsolidated wholly owned subsidiary, Trinity Capital Adviser LLC, a Delaware limited liability company Adviser Sub ). The Company was granted exemptive relief by the SEC that permits the Company to organize, acquire, wholly own and operate the Adviser Sub as an investment adviser registered under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, as amended (the Adviser Act ). The Adviser Sub may provide investment advisory and related services to one or more investment vehicles (the Adviser Funds with ownership by one or more unrelated third-party investors and receive fee income for such services. 
 On June 28, 2024, the Company and a specialty credit manager funded a portion of their respective capital commitments to commence operations of a credit fund, EPT 16 LLC, a Delaware limited liability company EPT 16 ). EPT 16 has acquired and intends to acquire, hold and, as applicable, dispose of investments that have been originated by the Company. 
 Critical Accounting Estimates and Policies 
 The preparation of our financial statements in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses. Changes in the economic environment, financial markets and any other parameters used in determining such estimates could cause actual results to differ materially. Our critical accounting estimates, including those relating to valuation of investments and income recognition, are described below. Please refer to Note 2 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for a discussion of our significant accounting policies. 
 Valuation of Investments 
 The most significant estimate inherent in the preparation of the Company s consolidated financial statements is the valuation of investments and the related amounts of unrealized appreciation and depreciation of investments recorded. The Company s investments are carried at fair value in accordance with the 1940 Act and Accounting Standards Codification ASC 946, Financial Services Investment Companies ASC 946 and measured in accordance with ASC 820, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures ASC 820 ). ASC 820 defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value, establishes a fair value hierarchy based on the observability of inputs used to measure fair value, and provides disclosure requirements for fair value measurements. ASC 820 requires the Company to assume that each of the portfolio investments is sold in a hypothetical transaction in the 
 103 

Table of Contents 

principal or, as applicable, most advantageous market using market participant assumptions as of the measurement date. Market participants are defined as buyers and sellers in the principal market that are independent, knowledgeable and willing and able to transact. The Company values its investments at fair value as determined in good faith by the Company s Board of Directors (the Board in accordance with the provisions of ASC 820 and the 1940 Act. 
 The SEC adopted Rule 2a-5 under the 1940 Act Rule 2a-5 ), which establishes a framework for determining fair value in good faith for purposes of the 1940 Act. As adopted, Rule 2a-5 permits boards of directors to designate certain parties to perform fair value determinations, subject to board oversight and certain other conditions. The SEC also adopted Rule 31a-4 under the 1940 Act Rule 31a-4 ), which provides the recordkeeping requirements associated with fair value determinations. While the Company's Board has not elected to designate a valuation designee, the Company has adopted certain revisions to its valuation policies and procedures to comply with the applicable requirements of Rule 2a-5 and Rule 31a-4. 
 While the Board is ultimately and solely responsible for determining the fair value of the Company s investments, the Company has engaged independent valuation firms to provide the Company with valuation assistance with respect to its investments. The Company engages independent valuation firms on a discretionary basis. Specifically, on a quarterly basis, the Company identifies portfolio investments with respect to which an independent valuation firm assists in valuing certain investments. The Company selects these portfolio investments based on a number of factors, including, but not limited to, the potential for material fluctuations in valuation results, size, credit quality and the time lapse since the last valuation of the portfolio investment by an independent valuation firm. 
 Investments recorded on our Consolidated Statements of Assets and Liabilities are categorized based on the inputs to the valuation techniques as follows: 
 Level 1 Investments whose values are based on unadjusted quoted prices for identical assets in an active market that the Company has the ability to access (examples include investments in active exchange-traded equity securities and investments in most U.S. government and agency securities). 
 Level 2 Investments whose values are based on quoted prices in markets that are not active or model inputs that are observable either directly or indirectly for substantially the full term of the investment. 
 Level 3 Investments whose values are based on prices or valuation techniques that require inputs that are both unobservable and significant to the overall fair value measurement (for example, investments in illiquid securities issued by privately held companies). These inputs reflect management s own assumptions about the assumptions a market participant would use in pricing the investment. 
 Given the nature of lending to venture capital-backed growth-stage companies, substantially all of the Company s investments in these portfolio companies are considered Level 3 assets under ASC 820 because there is no known or accessible market or market indexes for these investment securities to be traded or exchanged. The Company uses an internally developed portfolio investment rating system in connection with its investment oversight, portfolio management and analysis and investment valuation procedures. This system takes into account both quantitative and qualitative factors of the portfolio companies. Due to the inherent uncertainty of determining the fair value of investments that do not have a readily available market value, the fair value of the Company s investments may fluctuate from period to period. Because of the inherent uncertainty of valuation, these estimated values may differ significantly from the values that would have been reported had a ready market for the investments existed, and it is reasonably possible that the difference could be material. 
 Fair value estimates are made at discrete points in time based on relevant information. These estimates may be subjective in nature and involve uncertainties and matters of significant judgment and, therefore, cannot be determined with precision. The carrying amounts of the Company s financial instruments, consisting of cash, investments, receivables, payables and other liabilities approximate the fair values of such items due to the short-term nature of these instruments.

Income Recognition 
 The Company recognizes interest income on an accrual basis and recognizes it as earned in accordance with the contractual terms of the loan agreement to the extent that such amounts are expected to be collected. Original issue discount OID initially includes the estimated fair value of detachable warrants obtained in conjunction with the origination of debt securities, and is accreted into interest income over the term of the loan as a yield enhancement based on the effective yield method. Interest income from payment-in-kind PIK represents contractually deferred interest added to the loan balance recorded on an accrual basis to the extent such amounts are expected to be collected. 
 In addition, the Company may also be entitled to an end-of-term EOT payment. EOT payments to be paid at the termination of the debt agreement are accreted into interest income over the contractual life of the debt based on the effective yield method. When a portfolio company pre-pays their indebtedness prior to the scheduled maturity date, the acceleration of the unaccreted OID and EOT is recognized as interest income. 
 Income related to application or origination payments, including facility commitment fees, net of related expenses and generally collected in advance, are accreted into interest income over the contractual life of the loan. The Company recognizes nonrecurring fees and additional OID and EOT received in consideration for contract modifications commencing in the quarter relating to the specific modification. 
 The Company records dividend income on an accrual basis to the extent amounts are expected to be collected. Dividend income is recorded when dividends are declared by the portfolio company or at such other time that an obligation exists for the portfolio company to make a distribution. During three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company recorded 0.5 million and 1.0 million, respectively, in dividend income. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, the Company recorded 0.1 million and 0.1 million, respectively, in dividend income. 
 The Company recognizes one-time fee income, including, but not limited to, structuring fees, prepayment penalties, and exit fees related to a change in ownership of the portfolio company, as other income when earned. These fees are generally earned when the portfolio company enters into an equipment financing arrangement or pays off their outstanding indebtedness prior to the scheduled maturity. In addition, fee income may include fees for originations and administrative agent services rendered by the Company to the JV. Such fees are earned in the period that the services are rendered.

 Debt Investments on Non-Accrual Status 
 When a debt security becomes 90 days or more past due, or if our management otherwise does not expect that principal, interest, and other obligations due will be collected in full, we will generally place the debt security on non-accrual status and cease recognizing interest income on that debt security until all principal and interest due has been paid or we believe the borrower has demonstrated the ability to repay its current and future contractual obligations. Any uncollected interest is reversed from income in the period that collection of the interest receivable

is determined to be doubtful. However, we may make exceptions to this policy if the investment has sufficient collateral value and is in the process of collection. 
 As of September 30, 2024, loans to three portfolio companies and equipment financings to two portfolio company were on non-accrual status with a total cost of approximately 47.2 million, and a total fair value of approximately 22.2 million, or 1.4 , of the fair value of the Company s debt investment portfolio. As of December 31, 2023, loans to three portfolio companies and equipment financings to two portfolio companies were on non-accrual status with a total cost of approximately 60.8 million, and a total fair value of approximately 43.2 million, or 3.5 , of the fair value of the Company s debt investment portfolio.

The increase in interest expense for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily due to increased borrowings and increased base rate under our credit facility with KeyBank, National Association (the KeyBank Credit Facility ). 
 Employee Compensation and Benefits 
 Employee compensation and benefits totaled approximately 11.5 million and 8.7 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and 31.3 million and 24.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The increase in employee compensation expenses for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 relates primarily to the increased variable compensation related to a higher headcount and stock-based compensation.

 Professional fees expenses, consisting of legal fees, accounting fees, third-party valuation fees, and talent acquisition fees, totaled approximately 1.3 million and 1.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and 3.4 million and 4.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The decrease in professional fees expenses for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 resulted primarily from a decrease in legal fees, third-party valuation fees and other consulting fees. 
 General and Administrative Expenses 
 General and administrative expenses include insurance premiums, rent, state taxes and various other expenses related to our ongoing operations. Our general and administrative expenses totaled approximately 2.2 million and 1.7 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and 6.2 million and 4.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The increase in general and administrative expenses for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily due to additional office rent and related expenses.

Our primary use of our funds includes investments in portfolio companies, payments of interest on our outstanding debt, and payments of fees and other operating expenses we incur. We also expect to use our funds to pay distributions to our stockholders. We have used, and expect to continue to use, our borrowings, including under the KeyBank Credit Facility or any future credit facility, as well as proceeds from the turnover of our portfolio, to finance our investment objectives and activities. 
 From time to time, we may enter into additional credit facilities, increase the size of our existing KeyBank Credit Facility, or issue additional securities in private or public offerings. Any such incurrence or issuance would be subject to prevailing market conditions, our liquidity requirements, contractual and regulatory restrictions, and other factors. 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we experienced a net increase in cash and cash equivalents in the amount of 3.8 million, which is the net result of 339.4 million of cash provided by financing activities, offset by 335.3 million of cash used in operating activities and 0.3 million of cash used in investing activities. During the nine months ended September 30, 2023, we experienced a net decrease in cash and cash equivalents in the amount of 3.4 million, which is the net result of 41.3 million of cash used in financing

activities and 2.2 million of cash used in investing activities, offset by 40.1 million of cash provided by operating activities. 
 As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we had cash and cash equivalents of 8.5 million and 4.8 million, respectively, of which 0.9 million and 3.1 million, respectively, was held in the Goldman Sachs Financial Square Government Institutional Fund. Cash held in demand deposit accounts may exceed the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation FDIC insured limit and therefore is subject to credit risk. All of the Company s cash deposits are held at large established high credit quality financial institutions, and management believes that the risk of loss associated with any uninsured balances is remote. 
 As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we had approximately 220.0 million and 137.0 million, respectively, of available borrowings under the KeyBank Credit Facility, subject to its terms and regulatory requirements. Cash and cash equivalents, taken together with available borrowings under the KeyBank Credit Facility, as of September 30, 2024, are expected to be sufficient for our investing activities and to conduct our operations in the near term and long term. 
 Refer to Note 5 Borrowings in the notes to our consolidated financial statements included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for additional information, including a discussion of our borrowings. 
 Asset Coverage Requirements 
 In accordance with the 1940 Act, with certain limited exceptions, we are only allowed to incur borrowings, issue debt securities or issue preferred stock, if immediately after the borrowing or issuance, the ratio of total assets (less total liabilities other than indebtedness) to total indebtedness plus preferred stock, is at least 150 . On September 27, 2019, the Board, including a required majority (as such term is defined in Section 57(o) of the 1940 Act) and our initial stockholder approved the application to us of the 150 minimum asset coverage ratio set forth in Section 61(a)(2) of the 1940 Act. As a result, we are permitted to potentially borrow 2 for investment purposes of every 1 of investor equity. As of September 30, 2024, our asset coverage ratio was approximately 182.0 and our asset coverage ratio per unit was approximately 1,820. As of December 31, 2023, our asset coverage ratio was approximately 194.7 and our asset coverage ratio per unit was approximately 1,947. 
 Commitments and Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 
 The Company has entered into a capital commitment with each of the JV and EPT 16 to fund capital contributions through June 2026 in the amount of 21.4 million and 10.0 million, respectively. As of September 30, 2024, unfunded commitments were 3.0 million and 6.0 million for the JV and EPT 16, respectively. As of September 30, 2024, the Company also had unfunded commitments of approximately 25.0 million to one portfolio company. As of December 31, 2023, unfunded commitments were 10.4 million for the JV. The Company did not have any other off-balance sheet financings or liabilities as of September 30, 2024 or December 31, 2023. 
 The Company s commitments and contingencies consist primarily of unfunded commitments to extend credit in the form of loans to the Company s portfolio companies. A portion of these unfunded contractual commitments as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 are dependent upon the portfolio company reaching certain milestones before the debt commitment becomes available. Furthermore, the Company s credit agreements with its portfolio companies generally contain customary lending provisions that allow the Company relief from funding obligations for previously made commitments in instances where the underlying portfolio company experiences materially adverse events that affect the financial condition or business outlook for the company. Since a portion of these commitments may expire without being drawn, unfunded contractual commitments do not necessarily represent future cash requirements. As such, the Company s disclosure of unfunded contractual commitments includes only those which are available at the request of the portfolio company and unencumbered by milestones. The Company will fund future unfunded commitments from the same sources it uses to fund its investment commitments that are funded at the time they are made (which are typically through existing cash and cash equivalents and borrowings under the KeyBank Credit Facility).

In the normal course of business, the Company enters into contracts that provide a variety of representations and warranties, and general indemnifications. Such contracts include those with certain service providers, brokers and trading counterparties. Any exposure to the Company under these arrangements is unknown as it would involve future claims that may be made against the Company; however, based on the Company s experience, the risk of loss is remote and no such claims are expected to occur. As such, the Company has not accrued any liability in connection with such indemnifications.

Shares of BDCs may trade at a market price that is less than the value of the net assets attributable to those shares. At times, our shares of common stock have traded at prices both above and below our net asset value per share. The possibility that our shares of common stock will trade at a discount from net asset value per share or at premiums that are unsustainable over the long term are separate and distinct from the risk that our net asset value per share will decrease. It is not possible to predict whether our common stock will trade at, above, or below net asset value per share.

Item 3. Quantitative a nd Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk

Hedging 
 We do not currently engage in any hedging activities. However, we may, in the future, hedge against interest rate and currency exchange rate fluctuations by using standard hedging instruments such as futures, options and forward contracts subject to the requirements of the 1940 Act. While hedging activities may insulate us against adverse changes in interest rates, they may also limit our ability to participate in benefits of lower interest rates with respect to our portfolio of investments with fixed interest rates. We may also borrow funds in local currency as a way to hedge our non-U.S. denominated investments.

Certain capitalized and other terms used in this Agreement are defined in Schedule A and, for purposes of this Agreement, the rules of construction set forth in Section 22.4 shall govern. 
 The Series A Notes, together with each Series of Additional Notes which may from time to time be issued pursuant to the provisions of Section 2.2, are collectively referred to as the Notes (such term shall also include any such notes as amended, restated or otherwise modified from time to time pursuant to Section 17 and including any such notes issued in substitution therefor pursuant to Section 13). 
 	Section 1.2.	Changes in Interest Rate. (a) If at any time a Below Investment Grade Event occurs, then: 
 	(i)	as of the date of the occurrence of a Below Investment Grade Event to and until the date on which such Below Investment Grade Event is no longer continuing (as evidenced by the receipt and delivery to the holders of the Notes of any Debt Rating

 necessary to cure such Below Investment Grade Event), the directly affected Notes shall bear interest at the Below Investment Grade Adjusted Interest Rate and 
 	(ii)	the Company shall promptly, and in any event within twenty (20) Business Days after a Below Investment Grade Event has occurred, notify the holders of the Notes in writing, sent in the manner provided in Section 18, that a Below Investment Grade Event has occurred and confirming the effective date of the Below Investment Grade Event and that the Below Investment Grade Adjusted Interest Rate will accrue from the date on which such Below Investment Grade Event shall have occurred and will be payable on each subsequent interest payment date until such Below Investment Grade Event is no longer continuing in consequence thereof. 
 	(b)	The reasonable, documented fees and expenses of any Acceptable Rating Agency and all other costs incurred in connection with obtaining, affirming or appealing a Debt Rating pursuant to this Section 1.2 shall be borne solely by the Company. 
 	(c)	If at any time a Secured Debt Ratio Event occurs, then: 
 	(i)	as of the earlier of (x) the date of the occurrence of a Secured Debt Ratio Event and (y) the last day of the applicable fiscal quarter or fiscal year for which financial statements delivered pursuant to Section 7.1 or Section 7.2 evidence the occurrence of a Secured Debt Ratio Event to and until the date on which such Secured Debt Ratio Event is no longer continuing (as evidenced by the receipt and delivery to the holders of the Notes of a certificate from a Senior Financial Officer of the Company certifying that such Secured Debt Ratio Event has been cured), the Notes shall bear interest at the Secured Debt Ratio Adjusted Interest Rate and 
 	(ii)	to the extent the Company has knowledge thereof, the Company shall promptly, and in any event within ten (10) Business Days after the Company has knowledge that a Secured Debt Ratio Event has occurred, notify the holders of the Notes in writing, sent in the manner provided in Section 18, that a Secured Debt Ratio Event has occurred and confirming the effective date of the Secured Debt Ratio Event and that the Secured Debt Ratio Adjusted Interest Rate will accrue from such effective date and will be payable on each subsequent interest payment date until such Secured Debt Ratio Event is no longer continuing, in consequence thereof.

 	(h)	As used herein, Secured Debt Ratio Adjusted Interest Rate means the interest rate per annum which is 1.50 above the rate of interest then in effect on the applicable Notes (or the Default Rate based on the rate of interest then in effect on the applicable Notes, as the case may be). For the avoidance of doubt, the Secured Debt Ratio Adjusted Interest Rate shall not apply unless and until a Secured Debt Ratio Event has occurred.

Upon the end of the Secured Debt Ratio Event, the applicable interest rate shall automatically return to the stated interest rate for the Notes or, if applicable, the Below Investment Grade Adjusted Interest Rate (or the Default Rate based on the applicable interest rate for the Notes, as the case may be). 
 	(j)	Following the occurrence and during the continuance of an Event of Default with respect to a Series of Notes, such Series of Notes shall bear interest at the Default Rate, as may be adjusted in accordance with this Section 1.2.

 Make Whole Amount means, with respect to any Note, an amount equal to the excess, if any, of the Discounted Value of the Remaining Scheduled Payments with respect to the Called Principal of such Note over the amount of such Called Principal, provided that the Make Whole Amount may in no event be less than zero.

 - 29 -

 Called Principal means, with respect to any Note, the principal of such Note that is to be prepaid pursuant to Section 8.2 or has become or is declared to be immediately due and payable pursuant to Section 12.1, as the context requires. 
 Discounted Value means, with respect to the Called Principal of any Note, the amount obtained by discounting all Remaining Scheduled Payments with respect to such Called Principal from their respective scheduled due dates to the Settlement Date with respect to such Called Principal, in accordance with accepted financial practice and at a discount factor (applied on the same periodic basis as that on which interest on the Notes is payable) equal to the Reinvestment Yield with respect to such Called Principal. 
 Reinvestment Yield means, with respect to the Called Principal of any Note, the sum of (a) 0.50 plus (b) the yield to maturity implied by the Ask Yield(s) reported as of 10:00 a.m. (New York City time) on the second Business Day preceding the Settlement Date with respect to such Called Principal, on the display designated as Page PX1 (or such other display as may replace Page PX1) on Bloomberg Financial Markets for the most recently issued actively traded on the run U.S. Treasury securities Reported having a maturity equal to the Remaining Average Life of such Called Principal as of such Settlement Date. If there are no such U.S. Treasury securities Reported having a maturity equal to such Remaining Average Life, then such implied yield to maturity will be determined by (i) converting U.S. Treasury bill quotations to bond equivalent yields in accordance with accepted financial practice and (ii) interpolating linearly between the Ask Yields Reported for the applicable most recently issued actively traded on the run U.S. Treasury securities with the maturities (1) closest to and greater than such Remaining Average Life and (2) closest to and less than such Remaining Average Life. The Reinvestment Yield shall be rounded to the number of decimal places as appears in the interest rate of the applicable Note. 
 If such yields are not Reported or the yields Reported as of such time are not ascertainable (including by way of interpolation), then Reinvestment Yield means, with respect to the Called Principal of any Note, the sum of (x) 0.50 plus (y) the yield to maturity implied by the U.S. Treasury constant maturity yields reported, for the latest day for which such yields have been so reported as of the second Business Day preceding the Settlement Date with respect to such Called Principal, in Federal Reserve Statistical Release H.15 (or any comparable successor publication) for the U.S. Treasury constant maturity having a term equal to the Remaining Average Life of such Called Principal as of such Settlement Date. If there is no such U.S. Treasury constant maturity having a term equal to such Remaining Average Life, such implied yield to maturity will be determined by interpolating linearly between (1) the U.S. Treasury constant maturity so reported with the term closest to and greater than such Remaining Average Life and (2) the U.S. Treasury constant maturity so reported with the term closest to and less than such Remaining Average Life. The Reinvestment Yield shall be rounded to the number of decimal places as appears in the interest rate of the applicable Note. 
 Remaining Average Life means, with respect to any Called Principal, the number of years obtained by dividing (i) such Called Principal into (ii) the sum of the products obtained by multiplying (a) the principal component of each Remaining Scheduled Payment with respect to such Called Principal by (b) the number of years, computed on the basis of a 360 day year

 comprised of twelve (12) thirty (30) day months and calculated to two (2) decimal places, that will elapse between the Settlement Date with respect to such Called Principal and the scheduled due date of such Remaining Scheduled Payment. 
 Remaining Scheduled Payments means, with respect to the Called Principal of any Note, all payments of such Called Principal and interest thereon that would be due after the Settlement Date with respect to such Called Principal if no payment of such Called Principal were made prior to its scheduled due date, provided that if such Settlement Date is not a date on which interest payments are due to be made under the Notes, then the amount of the next succeeding scheduled interest payment will be reduced by the amount of interest accrued to such Settlement Date and required to be paid on such Settlement Date pursuant to Section 8.2 or Section 12.1. 
 Settlement Date means, with respect to the Called Principal of any Note, the date on which such Called Principal is to be prepaid pursuant to Section 8.2 or has become or is declared to be immediately due and payable pursuant to Section 12.1, as the context requires.
