 NOTES TO UNAUDITED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
 SEPTEMBER 30, 2024 
 (Dollars in millions, except per share data and unless otherwise indicated) 

equity interest in MAV Canopy HoldCo I, LLC (MAV Canopy) that invests in mortgage servicing assets through its licensed mortgage subsidiary MSR Asset Vehicle LLC (MAV). 
 We perform servicing activities related to our own MSR portfolio (primary) and on behalf of other servicers (subservicing), and investors (primary and master servicing), including the Federal National Mortgage Association (Fannie Mae) and Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (Freddie Mac) (collectively referred to as GSEs), the Government National Mortgage Association (Ginnie Mae, and together with the GSEs, the Agencies) and private-label securitizations (PLS, or non-Agency). 
 We source our servicing portfolio through multiple channels, including retail, wholesale, correspondent, flow MSR purchase agreements, the Agency Cash Window programs and bulk MSR purchases. We originate, sell and securitize conventional (conforming to the GSE underwriting standards) loans and government-insured (Federal Housing Administration (FHA), Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) or United States Department of Agriculture (USDA)) forward mortgage loans, generally with servicing retained. The GSEs or Ginnie Mae guarantee these mortgage securitizations. We originate and purchase Home Equity Conversion Mortgage (HECM) loans, or reverse mortgages, which are mostly insured by the FHA and we are an approved issuer of Home Equity Conversion Mortgage-Backed Securities (HMBS) that are guaranteed by Ginnie Mae. 
 We had a total of approximately employees at September 30, 2024 of which approximately were located in India and approximately were based in the Philippines. Our operations in India and the Philippines provide support services to our loan servicing and originations businesses and our corporate functions.

days of loan closing or purchase. We act only as a fiduciary and do not have a variable interest in the securitization trusts. As a result, we account for these transactions as sales upon transfer. 
 Servicing fees collected (1) Purchases of previously transferred assets, net of claims reimbursed 
 ) ) ) ) 
 
 In connection with these transfers, we retained MSRs of million and million during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, and million and million during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively. 
 Certain obligations arise from the agreements associated with our transfers of loans. Under these agreements, we may be obligated to repurchase the loans, or otherwise indemnify or reimburse the investor or insurer for losses incurred due to material breach of contractual representations and warranties. We receive customary origination representations and warranties from our network of approved correspondent lenders. To the extent that we have recourse against a third-party originator, we may recover part or all of any loss we incur. Also refer to the Loan Put-Back and Related Contingencies section of Note 21 Contingencies.

Advances UPB of loans transferred (1) Maximum exposure to loss (2) 
 (1) Includes billion and billion of loans delivered to Ginnie Mae as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively, and includes loan modifications repurchased and delivered through the Ginnie Mae Early Buyout Program (EBO). 
 (2) The maximum exposure to loss in the table above is primarily based on the remaining UPB of loans serviced and assumes all loans were deemed worthless as of the reporting date. It does not take into consideration the proceeds from the underlying collateral liquidation, recoveries or any other recourse available to us, including from mortgage insurance, guarantees or correspondent sellers. We do not believe the maximum exposure to loss from our involvement with these previously transferred loans is representative of the actual loss we are likely to incur based on our contractual rights and historical loss experience and projections. Also, refer to the Loan Put-Back and Related Contingencies section in Note 21 Contingencies. 
 At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, and , respectively, of the transferred residential loans that we service were days or more past due, including days or more past due loans under forbearance. This includes and , respectively, of loans delivered to Ginnie Mae that are days or more past due. 
 Transfers of Reverse Mortgages 
 We pool HECM loans into HMBS that we sell into the secondary market with servicing rights retained. As the transfers of the HECM loans do not qualify for sale accounting, we account for these transfers as secured financings, with the HECM loans classified as Loans held for investment, at fair value, on our consolidated balance sheets. 
 Financing of Loans Held for Sale, Receivables and Other Assets using SPEs 
 We consolidate an SPE (trust) in connection with a warehouse mortgage loan financing facility structured as a gestation repurchase facility whereby Agency mortgage loans are transferred by PHH to the trust for collateralization purposes. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, million and million, respectively, loans held for sale were pledged as collateral for million and million, respectively, debt certificates issued by the trust. See Note 13 Borrowings. 
 We finance certain reverse mortgage buyouts that are insured by the FHA, including loans held for sale, receivables and REO properties, through private placement securitizations, referred to as OLIT transactions. The securitization trusts issued senior and mezzanine class Notes to third party investors. We retain certain mezzanine class Notes and ownership interests and service the underlying assets. As servicer, we are required to make certain servicing and principal advances that will not be reimbursable to us until all payments of interest and principal have been made to noteholders. We determined we were the primary beneficiary, and thus consolidate the securitization trusts and related depositor. Recourse for the Notes is limited to the assets of the respective securitization trusts. We executed our second and third OLIT securitizations in February 2024 and September 2024, respectively. Also refer to Note 13 Borrowings.

A reconciliation from the beginning balances to the ending balances of Loans held for investment and HMBS-related borrowings, MSRs and Pledged MSR liabilities that we measure at fair value on a recurring basis is disclosed in Note 5 - Reverse Mortgages, Note 7 Mortgage Servicing and Note 8 Other Financing Liabilities, at Fair Value, respectively. 
 The significant unobservable assumptions that we make to estimate the fair value of certain assets and liabilities classified as Level 3 and measured at fair value on a recurring basis are provided below. 
 Loans Held for Sale 
 The fair value of residential forward and reverse mortgage loans we purchased from Ginnie Mae guaranteed securitizations or from third parties (including government insured reverse buyouts previously purchased from Ginnie Mae guaranteed securitizations) is estimated using both observable and unobservable inputs, including published Ginnie Mae prices or expected collateral values, as well as estimated default, prepayment, and discount rates. Significant unobservable inputs in estimating fair value include the estimated default rate and, for reverse loans the prepayment rate and liquidation timeline. Accordingly, these repurchased Ginnie Mae forward and reverse loans are classified as Level 3 within the valuation hierarchy. 
 Loans Held for Investment - Reverse Mortgages 
 Reverse mortgage loans held for investment are carried at fair value and classified as Level 3 within the valuation hierarchy. We measure these loans at fair value based on the expected future cash flows discounted over the expected life of the loans at a rate commensurate with the risk of the estimated cash flows, including future draw commitments for HECM loans. We engage third-party valuation experts in the determination of fair value. Significant unobservable assumptions include conditional prepayment rate and discount rate. The conditional prepayment rate assumption displayed in the table below is inclusive of voluntary (repayment or payoff) and involuntary (inactive/delinquent status and default) prepayments. The discount rate assumption is primarily based on an assessment of current market yields on reverse mortgage loan and tail securitizations, expected duration of the asset and current market interest rates.

 Range to 
 to 
 Weighted average Discount rate 
 (a) Annualized rate of lifetime projected prepayments as a percentage of the UPB at the beginning of any given period. 
 Significant changes in any of these assumptions in isolation could result in a significant change in fair value. The effects of changes in the assumptions used to value the securitized loans held for investment, excluding future draw commitments, are partially offset by the effects of changes in the assumptions used to value the HMBS-related borrowings that are associated with these loans. 
 MSRs 
 MSRs are carried at fair value and classified within Level 3 of the valuation hierarchy. The fair value is equal to the fair value mark provided by the third-party valuation experts, without adjustment, except in the event we have a potential or completed sale, including transactions where we have executed letters of intent, in which case the fair value of the MSRs is recorded at the estimated sale price. 
 We engage third-party valuation experts who generally utilize: (a) transactions involving instruments with similar collateral and risk profiles, adjusted as necessary based on specific characteristics of the asset or liability being valued; and/or (b) industry-standard modeling, such as a discounted cash flow model and prepayment model, in arriving at their estimate of fair value. The prices provided by the valuation experts reflect their observations and assumptions related to market activity, generally the bulk market, incorporating available industry survey results, client feedback and our actual trade activity, and including risk premiums and liquidity adjustments. While interest rates are a key value driver, MSR fair value may change for other market-driven factors, including but not limited to the supply and demand of the market or the required yield or perceived value by investors of such MSRs. While the models and related assumptions used by the valuation experts are proprietary to

Weighted average lifetime delinquency rate Weighted average discount rate Weighted average cost to service (in dollars) 
 Because the mortgages underlying these MSRs permit the borrowers to prepay the loans, the value of the MSRs generally tends to diminish in periods of declining interest rates, an improving housing market or expanded product availability (as prepayments increase) and increase in periods of rising interest rates, a deteriorating housing market or reduced product availability (as prepayments decrease).

 Financing Liabilities 
 HMBS-Related Borrowings 
 HMBS-related borrowings are carried at fair value and classified as Level 3 within the valuation hierarchy. These borrowings are not actively traded, and therefore, quoted market prices are not available. We determine fair value using a discounted cash flow approach, by discounting the projected recovery of principal and interest over the estimated life of the borrowing at a market rate commensurate with the risk of the estimated cash flows. 
 We engage third-party valuation experts to support our valuation and provide observations and assumptions related to market activities. The fair value is equal to the fair value mark provided by a third-party valuation expert. We evaluate the reasonableness of our fair value estimate and assumptions using historical experience, or cash flow backtesting, adjusted for prevailing market conditions and benchmarks of assumptions and value estimates. 
 Significant unobservable assumptions include yield spread and discount rate. The yield spread and discount rate assumption for these liabilities are primarily based on an assessment of current market yields for newly issued HMBS, expected duration and current market interest rates.

 Significant changes in any of these assumptions in isolation could result in a significant change in fair value. The effects of changes in the assumptions used to value the HMBS-related borrowings are partially offset by the effects of changes in the assumptions used to value the associated pledged loans held for investment, excluding future draw commitments. 
 Pledged MSR Liabilities 
 Pledged MSR liabilities are carried at fair value and classified as Level 3 within the valuation hierarchy. We determine the fair value of the pledged MSR liability following a similar approach as for the associated transferred MSRs. Fair value of the pledged MSR liability in connection with the MSR capital partner transactions (including MAV) is determined using the fair value mark provided by third-party valuation expert, consistent with the associated MSR, using the same methodology and assumptions, while considering cash flows contractually retained by PHH and expected life of subservicing agreement, when applicable. 
 Weighted average delinquency rate Weighted average subservicing life (in years) Weighted average discount rate Weighted average cost to service (in dollars) 
 Significant increases or decreases in these assumptions in isolation would result in a significantly higher or lower fair value. 
 ESS Financing Liability 
 The Excess Servicing Spread (ESS) financing liability consists of the obligation to remit to a third party a specified percentage of future servicing fee collections on reference pools of mortgage loans, which we are entitled to as owner of the related MSRs. We have elected to carry the ESS financing liability at fair value and have classified it as Level 3 within the valuation hierarchy. The fair value represents the net present value of the expected servicing spread cash flows, consistent with the valuation model and behavioral projections of the underlying MSR, as applicable. The fair value of the ESS financing liability is determined using a third-party valuation expert. The significant unobservable assumptions used in the valuation of the ESS financing liability include prepayment speeds, delinquency rates, and discount rates. The discount rate is initially determined based on the expected cash flows and the proceeds from each issuance, and is subsequently updated, at each issuance level, to incorporate discount rate assumption updates for the underlying MSR or other factors, as provided by third-party valuation expert. At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the weighted average discount rate of the ESS financing liability was and , respectively. Refer to MSRs above for a description of other significant unobservable assumptions. Also see Note 8 Other Financing Liabilities, at Fair Value.

 MAV (Related Party) Transactions 
 PHH entered into agreements to sell MSR portfolios to its related party MAV, on a bulk and flow basis, for which PHH has been retained as subservicer. While MSR legal title has transferred to MAV, the transactions do not qualify for sale accounting treatment primarily due to the termination restrictions of the subservicing agreement. See Note 11 - Investment in Equity Method Investee and Related Party Transactions. Accordingly, we continue to report the MSR and an associated Pledged MSR liability on our consolidated balance sheet. 
 Rithm Transactions 
 Starting in 2012, Onity and PHH entered into agreements to sell MSRs and the related servicing advances to Rithm, and in all cases have been retained by Rithm as subservicer. As of September 30, 2024, all transactions met sale accounting treatment except for the agreement to sell a billion MSR portfolio to Rithm, referred to as Rights to MSRs (or RMSR). While most of the economics and risks of the MSR and related advances have contractually transferred to Rithm, the MSR legal title was retained by Onity and the third-party consents required for title transfer were not obtained, causing the transactions to be accounted for as secured financings. Accordingly, we continue to report the million MSR and an associated Pledged MSR liability on our consolidated balance sheet.

billion did not qualify for sale accounting treatment, primarily due to the length of the non-cancellable term of the subservicing agreements. On December 31, 2023, we derecognized million non-Agency MSRs and Pledged MSR liability associated with Rithm servicing agreements with a UPB of billion for which MSR sale accounting criteria was met. Specifically, with the amendments described below, starting on December 31, 2023, the parties have the right to cancel or decline to renew the servicing agreements within a reasonable period of time. 
 On May 2, 2022, Onity entered into amendments to its servicing agreements (consisting of two subservicing agreements and the RMSR agreement) with Rithm to extend their terms to December 31, 2023 and provide for subsequent, automatic renewals, unless Onity provides advance notice of termination (by July 1), or Rithm provides advance notice of termination (by October 1), among other changes. Onity and Rithm did not provide notice of termination by July 1, 2024 and October 1, 2024, respectively, with respect to any of these agreements. 
 Onity and Rithm agreed to extend Rithm s termination rights with respect to its subservicing agreements from October 1, 2024 through November 15, 2024. In addition, Onity and Rithm agreed to extend the current terms of the billion of subservicing agreements with Rithm through February 1, 2025, with subsequent, automatic one-year renewals if notice of termination is not provided by July 1, 2025 or October 1, 2025 by Onity and Rithm, respectively. 
 Rithm s termination rights with respect to the RMSR agreement were not extended; accordingly, as Rithm did not give notice of termination by October 1, 2024, the RMSR agreement will continue for an additional one-year term ending December 31, 2025. Rithm has the right to terminate the billion RMSR agreements for convenience, in whole but not in part, subject to complying with the requirements to give notice of non-renewal as described above. If Rithm exercises this termination right, Rithm has the option of seeking (i) the transfer of the MSRs through a sale to a third party of its Rights to MSRs (together with a transfer of Onity s title to those MSRs) or (ii) a substitute RMSR arrangement that substantially replicates the Rights to MSRs structure under which we would transfer title to the MSRs to a successor servicer and Rithm would continue to own the economic rights and obligations related to the MSRs. In the case of option (i), we have a purchase option, as specified in the RMSR Agreements. If Rithm is not able to sell the Rights to MSRs or establish a substitute RMSR arrangement with another servicer, Rithm has the right to revoke its termination notice and re-instate the applicable servicing addendum or to establish a subservicing arrangement whereby the MSRs remaining subject to the RMSR Agreements would be transferred to up to subservicers who would subservice under Onity s oversight. If such a subservicing arrangement were established, Onity would receive an oversight fee and reimbursement of expenses. We may also agree on alternative arrangements that are not contemplated under our existing agreements or that are variations of those contemplated under our existing agreements. 
 Other MSR Capital Partner Transactions 
 PHH entered into agreements to sell MSR portfolios to different unrelated third parties, referred to as MSR capital partners, on a bulk and flow basis, for which PHH has been retained as subservicer. While MSR legal title has transferred to the MSR capital partners, the transactions do not qualify for sale accounting treatment primarily due to the termination restrictions of the subservicing agreements. Accordingly, we continue to report the MSR and an associated Pledged MSR liability on our consolidated balance sheet.

As of September 30, 2024, Onity has not recognized any such Promote Distribution income. See the Transaction Agreement discussed below and Note 22 Subsequent Events. 
 PHH entered into a Subservicing Agreement with MAV for exclusive rights to service the mortgage loans underlying MSRs owned by MAV. The Subservicing Agreement will continue until terminated by mutual agreement of the parties or for cause, as defined. MAV is permitted to sell the underlying MSR, in whole or in part, without Onity s consent after May 3, 2024. See the Transaction Agreement discussed below and Note 22 Subsequent Events. 
 As of September 30, 2024, PHH subserviced a total of billion UPB on behalf of MAV under the Subservicing Agreement, of which billion of MSRs were previously sold by PHH to MAV and do not qualify for sale accounting and thus remain reported on the consolidated balance sheet of PHH, with a fair value of million MSR and million Pledged MSR liability - see Note 8 Other Financing Liabilities, at Fair Value. The fair value of the Pledged MSR liability is determined using the fair value mark provided by third-party valuation experts, consistent with the associated MSR, using the same methodology and assumptions, while considering cash flows contractually retained by PHH during the expected life of the Subservicing Agreement. We are exposed to a risk of loss of this net million asset value if, and to the extent that MAV sells the billion MSR portfolio, in whole or in part at a faster pace than anticipated or if prepayments exceeds expectations, among other factors. 
 equity investment in MAV Canopy, Onity issued common stock, warrants and senior secured notes to Oaktree in 2021. See also Note 13 Borrowings and Note 16 Interest Expense. 
 On September 30, 2024, Onity entered into a definitive Transaction Agreement with Oaktree, MAV Canopy and MAV, that provides a framework pursuant to which the parties intend to consummate a series of transactions as follows: 
 Redemption Agreement and MAV Sale - Onity will sell its ownership interest in MAV Canopy, including its right to the Promote Distribution (MAV Sale), for a cash payment of of the adjusted book value of MAV Canopy upon closing, plus million, subject to certain adjustments. The MAV sale is conditioned upon the completion of a debt financing transaction by Onity, with certain criteria (Debt Financing), to redeem all of the outstanding PMC Senior Secured Notes due 2026 and, the Onity Senior Secured Notes to the extent of any remaining proceeds. Oaktree also agreed to participate as an anchor investor in the Debt Financing at different levels depending upon its size and pricing. Closing of the MAV sale is also subject to the receipt of necessary regulatory consents and approvals, and other customary closing conditions. 
 Amendment to Subservicing Agreement - Upon closing of the MAV sale, PHH and MAV will amend their current subservicing agreement, pursuant to which PHH will have the right to be the exclusive subservicer for an initial term of five years subject to certain extensions of all MSRs that MAV currently owns, which had a UPB of billion as of September 30, 2024, for all future MSRs that MAV acquires from PHH, and for the majority of MAV s MSR portfolio overall, as defined. PHH will have an obligation to provide MAV with a right of first offer for any GSE MSRs that PHH desires to sell that meet certain criteria. 
 MSR Sale Lockout Period - Upon closing of the MAV sale, the Transaction Agreement provides for a six-month lockout during which MAV shall not sell or otherwise transfer any MSRs owned by MAV at the effective date without the prior consent of PHH. Following this initial six-month period, this lockout restriction is subject to reduction in increments through September 30, 2027. MAV may freely sell or transfer any MSRs thereafter. 
 Warrant Amendments - Upon the pricing of the Debt Financing, the warrants were amended to provide that upon their exercise Oaktree can elect the cash exercise option only with the consent of Onity and, without the consent of Onity, 
 34 

the exercise price can only be paid via the net share settlement option. Currently, Oaktree has the option to pay the exercise price either in cash or via net share settlement. 
 Note Purchase Agreement (NPA) Amendment; Oaktree Parties Participation in a Debt Financing - The Onity Senior Secured Notes agreement were amended to (i) permit a Debt Financing by Onity, (ii) waive the make-whole premium, which is currently due in connection with any optional redemption of the Onity Senior Secured Notes on or prior to March 4, 2026, in connection with the redemptions described in this paragraph and (iii) require Onity to redeem the Onity Senior Secured Notes with the cash proceeds from the following transactions at reduced redemption prices. 
 First, Onity is required to redeem a principal amount of Onity Senior Secured Notes equal to the cash proceeds from the MAV Sale at a redemption price equal to of the principal amount of Onity Senior Secured Notes so redeemed plus accrued interest. 
 Second, Onity is required to redeem a principal amount of Onity Senior Secured Notes equal to (x) any remaining net proceeds from a Debt Financing, after repurchasing, redeeming or defeasing the PMC Notes in full, (y) the cash proceeds from the MAM Asset Acquisition and the proceeds from any debt financing secured with the assets acquired in the MAM Asset Acquisition, and (z) the net cash proceeds from the reverse mortgage asset OLIT securitization completed in September 2024 (see Note 13 Borrowings, footnote 13), in each case, at a redemption price equal to of the principal amount of Onity Senior Secured Notes so redeemed plus accrued interest. 
 Finally, Onity has the option to redeem up to an additional million principal amount of Onity Senior Secured Notes prior to December 31, 2024 at a redemption price equal to of the principal amount of Onity Senior Secured Notes so redeemed plus accrued interest. 
 The effectiveness of the amendments in the NPA Amendment is subject to the pricing of a Debt Financing . 
 In return for Oaktree agreeing to undertake the MAV sale, participate as an anchor investor in a Debt Financing, amend the Onity Senior Secured Notes NPA to permit a Debt Financing and amend the terms of the redemption provisions of the Oaktree Notes to waive the make-whole premium and make the other changes described above, Onity has agreed to pay Oaktree a transaction fee that is dependent on the size and pricing of the financing (See Note 22 Subsequent Events). 
 Termination - The Transaction Agreement may be terminated prior to the consummation of the MAV Sale (i) by mutual agreement of the parties, (ii) by either party, if any governmental approval has been denied or if any governmental authority has enjoined or otherwise prohibited the consummation of the MAV Sale, (iii) subject to certain conditions and cure periods, by either party, upon the breach of the representations, warranties or covenants by the other party or (iv) by either party, subject to certain limitations, if the closing of the MAV Sale has not occurred on or before February 1, 2025 (the Outside Date), or thirty (30) days after the Outside Date, if, as of five (5) business days prior to the Outside Date, all conditions, other than the obtaining of any required regulatory consent and approvals, have been satisfied or are reasonably capable of being satisfied on or prior to the Outside Date.

 Interest Rate Risk 
 MSR Hedging 
 MSRs are carried at fair value with changes in fair value being recorded in earnings in the period in which the changes occur. The fair value of MSRs is subject to changes in market interest rates among other inputs and assumptions. 
 The objective of our MSR interest rate risk management and hedging policy is to protect shareholders equity and earnings against the fair value volatility of interest-rate sensitive MSR portfolio exposure, considering market, liquidity, cost and other conditions. The interest-rate sensitive MSR portfolio exposure is defined as follows: 
 Agency MSR portfolio, 
 expected Agency MSR bulk transactions subject to letters of intent (LOI), 
 less the Agency MSRs subject to our sale agreements with MAV, Rithm and others, also referred to as Pledged MSR liabilities (See Note 8 Other Financing Liabilities, at Fair Value), 
 less the asset value for securitized HECM loans, net of the corresponding HMBS-related borrowings, 
 other interest-rate sensitive exposures, including our ESS financing liabilities, as deemed appropriate by the Market Risk Committee. 
 The hedge coverage ratio, defined as the ratio of hedge and asset rate sensitivity (referred to as DV01) is subject to lower and upper target thresholds under our policy. We regularly evaluate the hedge coverage ratio at the intended shock interval to determine if it is relevant or warrants adjustment based on market conditions, symmetry of interest rate risk exposure, liquidity impacts under shock scenarios and other factors. As the market dictates, management may choose to maintain the hedge coverage ratio at different thresholds, with approval of the Market Risk Committee, in order to preserve liquidity and/or optimize asset returns. 
 Effective September 2022, a minimum and hedge coverage ratios were required for interest rate declines less than, and more than basis points, respectively. During the second quarter of 2023, management raised its minimum hedge coverage ratio to . Effective December 2023, we established a targeted hedge coverage ratio range between and . In April 2024, we changed the risk measure to a dollar DV01 that resulted in an equivalent range of approximately to . 
 With a partial hedge coverage ratio, the changes in fair value of our hedging instruments may not fully offset the changes in fair value of our net MSR portfolio exposure attributable to interest rate changes. In addition, while DV01 measures may remain within the range of our hedging strategy s objective, actual changes in fair value of the derivatives and MSR portfolio

to days, with the majority of our commitments to borrowers for to days and our commitments to correspondent sellers for to days. Loans held for sale are generally funded and sold within to days. This interest rate exposure of loans and IRLCs is economically hedged with derivative instruments, including forward sales of Agency TBAs. The objective of our pipeline hedging strategy is to reduce the volatility of the fair value of IRLCs and loans due to market interest rates, thus preserving the initial gain on sale margin at lock date. We report changes in fair value of these derivative instruments as gain or loss on economic hedge instruments within either Gain on loans held for sale, net or Gain on reverse loans held for investment and HMBS-related borrowings, net in our consolidated statements of operations.

On September 26, 2024, Ginnie Mae issued a waiver extending the deadline by which PHH must meet the risk-based capital ratio requirements to May 1, 2025. We are currently implementing certain actions intended to achieve compliance with the requirements. 
 New York Department of Financial Services (NY DFS). We operate pursuant to certain regulatory requirements with the NY DFS, including obligations arising under a consent order entered into in March 2017 (the NY Consent Order) and the terms of the NY DFS conditional approval in September 2018 of our acquisition of PHH Corporation. The conditional approval restricts our ability to acquire MSRs with respect to New York loans, so that Onity may not increase its aggregate portfolio of New York loans serviced or subserviced by Onity by more than 2 per year. This restriction will remain in place until the NY DFS determines that all loans serviced on the Onity legacy REALServicing system have been successfully migrated to Black Knight MSP and that Onity has developed a satisfactory infrastructure to board sizable portfolios of MSRs. We transferred all loans onto Black Knight MSP in 2019 and have not serviced any loans on the REALServicing system since then. We continue to work with the NY DFS to address matters they raise with us as well as to fulfill our commitments under the NY Consent Order and PHH Corporation acquisition conditional approval. We believe we have complied with all terms of the PHH Corporation acquisition conditional approval and the NY Consent Order to date.

billion at September 30, 2024. This additional borrowing capacity is available on a scheduled or unscheduled payment basis. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we funded million out of the billion borrowing capacity as of December 31, 2023. We also had short-term commitments to lend billion and million in connection with our forward and reverse mortgage loan IRLCs, respectively, outstanding at September 30, 2024. We finance originated and purchased forward and reverse mortgage loans with repurchase and participation agreements, also referred to as warehouse lines, prior to their respective securitization. 
 HMBS Issuer Obligations 
 As an HMBS issuer, we assume certain obligations related to each security issued. The most significant obligation is the requirement to purchase loans out of the Ginnie Mae securitization pools once the outstanding principal balance of a reverse mortgage loan is equal to or greater than of the maximum claim amount (MCA repurchases).

 Client Concentration 
 Our Servicing segment has exposure to concentration risk and client retention risk. 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, servicing and subservicing fees from Rithm amounted to million, or of total servicing and subservicing fees (excluding ancillary income). In addition, the related Rithm Pledged MSR liability expense amounted to million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. As of September 30, 2024, Rithm represented billion, or of the UPB and of the loan count of our total servicing and subservicing portfolio, and approximately of all delinquent loans that Onity services. Our Subservicing Agreements and Servicing Addendum with Rithm provide for automatic one-year renewals, unless Onity or Rithm provide advance notice of termination. Onity and Rithm did not provide their respective notice of termination by July 1, 2024 and October 1, 2024. Onity and Rithm agreed to extend Rithm s termination rights with respect to its subservicing agreements billion UPB) from October 1, 2024 through November 15, 2024. In addition, Onity and Rithm agreed to extend the current terms of the subservicing agreements with Rithm through February 1, 2025, with subsequent, automatic one-year renewals. Rithm s termination rights with respect to the RMSR agreement were not extended; accordingly, as Rithm did not give notice of termination by October 1, 2024, the RMSR agreement billion UPB) will continue for an additional one-year term ending December 31, 2025. In connection with the RSMR agreement, we reported million servicing fees and million of Pledged MSR liability expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2024.

In addition, the related MAV Pledged MSR liability expense amounted to million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. As of September 30, 2024, our servicing and subservicing portfolio with MAV represented billion UPB, or of the UPB and of the loan count in our total servicing and subservicing portfolio. While our servicing agreement with MAV is non-cancellable and provides us with exclusivity, MAV is permitted to sell the underlying MSR without Onity s consent.

million at September 30, 2024. We cannot currently estimate the amount, if any, of reasonably possible losses above amounts that have been recorded at September 30, 2024. 
 As previously disclosed, we are subject to individual lawsuits relating to our FDCPA compliance and putative state law class actions based on the FDCPA and similar state statutes. We are currently defending a class action lawsuit challenging, under state and federal law, our practice of charging borrowers a fee to use certain optional payment methods, in Jones v. PHH Mortg. Corp., et al. (D. NJ), which we have filed a motion to dismiss. On July 23, 2024, the court granted the motion in part, dismissing the majority of the claims. Onity filed an answer to the surviving claims on August 14, 2024. In addition, between November 2022 and June 2023, we settled the previously disclosed cases of Morris v. PHH Mortg. Corp., et al. (S.D. FL), Torliatt v. PHH Mortg. Corp., et al. (N.D. CA), Thacker v. PHH Mortg. Corp., et al. (N.D. WV), Forest v. PHH Mortg. Corp., et al. (D. RI), and Williams v. PHH Mortg. Corp., et al. (S.D. TX). 
 In addition, we continue to be involved in legacy matters arising prior to Onity s October 2018 acquisition of PHH Corporation, including a putative class action filed in 2008 in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of California against PHH and related entities alleging that PHH Corporation s legacy mortgage reinsurance arrangements between its captive reinsurer, Atrium Insurance Corporation, and certain mortgage insurance providers violated RESPA. See Munoz v. PHH Mortgage Corp. et al. (Eastern District of California). In June 2015, the court certified a class of borrowers who obtained loans with private mortgage insurance through PHH s captive reinsurance arrangement between June 2007 and December 2009. PHH asserted numerous defenses to the merits of the case. Following pre-trial developments in August 2020, the only issues remaining for trial were whether the plaintiffs had standing to bring their claims and whether the reinsurance services provided by PHH Corporation s captive reinsurance subsidiary, Atrium, were actually provided in order for the safe harbor provision of RESPA to apply. In January 2022, the Court denied a motion by the plaintiffs to enter new evidence and a motion by PHH to decertify the class, which motion PHH may renew if the case ultimately goes to trial. Following the entry of this order, at the request of the parties, the Court dismissed all of the plaintiffs claims for lack of standing and entered judgment in favor of PHH. The plaintiffs appealed to the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, and in February 2023 that court reversed and remanded for further proceedings. Onity will continue to vigorously defend itself. Our current accrual with respect to this matter is included in the million legal and regulatory accrual referenced above. At this time, Onity is unable to predict the outcome of this lawsuit or the possible loss or range of loss, if any, associated with the resolution of such lawsuit. If our efforts to defend this lawsuit are not successful, our business, reputation, financial condition, liquidity and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. 
 Onity is a defendant in a certified class action in the U.S. District Court in the Eastern District of California where the plaintiffs claim Onity marked up fees for property valuations and title searches in violation of California state law. See Weiner v. Ocwen Financial Corp., et al . In May 2020, the court ruled that plaintiff s recoverable damages are limited to out-of-pocket costs, i.e. , the amount of marked-up fees actually paid, rather than the entire cost of the valuation that plaintiffs sought. In October 2023, the parties reached a tentative settlement to resolve the lawsuit prior to trial. A hearing on the parties motion for preliminary approval was scheduled for February 29, 2024, but the court postponed that hearing pending the submission of 
 53 

million, which amount was previously accrued. 
 Over the past several years, lawsuits have been filed by RMBS trust investors alleging that the trustees and master servicers breached their contractual and statutory duties by (i) failing to require loan servicers to abide by their contractual obligations; (ii) failing to declare that certain alleged servicing events of default under the applicable contracts occurred; and (iii) failing to demand that loan sellers repurchase allegedly defective loans, among other things. Onity has received several letters from trustees and master servicers purporting to put Onity on notice that the trustees and master servicers may ultimately seek indemnification from Onity in connection with the litigations. Onity has not yet been impleaded into any of these cases, but it has produced and continues to produce documents to the parties in response to third-party subpoenas. 
 Onity has, however, been impleaded as a third-party defendant into consolidated loan repurchase cases first filed against Nomura Credit Capital, Inc. in 2012 and 2013. Onity is vigorously defending itself in those cases against allegations by the mortgage loan seller-defendant that Onity failed to inform its contractual counterparties that it had discovered defective loans in the course of servicing them and had otherwise failed to service the loans in accordance with accepted standards. In September 2023, the Court granted in part Onity s motion for summary judgment, dismissing Nomura s failure to notify claim in its entirety; the Court, however, denied Onity s motion with respect to Nomura s second claim alleging failure to service loans in accordance with accepted standards. In May 2024, Onity filed an appeal of the Court s partial denial of Onity s summary judgment motion related to the negligent servicing claim. Briefing on that appeal concluded in September 2024. The scope of any resulting trial is uncertain, and thus Onity is unable at this time to predict the ultimate outcome of these matters, the possible loss or range of loss, if any, associated with the resolution of these matters or any potential impact they may have on us or our operations. If, however, we were required to compensate claimants for losses related to the alleged loan servicing breaches, then our business, reputation, financial condition, liquidity and results of operations could be adversely affected. 
 In addition, several RMBS trustees have received notices of events of default alleging material failures by servicers to comply with applicable servicing agreements. Although Onity has not been sued by an RMBS trustee in response to an event of default notice, there is a risk that Onity could be replaced as servicer as a result of said notices, that the trustees could take legal action on behalf of the trust certificate holders, or, under certain circumstances, that the RMBS investors who issue notices of event of default could seek to press their allegations against Onity, independent of the trustees. We are unable at this time to predict what, if any, actions any trustee will take in response to an event of default notice, nor can we predict at this time the potential loss or range of loss, if any, associated with the resolution of any event of default notice or the potential impact on our operations. If Onity were to be terminated as servicer, or other related legal actions were pursued against Onity, it could have an adverse effect on Onity s business, reputation, financial condition, liquidity, and results of operations. 
 Regulatory 
 We are subject to a number of ongoing federal and state regulatory examinations, orders, inquiries, subpoenas, civil investigative demands, requests for information and other actions. We may also on occasion be subject to foreign regulatory actions in the countries where we operate outside the U.S. Where we determine that a loss contingency is probable in connection with a regulatory matter and the amount of our loss can be reasonably estimated, we record an accrual for the loss. Where we determine that a loss is not probable but is reasonably possible or where a loss in excess of the amount accrued is reasonably possible, we disclose an estimate of the amount of the loss or range of possible losses for the claim if a reasonable estimate can be made, unless the amount of such reasonably possible loss is not material to our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. It is possible that we will incur losses relating to regulatory matters that materially exceed any accrued amount. Predicting the outcome of any regulatory matter is inherently difficult and we generally cannot predict the eventual outcome of any regulatory matter or the eventual loss, if any, associated with the outcome. 
 To the extent that an examination, audit or other regulatory engagement results in an alleged failure by us to comply with applicable laws, regulations or licensing requirements, or if allegations are made that we have failed to comply with applicable laws, regulations or licensing requirements or the commitments we have made in connection with our regulatory settlements (whether such allegations are made through administrative actions such as cease and desist orders, through legal proceedings or otherwise) or if other regulatory actions of a similar or different nature are taken in the future against us, this could lead to (i) 
 54 

million legal and regulatory accrual referenced above. 
 Loan Put-Back and Related Contingencies 
 We have exposure to representation, warranty and indemnification obligations relating to our lending, loan sales and securitization activities, and servicing practices. We received origination representations and warranties from our network of approved originators in connection with loans we purchased through our correspondent lending channel. To the extent that we have recourse against a third-party originator, we may recover part or all of any loss we may incur. We do not provide or assume any origination representations and warranties in connection with our MSR purchases. 
 At September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023, we had outstanding representation and warranty repurchase demands of million UPB loans) and million UPB loans), respectively. We review each demand and monitor through resolution, primarily through rescission, loan repurchase or make-whole payment.

 We believe that it is reasonably possible that losses beyond amounts currently recorded for potential representation and warranty obligations and other claims described above could occur, and such losses could have an adverse impact on our results of operations, financial condition or cash flows. However, based on currently available information, we are unable to estimate a range of reasonably possible losses above amounts that have been recorded at September 30, 2024 .

 Oaktree Warrant Amendment 
 On October 23, 2024, pursuant to the Transaction Agreement with Oaktree described in Note 11 - Investment in Equity Method Investee and Related Party Transactions, the warrants held by Oaktree were amended to provide that upon their exercise Oaktree can elect the cash exercise option only with the consent of Onity and, without the consent of Onity, the exercise price can only be paid via the net share settlement option. Previously, Oaktree had the option to pay the exercise price either in cash or via net share settlement. As of September 30, 2024, Oaktree holds and warrants to purchase shares of Onity s common stock at an exercise price of and per share, respectively, subject to anti-dilution adjustments. The amendment will not result in any change in the accounting or presentation of the warrants. 
 MAM Asset Acquisition and Financing, Preferred Stock Issuance 
 On October 9, 2 024, Onity and PHH entered into a definitive agreement with Mortgage Assets Management, LLC (MAM), a mortgage servicer, and certain investment funds managed by Waterfall Asset Management, LLC that own MAM (collectively Waterfall to acquire certain assets of MAM and Waterfall that are currently subserviced by PHH with an estimated book value of million, subject to certain post-closing adjustments MAM Asset Acquisition ). Onity had previously entered into a letter of intent with Waterfall on July 26, 2024 in connection with this transaction. The acquired assets include HECM reverse mortgage loans and mortgage servicing rights with a projected UPB of approximately billion (which assets will be reflected on Onity s balance sheet as Loans held for investment, at fair value along with the related borrowings, at fair value), million in cash, and reverse mortgage buyouts, advances, tails and other related assets. 
 In consideration of the MAM Asset Acquisition, Onity issued to Waterfall shares of a new series of non-convertible, perpetual preferred stock ("Series B Preferred Stock with an aggregate liquidation preference amount of million, subject to certain post-closing adjustments. The Series B Preferred Stock will accrue cumulative dividends initially at a rate of per year for the first , increasing each year thereafter up to a maximum rate of per year, which dividends will be payable in cash and in arrears on a quarterly basis when, as and if declared by the board of directors of Onity. After September 15, 2028, Onity will be able to redeem the Series B Preferred Stock, in whole or in part, for cash at a redemption price equal to the liquidation preference plus an amount equal to any accumulated and unpaid dividends thereon. If Onity experiences a change of control, as defined, it would be required to offer to repurchase all of the shares of Series B Preferred Stock at a purchase price equal to of the liquidation preference plus an amount equal to any accumulated and unpaid dividends thereon. The issued shares of Series B Preferred Stock are subject to a Registration Rights Agreement pursuant to which Onity agreed to file a resale registration statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission within days. The preferred stock will be accounted for at their initial fair value less issuance costs and classified as mezzanine equity on our consolidated balance sheet as it is contingently redeemable in the event of a change of control. Net income attributable to Onity common stockholders will be measured as Net income (attributable to Onity stockholders) less Preferred stock dividends. 
 Concurrently, Onity entered into a Loan and Security Agreement with an entity managed by Waterfall pursuant to which PHH may borrow against certain eligible reverse mortgage assets, as defined, on a revolving basis for up to a maximum committed amount WAM Financing Agreement ). The maximum committed amount decreases from an initial million to million after the first securitization of HECM tails. The obligations of PHH under the Loan and Security Agreement are guaranteed by Onity. 
 The consummation of the MAM Asset Acquisition, WAM Financing Agreement and Series B Preferred Stock issuance occurred on November 1, 2024. Due to the timing of the transaction, the fair value of the assets acquired and the preferred stock issued on November 1, 2024 has not yet been determined as of the date of issuance of these financial statements .

million PHH Senior Notes due 2029 
 On November 6, 2024, Onity issued million aggregate principal amount of Senior Notes due 2029 at a price of of the principal amount in a syndicated private placement to redeem all of the outstanding million PMC Senior Secured Notes due 2026 and million Onity Senior Secured Notes due 2027 subject to certain conditions described below. 
 The PHH Senior Notes were issued by PHH Escrow Issuer LLC, a special purpose entity wholly-owned and consolidated by PHH Corporation and Onity. Oaktree was allocated million of the PHH Senior Notes principal amount. The net proceeds from the sale of the PHH Senior Notes, together with approximately million additional cash from Onity, are placed into escrow pending the satisfaction of certain conditions, including, but not limited to, the consummation of the sale by Onity of its ownership interest in MAV to Oaktree, pursuant to the Transaction Agreement with Oaktree discussed in Note 11 - Investment in Equity Method Investee and Related Party Transactions. We expect to consummate the MAV sale during the fourth quarter of 2024, subject to regulatory approval and customary closing conditions. The total cash proceeds to be received by Onity upon consummation of the MAV Sale are currently expected to be approximately million resulting in the recognition of a gain on sale of its investment of approximately million (based on values as of September 30, 2024), excluding transaction costs. 
 Upon completion of the MAV sale and satisfaction of all escrow conditions, the escrowed proceeds will be released to PHH Corporation as co-issuer and will be used, together with the net proceeds from the MAV sale and available liquidity, to redeem all of the outstanding PMC Senior Secured Notes due 2026 and all of the outstanding Onity Senior Secured Notes due 2027. The PHH Senior Notes will be guaranteed by Onity and certain subsidiaries. 
 million loss on debt extinguishment due to the accelerated write-off of million unamortized discount and debt issuance costs, the payment of an million make-whole redemption premium and million transaction fee to Oaktree. In addition, a total estimated million of new debt issuance costs (underwriting, legal and other fees) will be amortized over the life of the PHH Senior Secured Notes due 2029.

 (Dollars in millions, except per share amounts and unless otherwise indicated. Amounts may not add in certain tables due to rounding.) 

OVERVIEW 
 
 General 
 We are a leading non-bank mortgage servicer and originator providing solutions through our primary brands, PHH Mortgage and Liberty Reverse Mortgage. PHH is one of the largest non-bank servicers in the country based on UPB, focused on delivering a variety of servicing and lending programs, and is also one of the largest correspondent lenders in the U.S. based on origination UPB. Liberty is one of the nation s largest reverse mortgage lenders and servicer based on origination and securitization UPB, dedicated to education and providing loans that help customers meet their personal and financial needs by drawing upon their home equity. We serviced or subserviced 1.4 million loans with a total UPB of 298.9 billion on behalf of more than 4,000 investors and 120 subservicing clients as of September 30, 2024. We service all mortgage loan classes, including conventional, government-insured, non-Agency, small-balance commercial and multi-family loans. Our Originations business is part of our balanced business model to generate gains on loan sales and profitable returns, and to support the replenishment and the growth of our servicing portfolio. Through our retail, correspondent and wholesale channels, we originate and purchase conventional and government-insured forward and reverse mortgage loans that we sell or securitize on a servicing retained basis. In addition, we grow our mortgage servicing volume through MSR flow purchase agreements, Agency Cash Window and co-issue programs, bulk MSR purchase transactions, and subservicing agreements. On June 10, 2024, Ocwen Financial Corporation changed its name to Onity Group Inc.

The table below summarizes the volume of Originations by channel on a current and comparative basis. The volume of Originations is a key driver of the profitability of our Originations segment, along with margins, and also a key driver of the replenishment and growth of our Servicing segment. In the third quarter of 2024, we added 18.5 billion of new volume, mainly 8.4 billion of new subservicing and 8.5 billion of new Originations production, as further detailed in the below table.

Volume Overview 
 The following table summarizes the average volume of our Servicing segment, a key driver of the profitability of our Servicing segment, on a current and comparative basis. The relative weight of performing and delinquent loans or servicing and subservicing also drive the amount and timing of gross revenue and expenses. Our average total servicing and subservicing UPB remained flat during the third quarter of 2024 compared to prior quarter.

 The following table presents key market interest rates which are important drivers of our businesses. As further discussed, the 30-year fixed rate mortgage is a key driver of Originations volume, the 10-year Treasury rate is a key benchmark for MSR valuation and hedging activities, and the 1-month SOFR is a key benchmark for the profitability of our Servicing segment (including float earnings and asset-backed financing cost).

 Business Strategy 
 We established the following strategy to return to sustainable profitability and create long-term value for shareholders: 
 Balance and diversification: Maintain a scale position in origination and servicing to address market-cycle opportunities; 
 Prudent capital-light growth: Emphasize on capital-light subservicing to drive servicing portfolio UPB growth and emphasize higher margin origination channels and products to drive accretive MSR investments; 
 Industry-leading cost structure: Optimize cost structure across the organization to achieve industry cost leadership through continuous cost and process improvement, optimizing technology, global operations, and scale; 
 Top-tier operating performance and capabilities: Delivering industry top-tier servicing operational performance and driving increased borrower and client satisfaction; 
 Dynamic asset management: Optimize investment returns and liquidity through opportunistic asset purchases and sales, leveraging third party capital sources, including our multi-investor partnership model to fund new MSR origination to deliver value for shareholders, including deleveraging. 
 Our growth and asset management strategy includes purchasing assets and/or operations of complementary businesses, by means of acquisition, merger or other transaction forms. Our strategy may also include pursuing large transactions, including bulk purchases or sales of MSRs . We have engaged in such transactions in the past, and we continue to explore opportunities that may be accretive to our business and stockholders value.

 Three Months Ended Change Nine Months Ended Change September 30, June 30, September 30, September 30, 2024 2024 2024 2023 Revenue 265.7 246.4 8 751.2 789.4 (5) MSR valuation adjustments, net (31.5) (32.7) (4) (75.8) (134.2) (44) Operating expenses 112.4 104.0 8 320.8 308.4 4 Other income (expense), net (94.1) (96.2) (2) (281.7) (359.2) (22) Income (loss) before income taxes 27.6 13.5 105 72.9 (12.5) (686) Income tax expense

 Onity reported 21.4 million net income in the third quarter of 2024, an increase of 10.9 million compared to the second quarter of 2024, mostly driven by the following: 
 A 19.3 million increase in revenue, mostly attributed to our Servicing segment due to a 9.6 million favorable change in fair value of loans held for sale attributed to market interest rate declines and favorable assumption updates on reverse buyouts and 9.1 million additional gains on our reverse mortgage portfolio of loans held for investment and HMBS-related borrowings. The reverse portfolio gains in the third quarter are driven by a decline in market interest rates (vs. an increase in the second quarter) and are part of our MSR hedge strategy. 
 Mostly flat MSR valuation adjustments, net with the net loss in both quarters driven by the MSR realization of expected cash flows or runoff. In both the second and third quarters of 2024, the fair value changes of the MSR exposure due to interest rates were largely offset with hedging derivatives. 
 An 8.5 million increase in Operating expenses, primarily due to reimbursements received in the second quarter of 2024 from mortgage loan investors related to prior year legal expenses and payments following resolution of legacy litigation matters, and a higher estimated annual cash awards expense based on our year-to-date financial performance. 
 A 3.3 million increase in Income tax expense, mostly due to the increase in pre-tax earnings. 
 When comparing to the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the statement of operations for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 reflects 95.3 million servicing fees collected on behalf of and remitted to Rithm and reported gross, both as Revenue (Servicing and subservicing fees) and as Other income (expense), net (Pledged MSR liability expense) associated with the MSR that achieved sale accounting treatment on December 31, 2023, with no impact on Net income (loss). On December 31, 2023, we derecognized from our balance sheet 421.7 million non-Agency MSRs and Pledged MSR liability associated with Rithm servicing agreements with a UPB of 33.4 billion for which MSR sale accounting criteria was met. As PHH continues to subservice the portfolio, our statement of operations in 2024 reflects subservicing fee revenue as opposed to the gross presentation of servicing fee revenue and offsetting servicing fee remittances within Pledged MSR liability expense, a component of Other income (expense), net, prior to December 31, 2023. These required presentation changes do not affect the amount of net fee retained by Onity in connection with the Rithm servicing agreements.

Total Revenue 
 The below table presents total revenue by type and segment: 
 Revenue Three Months Ended Change Nine Months Ended Change September 30, June 30, September 30, September 30, 2024 2024 2024 2023 Servicing and subservicing fees 211.1 210.8 626.5 707.5 (11) Reverse mortgage revenue, net 18.0 8.5 113 41.9 21.5 95 Gain on loans held for sale, net 
 25.8 16.5 57 53.2 36.3 47 Other revenue, net 10.8 10.6 1 29.6 24.0 23 Total revenue 
 265.7 246.4 8 751.2 789.4 (5) Servicing 236.1 217.2 9 672.3 734.3 (8) Originations 29.6 29.2 1 78.9 55.2 43 Corporate n/m n/m Total segment revenue 265.7 246.4 8 751.2 789.4 (5) n/m: not meaningful 
 
 Total segment revenue for the three months ended September 30, 2024 increased 19.3 million, or 8 compared to the three months ended June 30, 2024 due to an 18.9 million increase in Servicing revenue and a 0.4 million increase in Originations revenue. The increase in Servicing revenue is driven by a 9.6 million increase in Gain on loans held for sale, net mostly attributed to reverse mortgage loan buyouts in the third quarter of 2024, and a 9.1 million increase in Gain on reverse loans held for investment and HMBS-related borrowings, net driven by a favorable decline in market rates (vs. an increase in the second quarter), partially offset by unfavorable yield spread widening (vs. favorable tightening in the second quarter). In addition, servicing and subservicing fees increased by 0.1 million with offsetting factors as float earnings increased with seasonally higher average float balances, offset by a decrease in servicing fees mostly due to MAV s sale of MSRs (previously sold by Onity to MAV in a transaction which did not qualify for sale accounting treatment) during the three months ended June 30, 2024. 
 Compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023, total segment revenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 38.2 million or 5 lower, due to a 62.0 million decline in Servicing revenue offset by a 23.7 million increase in Originations revenue. 
 The decline in Servicing revenue is mostly due to an 81.4 million decrease in servicing and subservicing fees largely due to the effects of our accounting derecognition of MSRs previously sold to Rithm for which the sale accounting criteria were met effective December 31, 2023, as discussed above 95.3 million fees collected and remitted to Rithm recognized in the nine months ended September 30, 2023). Partially offsetting this decrease, Gain on reverse loans held for investment and HMBS-related borrowings, net increased 19.4 million due to a decrease in market rates vs. an increase in the prior year period and yield spread tightening vs. widening in the prior year period. 
 The increase in Originations revenue is primarily driven by an 18.9 million increase in Gain on loans held for sale, net (forward loans) due to an increase in volume and margin for both our Correspondent and Consumer Direct channel. The increase in Correspondent volume is mostly attributed to our owned MSR replenishment strategy after the opportunistic MSR bulk sales in 2024. The increase in Consumer Direct volume is driven by the recent decline in interest rates generating additional recapture opportunities.

MSR Valuation Adjustments, Net 
 The table below presents the key components of MSR valuation adjustments, net which include MSRs, MSR pledged liabilities and ESS financing liabilities at fair value, together with MSR hedging derivatives: 
 Three Months Ended Nine Months Ended September 30, June 30, September 30, September 30, 2024 2024 2024 2023 Realization of expected cash flows (runoff) (40.2) (38.0) (118.2) (107.0) Fair value gains (losses) due to rate and assumption changes 
 (45.6) 56.0 92.4 92.5 MSR hedging derivative fair value gain (loss) 54.3 (50.6) (50.0) (119.7) MSR valuation adjustments, net (1) 
 (31.5) (32.7) (75.8) (134.2) 
 (1) Excludes fair value changes of reverse mortgage loans held-for-investment and HMBS related borrowing due to rates and assumptions that are part of the MSR hedging strategy. Refer to MSR Hedging Strategy section of Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risks for further detail and the discussion below within Servicing. 
 The 31.5 million loss on MSR valuation adjustments, net for the three months ended September 30, 2024 is comprised of 40.2 million runoff, 45.6 million fair value loss attributed to rate and assumption changes and 54.3 million gain on MSR hedging derivatives. As we maintained a high hedge coverage ratio in both quarters, the 1.2 million lower loss in MSR valuation adjustments, net in the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three months ended June 30, 2024 is largely driven by lower hedge costs in the third quarter of 2024 and certain favorable assumption updates to reflect actual market trade pricing levels. 
 MSRs are subject to runoff, a fair value decline due to the realization of expected cash flows and yield based on projected borrower behavior, including scheduled amortization of the loan UPB together with projected voluntary and involuntary prepayments. The unfavorable 2.2 million higher runoff quarter-over-quarter is mostly due to the impact of lower market rates on expected cash flows. 
 The 45.6 million fair value loss due to rate and assumption changes is attributed to a decline in interest rates in the quarter, partially offset by favorable assumption updates to reflect market participant perspectives on MSRs and actual market trade pricing levels. The change from a 56.0 million fair value gain in the three months ended June 30, 2024 to a 45.6 million fair value loss in the three months ended September 30, 2024 is mostly driven by changes in market interest rates as the 10-year Treasury rate declined 55 basis points in the three months ended September 30, 2024 and increased 16 basis points in the three months ended June 30, 2024. 
 MSR hedging derivative fair value gains or losses are designed to partially offset the expected fair value losses or gains, respectively, of the net MSR, MSR pledged liabilities and ESS exposure, commensurate with our target hedge coverage ratio. The 54.3 million derivative gain recognized in the three months ended September 30, 2024 is primarily driven by the rate decrease discussed above. Also refer to Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk for further detail on our hedging strategy and its effectiveness. 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the 75.8 million loss on MSR valuation adjustments, net is comprised of 118.2 million runoff, 92.4 million fair value gain attributed to rate and assumption changes and 50.0 million loss on MSR hedging derivatives. 
 The unfavorable 11.2 million increase in runoff is mostly due to the impact of lower market rates on expected cash flows and our replenishment of lower note rate MSRs sold in 2023 with new higher note rate originations. 
 Fair value changes attributed to rates and assumptions remained flat. The market interest rate impact as the 10-year Treasury rate declined 7 basis points during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to an increase of 71 basis points during the same period of 2023 was offset by certain favorable assumption updates in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 to reflect actual market trade pricing levels. 
 The 69.7 million lower loss from derivatives is mainly due to the market interest rate changes noted above, and the impact of our hedge coverage ratio. During the first nine months of 2023, we gradually increased our minimum hedge coverage ratio from 25 to 60 , with the minimum increasing to 95 in December 2023, adjusted to 90 in April 2024.

Operating Expenses 
 The table below presents the key components of operating expenses: 
 Three Months Ended Change Nine Months Ended Change September 30, June 30, September 30, September 30, 2024 2024 2024 2023 Compensation and benefits 59.5 55.0 8 168.1 171.4 (2) Servicing and origination 11.1 13.9 (21) 40.0 48.8 (18) Technology and communications 13.2 13.0 2 38.9 39.5 (1) Professional services 17.3 10.7 61 40.1 9.9 306 Occupancy, equipment and mailing

 4,305 4,374 (2) 4,391 4,700 (7) 
 Compensation and benefits expense for the three months ended September 30, 2024 increased 4.6 million, or 8 compared to the three months ended June 30, 2024, largely due to higher estimated annual cash awards expense based on our year-to-date financial performance. 
 Compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023, Compensation and benefits expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 decreased 3.3 million, or 2 largely due to a decrease in salaries and benefits, offset in part by an increase in estimated annual cash awards expense discussed above. Our total average headcount declined 7 , mostly due to efficiencies in Servicing and runoff of our reverse subservicing portfolio. 
 Servicing and origination expense for the three months ended September 30, 2024 decreased 2.9 million compared to the three months ended June 30, 2024, mostly driven by the reversal of a liability for representation and warranty indemnification obligations due to a favorable settlement in the third quarter of 2024 . 
 Compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023, Servicing and origination expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 decreased 8.7 million mostly due to an 11.5 million decrease in Servicing, partially offset by 2.4 million incremental expenses in Originations. The decline in Servicing expense is primarily attributed to the release of indemnification obligations driven by recoveries and favorable resolutions in the nine months ended September 30, 2024, partially offset by higher provision expense on reverse servicing portfolio related advances and higher loss adjustment expense in line with higher reinsurance premiums assumed. The increase in Originations expense is mostly driven by higher production volume and a provision release for representation and warranty indemnification obligations recorded in the first nine months of 2023 due to favorable resolution of demands. 
 Professional services expense for the three months ended September 30, 2024 increased 6.6 million compared to the three months ended June 30, 2024 primarily due to reimbursements received in the second quarter of 2024 from mortgage loan investors related to prior year legal expenses and payments following favorable resolution of legacy litigation matters. 
 Compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023, Professional services expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 increased 30.2 million primarily due to the reversal of our loss contingency accrual related to the CFPB matter resolved in our favor in the second quarter of 2023 and an increase in other litigation-related expenses recognized in the nine months ended September 30, 2024, largely offset by the reimbursements received in the second quarter of 2024 related to legacy litigation matters.

Other Income (Expense)

 Net interest expense for the three months ended September 30, 2024 remained mostly flat compared to the three months ended June 30, 2024. Compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023, Net interest expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 increased 5.5 million, mostly driven by the additional financing cost incurred in connection with our acquisition and securitization of reverse mortgage buyouts and the second lien PLS MSR financing facility entered into in March 2024. The increase in average short-term market interest rates in the first nine months of 2024 compared to the first nine months of 2023, on our variable rate borrowings was mostly offset by the decline in our average debt balances for servicing advances due to our collection efforts and lower Corporate debt interest expense attributed to our partial debt repayment. 
 During March 2024 and September 2024, we repurchased a total of 47.4 million and 23.5 million, respectively, of the PMC Senior Secured Notes for a price of 45.5 million and 23.0 million, and recognized a gain of 1.4 million and 0.3 million on debt extinguishment, net of the associated write-off of unamortized discount and debt issuance costs. During September 2023, we repurchased a total of 13.9 million of the PMC Senior Secured Notes for a price of 12.5 million and recognized a 1.2 million gain on debt extinguishment, net of the associated write-off of unamortized discount and debt issuance costs. 
 Refer to Servicing segment for discussion of Pledged MSR liability expense (primarily impacted by the accounting presentation change of the derecognized Rithm MSR on December 31, 2023) and Earnings of equity method investee (predominantly impacted by the fair value changes of MAV s MSR portfolio). 
 Income Tax Expense (Benefit) 
 Three Months Ended Nine Months Ended 
 September 30, June 30, Change September 30, September 30, Change 2024 2024 2024 2023 Income tax expense 
 6.3 3.0 109 10.9 3.8 189 Income (loss) before income taxes 27.6 13.5 105 72.9 (12.5) (686) Effective tax rate 22.7 22.2 2 15.0 (30.3) (149) 
 Our annual effective tax rate is generally lower than the 21 federal statutory income tax rate primarily due to the full valuation allowance recorded on our net U.S. federal and state deferred tax assets. We evaluated all positive and negative evidence to determine whether it is more likely than not that the deferred tax asset can be realized in future periods and determined that a full valuation allowance at September 30, 2024 remains appropriate. 
 Our income tax expense is primarily driven by the jurisdictional mix of our earnings. The increase in the effective tax rate for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period of 2023 is primarily due to recognizing income tax expense in the U.S. driven by the increase in pre-tax earnings. 
 Under our transfer pricing agreements, our operations in India and Philippines are compensated on a cost-plus basis for the services they provide, such that even when we have a consolidated pre-tax loss from operations these foreign operations have taxable income, which is subject to statutory tax rates in these jurisdictions that are higher than the U.S. statutory rate of 21 .

 Total assets increased 713.0 million, or 6 , between December 31, 2023 and September 30, 2024 with a 520.4 million increase in our Loans held for sale portfolio driven by the growth our Originations pipeline and our acquisition of reverse mortgage buyouts and a 356.0 million fair value increase in reverse Loans held for investment mostly driven by capitalization of interest. These increases were offset in part by a 156.1 million decline in servicing advances that was largely driven by seasonal reduction of balances and a 48.7 million decrease in our MSR portfolio due to MSR sales and derecognition of MSRs previously sold to MAV, offset in part by fair value gains attributed to rates and assumptions and new additions in excess of runoff. 
 66 

Total liabilities increased by 646.6 million, or 5 , compared to December 31, 2023, due largely to factors described above. Our borrowings under Mortgage loan financing facilities increased 645.3 million due to the higher loans held for sale balance at September 30, 2024, including the issuance of OLIT Notes in 2024 in connection with the securitization of reverse mortgage loan buyouts. Our HMBS-related borrowings increased by 335.1 million mostly due to fair value changes attributable to interest. Partially offsetting these increases, Advance match funded liabilities decreased 122.5 million consistent with the decline in servicing advances driven by our collection efforts, and Senior notes, net decreased 60.7 million mostly due to our repurchases of PMC Senior Secured Notes during the first and third quarters of 2024. MSR financing facilities declined 111.4 million with a decrease in our MSR portfolio and lower utilization of available borrowing capacity at September 30, 2024. Other financing liabilities declined by 73.8 million primarily due to the derecognition of MSRs previously sold to MAV. 
 Total equity increased 66.4 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, mainly due to 62.0 million net income for the period and 2.9 million compensation related to equity-classified awards. 
 Also refer to Key Trends and Outlook below and Note 22 Subsequent Events for discussion of recent asset acquisitions and financing transactions. 
 Key Trends and Outlook 
 The following discussion provides information regarding certain key drivers of our financial performance and includes certain forward-looking statements that are based on the current beliefs and expectations of Onity s management and are subject to significant risks and uncertainties. Refer to Forward-Looking Statements beginning on page 2 of this Form 10-Q and Part I, Item 1.A. of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, for discussion of certain of those risks and uncertainties and other factors that could cause Onity s actual results to differ materially because of those risks and uncertainties. There is no assurance that actual results will be in line with the outlook information set forth below, and Onity does not undertake to update any forward-looking statements. Refer to the Segment results of operations section for further detail, the description of our business environment, initiatives and risks. 
 Servicing and subservicing fee revenue - Our servicing fee revenue is a function of the volume being serviced - UPB for servicing fees and loan count for subservicing fees. We expect we will continue to grow our servicing and subservicing portfolio through our multi-channel Originations platform and through MSR capital partners, with an emphasis on subservicing. We expect ancillary float income to trend with short-term interest rates considering seasonal changes in average float balances. 
 Gain on sale of loans held for sale - Our gain on sale is driven by both volume and margin and is channel-sensitive. The updated industry forecasts suggest an increase in loan origination in 2025 driven by lower interest rates. We anticipate growth in our Consumer Direct channel considering the updated industry forecast and our increased recapture capabilities. We expect to continue to prudently grow our Correspondent volume at margins that are accretive to the business as part of our MSR replenishment and growth strategy after the opportunistic MSR bulk sales in 2024. We expect continued competitive pressure on margins across all channels. 
 Gain on reverse loans held for investment and HMBS-related borrowings, net - The reverse mortgage origination gain is driven by the same factors as gain on sale of loans held for sale, with smaller volumes in the reverse mortgage market and generally larger margins. With our experience and brand in the marketplace, we expect to continue to maintain or prudently grow our portfolio albeit with some channel mix changes. We expect continued uncertain market interest rate and spread conditions. The fair value of the net reverse servicing asset is expected to continue to follow market conditions, with fair value gains or losses generally associated with declining or increasing interest rates and spread, respectively, and is part of our forward MSR hedging strategy. On November 1, 2024, we completed the acquisition of 3.0 billion UPB of HECM loans along with HMBS-related borrowings and other assets from MAM that we subserviced. We expect higher net interest income (reported as fair value changes) due to higher UPB and increased volatility in fair value changes that we expect would largely be offset with our MSR hedging strategy, refer to Note 22 Subsequent Events and Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk for further detail on our hedge strategy. 
 MSR valuation adjustments, net - Our net MSR fair value changes include multiple components. First, amortization of our investment is a function of the UPB, capitalized value of the MSR relative to the UPB, and prepayments. We expect the MSR realization of expected cash flows to generally follow the growth or size of our MSR portfolio net of ESS financing liabilities and pledged MSR liabilities with our MSR capital partners. Second, MSR fair value changes are driven by changes in interest rates and assumptions, such as forecasted prepayments. Third, the MSR fair value changes due to changes in interest rates are partially offset by derivative fair value changes that economically hedge the MSR portfolio to the extent of our hedge coverage ratio and hedge performance. Refer to the sensitivity analysis in Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk for further detail. 
 Operating expenses - Compensation and benefits are a significant component of our cost-to-service and cost-to-originate and is directly correlated to headcount levels. Headcount in Servicing is primarily driven by the number of loans or UPB being serviced and subserviced, and by the relative mix of performing, delinquent and defaulted loans. As servicing volume is 
 67 

expected to modestly increase (see above), we expect a stable workforce with productivity gains. We expect our Originations headcount and operating expenses to align with the expected growth in volume. Our operating expenses are expected to correlate with volumes, with some productivity and efficiencies expected through our technology and continuous improvement initiatives. 
 Net interest expense - Interest expense varies based on changes in average debt balance and changes in interest rate on our variable rate debt. The average balance of collateralized financing facilities trends with the balance of the underlying assets discussed above (including MSR, advances and loans). We expect interest expense on our collateralized financing facilities to trend with short-term interest rate changes. Interest expense on our warehouse loan facilities is expected to be largely offset by interest income on our Originations pipeline loans. We also expect interest expense on our corporate debt to decline upon the consummation of our refinancing transactions, refer to Note 22 Subsequent Events. 
 Stockholders equity - With the above considerations, we expect our businesses to continue to generate net income and increase our equity in 2025, absent any significant adverse change in interest rates, hedge performance or other factors. We also expect our profitability in the fourth quarter of 2024 to be negatively affected by our refinancing transactions, partly offset by the expected gain on MAV sale. Conversely, we expect our profitability in 2025 to be favorably impacted by our refinancing transactions, with an overall lower interest expense on our corporate debt after consideration of preferred stock dividend.

 Our activities are organized into two reportable business segments that reflect our primary lines of business - Servicing and Originations - as well as a Corporate Items and Other segment. 

SERVICING 
 
 We earn contractual monthly servicing fees pursuant to servicing agreements pertaining to MSRs we own, which are typically payable as a fixed percentage of UPB, as well as ancillary fees that include float earnings, late fees, and other fees, where permitted. We also earn fees under subservicing arrangements with other institutions that own MSRs, which are typically on a per-loan basis and vary based on loan delinquency status. 
 As of September 30, 2024, we serviced 1.4 million mortgage loans with an aggregate UPB of 298.9 billion. 
 Concentration 
 Rithm is one of our largest subservicing clients accounting for 42.2 billion, or 14 of the UPB and 25 of the loan count of our total servicing and subservicing portfolio as of September 30, 2024, and approximately 64 of all delinquent loans that Onity services. The servicing agreements automatically renew annually unless notice of termination is provided. Refer to Note 8 Other Financing Liabilities, at Fair Value and Note 22 Subsequent Events. 
 MAV represented 41.9 billion, or 14 of the UPB and 11 of the loan count of our total servicing and subservicing portfolio as of September 30, 2024. In May 2021, PHH entered into a subservicing agreement with MAV for exclusive rights to service the mortgage loans underlying MSRs owned by MAV. MAV provides us with a source of additional subservicing volume, either with the MSRs that MAV purchases outright from third parties or with the MSRs that MAV purchases from PHH. Refer to Note 11 - Investment in Equity Method Investee and Related Party Transactions and Note 22 Subsequent Events. 
 Loan Resolutions 
 We have a strong track record of success as a leader in the servicing industry in foreclosure prevention and loss mitigation that helps homeowners stay in their homes and improves financial outcomes for mortgage loan investors. Reducing delinquencies also enables us to recover advances and recognize additional ancillary income such as late fees, which we do not recognize on delinquent loans until they are brought current. Loan resolution activities address the pipeline of delinquent loans and generally lead to (i) modification of the loan terms, (ii) repayment plan alternatives, (iii) a discounted payoff of the loan (e.g., a short sale ), or (iv) foreclosure or deed-in-lieu-of-foreclosure and sale of the resulting REO. Loan modifications must be made in accordance with the applicable servicing agreement as such agreements may require approvals or impose restrictions upon, or even forbid, loan modifications. To select an appropriate loan modification option for a borrower, we perform a structured analysis, using a proprietary model, of all options using information provided by the borrower as well as external data, including recent broker price opinions to value the mortgaged property. Our proprietary model includes, among other things, an assessment of re-default risk.

Advance Obligation 
 As a servicer, we are generally obligated to advance funds in the event borrowers are delinquent on their monthly mortgage related payments. We advance principal and interest (P I Advances), taxes and insurance (T I Advances) and legal fees, property valuation fees, property inspection fees, maintenance costs and preservation costs on properties that have been foreclosed (Corporate Advances). For certain loans in non-Agency securitization trusts, we have the ability to cease making P I advances and immediately recover advances previously made from the general collections of the respective trust if we determine that our P I advances cannot be recovered from the projected future cash flows. With T I and Corporate advances, we continue to advance if net future cash flows exceed projected future advances without regard to advances already made. 
 Most of our advances have the highest reimbursement priority (i.e., they are top of the waterfall ), so we are entitled to repayment from respective loan or REO liquidation proceeds before any interest or principal is paid on the bonds that were issued by the trust. In the majority of cases, advances in excess of respective loan or REO liquidation proceeds may be recovered from pool-level proceeds. The costs incurred in meeting these obligations consist principally of the interest expense incurred in financing the servicing advances. Most subservicing agreements, including our agreements with Rithm and MAV, provide for prompt reimbursement of any advances from the owner of the servicing rights. 
 MSR Valuation Adjustments 
 The financial performance of our Servicing segment is impacted by the changes in fair value of the MSR portfolio due to changes in market interest rates, among other factors. Our MSR hedging policy is designed to reduce the expected volatility of the MSR portfolio fair value due to market interest rates commensurate with the target hedge coverage ratio determined by our Market Risk Committee. Refer to Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk for further detail on our hedging strategy. 
 We report all fair value changes of our MSR portfolio and MSR hedges within MSR valuation adjustments, net. MSR valuation adjustments, net includes the loss on the MSR portfolio associated with the realization of its expected cash flows, or runoff, due to the passage of time, and any fair value gains or losses due to inputs, market interest rates or assumptions, net of hedging gains and losses. Included in MSR valuation adjustments, net are fair value gains and losses of the MSR pledged liability associated with the MSR transfers that do not meet sale accounting and the ESS financing liabilities for which we elected the fair value option and that is collateralized by MSRs. 
 Reverse Mortgages 
 We originate and purchase reverse mortgage loans through our Originations business, under the guidelines of the HECM reverse mortgage insurance program of the FHA. Loans are generally insured by the FHA, which provides protection against risk of borrower default, and are securitized through the Ginnie Mae program. As the securitization of reverse mortgage loans does not achieve sale accounting treatment, the loans remain on our balance sheet as Loans held for investment, at fair value together with the securitization HMBS-related borrowings, at fair value. 
 Our servicing activities of reverse loans are generally consistent with forward mortgage loan servicing as described above, with the following additional functions: the funding of borrower advances or draws under their approved borrowing capacity and the repurchase of loans upon reaching a limit: 
 a . Borrower draw funding obligation - Under the terms of ARM-based HECM loan agreements, the borrowers have additional borrowing capacity. Any borrower draws or tails are funded by the servicer and are securitized. We do not incur any substantive underwriting, marketing or compensation costs in connection with any future draws, although we must maintain sufficient capital resources and available borrowing capacity to ensure that we are able to fund these future draws prior to securitization with Ginnie Mae (generally less than 30 days). Also refer to Liquidity and Capital Resources, Use of Funds. 
 b. Loan repurchase obligation - As an HMBS issuer, we are required to purchase loans out of the Ginnie Mae securitization pools once they reach 98 of the maximum claim amount (MCA buyouts). Active buyouts are assigned to HUD and payment is received from HUD through a claims process, generally within 30 days. HUD reimburses us for the outstanding principal balance on the loan up to the maximum claim amount; we bear the risk of exposure if the outstanding balance on a loan exceeds the maximum claim amount. Inactive buyouts (loans that are in default for one of the following reasons - title conveyances or the borrower is deceased, no longer occupies the property or is delinquent on tax and insurance payments) are generally liquidated through foreclosure and subsequent sale of REO. State specific foreclosure and REO liquidation timelines have a significant impact on the timing and amount of our recovery. If we are unable to sell the property securing the inactive reverse loan for an acceptable price within the timeframe established by HUD (six months), we are required to make an appraisal-based claim to HUD. In such cases, HUD reimburses us for the loan balance, eligible expenses and interest, less the appraised value of the underlying property. Thereafter, all the risks and costs associated with maintaining and liquidating the property remains with us; we may incur additional losses on REO properties as they progress through the liquidation processes related to delayed 
 69 

timelines due to market conditions, sales commissions, property preservation costs or property tax and insurance advances. The significance of future losses associated with appraisal-based claims is dependent upon the volume of inactive loans, condition of foreclosed properties and the general real estate market. 
 The Gain on reverse loans held for investment and HMBS-related borrowings, net reported within the Servicing segment includes the net fair value changes of securitized reverse mortgage loans held for investment and HMBS-related borrowings, that comprise the following: 
 contractual interest income earned on securitized reverse mortgage loans, or HECM loans, net of interest expense on HMBS-related borrowings, that is, on a net basis, the servicing fee we are contractually entitled to and collect on a monthly basis under the Ginnie Mae MBS Guide regarding servicing HMBS; and 
 other fair value changes of the net balance of securitized loans held for investment and HMBS-related borrowings, that effectively represents servicing and tails. Tails are participations in previously securitized HECMs and are created by additions to principal for borrower draws on lines-of-credit (scheduled and unscheduled), interest, servicing fees, and mortgage insurance premiums. 
 The fair value of our Ginnie Mae securitized HECM loan portfolio net of HMBS-related Borrowings generally decreases as market interest rates rise and increases as market rates fall. The exposure is managed as part of our MSR hedging strategy (see Item 3 - Quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk, Loans Held for Investment and HMBS-related Borrowings and the associated interest rate sensitivity disclosure). 
 Gain (loss) on reverse loans held for investment and HMBS-related borrowings, net strictly reflects the financial performance of owned loans/servicing and excludes any subservicing activity. The financial performance associated with the subservicing of reverse mortgage loans on behalf of investors is primarily reflected within Servicing and subservicing fees, net. 
 Since 2023, we have opportunistically acquired reverse mortgage assets from financial institutions, including active and inactive reverse mortgage loan buyouts, advances, claim receivables from HUD and real estate properties. We finance our asset acquisitions together with the buyouts of our own portfolio through on-balance sheet private placement securitizations (referred to as OLIT). The financial performance of our reverse asset management is reported within the Servicing segment, primarily as Gains (losses) on loans held for sale, and is affected by multiple factors, including liquidation timeline and changes in market interest rates.

Third-Party Servicer Ratings 
 Like other servicers, we are the subject of mortgage servicer ratings or rankings (collectively, ratings) issued and revised from time to time by rating agencies including Moody s Investors Service, Inc. (Moody s), S P Global Ratings, Inc. (S P) and Fitch Ratings, Inc.(Fitch). Favorable ratings from these agencies are important to the conduct of our loan servicing and lending businesses. 
 The following table summarizes our latest key servicer ratings: 
 PHH 
 Moody s S P Fitch Forward Residential Prime Servicer SQ3+ 
 Above Average RPS3+ Residential Subprime Servicer SQ3+ 
 Above Average RPS3+ Residential Special Servicer SQ3+ 
 Above Average RSS3 Residential Second/Subordinate Lien Servicer SQ3+ 
 Above Average RPS3 Residential Home Equity Servicer RPS3 Residential Alt-A Servicer RPS3 Master Servicer SQ3+ Above Average RMS3 Ratings Outlook N/A Stable Stable 
 Date of last action August 10, 2023 October 11, 2024 February 15, 2024 Reverse Residential Reverse Servicer Above Average Ratings Outlook Stable Date of last action 
 October 11, 2024 
 In addition to servicer ratings, the agencies may from time to time assign an outlook to the rating status. A negative outlook is generally used to indicate that a rating may be lowered, while a positive outlook is generally used to indicate a rating may be raised . 
 On February 13, 2024, Fitch affirmed PHH s residential servicer ratings and revised its outlook from Positive to Stable for Prime and Subprime products. The rating outlook remains Stable for the other products. The rating actions reflect PHH s comprehensive enterprise-wide internal control environment, extensive industry experience and highly-developed global loan servicing platform, competitive loan servicing performance metrics, and effective technology platform. The ratings also consider the financial condition of PHH s parent, Onity Group Inc. The affirmed ratings and Stable outlook on PHH s residential servicer ratings are reflective of the company s continued business growth, diversified sourcing strategies and overall loan servicing performance. 
 On February 15, 2024, Fitch affirmed PHH's Master Servicer rating and Stable outlook, reflecting the company's effective enterprise-wide risk environment and compliance management framework, satisfactory loan servicing performance metrics and efficient servicing technology. The ratings also consider the financial condition of PHH's parent, Onity Group Inc. 
 On October 11, 2024, S P affirmed the Above Average ratings and Stable outlook citing the company s experienced management and team, effective systems and technology, sound control framework and good servicing performance metrics, among other factors.

 (6) Includes 35.3 billion average UPB of MSRs in the nine months ended September 30, 2023, previously sold to Rithm for which the sale accounting criteria were met effective December 31, 2023. 
 (7) Includes an average 255 thousand , 260 thousand and 260 thousand loans subserviced under Rithm agreements in the three months ended September 30, 2024, three months ended June 30, 2024 and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, of MSRs previously sold to Rithm for which the sale accounting criteria were met effective December 31, 2023. 
 Servicing and subservicing fees (excluding Ancillary income) for the three months ended September 30, 2024 declined 3.2 million compared to the three months ended June 30, 2024, due to a 3 decrease in average servicing UPB, driven by MAV s sale of MSRs (previously sold by Onity to MAV in a transaction which did not qualify for sale accounting treatment). Subservicing fees remained unchanged compared to the three months ended June 30, 2024. 
 Compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023, our servicing and subservicing fees (excluding Ancillary income) for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 decreased 84.7 million, or 15 with a 110.6 million decrease in servicing fees partially offset by a 25.9 million increase in subservicing fees. These variances are largely due to the effects of our accounting derecognition of MSRs previously sold to Rithm for which the sale accounting criteria were met effective December 31, 2023 95.3 million servicing fees remitted to Rithm recognized in the nine months ended September 30, 2023). Effective January 1, 2024, as PHH continues to subservice the portfolio, the statement of operations reflects subservicing fee revenue as opposed to the previous gross presentation of servicing fee revenue (collections) and separate offsetting presentation of servicing fee remittances within Pledged MSR liability expense (see further discussion below). These required accounting presentation changes do not affect the amount of net fee retained by Onity in connection with the Rithm servicing agreements (Loan servicing and subservicing fees less Pledged MSR liability expense). 
 76 

The 110.6 million decrease in servicing fees compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023 is primarily attributed to 133.6 million servicing fees collected on behalf of Rithm recorded in the first nine months of 2023 related to the previously sold MSRs derecognized on December 31, 2023, offset in part by higher fees in the first nine months of 2024 attributed to other MSR capital partners and MAV, growth in Ginnie Mae servicing UPB and 8.2 million increased collection of previously deferred non-Agency servicing fees. The 25.9 million increase in subservicing fees is mostly due to the effects of our derecognition of MSRs previously sold to Rithm as discussed above, with 38.9 million higher forward subservicing fees, partially offset by a 13.0 million reduction in reverse mortgage subservicing fees due to portfolio runoff. 
 The following table presents the detail of our ancillary income: 
 Ancillary Income Three Months Ended Change Nine Months Ended Change September 30, June 30, September 30, September 30, 2024 2024 2024 2023 Custodial accounts (float earnings) 35.4 31.9 11 94.5 77.9 21 Late charges 8.8 8.7 2 25.5 28.8 (11) Reverse subservicing ancillary fees 5.2 6.2 (16) 18.1 26.1 (31) Other 6.7 6.2 8 18.6 20.5 (9) Ancillary income 56.1 52.9 6 156.6 153.4 2 
 Ancillary income for the three months ended September 30, 2024 increased by 3.2 million, or 6 compared to the three months ended June 30, 2024 primarily due to a 3.6 million increase in float earnings mostly attributable to seasonally higher average float balances, offset in part by 1.0 million decrease in reverse subservicing related ancillary fees driven by portfolio runoff. 
 Compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023, ancillary income for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 increased by 3.2 million, or 2 largely driven by a 16.6 million increase in float earnings mostly due to higher short-term market interest rates, partially offset by an 8.0 million decline in reverse subservicing ancillary fees driven by portfolio runoff, a 3.3 million reduction in late charges and a 1.8 million decline in loan collection fees primarily driven by the Rithm portfolio derecognition.

 We recognized a 9.4 million gain on loans held for sale, net for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to a 0.2 million loss recognized in the three months ended June 30, 2024, mostly due to reverse mortgage buyouts in the third quarter of 2024, partly driven by market interest rate decline and favorable assumption updates. 
 Compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023, Gain on loans held for sale, net for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 decreased by 2.0 million, mostly due to reverse mortgage buyouts in connection with our opportunistic acquisitions and securitization strategy.

 Gain on reverse loans held for investment and HMBS-related borrowings, net increased 9.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three months ended June 30, 2024 largely driven by a favorable decline in market interest rates. While not the only benchmark for the reverse mortgage exposure, the 10-year Treasury rate declined 55 basis points during the three months ended September 30, 2024 and increased 16 basis points during the three months ended June 30, 2024. Net interest income remained mostly flat (+2 ), consistent with the portfolio growth. 
 Compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023, Gain on reverse loans held for investment and HMBS-related borrowings, net for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 increased 19.4 million largely due to a decrease in market rates vs. an increase in the prior year period and yield spread tightening vs. widening in the prior year period. The 10-year Treasury rate declined 7 basis points during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to an increase of 71 basis points during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Net interest income remained mostly flat (+ 3 ), consistent with the portfolio growth.

MSR Valuation Adjustments, Net 
 Refer to the discussion above within Overview-Results of Operations and Financial Condition-MSR Valuation Adjustments, Net. 
 The following table summarizes the impact of our MSR interest rate hedging strategy on Servicing segment results. Refer to MSR Hedging Strategy section of Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risks for further detail. Net MSR portfolio exposure gains (losses) comprise the fair value changes of the MSR portfolio attributable to rates and assumption changes, the MSR hedging derivative gains and losses, and other fair value changes of the HECM loans and HMBS-related borrowings used as a hedge for risk management purposes.

 (3) See Other change in fair value of securitized loans held for investment and HMBS-related borrowings, net in above table. 
 The Net MSR portfolio exposure gains of 10.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 are largely driven by favorable assumption updates to reflect actual market trade pricing levels as our MSR hedge strategy was effective at reducing net fair value changes due to interest rate changes. With a 90-110 targeted hedge coverage ratio, the fair value losses of the MSR portfolio due to the decline in market interest rates in the third quarter of 2024 were largely offset by gains on MSR hedging derivatives and loans held for investment net of HMBS-related borrowings. The favorable change from the prior quarter is driven by favorable assumption updates, higher hedge performance and lower hedge costs despite volatile market conditions. 
 The favorable change of Net MSR portfolio exposure gains for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to losses for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 is mainly driven by changes in interest rates, our adoption of a 95-105 hedge coverage ratio in December 2023 (revised to 90-110 in April 2024) and assumption updates that reflect market trade pricing levels in the respective periods. 
 Compensation and Benefits Three Months Ended Change Nine Months Ended Change September 30, June 30, September 30, September 30, 2024 2024 2024 2023 Compensation and benefits 26.0 24.5 6 75.8 81.3 (7) Average Employment - Servicing 3,073 3,148 (2) 3,169 3,438 (8) 
 Compensation and benefits expense for the three months ended September 30, 2024 increased 1.4 million or 6 compared to the three months ended June 30, 2024 primarily due to an increase in estimated annual cash awards based on our year-to-date financial performance. 
 Compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023, Compensation and benefits expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 decreased 5.5 million or 7 , mostly driven by the headcount reduction. The average headcount decreased 8 driven by the integration of reverse servicing and the runoff of our reverse subservicing portfolio. The increase in the estimated annual cash awards in the third quarter of 2024 discussed above was offset by severance expense recorded in the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 Servicing Expense 
 Servicing expense primarily includes claim losses and interest curtailments on government-insured loans, provision expense for advances and servicing representation and warranties, and certain loan-volume related expenses. 
 79 

Servicing expense declined 2.3 million in the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three months ended June 30, 2024, primarily as a result of a release of representation and warranty indemnification obligations due to a favorable settlement in the third quarter of 2024. 
 Compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023, Servicing expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 declined 11.5 million. The decline in servicing expenses is primarily attributed to a 7.2 million favorable change in provision for indemnification obligations driven by recoveries and favorable resolutions in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and new demands in the nine months ended September 30, 2023. In addition, the decline in servicing expense is due to lower claim loss on Ginnie Mae loan repurchases, driven by lower severity, partially offset by a higher insurance loss expense in line with higher quota share on reinsurance premiums assumed. 
 Other Operating Expenses 
 Professional services for the three months ended September 30, 2024 increased 6.7 million, compared to the three months ended June 30, 2024, mostly due to reimbursements received in the second quarter of 2024 from mortgage loan investors related to prior year legal expenses and payments following resolution of legacy litigation matters. 
 Compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023, Professional services expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 declined 7.9 million mostly due to the reimbursements received in the second quarter of 2024 from mortgage loan investors discussed above and a reduction in outsourcing costs in our reverse subservicing business. 
 Other Income (Expense) 
 Other income (expense) primarily includes net interest expense and pledged MSR liability expense. 
 The following table presents details related to interest expense and its drivers.

 Interest expense for the three months ended September 30, 2024 remained mostly flat (decreased 1 ), compared to the three months ended June 30, 2024. 
 Compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023, interest expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 increased 11.3 million, or 9 , mostly driven by a 12.5 million increase in interest expense on the OLIT mortgage loan financing relating to our reverse buyouts. In addition, interest expense on MSR financing facilities increased 4.2 million, largely driven by a higher average funding cost, largely attributed to the second lien PLS MSR financing facility entered into in March 2024 and renegotiation of a GSE financing facility. In addition, average short-term market interest rates increased by 30 
 80 

basis points in the first nine months of 2024 compared to the same period of 2023. These increases were partially offset by a 2.2 million decrease in interest on Advance funding liabilities, mostly driven by the decline in average debt balances for servicing advances due to our advance collection efforts, and 2.6 million lower corporate debt interest allocation due to our repurchase of 47.4 million and 23.5 million of the PMC Senior Secured Notes during March 2024 and September 2024, respectively. 
 Interest income for the three months ended September 30, 2024 increased 1.2 million compared to the three months ended June 30, 2024 primarily due to reverse mortgage buyouts acquired in the third quarter of 2024. Compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023, interest income increased 6.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, primarily due to the reverse mortgage buyouts acquired in the first and third quarters of 2024 and the second quarter of 2023. 
 Pledged MSR liability expense includes the servicing fee remittance related to the MSR sales or transfers that do not meet sale accounting criteria and are presented on a gross basis in our consolidated financial statements, together with the servicing spread remittance associated with our ESS financing liability at fair value. See Note 8 Other Financing Liabilities, at Fair Value to the Unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements. 
 The following table provides the components of Pledged MSR liability expense:

 (1) For MSR transfers that do not meet sale accounting criteria. See Note 8 Other Financing Liabilities, at Fair Value. 
 Pledged MSR liability expense for the three months ended September 30, 2024 decreased 3.7 million, or 8 , compared to the three months ended June 30, 2024, mostly driven by MAV s sale of MSRs (previously sold by Onity to MAV in a transaction which did not qualify for sale accounting treatment) and resultant derecognition of the Pledged MSR liability during the three months ended September 30, 2024. 
 Compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023, Pledged MSR liability expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 decreased 86.5 million largely due to the accounting derecognition of MSRs previously sold to Rithm for which sale accounting criteria were met effective December 31, 2023 33.4 billion UPB), partially offset by the increase in the portfolio of MSRs sold to MSR capital partners. Effective January 1, 2024, as PHH continues to subservice the portfolio, the statement of operations reflects subservicing fee revenue as opposed to the previous gross presentation of servicing fee revenue (collections) and separate offsetting presentation of servicing fee remittances within Pledged MSR liability expense. 
 Servicing fee and Pledged MSR liability expense continues to be presented on a gross basis for those MSRs sold to Rithm for which title has not transferred, also referred to as Right to MSR 9.3 billion UPB at September 30, 2024). The following table presents a subset of the above table related to Rithm, specifically the subservicing fees retained by Onity together with the associated serviced UPB on behalf of Rithm:

 Earnings of equity method investee represents our 15 share of MAV Canopy. Earnings for the three months ended September 30, 2024 decreased 2.3 million compared to the three months ended June 30, 2024. Compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023, earnings increased 0.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. The changes are largely attributed to the impact of changes in market interest rates on the underlying MSR portfolio held by MAV in the respective periods and actual trade prices. 
 
 ORIGINATIONS 
 
 We originate and purchase loans and MSRs through multiple channels. Loans conform to the underwriting standards of Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac (GSEs) or are government-insured (FHA, VA or USDA). We generally sell immediately the loans in the secondary mortgage market through GSE and Ginnie Mae securitizations on a servicing retained basis. 
 The Originations business generates a gain on sale of loans, which represents the difference between the origination or purchase value and the sale or securitization value of the loans, and fee revenue. 
 We conduct our Originations business through the following five channels: 
 1- Consumer Direct 
 Within retail, our Consumer Direct channel for forward mortgage loans focuses on targeting existing servicing customers by offering them competitive mortgage refinance opportunities, where permitted by the governing servicing and pooling agreement. A portion of our servicing portfolio is susceptible to refinance activity during periods of declining interest rates. Origination recapture volume and related gains are a natural economic hedge, to a certain degree, to the impact of declining MSR values as interest rates decline. In addition to rate and term refinance activities, our Consumer Direct channel targets purchase mortgage loans, cash-out, debt consolidation, mortgage insurance premium reduction, and new customer acquisition. 
 2- Correspondent Lending 
 Our correspondent lending channel drives the replenishment and growth of our MSR portfolio. We purchase closed loans that have been underwritten to investor guidelines from our network of correspondent sellers and sell and securitize them, on a servicing retained basis. We offer correspondent sellers the choice to take out mandatory or best-efforts contracts, under which the seller's obligation to deliver the mortgage loan becomes mandatory only when and if the mortgage is closed and funded. Additionally, we offer correspondent sellers the opportunity to leverage a non-delegated underwriting option for best-efforts deliveries. We provide customary origination representations and warranties to investors in connection with our loan sales and securitization activities. We receive customary origination representations and warranties from our network of approved correspondent lenders. As of September 30, 2024, we have relationships with 711 approved correspondent sellers. 
 3- Reverse Originations 
 We originate and purchase reverse mortgage loans through our retail, wholesale and correspondent lending channels, under the guidelines of the HECM reverse mortgage insurance program of the FHA. Loans originated under this program are generally insured by the FHA, which provides protection against risk of borrower default. As the securitizations of reverse mortgage loans do not achieve sale accounting treatment and the loans remain reported as Loans held for investment, at fair 
 82 

value together with the securitization HMBS-related borrowings, revenue mostly include the fair value changes of the loan from lock date to securitization date that are reported in Gain on reverse loans held for investment and HMBS-related borrowings, net. 
 4- Co-Issue Programs 
 We purchase MSRs through flow purchase agreements, the Agency Cash Window co-issue programs and bulk MSR purchases. The Agency Cash Window programs we participate in, and purchase MSR from, allow mortgage companies and financial institutions to sell whole loans servicing released to the respective agency and sell the MSR to the winning bidder. In addition, we partner with other originators to replenish our MSRs through flow purchase agreements. As of September 30, 2024, we have relationships with 496 approved sellers through the Agency Cash Window co-issue programs. 
 5- Subservicing Growth 
 We source additional servicing volume through our subservicing and interim servicing agreements, with our existing relationships and our enterprise sales initiatives. We do not report any revenue or gain associated with subservicing within the Originations segment as the impact is captured in the Servicing segment. However, sales efforts and certain costs - marginal compensation and benefits - are managed and reported within the Originations segment.

 (1) Defined as the UPB of loans funded in the period. 
 (2) Ratio of gain on Loans held for sale to funded UPB. Note that the ratio differs from the day-one gain on sale margin upon lock. 
 Gain on loans held for sale, net for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was flat compared to the three months ended June 30, 2024, with a 4.5 million decrease in our Correspondent channel offset by a 4.3 million increase in Consumer Direct. The decrease in our Correspondent channel is due to a 43 decrease in margin, driven by execution gains recognized in the second quarter and a more volatile pricing environment in the third quarter, including as a result of pricing changes by the GSEs. The increase in our Consumer Direct channel is primarily driven by the 52 increase in loan funded volume attributed to the interest rate decline in the third quarter, with a 78 basis point decline in the 30-year fixed rate mortgage. We recognize gains on loans held for sale at the time of the interest rate lock commitment in accordance with GAAP and the margin increase is mostly due to the increase in interest rate lock commitment at September 30, 2024. 
 Compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023, Gain on loans held for sale, net for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 increased 18.9 million, with a 10.6 million increase in Consumer Direct and an 8.3 million increase in our Correspondent channel. The increase in Consumer Direct gain is primarily driven by a 94 increase in loan funded volume, attributed to the interest rate decline in the third quarter of 2024 discussed above and our increased recapture operational capability. 2023 was the lowest production year for refinance over the past 20 years. In our Correspondent channel, the 8.3 million increase is driven by the increased loan production volume, attributed to our MSR replenishment strategy following our opportunistic MSR bulk sales. 
 Gain on Reverse Loans Held for Investment and HMBS-Related Borrowings, Net 
 The following table provides information regarding Gain on reverse loans held for investment and HMBS-related borrowings, net, of the Originations segment that comprises fair value changes of the pipeline and unsecuritized reverse mortgage loans held for investment, at fair value, together with volume and margin (including loan fees):

(2) Ratio of origination gain to funded UPB. Note that the ratio includes loan fees. 
 Gain on reverse loans held for investment and HMBS-related borrowings, net remained mostly flat when comparing current periods with the prior quarter and the prior nine-month period, with both margins and volume relatively stable. The Reverse Originations production volume remains at a historical low level due to elevated interest rates. 
 Other Revenue, net 
 Other revenue, net consists primarily of correspondent and broker fees, and also includes setup fees earned for loans boarded on our servicing platform. Changes in Other revenue, net for the periods presented are primarily attributed to production volume changes. 
 MSR Valuation Adjustments, Net 
 MSR valuation adjustments, net includes revaluation gains on certain MSRs opportunistically purchased through the Agency Cash Window programs, and flow purchases. As an aggregator of MSRs, we may purchase MSRs from smaller originators with a purchase price at a discount to fair value and we recognize valuation adjustments for differences in exit markets in accordance with the accounting fair value guidance. We record such valuation adjustments as MSR valuation adjustments, net within the Originations segment since the segment s business objective is the sourcing of new MSRs at targeted returns. Changes in MSR valuation adjustments, net period over period are mostly due to volume changes. 
 Operating Expenses 
 Operating expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2024 remained mostly flat, compared to the three months ended June 30, 2024. 
 Compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023, Operating expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 increased 1.1 million. Originations expense increased 2.4 million and Compensation and benefits increased 1.2 million driven by higher production volume. The increase in Compensation and benefits was driven by higher commissions with higher production volume, partially offset by a decline in salaries and benefits, with a decrease in average U.S. based headcount as part of our cost-reduction efforts. Overhead allocations declined 2.0 million due to lower total corporate overhead expenses and a lower allocation percentage to Originations as a result of lower average headcount. 
 Other Income (Expense) 
 Interest income consists primarily of interest earned on newly-originated and purchased loans during the pipeline period prior to securitization or sale to investors. Interest expense is incurred to finance the mortgage loans during the same pipeline period, which is generally less than 30 days. Our net interest margin is driven by the difference between the average mortgage note rate and the average warehouse line cost of funds, and by the average number of days loans remain in the pipeline. There were no significant changes in our net interest margin, period-over-period. 
 
 CORPORATE ITEMS AND OTHER 
 
 Corporate Items and Other includes expenses of corporate support services and activities that are not directly related to other reportable segments. 
 Certain expenses incurred by corporate support services, such as technology, risk and compliance are allocated to the Servicing and Originations segments using various methodologies intended to approximate the utilization of such services. 
 Interest expense on corporate debt is allocated to the Servicing and the Originations segments based on relative financing uses, with the exception of the Onity Senior Secured Notes issued by the holding company Onity Group Inc. Accordingly, the financing cost of the Servicing and Originations segments reflects and is consistent with the financing structure of the licensed entity PHH that carries out these businesses and does not depend on the financing structure strategy of its parent, as a holding company. 
 Effective in the fourth quarter of 2023, CRL, our wholly-owned captive reinsurance subsidiary, is reported in the Servicing segment. Segment results for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 have been recast to conform to the current segment presentation. 
 87 

The following table presents selected results of operations of Corporate Items and Other. The amounts presented are before the allocation and elimination of balances and transactions with our other segments: 
 Three Months Ended Change Nine Months Ended Change September 30, June 30, September 30, September 30, 2024 2024 2024 2023 Revenue Operating expenses Compensation and benefits 21.7 19.2 13 59.1 58.0 2 Professional services 7.2 7.4 (3) 19.1 (19.0) (201) Technology and communications

 Operating Expenses 
 Operating expenses before corporate overhead allocations increased by 2.4 million, or 7 , for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three months ended June 30, 2024, primarily driven by Compensation and benefits, specifically incentive compensation. The increase in incentive compensation is mostly due to an increase in estimated annual cash awards based on our year-to-date financial performance. 
 Operating expenses before corporate overhead allocations increased by 39.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023, primarily driven by Professional services. Professional services for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 reflected the reversal of our loss contingency accrual related to the CFPB matter resolved in our favor in the second quarter of 2023 and recoveries of prior years legal expenses from private mortgage insurers. In addition, legal fees and litigation-related expenses increased by 2.1 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 
 
 LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES 
 
 Overview 
 In the normal course of business, we are actively engaged with existing and potential lenders and as a result add, terminate, replace or extend our debt agreements to the extent necessary to finance our operations and growth and optimize our financing costs. 
 88 

In addition, we completed the following transactions during the nine months ended September 30, 2024: 
 Repurchased 70.9 million of our PMC Senior Secured Notes for a price of 68.5 million, and recognized a 1.8 million net gain on debt extinguishment; 
 Completed two private placement securitizations of HECM loans, and related receivables and REO properties, also referred to as reverse mortgage buyouts. In February and September 2024, different classes of asset-backed notes with an initial principal amount of 268.6 million and 330.6 million were issued at a discount, with a stated interest rate of 3 and 5 respectively, and a three-year mandatory call date; 
 Entered into a 34.0 million second-lien repurchase financing arrangement for the membership interest in our PLS MSR, pursuant to which PHH sold the membership interest certificate representing 100 of the limited liability company interests in PMC PLS ESR Issuer LLC (PLS Issuer) and agreed to repurchase such membership interest certificate at a specified future date at the price set forth in the repurchase agreement. The termination date of the facility is February 25, 2025. 
 Entered into a repurchase agreement in June 2024 which provides borrowing at our discretion up to a certain maximum amount of capacity on a rolling 30-day uncommitted basis, with the retained notes of the OLIT 2023 transaction pledged as collateral. 
 In addition, on November 1, 2024 , Onity acquired certain reverse mortgage assets of MAM that are currently subserviced by PHH. The acquired assets include HECM reverse mortgage loans and mortgage servicing rights with a projected UPB of approximately 3 billion (which assets will be reflected on Onity s balance sheet as Loans held for investment, at fair value along with the related borrowings, at fair value), 20.0 million cash, and other related reverse mortgage assets. In consideration of the MAM asset acquisition, Onity issued to Waterfall shares of a new series of non-convertible, perpetual preferred stock ("Series B Preferred Stock with an aggregate liquidation preference amount of 52.8 million, subject to certain post-closing adjustments. Concurrently, Onity entered into a two-year revolving line of credit with Waterfall, collateralized by certain acquired assets. The maximum committed amount decreases from an initial 45 million to 15 million after the first securitization of HECM tails. Refer to Note 22 Subsequent Events. 
 Further, on November 6, 2024, we issued 500 million aggregate principal amount of 9.875 Senior Notes due 2029 at a price of 99.556 . The net proceeds from the sale of the notes, together with additional cash from Onity, are placed into escrow pending the satisfaction of certain conditions, including, but not limited to, the consummation of the sale by Onity of its 15 ownership interest in MAV Canopy to Oaktree. Upon satisfaction of the escrow conditions, the escrowed proceeds will be released and will be used, together with the net proceeds from the sale of the investment in MAV Canopy and available liquidity, to redeem all of the outstanding PMC Senior Secured Notes and Onity Senior Secured Notes. Refer to Note 22 Subsequent Events. 
 A summary of borrowing capacity under our advance facilities, mortgage warehouse facilities and MSR financing facilities is as follows (see Note 13 Borrowings to the Unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information): 
 September 30, 2024 December 31, 2023 Total Borrowing Capacity (1) 
 Available Borrowing Capacity - Committed (1) Available Borrowing Capacity - Uncommitted (1) Total Borrowing Capacity (1) 
 Available Borrowing Capacity - Committed (1) Available Borrowing Capacity - Uncommitted (1) Advance facilities 714 273 64 714 151 64 Mortgage loan financing facilities 2,503 305 1,360 2,696 373 1,592 MSR financing facilities 1,200 318 164 1,082 128 38 Total 4,417 897 1,587 4,493 652 1,693 
 (1) Total Borrowing Capacity represents the maximum amount which can be borrowed, subject to eligible collateral. Available Borrowing Capacity represents Total Borrowing Capacity less outstanding borrowings. 
 At September 30, 2024, none of the available borrowing capacity under our advance financing facilities could be funded based on the amount of eligible collateral that had been pledged to such facilities. We may utilize committed borrowing capacity under our mortgage loan financing facilities and MSR financing facilities to the extent we have sufficient eligible collateral to borrow against and otherwise satisfy the applicable conditions to funding. At September 30, 2024, we had no committed borrowing capacity and 3.5 million uncommitted borrowing capacity under our mortgage loan financing facilities, and 27.1 million committed borrowing capacity and 67.0 million uncommitted borrowing capacity under our MSR financing facilities, based on the amount of eligible collateral. Uncommitted amounts can be advanced at the discretion of the lender, and there can be no assurance that any uncommitted amounts will be available to us at any particular time. 
 89 

At September 30, 2024, our 299.2 million total liquidity included 201.6 million unrestricted cash position and 97.6 million total available committed and uncommitted borrowing capacity based on the amount of eligible collateral as discussed above. With total liquidity of 241.6 million at December 31, 2023, the increase is primarily driven by bulk MSR sales, reverse buyout OLIT securitizations, second lien PLS financing, partly offset by 70.9 million corporate debt repurchases (PMC Senior Secured Notes). 
 Effective September 30, 2023, we implemented the revised minimum tangible net worth and liquidity requirements for GSE and Ginnie Mae seller/servicers. We believe that we are in compliance with these requirements as of September 30, 2024. 
 Ginnie Mae announced a new risk-based capital ratio effective on December 31, 2024 for Ginnie Mae issuers. PHH would not be in compliance with the upcoming risk-based capital requirements if they were in effect as of September 30, 2024. On September 26, 2024, Ginnie Mae issued a waiver extending the deadline by which PHH must meet the risk-based capital ratio requirements to May 1, 2025. We are currently implementing certain actions intended to achieve compliance with the requirements. Also refer to Note 19 Regulatory Requirements. 
 We optimize our daily cash position to reduce financing costs while closely monitoring our liquidity needs and ongoing funding requirements. We regularly monitor and project cash flows over various time horizons to anticipate and mitigate liquidity risk. We maintain liquidity buffers to be responsive to the level of risks, including stressed market interest rate conditions and operational risk. 
 Use of Funds 
 Our primary near-term uses of funds in the normal course include: 
 Payment of operating costs and corporate expenses; 
 Payments for servicing advances in excess of collections; 
 Investment in MSRs (purchased and originated), other asset acquisitions and MAV Canopy equity contributions; 
 Originated, purchased and repurchased loans, including reverse mortgage buyouts; 
 Payment of margin calls under our MSR financing facilities and derivative instruments; 
 Debt service and repayments of borrowings, including under our MSR financing, advance financing and warehouse facilities, and payment of interest expense; and 
 Net negative working capital and other general corporate cash outflows. 
 We have short-term commitments to lend 1.7 billion in connection with our forward and reverse mortgage loan IRLCs outstanding at September 30, 2024. In addition, we have originated floating-rate reverse mortgage loans under which the borrowers have additional borrowing capacity of 1.8 billion at September 30, 2024. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we funded 179.1 million out of the 1.8 billion borrowing capacity available at December 31, 2023. We are able to immediately securitize these borrower draws or advances under the Ginnie Mae program. As an HMBS issuer, we are required to repurchase loans out of the Ginnie Mae securitization pools once the outstanding principal balance of the loan is equal to or greater than 98 of the maximum claim amount (MCA repurchases). We carry these repurchases until reimbursement by HUD and/or property liquidation if inactive. Our reverse subservicing clients bear the financial obligation and risks associated with purchasing loans out of securitization pools within the portfolio we subservice. 
 Regarding the current maturities of our borrowings, as of September 30, 2024, we have approximately 1.6 billion of debt outstanding that would either come due, begin amortizing or require partial repayment in the next 12 months. This amount is comprised of 837.2 million of borrowings under forward and reverse mortgage loan financing facilities, 376.6 million of notes under advance financing facilities based on expected repayment, 342.8 million outstanding under GSE and Ginnie Mae MSR financing facilities maturing in the next 12 months, 28.8 million of scheduled principal amortization on the PLS Notes secured by PLS MSRs and 34.0 million outstanding under a PHH repurchase agreement. 
 With respect to liquidity management, we consider our servicing advance requirements during each investor remittance period and the uncertainties of daily margin calls on our collateralized debt facilities and derivative instruments due to interest rate fluctuations. 
 As servicer, we are required to advance to investors the loan P I installments not collected from borrowers for those delinquent loans, including those on forbearance plans. Loan payoffs and prepayments are a source of additional liquidity and are dependent on the interest rate environment. We also advance T I and Corporate advances primarily on properties that are in default or have been foreclosed. Our obligations to make these advances are governed by servicing agreements or guides, depending on investors or guarantor. As subservicer, we are also required to make P I, T I and Corporate advances on behalf of servicers following the servicing agreements or guides. However, servicers are generally required to reimburse us within 30 days of our advancing under the terms of the subservicing agreements, and we are generally reimbursed by Rithm the same day we fund P I advances, or within no more than three days for certain servicing advances. 
 90 

We are generally subject to daily margining requirements under the terms of our MSR financing facilities and daily cash calls for our TBAs, interest rate swap futures or other derivatives. Declines in fair value of our MSRs due to declines in market interest rates, assumption updates or other factors require that we provide additional collateral to our lenders under MSR financing facilities. Similarly, declines in fair value of our derivative instruments require that we provide additional collateral to the clearing counterparties. While the objective of our hedging strategy is to reduce volatility due to interest rates, it is also designed to address cash and liquidity considerations. Refer to the sensitivity analysis in Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk. 
 Our medium- and long-term requirements for cash include: 
 Payment of interest and principal repayment of our PLS Notes that mature in 2025, our PMC Senior Secured Notes that mature in 2026 and our Onity Senior Secured notes owed to Oaktree that mature in 2027; 
 Payment of interest and principal repayment of our OLIT securitization note issuances that have a three-year mandatory call date; 
 Any payments associated with the confirmation of loss contingencies; and 
 Any other payments required under contractual obligations discussed above that extend beyond one year. 
 We continuously evaluate alternative financings to diversify our sources of funds, optimize maturities and reduce our funding cost. In addition, we evaluate investment and capital allocation opportunities for any excess liquidity. 
 Sources of Funds 
 Our primary sources of funds for near-term liquidity in normal course include: 
 Collections of servicing and subservicing fees and ancillary revenues; 
 Collections of advances in excess of new advances; 
 Proceeds from match funded advance financing facilities; 
 Proceeds from other borrowings, including warehouse facilities, MSR financing facilities, MSR transfers and ESS financing; 
 Proceeds from sales and securitizations of originated loans and purchased loans; and 
 Net positive working capital from changes in other assets and liabilities. 
 Servicing advances are an important component of our business and represent amounts that we, as servicer, are required to advance to, or on behalf of, our servicing clients if we do not receive such amounts from borrowers. Our use of advance financing facilities is integral to our cash and liquidity management strategy. Additionally, certain of our financing and subservicing agreements permit us to retain advance collections for a period ranging from one to two business days before remittance, thus providing a source of short-term liquidity. 
 We use mortgage loan repurchase and participation facilities (commonly called warehouse lines) to fund newly-originated or purchased loans on a short-term basis until they are sold or securitized to secondary market investors, including GSEs or other third-party investors, and to fund repurchases of certain Ginnie Mae forward loans, HECM loans, second-lien loans and other types of loans. These facilities contain eligibility criteria that include aging and concentration limits by loan type among other provisions. Currently, our financing agreements generally have maximum terms of 364 days. The funds are typically repaid using the proceeds from the sale of the loans to the secondary market investors, usually within 30 days. 
 We also rely on the secondary mortgage market as a source of liquidity to support our lending operations. Substantially all of the mortgage loans that we originate or purchase are sold or securitized in the secondary mortgage market in the form of residential mortgage-backed securities guaranteed by Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac and, in the case of mortgage-backed securities guaranteed by Ginnie Mae, are mortgage loans insured or guaranteed by the FHA, VA or USDA. In June 2023, we issued a private placement securitization of reverse mortgage buyouts with an initial principal amount of 264.9 million and a three-year mandatory call date, expanding our access to capital markets and reducing our reliance on warehouse financing facilities. In February 2024 and September 2024, we issued a second and third private placement securitization of reverse mortgage buyouts with an initial principal amount of 268.6 million and 330.6 million, respectively, both with a three-year mandatory call date. 
 We regularly evaluate financing structure options to support our investment plans, address upcoming debt maturities and accommodate our business needs. We strive to diversify our sources of funds and optimize asset-backed financing. We continuously evaluate the allocation of our capital to MSR and other investments, the related returns, funding and liquidity requirements. Accordingly, we may opportunistically acquire or sell MSRs or other investments. The relationships with MAV and other MSR capital partners continue to provide PHH with additional means to grow servicing volume and finance MSRs while maintaining capital and liquidity. 
 91 

Covenants 
 Our debt agreements contain various qualitative and quantitative covenants including financial covenants, covenants to operate in material compliance with applicable laws and regulations, monitoring and reporting obligations and restrictions on our ability to engage in various activities, including but not limited to incurring or guarantying additional debt, paying dividends or making distributions on or purchasing equity interests of Onity and its subsidiaries, repurchasing or redeeming capital stock or junior capital, repurchasing or redeeming subordinated debt prior to maturity, issuing preferred stock, selling or transferring assets or making loans or investments or other restricted payments, entering into mergers or consolidations or sales of all or substantially all of the assets of Onity and its subsidiaries, creating liens on assets to secure debt, and entering into transactions with affiliates. These covenants may limit the manner in which we conduct our business and may limit our ability to engage in favorable business activities or raise additional capital to finance future operations or satisfy future liquidity needs. In addition, breaches or events that may result in a default under our debt agreements include, among other things, nonpayment of principal or interest, noncompliance with our covenants, breach of representations, the occurrence of a material adverse change, insolvency, bankruptcy, certain material judgments and litigation and changes of control. See Note 13 Borrowings to the Unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding our covenants. The most restrictive liquidity requirement under our debt agreements, excluding additional Agency minimum liquidity requirements, is for a minimum of 75.0 million in consolidated liquidity, as defined, under certain of our mortgage loan financing and MSR financing facilities agreements. At September 30, 2024, we held unrestricted cash in excess of this minimum amount. The minimum liquidity requirements for PHH contained in some debt agreements are also subject to the minimum requirement set forth by the Agencies. Refer to Note 19 Regulatory Requirements. 
 In addition, our debt agreements generally include cross default provisions such that a default under one agreement could trigger defaults under other agreements. If we fail to comply with our debt agreements and are unable to avoid, remedy or secure a waiver of any resulting default, we may be subject to adverse action by our lenders, including termination of further funding, acceleration of outstanding obligations, enforcement of liens against the assets securing or otherwise supporting our obligations, and other legal remedies, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, liquidity and results of operations. We believe that we are in compliance with the covenants in our debt agreements as of September 30, 2024. 
 Credit Ratings 
 The following table summarizes our current ratings and outlook by the respective nationally recognized rating agencies.

Moody s also assigned a B3 corporate family rating to Onity and withdrew the B3 corporate family rating of PHH Mortgage Corporation. The entities outlooks are stable. Moody s recognizes Onity's improving performance and return to profitability and adequate capitalization. At the same time, Moody s explained the rating is constrained by Onity's modest scale compared to mortgage peers and history of uneven financial performance. 
 On October 21, 2024, S P assigned a B- rating to the new PHH Corporation Senior Notes due in 2029 (See Note 22 Subsequent Events). S P also affirmed the B- rating to Onity with a Stable Outlook. The Stable Outlook reflects S P s expectations that Onity will maintain certain levels of debt ratio and debt-interest coverage while continuing to grow and diversify its servicing portfolio. 
 Cash Flows 
 Our operating cash flow is primarily impacted by operating results, changes in our servicing advance balances, the level of mortgage loan production, the timing of sales and securitizations of mortgage loans, and the margin calls required under our MSR financing facilities or derivative instruments. As one of the main differences between proceeds from sale and origination or purchase of loans held for sale, newly originated MSRs are effectively classified as operating cash flows. Purchases of MSRs through flow purchase agreements, Agency Cash Window and bulk acquisitions are classified as investing activity. MSR investments, whether originated or purchased, represent a key indicator of our ability to generate future income in our Servicing business. 
 We classify changes in HECM loans held for investment as investing activity and changes in the related HMBS borrowings as financing activity. Our MSR transfer agreements with MAV, Rithm and others have a significant impact on our consolidated statements of cash flows. Because the payments we received in connection with the HECM loan securitizations and MSR 
 92 

transfer agreements are recorded as secured financings, additions to, and reductions in, the balance of those secured financings are presented as financing activity in our consolidated statements of cash flows, excluding the changes in fair value attributable to inputs and assumptions. 
 Our cash flows are summarized as follows: 
 in millions Nine Months Ended September 30, 
 2024 2023 Net cash used in operating activities 
 (356) (271) Net cash provided by (used in) investing activities

Offsetting operating cash inflows include net collections of servicing advances of 140.9 million driven by seasonal activity and our increased collection efforts on legacy advances, and earnings distributions of 6.7 million received from our equity method investee MAV Canopy. 
 Our investing activities provided 214.2 million of cash. Cash inflows primarily include 193.9 million proceeds from sales of MSRs, 133.2 million net cash received in connection with our HECM reverse mortgages, 18.0 million proceeds from sales of real estate as part of our asset recovery strategy, 10.2 million received from the sale of advances in connection with sales of MSRs, and 7.1 million of capital distributions received, net of contributions, from our equity method investee MAV Canopy. Offsetting cash outflows include 114.8 million to purchase MSRs and 32.9 million to purchase real estate primarily in connection with our reverse mortgage buyout transaction. 
 Our financing activities provided 166.6 million of cash. Financing cash inflows are primarily comprised of 636.1 million net from borrowings under our mortgage loan financing facilities due to the increase in loans held for sale, including 569.9 million with the issuances of the OLIT securitization of reverse mortgage buyouts and 22.8 million of proceeds from the sale of MSRs accounted for as a financing in connection with sales of MSRs. Offsetting cash outflows include 122.5 million of net repayments on advance match funded liabilities due to the decline in servicing advances, 110.0 million of net repayment on MSR financing facilities, and 54.3 million of net payments on the financing liabilities related to MSRs transferred and ESS financings due to runoff. We also paid 68.5 million to repurchase 70.9 million of our 7.875 PMC Senior Secured Notes. Cash inflows of 792.3 million received in connection with our reverse mortgage securitizations, which are accounted for as secured financings, were more than offset by repayments on the related financing liability of 922.8 million. 
 Cash flows for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 
 Our operating activities used 271.4 million of cash primarily due to net cash paid on loans held for sale of 488.7 million as loan production volume exceeded sales. Offsetting operating cash inflows include net collections of servicing advances of 147.7 million. 
 Our investing activities used 43.6 million of cash. The primary use of cash in our investing activities was 89.6 million to purchase MSRs. Offsetting cash inflows include 36.3 million net cash inflows in connection with our HECM reverse mortgages, 2.7 million of capital distributions, net of contributions, from our equity method investee MAV Canopy and 6.1 million proceeds from the sale of advances.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES 
 
 Our ability to measure and report our financial position and operating results is influenced by the need to estimate the impact or outcome of future events based on information available at the date of the financial statements. An accounting estimate is considered critical if it requires that management make assumptions about matters that were highly uncertain at the time the accounting estimate was made. If actual results differ from our judgments and assumptions, then it may have an adverse impact on the results of operations and cash flows. We have processes in place to monitor these judgments and assumptions, and management is required to review critical accounting policies and estimates with the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors. 
 Our accounting policies and estimates involving significant judgments primarily relate to fair value measurements, income taxes, allowance for losses, and loss contingencies, including indemnification obligations and litigation proceedings. We use fair value measurements to record fair value adjustments to certain instruments in our statement of operations and to determine fair value disclosures, including but not limited to MSRs, Other financing liabilities, Loans held for sale, Loans held for investment-Reverse mortgages, and HMBS-related borrowings. As of September 30, 2024, 89 of our assets and 70 of our liabilities were reported at fair value, with fair value changes reported in our statement of operations. Substantially all our assets and liabilities at fair value were classified as Level 3 instruments due to unobservable inputs. 
 Our significant accounting policies and critical accounting estimates are disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 in Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements and in Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations under Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates. 
 
 RECENT ACCOUNTING DEVELOPMENTS 
 
 See Note 1 - Organization and Basis of Presentation to the Unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements for information related to recent accounting standards updates. 
 
 ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK (Dollars in millions unless otherwise indicated) 
 Interest Rates 
 Our principal market risk exposure is the impact of interest rate changes on our mortgage-related assets and commitments, including MSRs, loans held for sale, loans held for investment, IRLCs and other derivative instruments. In addition, changes in interest rates could materially and adversely affect the amount of escrow and float income, the volume of mortgage loan originations or result in MSR fair value changes. We also have exposure to the effects of changes in interest rates on our floating-rate borrowings, including MSR and advance financing facilities. 
 Our management-level Market Risk Committee establishes and maintains policies that govern our risk appetite and associated hedging programs, including such factors as duration and interest rate sensitivity measures, limits, targeted hedge coverage ratios, the hedge instruments that we are permitted to use in our hedging activities, and the counterparties with whom we are permitted to enter into hedging transactions and our liquidity risk profile. See Note 15 Derivative Financial Instruments and Hedging Activities to the Unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding our use of derivatives. 
 MSR Hedging Strategy 
 MSRs are carried at fair value with changes in fair value being recorded in earnings in the period in which the changes occur. The fair value of MSRs is subject to changes in market interest rates, among other inputs and assumptions. 
 The objective of our MSR interest rate risk management and hedging policy is to protect shareholders equity and earnings against the fair value volatility of interest-rate sensitive MSR portfolio exposure, considering market, liquidity, cost and other conditions. The interest-rate sensitive MSR portfolio exposure is defined as follows: 
 Agency MSR portfolio, 
 expected Agency MSR bulk transactions subject to letters of intent (LOI), 
 less the Agency MSRs subject to our sale agreements with MAV, Rithm and others, also referred to as Pledged MSR liabilities (See Note 8 Other Financing Liabilities, at Fair Value), 
 less the asset value for securitized HECM loans, net of the corresponding HMBS-related borrowings (also referred to as HECM or reverse MSR for risk management purposes), 
 other interest-rate sensitive exposures, including our ESS financing liabilities, as deemed appropriate by the Market Risk Committee.

The hedge coverage ratio, defined as the ratio of hedge (including reverse MSR) to asset rate sensitivity (referred to as DV01) is subject to lower and upper target thresholds under our policy. We regularly evaluate the hedge coverage ratio at the intended shock interval to determine if it is relevant or warrants adjustment based on market conditions, symmetry of interest rate risk exposure, liquidity impacts under shock scenarios, and other factors. As the market dictates, management may choose to maintain the hedge coverage ratio at different thresholds, with approval of the Market Risk Committee, in order to preserve liquidity and/or optimize asset returns. 
 Effective September 2022, a minimum 25 and 30 hedge coverage ratios were required for interest rate declines less than, and more than 50 basis points, respectively. During the second quarter of 2023, management raised its minimum hedge coverage ratio to 60 . Effective December 2023, we established a targeted hedge coverage ratio range between 95 and 105 . In April 2024, we changed the risk measure to a dollar DV01 that resulted in an equivalent range of approximately 90 to 110 . 
 Our Chief Investment Office, and Risk Management function, as the second line of defense, monitor fair value changes due to interest rates against the target hedge coverage ratio range on a daily basis. Exceptions are generally pre-approved by Risk Management. The following graph compares the daily hedge coverage ratio (based on interest rate modeled values) with target range and demonstrates the discipline of a highly effective MSR interest rate hedging strategy in the nine months ended September 2024 despite market volatility. The graph also shows the change in the targeted risk metric range starting in April 2024 discussed above. 
 
 With a less-than 100 hedge coverage ratio, the changes in fair value of our hedging instruments may not fully offset the changes in fair value of our net MSR portfolio exposure attributable to interest rate changes. In addition, while interest rate sensitivity measures (DV01) may remain within the range of our hedging strategy s objective, actual changes in fair value of the derivatives and MSR portfolio may not offset to the same extent, due to many factors. These factors include non-parallel changes in the interest rate curve, the convexity of the MSR, the basis risk inherent in the MSR profile and hedging instruments, model risk observed between actual vs. expected fair value changes, and hedge costs. 
 We continuously evaluate the use of hedging instruments with the objective of enhancing the effectiveness of our interest rate hedging strategy. 
 Our derivative instruments include forward trades of MBS or Agency TBAs with different banking counterparties, exchange-traded interest rate swap futures and interest rate options. These derivative instruments are not designated as accounting hedges. TBAs, or To-Be-Announced securities are actively traded, forward contracts to purchase or sell Agency MBS on a specific future date. From time to time, we enter into exchange-traded options contracts with purchased put options financed by written call options. We report changes in fair value of these derivative instruments in MSR valuation adjustments, net in our consolidated statements of operations, within the Servicing segment. 
 The derivative instruments are subject to margin requirements, posted as either initial or variation margin. Onity may be required to post or may be entitled to receive cash collateral with its counterparties through margin calls, based on daily value changes of the instruments. Changes in market factors, including interest rates, and our credit rating may require us to post additional cash collateral and could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and liquidity. 
 Loans Held for Investment and HMBS-related Borrowings 
 The fair value of our securitized HECM loan portfolio generally decreases as market interest rates rise and increases as market rates fall. As our HECM loan portfolio is predominantly comprised of ARMs, higher interest rates cause the loan 
 95 

balance to accrue and reach a 98 maximum claim amount liquidation event more quickly, while lower interest rates extend the timeline to reach maximum claim amount liquidation . Additionally, portfolio value is heavily influenced by market spreads for fixed and discount margin for ARMs. 
 The fair value of our securitized HECM loan portfolio net of the fair value of the HMBS-related borrowings represent a reverse mortgage economic MSR (HMSR) for risk management purposes. The fair value of our HMSR generally decreases as market interest rates rise and increases as market rates fall. As our HECM loan portfolio is predominantly comprised of ARMs, higher interest rates cause the loan balance to accrue and reach a 98 maximum claim amount liquidation event more quickly, with lower interest rates extending the timeline to liquidation. HECM loans have a longer duration than HMBS-related borrowings as a result of the future draw commitments, and our obligations as issuer of HMBS to purchase loans out of the Ginnie Mae securitization pools once the outstanding principal balance of the related HECM loan is equal to 98 of the maximum claim amount. This HMSR exposure is used as a partial offset to our forward MSR exposure and managed as part of our MSR hedging strategy described above. 
 Pipeline Hedging Strategy - Loans Held for Sale and IRLCs 
 In our Originations business, we are exposed to interest rate risk and related price risk during the period from the date of the interest rate lock commitment through (i) the lock commitment cancellation or expiration date or (ii) through the date of sale or securitization of the resulting loan into the secondary mortgage market. Loan commitments for forward loans generally range from 5 to 75 days, with the majority of our commitments to borrowers for 40 to 60 days and our commitments to correspondent sellers for 5 to 30 days. Loans held for sale are generally funded and sold within 5 to 30 days. This interest rate exposure of loans and IRLCs is economically hedged with derivative instruments, including forward sales of Agency TBAs. The objective of our pipeline hedging strategy is to reduce the volatility of the fair value of IRLCs and loans due to market interest rates, thus preserving the initial gain on sale margin at lock date. The net daily market risk position of net pull-though adjusted locks and loans held for sale, less the offsetting hedges of the pipeline, is monitored daily and its daily limit is +/- 5 . We report changes in fair value of these derivative instruments as gain or loss on economic hedge instruments within either Gain on loans held for sale, net or Gain on reverse loans held for investment and HMBS-related borrowings, net in our consolidated statements of operations. 
 EBO and Loan Modification Hedging Loans Held for Sale, at fair value 
 In our Servicing business, effective February 2022, management started hedging certain Ginnie Mae EBO loans repurchased out of securitization pools for modification and reperformance with TBAs to manage the interest rate risk while these loans await redelivery. 
 Advance Match Funded Liabilities 
 We monitor the effect of changes in interest rates on the interest paid on our variable-rate advance financing debt. Earnings on cash and float balances are a partial offset to our exposure to changes in interest expense. 
 Sensitivity Analysis 
 Fair Value MSRs, Loans Held for Sale, Loans Held for Investment and Related Derivatives 
 We assess and manage our interest rate risk on a daily basis primarily using sensitivity analyses. We develop sensitivity analyses to determine the impact on our earnings and financial condition across various interest rate scenarios that could be expected over different time horizons. Our interest rate exposure spans from overnight rates to 30-year rates, with increased sensitivity related to the 5-, 10-, and 30-year rates. Sensitivity analyses are based on hypothetical change in values of different interest-rate sensitive assets and liabilities together with our hedges and are presented under a set instantaneous +/- 25 basis point parallel move in rates. Changes in fair value cannot be extrapolated because the relationship to the change in fair value may not be linear and other factors may apply, such as change in yield, spreads or other assumptions. 
 The following table summarizes the estimated change in the fair value of our MSRs, HECM loans held for investment and loans held for sale that we have elected to carry at fair value as well as any related derivatives at September 30, 2024, given hypothetical instantaneous parallel shifts in the yield curve. These sensitivities are hypothetical and presented for illustrative purposes only. Changes in fair value based on variations in assumptions generally cannot be extrapolated because the relationship to the change in fair value may not be linear, among other factors.

 (1) Primarily reflects the impact of market interest rate changes on projected prepayments on the Agency MSR portfolio, Rithm and MAV pledged MSR financing liabilities and ESS financing liabilities. 
 Borrowings 
 The majority of the collateralized debt used to finance our operations is based on variable rates, but remains exposed to interest rate fluctuations between repricing dates. Our corporate debt is based on fixed interest rates. As servicer, we are also exposed to the impact of interest rate fluctuations on the float income we earn on balances held in trust from the date a loan payment is received from borrowers to the date funds are forwarded to investors. 
 Based on September 30, 2024 balances, if interest rates were to decrease by 100 bps, we estimate a net negative impact on our profitability of approximately 6.7 million resulting from a decrease of 26.3 million in annual interest income and other credits on cash deposits and float balances, and a decrease of 19.6 million in annual interest expense on our variable-rate debt. 
 Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Risk 
 Our operations in India and the Philippines expose us to foreign currency exchange rate risk to the extent that our foreign exchange positions remain unhedged. Depending on the magnitude and risk of our positions we may enter into forward exchange contracts to hedge against the effect of changes in the value of the India Rupee or Philippine Peso. We did not enter into any foreign currency hedging derivative instruments during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 
 Home Prices 
 Inactive reverse mortgage loans for which the maximum claim amount has not been met are generally foreclosed upon on behalf of Ginnie Mae with the REO remaining in the related HMBS until liquidation. Inactive MCA repurchased loans are generally foreclosed upon and liquidated by the HMBS issuer. Although active and inactive reverse mortgage loans are insured by FHA, we may incur expenses and losses in the process of repurchasing and liquidating these loans that are not reimbursable by FHA in accordance with program guidelines. In addition, in certain circumstances, we may be subject to real estate price risk to the extent we are unable to liquidate REO within the FHA program guidelines. As our reverse mortgage portfolio seasons, and the volume of MCA repurchases increases, our exposure to this risk will increase. 
 
 ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 
 Our management, under the supervision of and with the participation of our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, has evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures, as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (Exchange Act), as of September 30, 2024. 
 Based on such evaluation, management concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures as of September 30, 2024 were (1) designed and functioning effectively to ensure that material information relating to Onity, including its consolidated subsidiaries, is made known to our principal executive officer and principal financial officer by others within those entities, particularly during the period in which this report was being prepared and (2) operating effectively in that they provided reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by Onity in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act (i) is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms and (ii) accumulated and communicated to management, including our principal executive officer or principal financial officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 
 There have not been any changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the fiscal quarter ended September 30, 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

PART II OTHER INFORMATION 
 
 ITEM 1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS 
 See Note 21 Contingencies to the Unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements for a description of our material legal proceedings. That information is incorporated into this item by reference. 
 
 ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS 
 An investment in our common stock involves significant risk. We describe the most significant risks that management believes affect or could affect us under Part I, Item 1.A. of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. Understanding these risks is important to understanding any statement in such reports and in our subsequent SEC filings (including this Form 10-Q) and to evaluating an investment in our common stock. You should carefully read and consider the risks and uncertainties described therein together with all the other information included or incorporated by reference in such Annual Report and in our subsequent SEC filings before you make any decision regarding an investment in our common stock. You should also consider the information set forth under Forward-Looking Statements. If any of the risks actually occur, our business, financial condition, liquidity and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. If this were to happen, the value of our common stock could significantly decline, and you could lose some or all of your investment. 
 There have been no material changes to the risks described in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, other than the following: 
 Our ability to conclude our refinancing transaction and redeem all of our PMC Senior Secured Notes and our Onity Senior Secured Notes depends on the closing of the MAV sale, the timing of which is uncertain due to the various required regulatory approvals. If we are not able to close the MAV sale by March 3, 2025, we will be required to repay the escrowed proceeds of the new PHH Senior Notes due 2029, including accrued interest, and our PMC Senior Secured Notes and Onity Senior Secured Notes will not be redeemed and will remain outstanding. If this were to happen, we cannot guarantee that we would be able to refinance the PMC Senior Secured Notes and Onity Senior Secured Notes on equally favorable terms prior to their maturity dates of March 2026 and March 2027, respectively, which could have a material adverse impact on our liquidity and financial condition and could raise concerns among investors, regulators, and current or potential contractual counterparties. 
 The net proceeds of our PHH Senior Notes that closed on November 6, 2024 were placed into escrow, together with approximately 23 million additional cash from Onity. It is a condition to the release of funds from the escrow account that the MAV sale has been closed. Closing of the MAV sale requires the approval of various state regulators as well as the approval of the GSEs. Pursuant to the terms of our refinancing agreement, if the MAV sale does not occur on or prior to March 3, 2025, we will be required to redeem all of the new PHH Senior Notes at a redemption price equal to 100 of the initial issue price of the notes, plus accrued and unpaid interest. In addition, we will be unable to redeem our outstanding PMC Senior Secured Notes due March 2026 with a UPB of 289.1 million and our Onity Senior Secured Notes due March 2027 with a UPB of 285.0 million. As a result, we will need to seek an alternative refinancing solution for these notes and we cannot guarantee that we will be able to obtain such refinancing on favorable terms, or at all, prior to the notes respective maturity dates. In addition, we will be unable to capture the expected benefits of the refinancing and the MAV sale, and third parties such as future debt investors and other potential lending sources may be disincentivized to extend credit to us, potential clients and contractual counterparties may be less inclined to enter business arrangements with us, and regulators may raise concerns during licensing renewal, examinations and other discussions. If any of these events occur, our access to liquidity and financial condition could be materially adversely impacted.

 SERIES A PERPETUAL CONVERTIBLE PREFERRED STOCK 

Pursuant to Sections 607.0602 and 607.1006 
 of the Florida Business Corporation Act 

Ocwen Financial Corporation, a Florida corporation (the Company ), certifies that pursuant to the authority contained in its Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation (the Articles of Incorporation ), and in accordance with the provisions of Sections 607.0602 and 607.1006 of the Florida Business Corporation Act, the Board of Directors of the Company (the Board of Directors at a meeting duly called and held on October 2, 2012 duly approved and adopted the following resolution, which resolution remains in full force and effect on the date hereof 
 RESOLVED, that pursuant to the authority vested in the Board of Directors by the Articles of Incorporation, the Board of Directors does hereby designate, create, authorize and provide for the issue of a series of preferred stock having a par value of 0.01 per share, with a liquidation preference of 1,000 per share (the Liquidation Preference ), which shall be designated as Series A Perpetual Convertible Preferred Stock, consisting of Two Hundred Thousand (200,000) shares having the following voting powers, preferences and relative, participating, optional and other special rights, and qualifications, limitations and restrictions 
 1. Designation and Number of Shares . The series of preferred stock shall be designated as Series A Perpetual Convertible Preferred Stock , with a par value of 0.01 per share (the Series A Preferred Stock ), and the number of shares so authorized and designated shall be Two Hundred Thousand (200,000). At all times the Company will have sufficient shares authorized and will take all actions necessary to authorize additional shares if required, in each case, to meet its obligations hereunder. 
 2. Ranking . The Series A Preferred Stock shall, with respect to payment of dividends, redemption and distributions upon the liquidation, winding-up and dissolution of the Company, rank (i) senior to all classes of Common Stock of the Company and to each other class of capital stock or series of preferred stock established after the date hereof by the Board of Directors, the terms of which do not expressly provide that it ranks senior to or on a parity with the Series A Preferred Stock as to dividends, redemptions and distributions upon the liquidation, winding-up and dissolution of the Company (collectively referred to with the Common Stock of the Company as Junior Securities (ii) on a parity with any additional shares of Series A Preferred Stock issued by the Company in the future (subject to compliance with Section 8) and any other class of capital stock or series of preferred stock issued by the Company, the terms of which expressly provide that such class or series will rank on a parity with the Series A Preferred Stock as to dividends, redemptions and distributions upon the liquidation, winding-up and dissolution of the Company (collectively referred to as Parity Securities and (iii) junior to each class of capital stock or series of preferred stock issued by the Company (subject to compliance with Section 8), the terms of which expressly provide that such class or series will rank senior to the Series A Preferred Stock as to dividends, redemptions and distributions upon the liquidation, winding-up and dissolution of the Company (collectively referred to as Senior Securities ). For the avoidance of doubt, a 
 12 

security shall not be deemed a Parity Security unless the dividend is payable in kind when the dividend of the Series A Preferred Stock is paid in kind, and a security shall not be deemed not to be a Parity Security solely because the dividend on such security has a coupon equal to or greater than the Series A Preferred Stock. 
 3. Dividends . 
 (a) Dividends . Holders of Series A Preferred Stock shall be entitled to receive, to the fullest extent permitted by law, mandatory and cumulative dividends payable quarterly in arrears with respect to each dividend period ending on and including the last calendar day of each quarter ending December 31, March 31, June 30 and September 30, respectively (each such period, a Dividend Period and each such date, a Dividend Payment Date ), at the rate per share equal to the greater of (x) 3.75 per annum multiplied by the Liquidation Preference and (y) in the event the Company pays a regular quarterly dividend on its Common Stock in such quarter, the rate per share payable in respect of such quarterly dividend (treating each holder of shares of Series A Preferred Stock as being the holder of the number of shares of Common Stock into which such holder s shares would be converted if such shares were converted pursuant to the provisions of Section 5 hereof as of the record date for the determination of holders of Common Stock entitled to receive such dividend) provided that the initial Dividend Period will commence on the Series A Preferred Stock Issue Date and end on the second Dividend Payment Date thereafter. The record date for payment of quarterly dividends on the Series A Preferred Stock will be the 15th day of the calendar month of the applicable Dividend Payment Date, whether or not such date is a Trading Day. If any Dividend Payment Date is not a Trading Day, the applicable payment shall be due on the next succeeding Trading Day. 
 (b) Special Dividends . If and to the extent the Company intends to pay any dividend or make a distribution on shares of Common Stock (whether or not in the form of cash, but excluding any dividend which results in an adjustment to the Conversion Price as described below) other than a dividend as provided in 3(a) above (a Special Dividend ), then any such dividend shall be payable to the holders of shares of Common Stock and Series A Preferred Stock on a pari passu , pro rata basis (treating each holder of shares of Series A Preferred Stock as being the holder of the number of shares of Common Stock into which such holder s shares of Series A Preferred Stock had been converted if such shares were converted pursuant to the provisions of Section 5 hereof as of the record date for the determination of holders of Common Stock entitled to receive such dividend). The record date for payment of any Special Dividend will be the same date as the record date for payment of the Special Dividend to holders of Common Stock, whether or not such date is a Trading Day. The payment date of any Special Dividend will be the same date on which payment of such dividend is made to holders of Common Stock Special Dividend Payment Date ). 
 
 (c) Company s Ability to Pay Dividends in Cash or Kind . Dividends shall be paid in full, in cash Cash Dividend for each Dividend Period on the applicable Dividend Payment Date provided, that at the Company s option, the Company may pay all or any percentage of the dividends contemplated by paragraphs (a) and (b) above in cash or additional shares of Series A Preferred Stock PIK Dividends ). The Company shall provide the holders with at least five (5) Trading Days notice of its election to pay all or any percentage of such dividend in shares of Series A Preferred Stock (the Company may indicate in such notice that the election contained in such notice shall continue for later periods until revised by a subsequent notice). If and to the extent that the Company does not for any reason pay the entire dividend payable for a particular Dividend Period either as a Cash Dividend, or a combination of Cash Dividend and PIK Dividend, on the applicable Dividend Payment Date for such period (whether or not the payment of dividends is permitted under applicable law or such dividends are declared by the Board of Directors of the Company), such unpaid dividends shall be paid in kind by issuance of additional Series A Preferred Stock (the Additional PIK Dividends to the holders of the Series A Preferred Stock as of the record date for the applicable Dividend Payment Date, on the first date on which such Additional PIK Dividend can be paid in accordance with applicable law. 
 (d) Dividend Calculations . Dividends on the Series A Preferred Stock shall be calculated on the basis of a 360-day year, consisting of twelve (12), thirty (30) calendar day periods, and shall accrue daily commencing on the Series A Preferred Stock Issue Date, and shall be deemed to accrue from such date whether or not earned or declared and whether or not there are profits, surplus or other funds of the Company legally available for the payment of dividends. Except as otherwise provided herein, if at any time the Company pays dividends partially in cash and partially in shares of Series A Preferred Stock, then such payment shall be distributed ratably among 
 13 

the holders of Series A Preferred Stock based upon the number of shares of Series A Preferred Stock held by each such holder on such Dividend Payment Date or Special Dividend Payment Date, as applicable. When a dividend or part thereof is paid in additional shares of Series A Preferred Stock, such number of additional shares shall be calculated by dividing the amount of such dividend or part thereof that would otherwise be paid in cash by the Liquidation Preference of a share of Series A Preferred Stock. For purposes of determining whether funds are legally available for any dividends pursuant to this Section 3, the assets of the Company shall, to the fullest extent permitted by law, be valued at the highest amount permissible under applicable law. 
 (e) Conversion Prior to or Following a Record Date . If the Conversion Date for any shares of Series A Preferred Stock is prior to the close of business on the record date for a dividend as provided in paragraphs (a) or (b) above, the holder of such shares shall not be entitled to any dividend in respect of such record date. If the Conversion Date for any shares of Series A Preferred Stock is after the close of business on the record date for a dividend as provided in paragraphs (a) or (b) above but prior to the corresponding Dividend Payment Date or Special Dividend Payment Date, as applicable, the holder of such shares as of the applicable record date shall be entitled to receive such dividend, notwithstanding the conversion of such shares prior to the applicable Dividend Payment Date or Special Dividend Payment Date, as applicable. 
 
 4. Transfer . The holders of shares of Series A Preferred Stock shall only be permitted to Transfer such shares of Series A Preferred Stock to a Permitted Transferee. 
 5. Conversion Rights . 
 (a) At the option of the holder, each share of Series A Preferred Stock may be converted into Common Stock at any time, unless previously redeemed (the Conversion Right ). Upon exercise of the Conversion Right as provided in this Section 5, the Company shall deliver to the holder the number of shares of Common Stock equal to the quotient obtained by dividing (i) the value of a share of Series A Preferred Stock, which shall be the Liquidation Preference (plus any accrued but unpaid dividends thereon, whether or not declared) on the Conversion Date, by (ii) the Conversion Price in effect on the Conversion Date to determine the number of shares of Common Stock issuable upon conversion of each share of Series A Preferred Stock. Immediately following such conversion, the rights of the holders of converted Series A Preferred Stock shall cease and the persons entitled to receive the Common Stock upon the conversion of Series A Preferred Stock shall be treated for all purposes as having become the owners of such Common Stock. 
 (b) To convert Series A Preferred Stock, a holder must (A) surrender the certificate or certificates evidencing the shares of Series A Preferred Stock to be converted, duly endorsed in a form satisfactory to the Company, at the office of the Company or Transfer Agent for the Series A Preferred Stock, (B) notify the Company at such office that he elects to convert Series A Preferred Stock and the number of shares he wishes to convert, (C) state in writing the name or names in which he wishes the certificate or certificates for shares of Common Stock to be issued, and (D) pay any transfer or similar tax required by clause (d) below to be paid by the holder. In the event that a holder fails to notify the Company of the number of shares of Series A Preferred Stock which he wishes to convert, he shall be deemed to have elected to convert all shares represented by the certificate or certificates surrendered for conversion. The date on which the holder satisfies all those requirements is the Conversion Date . As soon as practical following the Conversion Date, the Company shall deliver a certificate for the number of full shares of Common Stock issuable upon the conversion, and a new certificate representing the unconverted portion, if any, of the shares of Series A Preferred Stock represented by the certificate or certificates surrendered for conversion. The person in whose name the Common Stock certificate is registered shall be treated as the stockholder of record on and after the Conversion Date. The holder of record of a share of Series A Preferred Stock at the close of business on a record date with respect to the payment of dividends on the Series A Preferred Stock in accordance with Section 3 hereof will be entitled to receive such dividends with respect to such share of Series A Preferred Stock on the corresponding Dividend Payment Date, notwithstanding the conversion of such share after such record date and prior to such dividend payment date. If a holder of Series A Preferred Stock converts more than one share at a time, the number of full shares of Common Stock issuable upon conversion shall be based on the total Liquidation Preferences of all shares of Series A Preferred Stock converted. 
 
 14 

(c) The Company shall not issue any fractional shares of Common Stock upon conversion of Series A Preferred Stock. Instead the Company shall pay a cash adjustment based upon the closing price of the Common Stock on the principal securities exchange on which the Common Stock is then listed on the Business Day prior to the Conversion Date. 
 (d) If a holder converts shares of Series A Preferred Stock, the Company shall pay any documentary, stamp or similar issue or transfer tax due on the issue of shares of Common Stock upon the conversion. However, the holder shall pay any such tax that is due because the shares are issued in a name other than the holder s name. 
 (e) The Company has reserved (and shall keep available and free from preemptive rights) and shall continue to reserve out of its authorized but unissued Common Stock or its Common Stock held in treasury a sufficient number of shares of Common Stock to permit the conversion of the Series A Preferred Stock in full. All shares of Common Stock that may be issued upon conversion of Series A Preferred Stock shall be fully paid and nonassessable. The Company shall use commercially reasonable efforts to comply with all securities laws regulating the offer and delivery of shares of Common Stock upon conversion of Series A Preferred Stock and shall endeavor to list such shares on each national securities exchange or automated quotation system on which the Common Stock is listed. All shares of Common Stock that are issued upon the exercise of Series A Preferred Stock shall, upon issuance, be validly issued, not subject to any preemptive rights, and, be free from all taxes, liens, security interests, charges, and other encumbrances with respect to the issuance thereof (collectively, Encumbrances ), other than taxes in respect of any transfer occurring contemporaneously with such issue and Encumbrances created by the holder. 
 (f) In case the Company shall pay or make a dividend or other distribution on any outstanding class of capital stock of the Company payable in Common Stock, the Conversion Price in effect at the opening of business on the day following the date fixed for the determination of stockholders entitled to receive such dividend or other distribution shall be reduced by multiplying such Conversion Price by a fraction the numerator of which shall be the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding at the close of business on the date fixed for such determination and the denominator of which shall be the sum of such number of shares outstanding at the close of business on the date fixed for such determination and the total number of shares constituting such dividend or other distribution, such reduction to become effective retroactively to a date immediately following the close of business on the record date for the determination of the holders entitled to such dividends and distributions. For the purposes of this Section 5(f), the number of shares of Common Stock at any time outstanding shall not include shares held in the treasury of the Company. The Company will not pay any dividend or make any distribution on shares of Common Stock held in the treasury of the Company. 
 (g) In case the Company shall issue or sell Common Stock or Common Stock Equivalents at a price per share less than 95 of the Current Market Price per share of the Common Stock on the date fixed for the determination of stockholders entitled to receive such Common Stock or Common Stock Equivalents (treating the price per share of Common Stock, in the case of the issuance of any Common Stock Equivalent, as equal to (x) the sum of the price for such Common Stock Equivalent plus any additional consideration payable (without regard to any anti dilution adjustments) upon the conversion, exchange or exercise of such Common Stock Equivalent divided by (y) the number of shares of Common Stock initially underlying such Common Stock Equivalent), the Conversion Price in effect at the opening of business on the day following the date fixed for such determination shall be reduced by multiplying such Conversion Price by a fraction (I) the numerator of which shall be the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding at the close of business on the date fixed for such determination plus the number of shares of Common Stock which the aggregate of the offering price of the total number of shares of Common Stock so offered for subscription, purchase or acquisition would purchase at such Current Market Price (or, in the case of Common Stock Equivalents, the number of shares of Common Stock which the aggregate consideration received by the Company upon the issuance of such Common Stock Equivalents and receivable by the Company upon the conversion, exchange or exercise of such Common Stock Equivalents would purchase at the Current Market Price of one share of Common Stock on the Relevant Date) and (II) the denominator of which shall be the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding at the close of business on the date fixed for such determination plus the number of shares of Common Stock so offered for subscription, purchase or acquisition (or, in the case of Common Stock Equivalents, the maximum number of shares of Common Stock into which such Common Stock Equivalents initially may convert, exchange or be exercised). 
 15 

Such reduction shall become effective immediately on the issuance or sale of such Common Stock or Common Stock Equivalents. However, upon the expiration of any Common Stock Equivalent to purchase Common Stock, the issuance of which resulted in an adjustment in the Conversion Price pursuant to this Section 5(g), if any such Common Stock Equivalent shall expire and shall not have been exercised, the Conversion Price shall be recomputed immediately upon such expiration and effective immediately upon such expiration shall be increased to the price it would have been (but reflecting any other adjustments to the Conversion Price made pursuant to the provisions of this Section 5 after the issuance of such Common Stock Equivalents) had the adjustment of the Conversion Price made upon the issuance of such Common Stock Equivalents been made on the basis of offering for subscription or purchase only that number of shares of Common Stock actually purchased upon the exercise of such Common Stock Equivalents. No further adjustment shall be made upon exercise of any Common Stock Equivalent if any adjustment shall be made upon the issuance of such security. For the purposes of this Section 5(g), the number of shares of Common Stock at any time outstanding shall not include shares held in the treasury of the Company. The Company will not issue any Common Stock Equivalents in respect of shares of Common Stock held in the treasury of the Company. In case at any time any shares of Common Stock or Common Stock Equivalents or any rights or options to purchase any shares of Common Stock or Common Stock Equivalents shall be issued or sold for cash, the consideration received therefor shall be deemed to be the amount received by the Company therefor, without deduction therefrom of any expenses incurred or any underwriting commissions or concessions or discounts paid or allowed by the Company in connection therewith. In case any shares of Common Stock or Common Stock Equivalents or any rights or options to purchase any Common Stock or Common Stock Equivalents shall be issued or sold for a consideration other than cash, the amount of the consideration other than cash received by the Company shall be deemed to be the fair market value of such consideration, without deduction therefrom of any expenses incurred or any underwriting commissions or concessions or discounts paid or allowed by the Company in connection therewith, as determined by a nationally recognized appraiser selected by the Board of Directors. 
 
 (h) In case the outstanding shares of Common Stock shall be subdivided into a greater number of shares of Common Stock or the outstanding shares of Common Stock shall be combined into a smaller number of shares, then the Conversion Price in effect at the opening of business on the day following the day upon which such subdivision becomes effective shall be reduced, and, conversely, in case the outstanding shares of Common Stock shall each be combined into a smaller number of shares of Common Stock, the Conversion Price in effect at the opening of business on the day following the day upon which such combination becomes effective shall be increased to equal the product of the Conversion Price in effect on such date and a fraction the numerator of which shall be the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to such subdivision or combination, as the case may be, and the denominator of which shall be the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately after such subdivision or combination, as the case may be. Such reduction or increase, as the case may be, shall become effective retroactively to the close of business on the day upon which such subdivision or combination becomes effective. 
 (i) In case a tender offer, exchange offer or other offer to repurchase made by the Company or any subsidiary of the Company for all or any portion of the Common Stock shall expire and such tender offer, exchange offer or other offer to repurchase shall involve the payment by the Company or such subsidiary of consideration per share of Common Stock having a fair market value (as determined by the Board of Directors or, to the extent permitted by applicable law, a duly authorized committee thereof, whose determination shall be conclusive and described in a resolution of the Board of Directors or such duly authorized committee thereof, as the case may be) at the last time (the Expiration Time tenders or exchanges may be made pursuant to such tender or exchange offer (as it shall have been amended) that exceeds by 5 or more the current market price per share of the Common Stock on the Trading Day next succeeding the Expiration Time, the Conversion Price shall be reduced so that the same shall equal the price determined by multiplying the Conversion Price in effect immediately prior to the Expiration Time by a fraction of which (I) the numerator shall be the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding (including any tendered or exchanged shares) on the Expiration Time multiplied by the Current Market Price per share of the Common Stock on the Trading Day next succeeding the Expiration Time and (II) the denominator shall be the sum of (x) the fair market value (determined as aforesaid) of the aggregate consideration payable to stockholders based on the acceptance (up to any maximum specified in the 
 16 

terms of the tender or exchange offer) of all shares validly tendered or exchanged and not withdrawn as of the Expiration Time (the shares deemed so accepted, up to any such maximum, being referred to as the Purchased Shares and (y) the product of the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding (less any Purchased Shares) on the Expiration Time and the Current Market Price per share of the Common Stock on the Trading Day next succeeding the Expiration Time, such reduction to become effective immediately prior to the opening of business on the day following the Expiration Time. For the purposes of this Section 5(i), the number of shares of Common Stock at any time outstanding shall not include shares held in the treasury of the Company. 
 (j) In case the Company shall issue to one or more Affiliates (other than (a) persons or entities who become Affiliates only as a result of such issuance, (b) directors, officers or employees of the Company under bona fide compensation or benefit arrangements or (c) upon the exercise of options or warrants or the conversion of convertible securities, issued for fair value at the time of any such issuance of options, warrants or convertible securities) Common Stock at a price per share less than the Current Market Price per share of the Common Stock on the date of such issuance (the Issue Date ), the Conversion Price in effect at the opening of business on the day following the Issue Date shall be reduced by multiplying such Conversion Price by a fraction the numerator of which shall be the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding at the close of business on the Issue Date plus the number of shares of Common Stock which the aggregate of the offering price of the total number of shares of Common Stock so issued would purchase at such Current Market Price and the denominator of which shall be the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding at the close of business on the Issue Date plus the number of shares of Common Stock so issued, such reduction to become effective immediately after the opening of business on the day following the Issue Date. For the purposes of this Section 5(j), the number of shares of Common Stock at any time outstanding shall not include shares held in the treasury of the Company. The Company will not pay any dividend or make any distribution on shares of Common Stock held in the treasury of the Company. 
 (k) In case the Company at any time or from time to time shall take any action affecting its Common Stock similar to or having an effect similar to any of the actions described in any of Sections 5(f) through 5(j) (but not including any action described in any such Section) then, and in each such case, the Conversion Price shall be adjusted in such manner and at such time as determined in good faith by the Board of Directors (and, for so long as the Initial Holders constitute the Majority Holders, the Majority Holders). 
 (l) The reclassification or change of Common Stock into securities, including securities other than Common Stock (other than any reclassification upon a consolidation or merger to which Section 6(a) below shall apply), shall be deemed to involve (A) a distribution of such securities other than Common Stock to all holders of Common Stock, and (B) a subdivision or combination, as the case may be, of the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to such reclassification into the number of Common Shares outstanding immediately thereafter (and the effective date of such reclassification shall be deemed to be the day upon which such subdivision becomes effective or the day upon which such combination becomes effective, as the case may be, and the day upon which such subdivision or combination becomes effective within the meaning of Section 5(h) above). 
 (m) All calculations under this Section 5 shall be made to the nearest 1 10,000 th of a cent or to the nearest 1 10,000 th of a share, as the case may be. 
 (n) The Company from time to time may reduce the Conversion Price if it considers such reductions to be advisable in order that any event treated for federal income tax purposes as a dividend of stock or stock rights will not be taxable to the holders of Common Stock by any amount. 
 (o) For purposes of this Section 5, Common Stock includes any stock of any class of the Company which has no preference in respect of dividends or of amounts payable in the event of any voluntary or involuntary liquidation, dissolution or winding-up of the Company and which is not subject to redemption by the Company. However, subject to the provisions of Section 6(a) below, shares issuable on conversion of shares of Series A Preferred Stock shall include only shares of the class designated as Common Stock of the Company on the Series A Preferred Stock Issue Date or shares of any class or classes resulting from any reclassification thereof and which have no preferences in respect of dividends or amounts payable in the event of any voluntary or involuntary liquidation, dissolution or winding-up of the Company and which are not subject to redemption by the Company provided that, if at any time there shall be more than one such resulting class, the shares of each such class then so issuable shall be substantially in the proportion which the total number of shares of such 
 17 

class resulting from all such reclassifications bears to the total number of shares of all such classes resulting from all such reclassifications. 
 (p) No adjustment in the Conversion Price shall reduce the Conversion Price below the then par value of the Common Stock. 
 (q) If (A) the Company takes any action which requires an adjustment in the Conversion Price pursuant to Section 5 (B) the Company consolidates or merges with, or transfers all or substantially all of its assets to, another corporation, and stockholders of the Company must approve the transaction or (C) there is a dissolution or liquidation of the Company the Company shall mail to holders of the Series A Preferred Stock, first class, postage prepaid, a notice stating the proposed record or effective date, as the case may be. The Company shall mail the notice at least ten (10) days before such date. However, failure to mail the notice or any defect in it shall not affect the validity of any transaction referred to in clause (A), (B) or (C) of this Section. Whenever the Conversion Price is adjusted, the Company shall promptly mail to holders of Series A Preferred Stock, first class, postage prepaid, a notice of the adjustment. The Company shall file with the Transfer Agent for the Series A Preferred Stock, if other than the Company, a certificate from the Company s chief financial officer briefly stating the facts requiring the adjustment and the manner of computing it. 
 (r) In any case in which this Section 5 shall require that an adjustment as a result of any event becomes effective from and after a record date, the Company may elect to defer until after the occurrence of such event the issuance to the holder of any shares of Series A Preferred Stock converted after such record date and before the occurrence of such event of the additional shares of Common Stock issuable upon such conversion over and above the shares issuable on the basis of the Conversion Price in effect immediately prior to adjustment provided , however , that if such event shall not have occurred and authorization of such event shall be rescinded by the Company, the Conversion Price shall be recomputed immediately upon such rescission to the price that would have been in effect had such event not been authorized, provided that such rescission is permitted by and effective under applicable laws. 
 6. Change of Control Liquidation Event . 
 (a) Change of Control . In the case of any Change in Control of the Company, then, upon consummation of such transaction, each holder of a share of Series A Preferred Stock shall be entitled to receive in respect of such share the greater of (i) the Liquidation Preference plus accrued and unpaid dividends thereon, whether or not declared, if any, or (ii) the amount such holder would receive if such holder converted such share of Series A Preferred Stock into the kind and amount of securities, cash or other assets receivable upon the consummation of the Change in Control by a holder of the number of shares of Common Stock into which such share of Series A Preferred Stock might have been converted immediately prior to such Change in Control (assuming such holder of Common Stock failed to exercise any rights of election and received per share the kind and amount of consideration receivable per share by a plurality of non-electing shares). Appropriate adjustment (as determined by the Board of Directors) shall be made in the application of the provisions herein set forth with respect to the rights and interests thereafter of the holders of Series A Preferred Stock, to the end that the provisions set forth herein (including provisions with respect to changes in and other adjustment of the Conversion Price) shall thereafter be applicable, as nearly as reasonably may be, in relation to any shares of stock or other securities or property thereafter deliverable upon the conversion of Series A Preferred Stock. If this Section 6(a) applies, Sections 5(f), 5(h) and 5(l) do not apply. 
 (b) Liquidation Event . Upon any Liquidation Event of the Company, each holder of shares of the Series A Preferred Stock will be entitled to payment out of the assets of the Company available for distribution, before any distribution or payment out of such assets may be made to the holders of any Junior Securities, and subject to the rights of the holders of any Senior Securities or Parity Securities upon liquidation and the rights of the Company s creditors, of an amount equal to the Liquidation Preference plus accrued and unpaid dividends thereon, whether or not declared. After payment in full of the Liquidation Preference plus accrued and unpaid dividends thereon to which holders of Series A Preferred Stock are entitled, such holders will not be entitled to any further participation in any distribution of assets of the Company. If, upon any Liquidation Event of the Company, the amounts payable with respect to the Series A Preferred Stock and any other Parity Securities are not paid in full, the holders of the Series A Preferred Stock and such Parity Securities will share equally and ratably in any distribution of assets of the Company in proportion to the full liquidation preference and accumulated and unpaid dividends, if any, and other amounts payable in such event, to which each is entitled. 
 18 

The following shall be regarded as Liquidation Events within the meaning of this Section 5 (without limitation) (a) the commencement of a voluntary or involuntary case with respect to the Company or any subsidiary holding all or substantially all of the Company s assets (on a consolidated basis) pursuant to or within the meaning of Title 11 of the United States Code, (b) the appointment of a custodian for all or substantially all of the assets of the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, and (c) a general assignment by the Company for the benefit of its creditors. To the maximum extent that any liquidating distribution is made in a combination of cash and property other than cash, the liquidating distributions to the holders of the Series A Preferred shall be made in cash to the maximum extent possible, in preference and priority to the liquidating distribution payable to any other capital stock, other than Parity Stock (in which case, such distribution in cash shall be made pro rata) or Senior Stock. Whenever the distribution provided for in this Section shall be payable in property other than cash, the value of such distribution shall be the fair market value of such property as determined in good faith by the Board of Directors. 
 7. Redemptions . 
 (a) The shares of Series A Preferred Stock shall be redeemable, at the option of the Company, in whole, or, from time to time, in part, at any time beginning on the second anniversary of the Series A Preferred Stock Issue Date, payable by the Company through the issuance of shares of Common Stock. The number of shares of Common Stock to be delivered by the Company with respect to the shares of Series A Preferred Stock being redeemed (the Redemption Payment ), shall be equal to (1) the Applicable Redemption Amount (as defined below) per share of the Series A Preferred Stock being redeemed, divided by (2) the Current Market Price on the Redemption Date.

Any accrued dividends not declared and paid on any Dividend Payment Date will accrue dividends at the Dividend Rate. If any Dividend Payment Date is not a Business Day, then the dividend which would otherwise have been payable on such Dividend Payment Date will be paid on the next succeeding Business Day, and no additional dividends or other sums will accrue on the amount so payable for the period from and after such Dividend Payment Date to that next succeeding Business Day. Business Day means any day on which The New York Stock Exchange is open for trading and which is not a Saturday, a Sunday or other day on which banks in New York City are authorized or required by law to close. The amount of dividends payable in respect of each Dividend Period shall be computed on the basis of a 360-day year consisting of twelve 30-day months. Dividends on the Series B Preferred Stock, if declared, will be payable on each Dividend Payment Date to holders of record as they appear in the Company s stock records for the Series B Preferred Stock at the close of business, New York City time, on the applicable record date, which is the first day of the month in which the applicable Dividend Payment Date occurs (March 1, June 1, September 1 or December 1, as applicable), except that in the case of payments of dividends in arrears, the record date with respect to a Dividend Payment Date will be such date as may be designated by the Board, provided that such record date may not be retroactive. Except as otherwise provided herein, if at any time the Company pays dividends in part and not in full, then such payment shall be distributed ratably among the holders of Series B Preferred Stock based upon the number of shares of Series B Preferred Stock held by each such holder on such Dividend Payment Date, as applicable. So long as shares of Series B Preferred Stock are held of record by the nominee of the Securities Depository, declared dividends will be paid to the Securities Depository in same-day funds on each Dividend Payment Date.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, dividends on the Series B Preferred Stock shall accrue during any period of time in which the restrictions referred to in this Section 4(b) prohibit the payment of dividends, regardless of whether (i) the Company has earnings, (ii) there are funds legally available for the payment of such dividends or (iii) such dividends are authorized or declared.

 (d) Payment of Accrued and Unpaid Dividends . Accumulated dividends in arrears for any past Dividend Period may be declared by the Board and paid on any date fixed by the Board, whether or not a Dividend Payment Date, to holders of the Series B Preferred Stock on the record date for such payment, which may not be more than 60 days, nor less than 15 days, before such payment date. Subject to the next succeeding sentence, if all accumulated dividends in arrears on all outstanding Series B Preferred Stock and any Parity Securities have not been declared and paid, or sufficient funds for the payment thereof have not been set apart, payment of accumulated dividends in arrears will be made in order of their respective Dividend Payment Dates, commencing with the earliest. If less than all dividends payable with respect to all Series B Preferred Stock and any Parity Securities are paid, any partial payment will be made pro rata with respect to the Series B Preferred Stock and any Parity Securities entitled to a dividend payment at such time in proportion to the aggregate amounts remaining due in respect of such shares at such time.

ARTICLE II REGISTRATION RIGHTS 
 Section 2.01 Registration Rights . 
 (a) Shelf Registration . The Company shall prepare and file with the SEC a Shelf Registration Statement registering the public resale of all Registrable Securities on the terms and conditions specified in this Section 2.01 (a Registration Statement and shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to cause such Registration Statement to become effective or be declared effective by the SEC within 180 days of the date of this Agreement (the date the Registration Statement becomes or is declared effective, the Effective Date ). The Registration Statement filed with the SEC pursuant to this Section 2.01(a) shall be on Form S-3 or, if Form S-3 is not then available to the Company, on Form S-1 or such other form of registration statement as is then available to effect a registration for resale of the Registrable Securities, covering the Registrable Securities, and shall contain a prospectus in such form as to permit any Selling Holder covered by such Registration Statement to sell such Registrable Securities pursuant to Rule 415 under the Securities Act (or any successor or similar provision adopted by the SEC then in effect) at any time beginning on the Effective Date for such Registration Statement. 
 Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the SEC prevents the Company from including any or all of the Registrable Securities proposed to be registered under such Registration Statement due to limitations on the use of Rule 415 under the Securities Act for the resale of the Registrable Securities held by any Holder or otherwise, such Registration Statement shall register for resale such number of Registrable Securities which is equal to the maximum number of Registrable Securities as is permitted by the SEC. In such event, the number of Registrable Securities to be registered for each Selling Holder named in the Registration Statement shall be reduced pro rata among all such Selling Holders on the basis of the number of Registrable Securities held by each such Selling Holder or in such other manner as such Selling Holders may agree. In the event the SEC informs the Company that all of such Registrable Securities cannot, as a result of the application of Rule 415, be registered for resale on the Registration Statement, the Company agrees to promptly inform the Selling Holders thereof and use its commercially reasonable efforts to file amendments to the Registration Statement as required by the SEC, covering the maximum number of Registrable Securities permitted to be registered by the SEC, on Form S-3 or such other form available to register for resale such shares as a secondary offering. In accordance with the foregoing, the Company will use its reasonable best efforts to make inquiries and communicate with the SEC, including following the consummation of a disposition of any registered Registrable Securities, in order to register all such Registrable Securities of the Selling Holders as soon as the SEC no longer prevents the Company from including such Registrable Securities proposed to be registered under such Registration Statement. 
 A Registration Statement shall provide for the resale pursuant to any method or combination of methods legally available to, and requested by, the Selling Holders, including by way of an Underwritten Offering, if such an election has been made pursuant to Section 2.03 of this Agreement, and by way of Alternative Transactions. During the Effectiveness Period, the Company shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause a Registration Statement filed pursuant to this Section 2.01(a) to remain effective, and to be supplemented and amended to the extent necessary (including post-effective amendments) to ensure that such Registration Statement is available or, if not available, that another registration statement is available for the resale of the Registrable Securities until the date on which all Registrable Securities have ceased to be Registrable Securities. Within two Business Days of the Effective Date of a Registration Statement, the Company shall notify the Selling Holders of the effectiveness of such Registration Statement. When effective, a Registration Statement (including the documents incorporated therein by reference) will comply as to form in all material respects with all 
 4 

applicable requirements of the Securities Act and the Exchange Act and will not contain an untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading (in the case of any prospectus contained in such Registration Statement, in the light of the circumstances under which a statement is made). If the Managing Underwriter of any proposed Underwritten Offering of Registrable Securities determines in good faith that the inclusion of all of the Selling Holders Registrable Securities that the Selling Holders intend to include in such offering exceeds the number that can be sold in such offering without being likely to have an adverse effect on the price, timing or distribution of the Registrable Securities offered or the market for the Registrable Securities (such number, the Underwritten Offering Maximum Offering Size ), then the Registrable Securities to be included in such Underwritten Offering shall include the number of Registrable Securities that such Managing Underwriter advises the Company and the Holders in its good faith opinion can be sold without having such adverse effect, with such number to be allocated among such Selling Holders pro rata on the basis of the number of Registrable Securities held by each such Selling Holder or in such other manner as such Selling Holders may agree. 
 (b) Listing Rights . Within 45 days of receipt of a Listing Request, the Company will use commercially reasonable efforts to have the Preferred Shares listed on the NYSE, provided that, notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company shall not be required to effect such listing prior to the Effective Date of the Registration Statement. Any such Listing Request shall include such information regarding the Holders, the number of Holders, the market value or expected market value of the Preferred Shares and the proposed distribution of the Registrable Securities and any other information as shall be necessary to satisfy the Listing Requirements of the NYSE or indicate that such Listing Requirements will be satisfied following the consummation of a pending Underwritten Offering. The Company may require the Selling Holders to furnish in writing to the Company such information regarding such Holders and the proposed distribution of Registrable Securities by such Holders as required to satisfy the Listing Requirements of the Preferred Shares and to effect the listing of the Preferred Shares on the NYSE and each Selling Holder agrees to furnish promptly to the Company all such information upon request. 
 Section 2.02 Suspension Rights . 
 Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, the Company may, upon written notice to (i) all Holders whose Registrable Securities are to be included in a Registration Statement, delay the filing or effectiveness of a Registration Statement required under Section 2.01(a), or (ii) any Holder whose Registrable Securities are included in a Registration Statement or other registration statement contemplated by this Agreement, suspend such Holder s use of any prospectus that is a part of such Registration Statement or other registration statement (in which event the Holder shall discontinue sales of Registrable Securities pursuant to such Registration Statement or other registration statement contemplated by this Agreement but may settle any previously made sales of Registrable Securities) following the effectiveness of such Registration Statement or other registration statement if the Company (x) is pursuing an acquisition, merger, reorganization, disposition or other similar transaction and the Company determines in good faith that the Company s ability to pursue or consummate such a transaction would be materially adversely affected by any required disclosure of such transaction in such Registration Statement or other registration statement or (y) has experienced some other material non-public event the disclosure of which at such time, in the good faith judgment of the Company, would materially adversely affect the Company provided, however, in no event, during any rolling twelve-month period, shall the filing or effectiveness of such Registration Statement be delayed, or such Selling Holders be suspended from selling Registrable Securities pursuant to such Registration Statement or other registration statement on more than two occasions, for more than 90 calendar days in any one instance, or for more than an aggregate of 120 calendar days.

Such indemnity shall remain in full force and effect regardless of any investigation made by or on behalf of such Selling Holder Indemnified Person, and shall survive the transfer of such securities by such Selling Holder. 
 (b) By Each Selling Holder . Each Selling Holder agrees severally and not jointly to indemnify and hold harmless the Company, its directors, officers, employees and agents and each Person, if any, who controls the Company within the meaning of the Securities Act or of the Exchange Act, and its directors, officers, employees and agents, to the same extent as the foregoing indemnity from the Company to the Selling Holders, but only with respect to information regarding such Selling Holder 
 11 

furnished in writing by or on behalf of such Selling Holder expressly for inclusion in such Registration Statement or any other registration statement contemplated by this Agreement, any preliminary prospectus, prospectus supplement or final prospectus contained therein, or any amendment or supplement thereof, or any free writing prospectus relating thereto provided, however , that the liability of each Selling Holder shall not be greater in amount than the dollar amount of the proceeds (net of any Selling Expenses) received by such Selling Holder from the sale of the Registrable Securities giving rise to such indemnification. 
 (c) Notice . Promptly after receipt by an indemnified party hereunder of notice of the commencement of any action, such indemnified party shall, if a claim in respect thereof is to be made against the indemnifying party hereunder, notify the indemnifying party in writing thereof, but the omission to so notify the indemnifying party shall not relieve it from any liability that it may have to any indemnified party other than under this Section 2.08 . In any action brought against any indemnified party, it shall notify the indemnifying party of the commencement thereof. The indemnifying party shall be entitled to participate in and, to the extent it shall wish, to assume and undertake the defense thereof with counsel reasonably satisfactory to such indemnified party and, after notice from the indemnifying party to such indemnified party of its election so to assume and undertake the defense thereof, the indemnifying party shall not be liable to such indemnified party under this Section 2.08 for any legal expenses subsequently incurred by such indemnified party in connection with the defense thereof other than reasonable costs of investigation and of liaison with counsel so selected provided, however , that, (i) if the indemnifying party and the indemnified party shall have mutually agreed in writing to the contrary, (ii) if the indemnifying party has failed to assume the defense or employ counsel reasonably acceptable to the indemnified party or (iii) if the defendants in any such action include both the indemnified party and the indemnifying party and counsel to the indemnified party shall have concluded that there may be defenses available to the indemnified party that are different from or additional to those available to the indemnifying party, or if the interests of the indemnified party reasonably may be deemed to conflict with the interests of the indemnifying party, then the indemnified party shall have the right to select a separate counsel and to assume such legal defense and otherwise to participate in the defense of such action, with the reasonable expenses and fees of such separate counsel and other reasonable expenses related to such participation to be reimbursed by the indemnifying party as incurred. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, no indemnifying party shall settle any action brought against any indemnified party with respect to which such indemnified party is entitled to indemnification hereunder without the consent of the indemnified party, unless the settlement thereof imposes no liability or obligation on, and includes a complete and unconditional release from all liability of, and does not contain any admission of wrongdoing by, the indemnified party. 
 (d) Contribution . If the indemnification provided for in this Section 2.08 is held by a court or government agency of competent jurisdiction to be unavailable to any indemnified party or is insufficient to hold them harmless in respect of any Losses, then each such indemnifying party, in lieu of indemnifying such indemnified party, shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a result of such Loss in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative fault of the indemnifying party on the one hand and of such indemnified party, on the other hand, in connection with the statements or omissions that resulted in such Losses, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations provided, however , that in no event shall such Selling Holder be required to contribute an aggregate amount in excess of the dollar amount of proceeds (net of Selling Expenses) received by such Selling Holder from the sale of Registrable Securities giving rise to such indemnification. The relative fault of the indemnifying party on the one hand and the indemnified party on the other shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact has been made by, or relates to, information supplied by such party, and the parties relative intent, knowledge, access to information and 
 12 

opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission. The parties hereto agree that it would not be just and equitable if contributions pursuant to this paragraph were to be determined by pro rata allocation or by any other method of allocation that does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to herein. The amount paid by an indemnified party as a result of the Losses referred to in the first sentence of this paragraph shall be deemed to include any legal and other expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in connection with investigating, defending or resolving any Loss that is the subject of this paragraph. No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Securities Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any Person who is not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation.
