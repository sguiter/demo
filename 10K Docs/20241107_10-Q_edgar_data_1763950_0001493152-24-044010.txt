FORWARD-LOOKING
STATEMENTS 

This
Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q contains forward-looking statements that involve substantial risks and uncertainties. We make such forward-looking
statements pursuant to the safe harbor provisions of the U.S. Private Securities Litigation Reform Act, Section 21E of the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and other federal securities laws. All statements, other than statements of historical fact, contained
in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, including statements regarding our strategy, future preclinical studies and clinical trials, future
expectations for existing preclinical studies and clinical trials, future financial position, projected costs, prospects, plans and objectives
of management, are forward-looking statements. The words anticipate, believe, contemplate, 
 could, estimate, expect, intend, seek, may, might, 
 plan, potential, predict, project, target, model ,
 objective , aim, upcoming , should, will would, or
the negative of these words or other similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements, although not all forward-looking
statements contain these words. Forward-looking statements reflect our current views with respect to future events and are based on assumptions
and subject to risks and uncertainties. 

The
forward-looking statements in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q include, among other things, statements relating to: 

the potential advantages
 of our RADR platform in identifying drug candidates and patient populations that are likely to respond to a drug
 candidate; 

our strategic plans to
 advance the development of any of our drug candidates; 

our strategic plans to
 expand the number of data points that our RADR platform can access and analyze; 

our research and development
 efforts of our internal drug discovery and development programs and antibody drug conjugate (ADC) development program and the utilization
 of our RADR platform to streamline the drug development process; 

the initiation, timing,
 progress, and results of our preclinical studies or clinical trials for any of our drug candidates; 

our intention to leverage
 artificial intelligence, machine learning and biomarker data to streamline the drug development process and to identify patient populations
 that would likely respond to a drug candidate; 

our plans to discover and
 develop drug candidates and to maximize their commercial potential by advancing such drug candidates ourselves or in collaboration
 with others; 

our expectations regarding
 our ability to fund our operating expenses and capital expenditure requirements with our existing cash and cash equivalents; 

our ability to secure sufficient
 funding and alternative sources of funding to support our existing and proposed preclinical studies and clinical trials; 

our estimates regarding
 the potential market opportunity for our drug candidates we or any of our collaborators may in the future develop; 

our anticipated growth
 strategies and our ability to manage the expansion of our business operations effectively; 

our expectations related
 to future expenses and expenditures; 

our ability to keep up
 with rapidly changing technologies and evolving industry standards, including our ability to achieve technological advances; 

ii 

our ability to source our
 needs for skilled labor in the fields of artificial intelligence, genomics, biology, oncology and drug development; and 

the impact of government
 laws and regulations on the development and commercialization of our drug candidates and ADC development program. 

We
may not actually achieve the plans, intentions, or expectations disclosed in our forward-looking statements, and you should not place
undue reliance on our forward-looking statements. Actual results or events could differ materially from the plans, intentions, and expectations
disclosed in the forward-looking statements we make. We have included important factors in the cautionary statements included in this
Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and in the Risk Factors section of our Annual Report on Form 10-K 2023 Form 10-K ), for the
year ended December 31, 2023 filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, or the SEC, on March 18, 2024, and have identified other
factors such as the results of our clinical trials, and the impact of competition, that we believe could cause actual results or events
to differ materially from the forward-statements that we make. Furthermore, we operate in a competitive and rapidly changing environment.
New risks and uncertainties emerge from time to time, and it is not possible for us to predict all risks and uncertainties that could
have an impact on the forward-looking statements contained in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. 

You
should read this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and the documents that we file with the SEC with the understanding that our actual future
results may be materially different from what we expect. These forward-looking statements are based on management s current expectations.
These statements are neither promises nor guarantees, but involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other important factors
that may cause our actual results, performance or achievements to be materially different from any future results, performance or achievements
expressed or implied by the forward-looking statements. Factors that may cause actual results to differ materially from current expectations
include, among other things, those listed elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and those listed under the Risk Factors section
of our 2023 Form 10-K. You may access our 2023 Form 10-K under the investor SEC filings tab of our website at www.lanternpharma.com or
on the SEC s website at www.sec.gov. Given these uncertainties, you should not rely on these forward-looking statements as predictions
of future events. The forward-looking statements contained in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q are made as of the date of this Quarterly
Report, and we do not assume any obligation to update any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future
events or otherwise, except as required by applicable law. 

In
addition, statements that we believe and similar statements reflect our beliefs and opinions on the relevant subject. These
statements are based upon information available to us as of the date of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, and while we believe such
information forms a reasonable basis for such statements, such information may be limited or incomplete. Our statements should not be
read to indicate that we have conducted an exhaustive inquiry into, or review of, all potentially available relevant information. These
statements are inherently uncertain and investors are cautioned not to unduly rely upon these statements. 

Unless
the context requires otherwise, references to the Company, Lantern, we, us, and
 our in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q refer to Lantern Pharma Inc., a Delaware corporation, and, where appropriate,

Therapeutics 

In
May 2021, the Company entered into a Collaboration Agreement with Actuate Therapeutics, Inc. Actuate ), a clinical stage

the Company received restricted shares of Actuate stock, subject to meeting certain conditions of the collaboration, as well as
the potential to receive additional Actuate stock if results from the collaboration are utilized in future development efforts. In 2023,
the term of the Collaboration Agreement was extended to continue until March 31, 2024. We are currently in discussions with Actuate to
extend the Collaboration Agreement. Certain affiliates of Bios Partners beneficially own greater than 10 of the Company s common
stock and also hold substantial beneficial ownership interests in Actuate. Through September 30, 2024, no revenues have been recognized
under the Collaboration Agreement.

Item
2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. 

You
should read the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and plan of operations together with our condensed consolidated
financial statements and the related notes appearing elsewhere in this Quarterly Report. In addition to historical information, this
discussion and analysis contains forward-looking statements that involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions. Our actual results may
differ materially from the plans, intentions, expectations and other forward-looking statements included in the discussion below. Factors
that could cause or contribute to such differences include, but are not limited to, those identified below, and those factors discussed
in the Risk Factors section of our 2023 Form 10-K on file with the SEC. 

Overview 

We
are a clinical stage biotechnology company, focused on leveraging artificial intelligence A.I. ), machine learning and
genomic data to streamline the drug development process and to identify the patients that will benefit from our targeted oncology therapies.
Our portfolio of therapies consists of small molecules that others have tried, but failed, to develop into an approved commercialized
drug, as well as new compounds that we are developing with the assistance of our proprietary A.I. platform and our biomarker driven approach.
Our A.I. platform, known as RADR , currently includes more than 100 billion data points, and uses big data analytics (combining
molecular data, drug efficacy data, data from historical studies, data from scientific literature, phenotypic data from trials and publications,
and mechanistic pathway data) and machine learning to rapidly uncover biologically relevant genomic signatures correlated to drug response,
and then identify the cancer patients that we believe may benefit most from our compounds. This data-driven, genomically-targeted and
biomarker-driven approach allows us to pursue a transformational drug development strategy that identifies, rescues or develops, and
advances potential small molecule drug candidates at what we believe is a fraction of the time and cost associated with traditional cancer
drug development. 

We
now have active clinical programs for our three lead small molecule drug candidates: LP-300, LP-184, and LP-284. These programs are focused
on multiple important cancer indications, including both solid tumors and blood cancers. We have established a wholly-owned subsidiary,
Starlight Therapeutics, to focus exclusively on the clinical development of our promising opportunities for central nervous system CNS and brain cancers, many of which have no effective treatment options. We are also advancing an antibody-drug conjugate ADC program focused on developing highly specific ADCs with highly potent drug-payloads. 

Our
strategy is to both develop new drug candidates using our RADR platform, and other machine learning driven methodologies,
and to pursue the development of drug candidates that have undergone previous clinical trial testing or that may have been halted in
development or deprioritized because of insufficient clinical trial efficacy (i.e., a meaningful treatment benefit relevant for the disease
or condition under study as measured against the comparator treatment used in the relevant clinical testing) or for strategic reasons
by the owner or development team responsible for the compound. Importantly, these historical drug candidates appear to have been well-tolerated
in many instances, and often have considerable data from previous toxicity, tolerability and ADME (absorption, distribution, metabolism,
and excretion) studies that have been completed. Additionally, these drug candidates may also have a body of existing data supporting
the potential mechanism(s) by which they achieve their intended biologic effect, but often require more targeted trials in a stratified
group of patients to demonstrate statistically meaningful results. Our dual approach to both develop de-novo, biomarker-guided drug candidates
and rescue historical drug-candidates by leveraging A.I., recent advances in genomics, computational biology and cloud
computing is emblematic of a new era in drug development that is being driven by data-intensive approaches meant to de-risk development
and accelerate the clinical trial process. In this context, we intend to create a diverse portfolio of oncology drug candidates for further
development towards regulatory and marketing approval with the objective of establishing a leading A.I.-driven methodology for treating
the right patient with the right oncology therapy. 

A
key component of our strategy is to target specific cancer patient populations and treatment indications identified by leveraging our
RADR platform, a proprietary A.I. enabled engine created and owned by us. We believe the combination of our therapeutic
area expertise, our A.I. expertise, and our ability to identify and develop promising drug candidates through our collaborative relationships
with research institutions in selected areas of oncology gives us a significant competitive advantage. Our RADR platform
has been developed and refined over the last five years and integrates billions of data points immediately relevant for oncology drug
development and patient response prediction using artificial intelligence and proprietary machine learning algorithms. By identifying
clinical candidates, together with relevant genomic and phenotypic data, we believe our approach will help us design more efficient pre-clinical
studies, and more targeted clinical trials, thereby accelerating our drug candidates time to approval and eventually to market.
Although we have not yet applied for or received regulatory or marketing approval for any of our drug candidates, we believe our RADR 
 platform has the ability to reduce the cost and time to bring drug candidates to specifically targeted patient groups. We believe
we have developed a sustainable and scalable biopharma business model by combining a unique, oncology-focused big-data platform that
leverages artificial intelligence along with active clinical and preclinical programs that are being advanced in targeted cancer therapeutic
areas to address today s treatment needs. 

16 

Our
current portfolio consists of three lead drug candidates that are in clinical phases (known as LP-300, LP-184 and LP-284) and an Antibody
Drug Conjugate (ADC) program that is in preclinical research optimization. In January 2023, we formed a wholly owned subsidiary, Starlight
Therapeutics Inc. Starlight ), to develop drug candidate LP-184 s central nervous system (CNS) and brain cancer indications
 including glioblastoma (GBM), brain metastases (brain mets.), and several rare pediatric CNS cancers. Following the formation
of Starlight, we may also refer to the molecule LP-184, as it is developed in CNS indications, as STAR-001 . All of these
drug candidates and our ADC program are leveraging precision oncology, A.I. and genomic driven approaches to accelerate and direct development
efforts. 

We
are currently conducting a targeted phase 2 trial (the Harmonic trial) for LP-300 in never smoking patients with advanced non-small
cell lung cancer NSCLC in combination with chemotherapy, under an existing investigational new drug application. Our
candidate LP-184 has shown promising in-vitro and in vivo anticancer activity in multiple solid tumor indications (including
pancreatic, glioblastoma and triple negative breast cancer), and it is advancing in a Phase 1A clinical trial that commenced in mid-2023.
Our candidate LP-284 has shown promising in-vitro and in vivo anticancer activity in multiple hematological cancers, which
are distinct from the indications targeted by LP-184. LP-284 is advancing in a Phase 1A clinical trial that commenced in the fourth quarter
of 2023. 

Our
ADC program has also continued to advance. In 2023, we entered into a research collaboration with Bielefeld University in Germany focused
on development of ADCs utilizing cryptophycin as the ADC drug-payload. Cryptophycins are promising antitumor molecules that have demonstrated
potency at ultra-low, picomolar, concentrations. In a broad range of preclinical studies, the cryptophycin-ADC synthesized as part of
the Bielefeld collaboration demonstrated promising picomolar level potency and anti-tumor activity in multiple solid tumor cell lines,
including breast, bladder, colorectal, gastric, pancreatic and ovarian. 

In
addition to our lead drug candidates and ADC program, we also have an additional drug candidate, LP-100, that we believe has potential
for future development in combination with the class of anticancer agents known as PARP inhibitors (PARPi). For LP-100, as well as our
lead drug candidate LP-300, we are leveraging data from prior preclinical studies and clinical trials, along with insights generated
from our A.I. platform, to target the types of tumors and patient groups we believe will be most responsive to the drug. Both LP-100
and LP-300 showed promise in important patient subgroups, but failed pivotal Phase 3 trials when the overall results did not meet the
predefined clinical endpoints. We believe that this was due to a lack of biomarker-driven patient stratification. 

LP-300
has been studied in multiple randomized, controlled, multi-center non-small cell lung cancer, or NSCLC, trials that included administration
of either paclitaxel and cisplatin and/or docetaxel and cisplatin. LP-100 has previously been in a genomic signature guided phase 2 clinical
trial in Denmark for patients with metastatic castration resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC). 9 patients (out of a targeted enrollment
of 27) were treated in the trial. The median overall survival (OS) for the initial group of 9 patients was approximately 12.5 months,
which is an improvement over other similar fourth-line treatment regimens for mCRPC. Based on our evaluation of the synergies of LP-100
with PARP inhibitors, the decision was made in the first quarter of 2023 to close the phase 2 clinical trial in Denmark, to allow the
focus of LP-100-directed resources on positioning the molecule for development in earlier lines of therapy with potentially larger market
opportunities. LP-100 was previously out-licensed by us to Allarity Therapeutics A/S. In July 2021, we entered into an Asset Purchase
Agreement to reacquire global development and commercialization rights for LP-100 from Allarity. 

Our
development strategy is to pursue an increasing number of oncology focused, molecularly targeted therapies where artificial intelligence
and genomic data can help us provide biological insights, reduce the risk associated with development efforts and help clarify potential
patient response. We plan on strategically evaluating these on a program-by-program basis as they advance into clinical development,
either to be done entirely by us, or with licensing partners, to maximize the commercial opportunity and reduce the time it takes to
bring the right drug to the right patient. 

To
date, except for a prior research grant, we have not generated any revenue, we have incurred net losses and our operations have been
financed primarily by sales of our equity securities. Our net losses were approximately 14,906,000 and 11,776,000 for the nine months
ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. 

Our
net losses have primarily resulted from costs incurred in licensing and developing the drug candidates in our pipeline, planning, preparing
and conducting preclinical studies and clinical testing, and general and administrative activities associated with our operations. We
expect to continue to incur significant expenses and corresponding increased operating losses for the foreseeable future as we continue
to develop our pipeline. Our costs may further increase as we conduct additional preclinical studies and clinical trials and potentially
seek regulatory clearance for and prepare to commercialize our drug candidates. We expect to incur significant expenses to continue to
build the infrastructure necessary to support our expanded operations, preclinical studies, clinical trials, and commercialization, including
manufacturing, marketing, sales and distribution functions. We have experienced and will continue to experience substantial costs associated
with operating as a public company.

We
expect that our research and development expenses will continue to increase as we progress our clinical trials for LP-300, LP-184, and
LP-284, and advance our other drug candidates and programs. We expect this increase to include additional expenses associated with research
and service provider agreements for the advancement of our drug candidates and research and development efforts. 

Because
of the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with product development, we cannot determine with certainty the duration and completion
costs of these or other current or future clinical trials of LP-300, LP-184, LP-284 or our other drug candidates. We may never succeed
in achieving regulatory approval for LP-300, LP-184, LP-284, LP-100, or any of our other drug candidates. The duration, costs and timing
of clinical trials and development of our drug candidates will depend on a variety of factors, including the uncertainties of future
clinical and preclinical studies, uncertainties in clinical trial enrollment rates, significant and changing government regulation, and geopolitical risk, including in Taiwan where we are pursuing clinical
testing of LP-300.
In addition, the probability of success for each drug candidate will depend on numerous factors, including competition, manufacturing
capability and commercial viability. 

General
and Administrative 

General
and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and related costs for employees in executive, finance and administration, corporate
development and administrative support functions, including stock-based compensation expenses and benefits. Other significant general
and administrative expenses include accounting and legal services, insurance, the cost of various consultants, occupancy costs, investor
relations and information systems costs. 

We
expect increased administrative costs resulting from our existing and anticipated clinical trials and the potential commercialization
of our drug candidates. We believe that these increases will likely include increased costs for hiring additional administrative personnel
to support future market research and future product commercialization efforts and increased fees for outside consultants and other administrative
service providers.

Comparison
of the Three Months Ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 

General
and Administrative Expenses 

General
and administrative expenses increased approximately 149,000, or 11 , from approximately 1,314,000 for the three months ended September
30, 2023 to approximately 1,463,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2024. The increases are primarily attributable to increased
professional fees of approximately 134,000, increased patent and legal fees of approximately 42,000 and increased business development
costs of approximately 8,000, offset in part by reductions in travel costs of approximately 21,000 and reductions in salaries and benefits
of approximately 17,000. General and administrative expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 included administrative
expenses relating to our wholly-owned subsidiaries, including Starlight Therapeutics Inc., which was formed in January 2023. 

Research
and Development Expenses 

Research
and development expenses increased approximately 1,507,000, or 68 , from approximately 2,210,000 for the three months ended
September 30, 2023 to approximately 3,717,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2024. The increase is primarily attributable
to increased research study and material costs of approximately 1,189,000 relating to the conduct and support of our clinical
trials, increased salaries and benefits of approximately 263,000, and increased consulting expenses of approximately 88,000,
offset in part by reductions in product candidate manufacturing expenses of approximately 33,000. 

Interest
and Other Income, Net 

Interest
income decreased approximately 55,000, or 22 , from approximately 246,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2023 to approximately
 191,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2024. Other income, net increased approximately 367,000 from a gain of approximately
 116,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2023 to a gain of approximately 483,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2024.
This increase was primarily attributable to net appreciation in the fair value of our mutual funds and common stock of approximately
 224,000 during the three months ended September 30, 2024, as opposed to a net depreciation of approximately 45,000 in the fair value
of our investment securities during the three months ended September 30, 2023. We also recognized a gain on foreign currency remeasurement
of approximately 79,000 during the three months ended September 30, 2024, as opposed to a loss on foreign currency remeasurement of approximately
 79,000 during the three months ended September 30, 2023. These increases in other income, net were offset, in part, by a decrease in
research and development tax incentives related to our Australia subsidiary of approximately 33,000 and declines in dividend income
of approximately 27,000. 

19 

Comparison
of the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 

General
and Administrative Expenses 

General
and administrative expenses decreased approximately 215,000, or 5 , from approximately 4,679,000 for the nine months ended September
30, 2023 to approximately 4,464,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. The primary cause in the decline in general and administrative
expenses relates to reductions in salaries and benefit costs of approximately 285,000, reductions in insurance costs of approximately
 211,000, and reductions in office and administrative expenses of approximately 86,000, offset, in part, by increased professional fees
of approximately 169,000, increased patent and legal costs of approximately 159,000, and increased business development expenses of
approximately 37,000. General and administrative expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 included administrative
expenses relating to our wholly-owned subsidiaries, including Starlight Therapeutics Inc., which was formed in January 2023. 

Research
and Development Expenses 

Research
and development expenses increased approximately 3,535,000, or 42 , from approximately 8,321,000 for the nine months ended
September 30, 2023 to approximately 11,856,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. The increase is primarily attributable
to increased research study and material costs of approximately 3,457,000 relating to the conduct and support of our clinical
trials, increased salaries and benefits costs of approximately 674,000, and increased consulting expenses of 344,000, offset in
part by reductions in product candidate manufacturing costs of approximately 939,000. 

Interest
and Other Income, Net 

Interest
income increased approximately 83,000 from approximately 498,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 to approximately
 581,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. Other income, net increased approximately 106,000 from a gain of
approximately 727,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 to a gain of approximately 833,000 for the nine months ended
September 30, 2024. This increase was primarily attributable to net appreciation in the fair value of our mutual funds and common
stock of approximately 229,000 during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as opposed to a net depreciation of approximately
 94,000 in the fair value of our investment securities during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. We also recognized a gain on
foreign currency remeasurement of approximately 28,000 during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as opposed to a loss on
foreign currency remeasurement of approximately 130,000 during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Dividend income increased by
approximately 58,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. These increases in other income, net were offset, in part, by a decrease in research and development tax
incentives related to our Australia subsidiary of approximately 432,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023.

Operating
Activities 

For
the nine months ended September 30, 2024, net cash used in operating activities was approximately 13,841,000 compared to approximately
 10,961,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in net cash used in operating activities was primarily due to
the increase in the net loss for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, offset in part by an increase in accounts payable and accrued
expenses during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, which reduced the use of cash. 

Investing
Activities 

For
the nine months ended September 30, 2024, net cash used in investing activities was approximately 78,000 compared to approximately 1,186,000
of net cash used in investing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease in cash used in investing activities
is primarily related to a reduced level of net investments in marketable securities during the nine months ended September 30, 2024,
as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 

Financing
Activities 

Net
cash provided by financing activities was approximately 67,000 during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, which is attributable
to proceeds from warrant exercises. No cash was provided by or used in financing activities during the nine months ended September 30,
2023.

Operating
Capital and Capital Expenditure Requirements 

As
of September 30, 2024, we had total assets of approximately 30.3 million and working capital of approximately 26.3 million. As of September
30, 2024, our liquidity included approximately 28.1 million of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities. We believe that our
existing cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities as of September 30, 2024, and our anticipated expenditures and capital commitments,
will enable us to fund our operating expenses and capital expenditure requirements for at least 12 months from the date this quarterly
report is filed. We expect to continue to incur significant and increasing operating losses at least for the next several years as we
continue our clinical trials for LP-300, LP-184 and LP-284, advance our other drug candidates and programs, and seek potential future
marketing approval for our drug candidates, which could be several years in the future, if at all. We do not expect to generate revenue,
other than possible license and grant revenue, unless and until we successfully complete development and obtain regulatory approval for
our therapeutic candidates. Our net losses may fluctuate significantly from quarter-to-quarter and year-to-year, depending on the timing
of our existing and planned clinical trials and our expenditures on other research and development activities. 

We
have based our projections of operating capital requirements on assumptions that may prove to be incorrect and we may use all of our
available capital resources sooner than we expect. Because of the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with research, development
and commercialization of pharmaceutical products, we are unable to estimate the exact amount of our operating capital requirements. We
anticipate that our expenses will increase substantially as we: 

continue the development,
 including preclinical studies and clinical trials, of our drug candidates; 

initiate preclinical studies
 and clinical trials for any additional indications for our current drug candidates and any future drug candidates that we may pursue; 

continue to build our portfolio
 of drug candidates through the acquisition or in-license of additional drug candidates or technologies; 

continue to develop, maintain,
 expand and protect our intellectual property portfolio; 

pursue regulatory approvals
 for those of our current and future drug candidates that successfully complete clinical trials; 

ultimately establish a
 sales, marketing, distribution and other commercial infrastructure to commercialize any drug candidate for which we may obtain marketing
 approval; 

hire additional clinical,
 regulatory, scientific and accounting personnel; 

incur additional legal,
 accounting and other expenses in operating as a public company; and 

continue to develop, maintain,
 and expand our RADR platform. 

We
expect that we will need to obtain substantial additional funding in order to complete our clinical trials. To the extent that we raise
additional capital through the sale of common stock, convertible securities or other equity securities, the ownership interests of our
existing stockholders may be materially diluted and the terms of these securities could include liquidation or other preferences that
could adversely affect the rights of our existing stockholders. In addition, debt financing, if available, would result in increased
fixed payment obligations and may involve agreements that include restrictive covenants that limit our ability to take specific actions,
such as incurring additional debt, making capital expenditures or declaring dividends, that could adversely impact our ability to conduct
our business. If we are unable to raise capital when needed or on attractive terms, we could be forced to significantly delay, scale
back or discontinue the development or commercialization of LP-300, LP-184, LP-284, and/or our other drug candidates and programs, seek
collaborators at an earlier stage than otherwise would be desirable or on terms that are less favorable than might otherwise be available,
and relinquish or license, potentially on unfavorable terms, our rights to LP-300, LP-184, LP-284, and/or other drug candidates and programs
that we otherwise would seek to develop or commercialize ourselves. 

Critical
Accounting Estimates 

There
have been no changes to our critical accounting estimates during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 

Quantitative
and Qualitative Disclosure About Market Risk 

Our
primary exposure to market risk is interest rate sensitivity, which is affected by changes in the general level of U.S. interest rates.
Fixed rate securities may have their market value adversely affected due to a rise in interest rates. Accordingly, our future investment
income may fluctuate as a result of changes in interest rates, or we may suffer losses in principal if we are forced to sell securities
that decline in market value as a result of changes in interest rates. 

Historically,
we have raised capital through the issuance of equity securities. We had no long-term debt outstanding as of September 30, 2024 and December
31, 2023. 

21 

We
do not believe that our cash and cash equivalents have significant risk of default or illiquidity. Our cash and cash equivalents consist
primarily of cash and money market funds. Our exposure to market risk relating to cash and cash equivalents due to changes in interest
rates is limited because our cash and cash equivalents have a short-term maturity and are used primarily for working capital purposes.
Our marketable securities have had and may in the future have their market value adversely affected due to rises in interest rates. While
we believe our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities do not contain excessive risk, we cannot provide absolute assurance that
in the future our investments will not be subject to adverse changes in market value. In addition, we maintain significant amounts of
cash and cash equivalents at one or more financial institutions that are in excess of federally insured limits. Interest bearing and
non-interest bearing accounts we hold at banking institutions are guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation FDIC up to 250,000. Substantially all of our cash balances held at banking institutions are in excess of FDIC coverage. We consider this
to be a normal business risk. 

We
formed a wholly owned subsidiary, Lantern Pharma Australia Pty Ltd, in Australia in September 2021 and experienced foreign currency gains
of approximately 28,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and foreign currency losses of approximately 130,000 for the nine
months ended September 30, 2023 in connection with this subsidiary. We will remain subject to the risk of foreign currency losses in
future periods, although we do not expect the impact of any foreign currency losses to be material. We do not participate in any foreign
currency hedging activities, and we do not have any other derivative financial instruments. 

Inflation
generally affects us by increasing our cost of labor and clinical trial costs. We do not believe that inflation has had a material effect
on our results of operations during the periods presented. Inflation has increased substantially in recent periods and could have a greater
impact on our future results of operations if it remains at current levels or increases further.

As
a Smaller Reporting Company, we are exempt from the requirements of Item 3. 

Item
4. Controls and Procedures. 

Evaluation
of Disclosure Controls and Procedures. 

Our
management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer (our principal executive officer and principal
financial officer, respectively), evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of September 30, 2024. The
term disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act
of 1934, as amended, or the Exchange Act, means controls and other procedures of a company that are designed to ensure that information
required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized
and reported, within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without
limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it
files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to the company s management, including its principal executive
and principal financial officers, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Management recognizes that
any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives
and management necessarily applies its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures. 

Based
on the evaluation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of September 30, 2024, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial
Officer have concluded that, as of such date, our disclosure controls and procedures, as defined above, are effective. 

Changes
in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. 

There
were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the three months ended September 30, 2024 that
have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 

Inherent
Limitations on Effectiveness of Controls. 

Our
management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, do not expect that our disclosure controls or
our internal control over financial reporting will prevent all errors and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well conceived and
operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Further, the design
of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative
to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance
that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, have been detected. These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments
in decision-making can be faulty, and that breakdowns can occur because of a simple error or mistake. Additionally, controls can be circumvented
by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people or by management override of the controls. The design of any
system of controls is also based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance
that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions. Over time, controls may become inadequate
because of changes in conditions, or the degree of compliance with policies or procedures may deteriorate. Because of the inherent limitations
in a cost-effective control system, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected.
