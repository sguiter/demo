 Overview 
 Bristow Group Inc. is the leading global provider of innovative and sustainable vertical flight solutions. We primarily provide aviation services to a broad base of offshore energy companies and government entities. Our aviation services include personnel transportation, SAR, medevac, fixed wing transportation, unmanned systems and ad-hoc helicopter services. Our energy customers charter our helicopters primarily to transport personnel to, from and between onshore bases and offshore production platforms, drilling rigs and other installations. 
 Our core business of providing aviation services to leading global energy companies and government entities provides us with geographic and customer diversity that helps mitigate risks associated with a single market or customer. We currently have customers in Australia, Brazil, Canada, Chile, the Dutch Caribbean, the Falkland Islands, India, Ireland, the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, Mexico, the Netherlands, Nigeria, Norway, Spain, Suriname, Trinidad, the UK and the U.S. 
 Certain of our operations are subject to seasonal factors. For example, operations in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico are often at their highest levels from April to September, as daylight hours increase, and are at their lowest levels from December to February, as daylight hours decrease. Our North Sea operations also are subject to seasonality as drilling activity is lower during the winter months due to harsh weather and shorter days. See Segment, Markets and Seasonality in Part I, Item 1, Business of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for further discussion on seasonality.

 Current Quarter compared to Preceding Quarter 
 Operating revenues. Operating revenues were 3.9 million higher in the Current Quarter compared to the Preceding Quarter. 
 Operating revenues from offshore energy services were 4.8 million lower in the Current Quarter. 
 Operating revenues from offshore energy services in the Americas were 5.5 million lower in the Current Quarter primarily due to lower utilization in Suriname and Trinidad and lower revenues of 3.2 million from Cougar Helicopters Inc. Cougar ), primarily due to a one-time benefit in the Preceding Quarter related to transitioning from cash basis recognition to an accrual basis of accounting for lease payments. These decreases were partially offset by higher utilization in Brazil. 
 Operating revenues from offshore energy services in Africa were 0.5 million higher in the Current Quarter primarily due to additional aircraft on contract. 
 Operating revenues from offshore energy services in Europe were 0.1 million higher in the Current Quarter. Revenues in the UK were 3.0 million higher primarily due to higher utilization and the strengthening of the British Pound Sterling GBP relative to the U.S. dollar. Revenues in Norway were 2.9 million lower primarily due to lower utilization. 
 Operating revenues from government services were 5.8 million higher in the Current Quarter primarily due to the strengthening of the GBP relative to the U.S. dollar, fewer penalties related to availability and higher utilization. 
 Operating revenues from fixed wing services were 3.6 million higher in the Current Quarter primarily due to higher utilization. 
 Operating revenues from other services were 0.5 million lower primarily due to lower dry-lease revenues. 
 Operating expenses. Operating expenses were 16.3 million higher than the Preceding Quarter. Operating personnel costs were 13.0 million higher primarily due to the finalization of a labor agreement in the UK of 6.5 million in the Current Quarter, of which 4.6 million was related to prior periods, seasonal personnel cost variations in Norway of 3.8 million in the Preceding Quarter, one-time benefits related to an adjustment for tax equalization in Suriname and insurance reserve adjustments recognized in the Preceding Quarter of 1.6 million, and an increase in headcount in support of new contracts and higher activity of 1.1 million. Excluding the impact of seasonal and non-recurring items, operating personnel costs would have otherwise been 3.0 million higher in the Current Quarter. 
 Repairs and maintenance costs were 1.1 million higher primarily due to the timing of repairs, partially offset by lower inventory write-offs. Other operating costs were 1.9 million higher primarily due to lower gains from foreign currency hedging contracts and higher subcontractor costs.

 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 General 
 Our ongoing liquidity requirements arise primarily from working capital needs, meeting our capital commitments (including the purchase of aircraft and other equipment) and the payment of debt service obligations. In addition, we may use our liquidity to fund acquisitions, repurchase stock or debt securities or make other investments. Our primary sources of liquidity are cash balances and cash flows from operations and, from time to time, we may obtain additional liquidity through the issuance of equity or debt or other financing options or through asset sales. 
 Summary of Cash Flows 
 Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 (in thousands) Cash flows provided by or (used in): Operating activities 126,366 41,536 Investing activities (167,442) (28,043) Financing activities 63,263 25,346 Effect of exchange rate changes on cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash 2,732 7,214 Net increase in cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash 24,919 46,053 
 Operating Activities 
 Cash flows provided by operating activities were 84.8 million higher in the Current Year primarily due to an increase in operating income before depreciation and gains (losses) on asset dispositions. Working capital uses of 10.1 million in the Current Year were primarily due to increases in inventory to support new contracts and to mitigate risks related to supply chain constraints. Working capital changes of 3.5 million in the Prior Year were primarily due to increased accrued liabilities, partially offset by increased inventories and accounts receivables. 
 Investing Activities 
 During the Current Year, net cash used in investing activities was 167.4 million primarily consisting of: 
 Capital expenditures of 171.9 million primarily related to payments for aircraft, purchases of equipment and leasehold improvements, and 
 Proceeds of 4.5 million primarily from the sale of aircraft and other assets. 
 During the Prior Year, net cash used in investing activities was 28.0 million primarily consisting of: 
 Capital expenditures of 62.1 million primarily related to payments for aircraft, purchases of equipment and leasehold improvements, and 
 Proceeds of 34.1 million primarily from the sale or disposal of aircraft and other assets.

Table of Contents 

 Financing Activities 
 During the Current Year, net cash provided by financing activities was 63.3 million primarily consisting of: 
 Proceeds from borrowings of 82.3 million, partially offset by 
 Net repayments of debt of 11.5 million primarily related to the principal of secured equipment term loans, 
 Stock repurchases of 4.1 million, and 
 Payments on debt issuance costs of 3.5 million. 
 During the Prior Year, net cash provided by financing activities was 25.3 million primarily consisting of: 
 Proceeds from borrowings of 169.5 million, partially offset by 
 Net repayments of debt of 138.7 million primarily related to the principal of secured equipment term loans, 
 Payments on debt issuance costs of 2.7 million, and 
 Stock repurchases of 2.7 million. 
 Effect of Exchange Rate Changes 
 The effect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents denominated in currencies other than the reporting currency are reflected in a separate line on the condensed consolidated statement of cash flows. Through our foreign operations we are exposed to currency fluctuations, and changes in the value of the GBP and Norwegian krone relative to the U.S. dollar have the most significant impacts to the effect of exchange rate changes on our cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash. 
 Material Cash Requirements 
 The factors that materially affect our overall liquidity include cash from or used to fund operations, capital expenditure commitments, debt service, pension funding, adequacy of bank lines of credit and our ability to attract capital on satisfactory terms. We believe that our cash flows from operating activities will be adequate to meet our working capital requirements. To support our capital expenditure program and/or other liquidity requirements, we may use any combination of operating cash flows, unrestricted cash balances, borrowings under our ABL Facility, proceeds from sales of assets, issue debt or equity, or other financing options. 
 As of September 30, 2024, approximately 84 of our total cash balance was held outside the U.S. Most of our cash held outside the U.S. could be repatriated to the U.S., and any such repatriation could be subject to additional taxes. If cash held by non-U.S. operations is required for funding operations in the U.S., we may make a provision for additional taxes in connection with repatriating this cash, which is not expected to have a significant impact on our results of operations. 
 We have no near-term debt maturities, other than the current portion of long-term debt of 16.9 million, and believe that our cash flows from operations and other sources of liquidity will continue to be sufficient in fulfilling our capital requirements and other obligations. Our long-term liquidity is dependent upon our ability to generate operating profits sufficient to meet our requirements for working capital, debt service obligations, capital expenditures and a reasonable return on investment. As of September 30, 2024, we had 200.3 million of unrestricted cash and 59.6 million of remaining availability under our ABL Facility for total liquidity of 259.9 million. 
 In January 2024, we entered into a long-term equipment financing to upsize the UKSAR Debt by an aggregate amount of up to 55 million. As of September 30, 2024, we had drawn approximately 26.1 million under this facility. 
 In June 2024, we entered into a long-term equipment financing for an aggregate amount of up to 100.0 million with National Westminster Bank Plc as the original lender and UK Export Finance guaranteeing 80 of the facility IRCG Debt , formerly known as UKEF Debt ). As of September 30, 2024, we had drawn approximately 46 million under this facility. 
 As of September 30, 2024, our total principal debt balance, net of deferred financing fees, was 629.1 million, primarily comprised of the 6.875 Senior Notes due in March 2028 and the UKSAR Debt and IRCG Debt maturing in March 2036 and July 2031, respectively.

Table of Contents 

 We plan to use a combination of cash on hand, operating cash flows, new debt financing and aircraft leasing to fund our projected future capital expenditures, which includes our aircraft purchase commitments, infrastructure and other growth expenditure plans, primarily in support of new long-term contracts such as the UKSAR2G and IRCG, among other growth opportunities. 
 Contractual Obligations and Commercial Commitments 
 We have various contractual obligations that are recorded as liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets. Other items, such as certain purchase commitments and other executory contracts, are not recognized as liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets. 
 As of September 30, 2024, we had unfunded capital commitments of 289.3 million, consisting primarily of agreements to purchase ten AW189 heavy helicopters, three AW139 medium helicopters, five AW169 light twin helicopters and five H135 light twin helicopters. The AW189 helicopters are scheduled to be delivered between 2024 and 2026; the AW139 helicopters are scheduled to be delivered in 2024; and the H135 helicopters are scheduled to be delivered between 2024 and 2025. Delivery dates for the AW169 helicopters have yet to be determined. In addition, the Company has outstanding options to purchase up to 10 additional AW189 helicopters and 10 additional H135 helicopters. If these options are exercised, the AW189 helicopters would be scheduled for delivery between 2026 and 2028, and the H135 helicopters would be scheduled for delivery between 2027 and 2028. The Company may, from time to time, purchase aircraft for which it has no orders. 
 As of September 30, 2024, 35.2 million of our unfunded capital commitments may be terminated without further liability other than aggregate liquidated damages of approximately 1.1 million. If we do not exercise our rights to cancel these capital commitments, we expect to finance the remaining acquisition costs for these helicopters through a combination of cash on hand, cash provided by operating activities, asset sales and financing options. 
 Lease Obligations 
 From time to time, we may, under favorable market conditions and when necessary, enter into opportunistic aircraft lease agreements in support of our global operations. 
 We have non-cancelable operating leases in connection with the lease of certain equipment, including leases for aircraft, and land and facilities used in our operations. The related lease agreements, which range from non-cancelable to month-to-month terms, generally provide for fixed monthly rentals and can also include renewal options. As of September 30, 2024, aggregate undiscounted future payments under all non-cancelable operating leases that have initial or remaining terms in excess of one year were as follows (in thousands):

If such subsidiaries are unable to transfer funds to the Parent or Guarantors and sufficient cash or liquidity is not otherwise available, the Parent or Guarantors may not be able to make principal and interest payments on their outstanding debt, including the 6.875 Senior Notes or the guarantees. The following selected financial information of the Guarantors presents a sufficient financial position of the Parent to continue to fulfill its obligations under the requirements of the 6.875 Senior Notes. This selected financial information should be read in conjunction with the accompanying consolidated financial statements and notes (in thousands).

 Critical Accounting Estimates 
 See Part II, Item 7, Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Critical Accounting Estimates of the Annual Report on Form 10-K for a discussion of our critical accounting estimates. There have been no material changes to our critical accounting policies and estimates since the Annual Report on Form 10-K. 
 For discussion of recent accounting pronouncements and accounting changes, see Part I, Item 1, Financial Statements , Note 1 on this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. 
 
 Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk. 
 We are subject to certain market risks arising from the use of financial instruments in the ordinary course of business. This risk arises primarily as a result of potential changes in the fair market value of financial instruments that would result from adverse fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, credit risk, and interest rates. 
 For additional information about our exposure to market risk, refer to Part II, Item 7A, Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk of the Annual Report on Form 10-K. Our exposure to market risk has not changed materially since December 31, 2023.

 Item 4. Controls and Procedures 
 With the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, management evaluated, with reasonable assurance, the effectiveness of the disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Based on this evaluation, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer concluded that the Company s disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of September 30, 2024. 
 During the quarter ended September 30, 2024, there were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 
 
 PART II. OTHER INFORMATION 
 
 Item 1. Legal Proceedings 
 In the normal course of our business, we are involved in various litigation matters including, among other things, claims by third parties for alleged property damages and personal injuries. Management has used estimates in determining our potential exposure to these matters and has recorded reserves in our financial statements related thereto as appropriate. It is possible that a change in our estimates related to these exposures could occur, but we do not expect any such changes in estimated costs would have a material effect on our consolidated financial position or results of operations.
