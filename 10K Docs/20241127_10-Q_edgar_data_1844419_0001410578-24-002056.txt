 million of the net proceeds of the sale of the Units, the Private Placement Units, the Over-allotment Units and the Over-allotment Private Placement Units were placed in a trust account (the Trust Account with Continental Stock Transfer Trust Company. The funds held in the Trust Account will be invested only in U.S. government treasury bills with a maturity of one hundred eighty five (185) days or less or in money market funds that meet certain conditions under Rule 2a-7 under the Investment Company Act of 1940 and that invest only in direct U.S. government obligations. Funds will remain in the Trust Account until the earlier of (i) the consummation of the Initial Business Combination or (ii) the distribution of the Trust Account proceeds as described below. The remaining proceeds outside the Trust Account may be used to pay for business, legal and accounting due diligence on prospective acquisitions and continuing general and administrative expenses. In connection with the November 4, 2022 special meeting, stockholders holding shares of Class A common stock Public Shares exercised their right to redeem such shares. Following redemptions, the Company had Public Shares outstanding. In connection with the May 5, 2023 special meeting, stockholders holding shares of Class A common stock exercised their right to redeem such shares.

In connection with the August 5, 2024 special meeting, stockholders holding of the Company s Class A common stock exercised their right to redeem such shares. Following redemptions, the Company has Public Shares outstanding. Except with respect to interest earned on the funds held in the Trust Account that may be released to the Company to pay its taxes and up to of interest that may be used for dissolution expenses, the proceeds from the Initial Public Offering and the Private Placement will not be released from the Trust Account until the earlier of: (i) the completion of the Company s Initial Business Combination; (ii) the redemption of any Public Shares that have been properly tendered in connection with a stockholder vote to amend the Company s amended and restated certificate of incorporation (A) to modify the substance or timing of the Company s obligation to redeem of Public Shares if the Company does not complete its Initial Business Combination within 24 months from the closing of the Initial Public Offering or such a later date pursuant to stockholder approval or (B) with respect to any other provision relating to stockholders right or pre-Initial Business Combination activity; and (iii) the redemption of of the Public Shares if the Company is unable to complete an Initial Business Combination within the Combination Period (as defined below), subject to the requirements of applicable law. The proceeds deposited in the Trust Account could become subject to the claims of the Company s creditors, if any, which could have priority over the claims of the Company s public stockholders. Initial Business Combination The Company s management has broad discretion with respect to the specific application of the net proceeds of the Initial Public Offering and sale of the Placement Units, although substantially all of the net proceeds are intended to be applied generally toward consummating a Business Combination. NASDAQ rules provide that the Business Combination must be with one or more target businesses that together have a fair market value equal to at least of the balance in the Trust Account (as defined below) (less any deferred underwriting commissions and taxes payable on interest earned and less any interest earned thereon that is released for taxes) at the time of the signing of an agreement to enter into a Business Combination. The Company will only complete a Business Combination if the post-Business Combination company owns or acquires or more of the outstanding voting securities of the target or otherwise acquires a controlling interest in the target sufficient for it not to be required to register as an investment company under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the Investment Company Act ). There is no assurance that the Company will be able to successfully effect a Business Combination. The Company will provide its stockholders with the opportunity to redeem all or a portion of their Public Shares upon the completion of a Business Combination either (i) in connection with a stockholder meeting called to approve the Business Combination or (ii) by means of a tender offer. In connection with a proposed Business Combination, the Company may seek stockholder approval of a Business Combination at a meeting called for such purpose at which stockholders may seek to redeem their shares, regardless of whether they vote for or against a Business Combination. The Company will proceed with a Business Combination only if the Company has net tangible assets of at least upon such consummation of a Business Combination and, if the Company seeks stockholder approval, a majority of the outstanding shares voted are voted in favor of the Business Combination.

 or more of the Public Shares without the Company s prior written consent. The stockholders will be entitled to redeem their Public Shares for a pro rata portion of the amount then in the Trust Account (initially per share (redemption price as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 was and , respectively)), plus any pro rata interest earned on the funds held in the Trust Account and not previously released to the Company to pay its tax obligations). The per-share amount to be distributed to stockholders who redeem their Public Shares will not be reduced by the deferred underwriting commissions the Company will pay to the underwriter. There will be no redemption rights upon the completion of a Business Combination with respect to the Company s warrants. All of the Public Shares contain a redemption feature which allows for the redemption of such Public Shares in connection with the Company s liquidation, if there is a stockholder vote or tender offer in connection with the Company s Business Combination and in connection with certain amendments to the Company s amended and restated certificate of incorporation (the Certificate of Incorporation ). In accordance with the rules of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC and its guidance on redeemable equity instruments, which has been codified in Accounting Standards Codification ASC 480-10-S99, redemption provisions not solely within the control of a company require common stock subject to redemption to be classified outside of permanent equity. Given that the Public Shares were issued with other freestanding instruments (i.e., public warrants), the initial carrying value of the shares of Class A common stock classified as temporary equity was the allocated proceeds determined in accordance with ASC 470-20. Because of the redemption feature noted above, the shares of Class A common stock are subject to ASC 480-10-S99. If it is probable that the equity instrument will become redeemable, the Company has the option to either (i) accrete changes in the redemption value over the period from the date of issuance (or from the date that it becomes probable that the instrument will become redeemable, if later) to the earliest redemption date of the instrument or (ii) recognize changes in the redemption value immediately as they occur and adjust the carrying amount of the instrument to equal the redemption value at the end of each reporting period. The Company has elected to recognize the changes immediately. The re-measurement is treated as a deemed dividend (i.e., a reduction to retained earnings, or in absence of retained earnings, additional paid-in capital). While redemptions cannot cause the Company s net tangible assets to fall below , the Public Shares are redeemable and will be classified as such on the balance sheet until such date that a redemption event takes place. If a stockholder vote is not required and the Company does not decide to hold a stockholder vote for business or other legal reasons, the Company will, pursuant to its Amended and Restated Memorandum and Articles of Association, offer such redemption pursuant to the tender offer rules of the SEC, and file tender offer documents containing substantially the same information as would be included in a proxy statement with the SEC prior to completing a Business Combination. The Sponsor has agreed (a) to vote its Class B common stock, the common stock included in the Private Placement Units (the Placement Shares and any Public Shares purchased during or after the Initial Public Offering in favor of a Business Combination, (b) not to propose an amendment to the Company s Amended and Restated Memorandum and Articles of Association with respect to the Company s pre-Business Combination activities prior to the consummation of a Business Combination unless the Company provides dissenting public stockholders with the opportunity to redeem their Public Shares in conjunction with any such amendment; (c) not to redeem any shares (including the Class B common stock) and Private Placement Units (including underlying securities) into the right to receive cash from the Trust Account in connection with a stockholder vote to approve a Business Combination (or to sell any shares in a tender offer in connection with a Business Combination if the Company does not seek stockholder approval in connection therewith) or a vote to amend the provisions of the Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation relating to stockholders rights of pre-Business Combination activity and (d) that the Class B common stock and Private Placement Units (including underlying securities) shall not participate in any liquidating distributions upon winding up if a Business Combination is not consummated. However, the Sponsor will be entitled to liquidating distributions from the Trust Account with respect to any Public Shares purchased during or after the Initial Public Offering if the Company fails to complete its Business Combination.

Prior to the amendment to the Company s charter on May 5, 2023, the Company had until May 7, 2023 to consummate a Business Combination. On May 5, 2023, the Company held a special meeting of stockholders in which the Company s stockholders approved an amendment to extend the date by which the Company must consummate a Business Combination from May 7, 2023 to February 7, 2024 (the Third Combination Period ).

The underwriter has agreed to waive its rights to the deferred underwriting commission held in the Trust Account in the event the Company does not complete a Business Combination within the Third Combination Period and, in such event, such amounts will be included with the funds held in the Trust Account that will be available to fund the redemption of the Public Shares. In the event of such distribution, it is possible that the per share value of the assets remaining available for distribution will be less than the Initial Public Offering price per Unit.

In connection with the meeting, stockholders holding of the Company s Class A common stock exercised their right to redeem such shares. Following this redemption, the Company has Public Shares outstanding. The Sponsor has agreed that it will be liable to the Company, if and to the extent any claims by a vendor for services rendered or products sold to the Company, or a prospective target business with which the Company has discussed entering into a transaction agreement, reduce the amounts in the Trust Account to below per share (whether or not the underwriters over - allotment option is exercised in full), except as to any claims by a third party who executed a waiver of any and all rights to seek access to the Trust Account and except as to any claims under the Company s indemnity of the underwriters of the Initial Public Offering against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the Securities Act ). In the event that an executed waiver is deemed to be unenforceable against a third party, the Sponsor will not be responsible to the extent of any liability for such third-party claims. The Company will seek to reduce the possibility that the Sponsor will have to indemnify the Trust Account due to claims of creditors by endeavoring to have all vendors, service providers (except for the company s independent registered accounting firm), prospective target businesses or other entities with which the Company does business, execute agreements with the Company waiving any right, title, interest or claim of any kind in or to monies held in the Trust Account.

Subsequent to the consummation of the Initial Public Offering, the Company plans to address its liquidity through the net proceeds from the consummation of the Initial Public Offering and the Private Placement held outside of the Trust Account. The Company has incurred and expects to incur significant costs in pursuit of its acquisition plans. In connection with the Company s assessment of going concern considerations in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board s FASB Accounting Standards Codification ASC Topic 205-40, Presentation of Financial Statements Going Concern, the Company was formed for the purpose of completing a merger, capital stock exchange, asset acquisition, stock purchase, reorganization or similar business combination with one or more businesses or entities on or before January 7, 2025. There is no assurance that the Company will obtain the necessary approvals or raise the additional capital it needs to fund its business operations and complete any business combination prior to January 7, 2025, if at all. The Company also has no approved plan in place to extend the business combination deadline beyond January 7, 2025, and lacks the capital resources needed to fund operations and complete any business combination, even if the deadline to complete a business combination is extended to a later date. Management has determined that the liquidity condition and timing of liquidation raises substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern for the next twelve months from the issuance of these financial statements. No adjustments have been made to the carrying amounts of assets or liabilities. There is no assurance that the Company s plans to consummate an Initial Business Combination will be successful within the Combination Period. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.

The Company is currently not aware of any issues under review that could result in significant payments, accruals or material deviation from its position.

The Company believes its calculation to be a reliable estimate and allows it to properly take into account the usual elements that can impact its annualized book income and its impact on the effective tax rate. As such, the Company is computing its taxable income (loss) and associated income tax provision based on actual results through September 30, 2024. The Company s effective tax rate was and ) for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively.

Recent Developments Termination of Business Combination Agreement On May 20, 2024, pursuant to Section 9.01(a) of the Business Combination Agreement, Maquia and Immersed entered into a Termination of Business Combination Agreement Termination Agreement pursuant to which the Business Combination Agreement was terminated effective as of May 20, 2024. Entered in new Business Combination Agreement On July 15, 2024, the Company executed a Business Combination Agreement with Merger Sub and Velocium, Inc. On July 17, 2024, the Company provided to Nasdaq a copy of the Business Combination Agreement between the Company, Merger Sub, and Velocium. On July 19, 2024, the Company filed a Form 8 - K with the SEC reporting the Business Combination Agreement with Merger Sub and Velocium. Stockholders Special Meeting On August 7, 2024, the Company held a Special Meeting at which time the Company s stockholders approved an amendment to the Company s Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation to the date by which the Company must consummate its initial business combination from August 7, 2024 to January 7, 2025, or such earlier date as determined by the board of directors. In connection with the meeting, stockholders holding 861,653 of the Company s Class A common stock exercised their right to redeem such shares. Following this redemption, the Company has 135,663 Public Shares outstanding. Results of Operations We have not generated any revenues to date, and we will not be generating any operating revenues until the closing and completion of our initial business combination. Our entire activity up to September 30, 2024 was related to our formation, our initial public offering and, since the closing of our initial public offering, a search for an initial business combination target. We have, and expect to continue to generate, non-operating income in the form of interest income and unrealized gains on investments held in the trust account. We expect to continue to incur increased expenses as a result of being a public company (for legal, financial reporting, accounting and auditing compliance), as well as for due diligence expenses in connection with the search for an initial business combination target.

 For the three months ended September 30, 2024, we had a net loss of 23,661, which primarily consisted of general and administrative expenses of 357,084 partially offset by unrealized and realized gains on investments of 150,009, and a change in the fair value of convertible note payable of 183,414. For the three months ended September 30, 2023, we had net loss of 1,121,231, which primarily consisted of unrealized losses on fair value of convertible note payable of 780,653, general and administrative expenses of 293,713, change in fair value of derivative warrant liabilities of 120,625 and income tax expense of 98,637, partially offset by unrealized and realized gains on investments of 172,397. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we had net income of 782,822, which primarily consisted of unrealized and realized gains on investments of 452,995, a change in the fair value of the convertible note payable of 1,263,261 and an income tax benefit of 116,946, partially offset by general and administrative expenses of 1,037,398 and a change in fair value of the derivative warrant liabilities of 12,982. For the nine months ended September 30, 2023, we had net loss of 1,210,406, which primarily consisted of change in fair value of the derivative warrant liabilities of 243,846, change in fair value of debt of 765,292, general and administrative expenses of 816,532 and income tax expense of 263,259, partially offset by unrealized and realized gains on investments of 878,523. Liquidity and Capital Resources Prior to the consummation of our initial public offering, our only source of liquidity was the initial sale of the Founder Shares to our Sponsor and advances under the promissory note with our sponsor. Pursuant to our initial public offering, which was consummated in May 2021, the Company sold 17,309,719 units, which includes underwriters over-allotment, at a purchase price of 10.00 per unit generating gross proceeds to us in the amount of 173.1 million. Each unit consists of one share of our Class A common stock, par value 0.0001 per share, and one-half of one public warrant, with each whole warrant entitling the holder thereof to purchase one whole share of Class A common stock at a price of 11.50 per share, subject to adjustment. Simultaneously with the closing of our initial public offering, the Company consummated the private placement of an aggregate of 583,743 placement units, which includes underwriters over-allotment, to our sponsor at a purchase price of 10.00 per placement unit, generating gross proceeds to us in the amount of 5,837,430. A portion of the proceeds from the placement units was added to the proceeds from our initial public offering held in the trust account. If we do not complete an initial business combination by the end of the Combination Period, the proceeds from the sale of the placement units held in the trust account will be used to fund the redemption of the public shares (subject to the requirements of applicable law) and the placement units will be worthless. As indicated in the accompanying financial statements, at September 30, 2024, we had 42,479 in cash and restricted cash, and a working capital deficiency of 3,958,686. We presently have no operating revenue. Through September 30, 2024, our liquidity needs were satisfied through receipt of 475,500 held outside of the trust account from the sale of the placement warrants upon the closing of our initial public offering. In the future, a portion of interest income on the funds held in the trust account may be released to us to pay tax obligations. In order to finance transaction costs in connection with an initial business combination, our sponsor or an affiliate of our sponsor, or our officers and directors may, but are not obligated to, loan us funds as may be required Working Capital Loans ). Such Working Capital Loans would be evidenced by promissory notes. The notes would either be repaid upon consummation of an initial business combination, without interest, or, at the lender s discretion, up to 1,500,000 of notes and any other loans made by our sponsor or its affiliates (including the loans made to effectuate extensions as described below), our officers and directors, or our company and its affiliates prior to or in connection with an initial business combination may be converted upon consummation of an initial business combination into additional placement units at a price of 10.00 per placement unit. In the event that an initial business combination does not close, we may use a portion of proceeds held outside the trust account to repay the Working Capital Loans, but no proceeds held in the trust account would be used to repay the Working Capital Loans. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we had no borrowings under the Working Capital Loans.

 We may also need to obtain additional financing either to complete a business combination or because we become obligated to redeem a significant number of shares of our Class A common stock upon completion of the business combination, in which case we may issue additional securities or incur debt in connection with the business combination. In connection with the Company s assessment of going concern considerations in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board s FASB Accounting Standards Codification ASC Topic 205-40, Presentation of Financial Statements Going Concern, the Company was formed for the purpose of completing a merger, capital stock exchange, asset acquisition, stock purchase, reorganization or similar business combination with one or more businesses or entities on or before January 7, 2025. There is no assurance that the Company will obtain the necessary approvals or raise the additional capital it needs to fund its business operations and complete any business combination prior to January 7, 2025, if at all. The Company also has no approved plan in place to extend the business combination deadline beyond January 7, 2025, and lacks the capital resources needed to fund operations and complete any business combination, even if the deadline to complete a business combination is extended to a later date. Management has determined that the liquidity condition and timing of liquidation raises substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern for the next twelve months from the issuance of these financial statements. No adjustments have been made to the carrying amounts of assets or liabilities. There is no assurance that our plans to consummate an initial business combination will be successful by January 7, 2025. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty. In connection with the First Extension (as defined below), the Sponsor loaned to the Company an aggregate of 3,461,944, which amount was deposited into the Trust Account. The loan is non-interest bearing and will be payable upon the earlier of consummation of the Company s initial business combination and its winding up. At the election of the Sponsor, up to 1,500,000 of the loan is convertible into units of the Company identical to the units issued to the Sponsor in the private placement concurrent with the Company s Initial Public Offering, at a conversion price of 10 per unit. In connection with the Second Extension (as defined below), the Sponsor made six monthly contributions of 159,291, for a total of 955,746 in contributions through May 7, 2023, which amount was contributed to the Trust Account. In connection with the Third Extension (as defined below), the Sponsor or its designees have agreed to contribute to the Company as a loan an aggregate of 0.025 for each share of Class A commons stock that is not redeemed, for each calendar month (commencing on May 7, 2023 and each month thereafter) until February 7, 2024, with each monthly contribution being 27,268 based on 1,090,718 Public Shares outstanding following the approval of the Third Extension On February 5, 2024, in connection with the Fourth extension, the Company held a Special Meeting at which time the Company s stockholders approved an amendment to the Company s Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation to the date by which the Company must consummate its initial business combination from February 7, 2024 to August 7, 2024 (or such earlier date as determined by the Board). The Company filed the Charter Amendment with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware on Feb 7, 2024. In connection with this extension, the Company and the Sponsor entered into a non-redemption agreement with one or more unaffiliated third party or parties in exchange for such third party or third parties agreeing not to redeem an aggregate of 538,093 shares of Maquia Class A Common Stock sold in the IPO Non-Redeemed Shares ). In exchange for the foregoing commitments not to redeem such Non-Redeemed Shares, the Sponsor has agreed to transfer to such Third Parties 2.5 per month of the Non-Redeemed Shares up to a maximum of 6 months (depending upon the month the initial business combination is consummated), of the Company s Class A common stock held by such Third Parties, immediately following the consummation of an initial business combination, if the Third Parties continue to hold such Non-Redeemed Shares through the Fourth Extension Meeting. In connection with the vote to approve the Extension Amendment Proposal, public stockholders holding 93,402 of the Company s Class A common stock, par value 0.0001, properly exercised their right to redeem their shares for a cash payment out of the Company s trust account in connection with the Extension Amendment Proposal leaving a balance of 997,316 class A Common shares in the hands of the Public Shareholders. On August 7, 2024, the Company held a Special Meeting at which time the Company s stockholders approved an amendment to the Company s Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation to the date by which the Company must consummate its initial business combination from August 7, 2024 to January 7, 2025, or such earlier date as determined by the board of directors. In connection with the meeting, stockholders holding 861,653 of the Company s Class A common stock exercised their right to redeem such shares. Following this redemption, the Company has 135,663 Public Shares outstanding. If the Company opts not to utilize any remaining portion of the extension period prior to January 7, 2025, then the Company will liquidate and dissolve promptly in accordance with its charter, and its Sponsor s obligation to make additional Contributions will terminate.

 Critical Accounting Estimates The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions about future events that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes. Future events and their effects cannot be determined with absolute certainty. Therefore, the determination of estimates requires the exercise of judgment. Actual results inevitably will differ from those estimates, and such differences may be material to the financial statements. The most significant accounting estimates inherent in the preparation of our financial statements include estimates associated with the determinations of the fair-market value of the preferred stock, stock-based compensation, and the impairment analysis of intangibles. Our financial position, results of operations and cash flows are impacted by the accounting policies we have adopted. In order to get a full understanding of our financial statements, one must have a clear understanding of the accounting policies employed. A summary of our critical accounting policies is presented within the notes to our consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Our management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based on our financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The preparation of our financial statements and related disclosures requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, costs and expenses, and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities in our financial statements. These items are monitored and analyzed by us for changes in facts and circumstances, and material changes in these estimates could occur in the future. We base our estimates on historical experience, known trends and events, and on various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. We evaluate our estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis. Our actual results may materially differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. Our critical accounting estimates have not changed materially from those previously reported in our Annual Report for the year ended December 31, 2023, on Form 10-K. Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk Not required for smaller reporting companies. Item 4. Controls and Procedures Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial and accounting officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the fiscal quarter ended September 30, 2024, as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act. Based on the foregoing, our Certifying Officers concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of the end of the period covered by this Report, due to the material weaknesses in internal controls over financial reporting. Specifically, we did not design and maintain an effective control environment to prevent or detect material misstatements in the financial statements. The following material weaknesses in internal controls over financial reporting were identified: Controls over the identification, accounting and reporting for complex financial instruments. Controls over calculation and reporting for income taxes. Controls over the protection of funds permitted for withdrawal from the trust, including both the timely payment of income and other tax liabilities and ineffective oversight by the board and our management relating to the Company recurring non- compliance with an investment management trust agreement.

 Disclosure controls and procedures are controls and other procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to management, including our Certifying Officers, or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting Our internal control over financial reporting and other transactions reported above were not effective to properly evaluate complex equity transactions, to properly calculate and report income taxes and improper monitoring and accounting of the trust account. There has been no change in our internal control over financial reporting during the fiscal quarter ended September 30, 2024 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. The breakdown of an internal control process that led to the overpayment issue was primarily caused by lack of an effective check and balance system which allowed an individual to perform multiple tasks such as authorize payments, process transactions, and reconcile bank statements, without additional oversight. Furthermore, regular internal audits or reviews were absent, which otherwise would have identified discrepancies early on.

 PART II - OTHER INFORMATION Item 1. Legal Proceedings. To the knowledge of our management team, there is no litigation currently pending or contemplated against us, any of our officers or directors in their capacity as such or against any of our property. Item 1A. Risk Factors. As of the date of this Report, other than as set forth below, there have been no material changes with respect to those risk factors previously disclosed in our (i) Registration Statement on Form S-1 initially filed with the SEC on February 16, 2021, as amended, and declared effective on May 4, 2021 (File No. 333-253167) (the Registration Statement ), (ii) Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2022, as filed with the SEC on April 4, 2023, (iii) Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q for the quarterly periods ended March 31, 2022, June 30, 2022 and September 30, 2022, as filed with the SEC on May 10, 2022, August 16, 2022 and November 10, 2022, respectively, (iv) DEF 14A as filed with the SEC on April 24, 2023 and Amendment No. 2 to the S4 Registrations Statement filed April 19, 2024. Any of these factors could result in a significant or material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition. Additional risks could arise that may also affect our business or ability to consummate an initial business combination. We may disclose changes to such risk factors or disclose additional risk factors from time to time in our future filings with the SEC. Market conditions, economic uncertainty or downturns could adversely affect our business, financial condition, operating results and our ability to consummate a business combination. In recent years, the United States and other markets have experienced cyclical or episodic downturns, and worldwide economic conditions remain uncertain, including as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, supply chain disruptions, the Ukraine-Russia conflict, instability in the U.S. and global banking systems, rising fuel prices, increasing interest rates or foreign exchange rates and high inflation and the possibility of a recession. A significant downturn in economic conditions may make it more difficult for us to consummate a business combination. We cannot predict the timing, strength, or duration of any future economic slowdown or any subsequent recovery generally, or in any industry. If the conditions in the general economy and the markets in which we operate worsen from present levels, our business, financial condition, operating results and our ability to consummate a business combination could be adversely affected. For example, in January 2023, the outstanding national debt of the U.S. government reached its statutory limit. The U.S. Department of the Treasury (the Treasury Department has announced that, since then, it has been using extraordinary measures to prevent the U.S. government s default on its payment obligations, and to extend the time that the U.S. government has to raise its statutory debt limit or otherwise resolve its funding situation. The failure by Congress to raise the federal debt ceiling could have severe repercussions within the U.S. and to global credit and financial markets. If Congress does not raise the debt ceiling, the U.S. government could default on its payment obligations, or experience delays in making payments when due. A payment default or delay by the U.S. government, or continued uncertainty surrounding the U.S. debt ceiling, could result in a variety of adverse effects for financial markets, market participants and U.S. and global economic conditions. In addition, U.S. debt ceiling and budget deficit concerns have increased the possibility a downgrade in the credit rating of the U.S. government and could result in economic slowdowns or a recession in the U.S. Although U.S. lawmakers have passed legislation to raise the federal debt ceiling on multiple occasions, ratings agencies have lowered or threatened to lower the long-term sovereign credit rating on the United States as a result of disputes over the debt ceiling. The impact of a potential downgrade to the U.S. government s sovereign credit rating or its perceived creditworthiness could adversely affect economic conditions, as well as our business, financial condition, operating results and our ability to consummate a business combination. The termination of the business combination agreement with Immersed, Inc. will severely limit the company s ability to consummate a business combination with a new target. As reported above, the business combination agreement with Immersed, Inc. was mutually terminated on May 20, 2024. On August 7, 2024, the Company s shareholders voted to Amend the Company s amended and restated certificate of incorporation to extend the date by which the Company has to consummate a Business Combination from August 7, 2024 to January 7, 2025 or such earlier date as determined by the board of directors. To accomplish this the Company must locate a suitable target, engage that target with a business combination agreement, and submit the matter to shareholders for approval prior to January 7, 2025. Failure to do this will result in the liquidation of the Company unless the January 7, 2025 date is further extended. In addition, Nasdaq has delisted the company for failure to complete a business combination within 36 months of the effective date of its IPO. Because of the time limitations and the delisting, the Company faces significant limitations on its ability to complete the business combination in a timely manner and thus may be forced to liquidate.
