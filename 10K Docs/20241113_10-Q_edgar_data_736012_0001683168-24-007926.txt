proceeds received from the issuance of common stock in a series of transactions which include million from ATM sales, million
from a private placement, and million from the exercise of warrants. Management plans to continue to fund the operations of the Company
through the issuance of common stock using a combination of ATM and equity financings. If the Company is not able to raise adequate funds
under the Company s ATM program or obtain additional equity financing, the Company may be unable to implement the Company s
business plan, fund its liquidity needs or even continue its operations. The financial statements do not include any adjustments relating
to the recoverability and classification of assets and liabilities that may be necessary if the Company is unable to continue as a going
concern. 

The audit opinion that accompanied

expressed substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern.

million each with an initial rate of 7 . On March 10, 2022, the Company received
 million in net funds from the first tranche (Note 1) pursuant to a promissory note executed contemporaneously with the execution
of the loan agreement. On June 29, 2022, the Company received an additional million in net funds from the second tranche (Note 2)
pursuant to a promissory note. Each note has an 18-month maturity, may be prepaid subject to varying prepayment premiums, and may be redeemed
at any time after six months into the term of such note in amounts up to 0.5 million per calendar month upon the noteholder s election.
On January 11, 2023, the Company amended the promissory notes issued pursuant to the unsecured loan agreement with Streeterville whereby
the noteholder agreed to waive their redemption rights through March 31, 2023, in exchange for a fee equal to 3.75 of the outstanding
principal balance which increased the outstanding indebtedness due at maturity with Streeterville and increased the associated debt issuance
costs recorded on the condensed consolidated balance sheets by million. On August 2, 2023, the Company entered into a Forbearance
Agreement with Streeterville which was subsequently amended on August 7, 2023. The Forbearance Agreement and amendment extended the maturity
dates for each Note by twelve months to September 2024 and December 2024. In consideration of the extension of the maturity dates, the
Company entered into a Security Agreement with Streeterville, dated August 2, 2023 (the Security Agreement ), under which
Streeterville was granted a first-position security interest in all assets of the Company. 

In March 2024, the Company
entered into an agreement with Streeterville to exchange million in principal for thousand shares of common stock. Also in March
2024, the Company exchanged million in Streeterville debt for thousand shares of newly created Series A Preferred. The issuance
of both common and preferred shares was made pursuant to the exemption from the registration requirements afforded by the Securities Act,
as amended. The designations for the Series A Preferred preclude the Company from repaying any indebtedness for so long as any Series
A Preferred shares are outstanding. The Series A Preferred have a stated value of 1,100 per share and are subject to preferences and
designations as more fully described in our Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation filed on March 15, 2024, see also Note 6 Stockholders 
Equity. Following the exchanges noted herein, the remaining balance on Note One was 0.5 million. The maturity date for Note One was September
10, 2024, which conflicts with the Series A Preferred designation prohibiting repayment of any indebtedness. Note One is pending an amendment
to extend the maturity date. 

As a result of exchanging
 9.5 million principal in aggregate for equity, the Company reversed the interest accretion associated with the ability to stock-settle
principal redemptions and wrote off the balance of unamortized debt issuance costs of .0 million in March 2024. Simple interest of 
thousand thousand was incurred for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively. 

Streeterville Notes Payable 

On September 30, 2024, the
Company entered into a note purchase agreement with Streeterville where Streeterville purchased a note payable in the principal amount
of 
million in exchange for 
million in cash after redemption of 
million of Series A preferred stock. The note called for weekly payments of 25 thousand until the maturity on November 18, 2024.
In the event the note is not repaid on the maturity date weekly payments increase to 50 thousand. The note bears no interest. 

Scott Notes Payable 

During the period ended March
31, 2024, the Company entered into two separate note purchase agreements with the Company s Chief Executive Officer, Anthony Scott.
On January 2, 2024, Scott purchased a note payable in the principal amount of million in exchange for .0 million in cash. The note
called for payments of thousand until maturity on . Interest accrued on the balance of the note at per annum
compounding daily. During the period ended March 31, 2024, the Company made million in principal payments on the first note payable. 

On March 20, 2024, Scott
purchased a second note payable in the principal amount of thousand in exchange for thousand in cash. The note was non-interest
bearing and matured on April 19, 2024. On April 2, 2024, the Company reduced the principal balance due under the note by 101 thousand
which reflected the amount due from Scott for the exercise of common stock purchase warrants. 

On April 19, 2024, Scott
entered into a private placement subscription agreement to convert the aggregate outstanding balance of million for both notes in
exchange for common stock and common stock purchase warrants. 

The Company recorded no interest
expense for both notes in the accompanying condensed consolidated statement of operations for the three months ended September 30, 2024.
For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, thousand in amortization of debt issuance cost was recorded. 

million; and (iii) the dismissal of all claims
against the Defendants, including the Company, in connection with the action. The 0.3 million settlement payment was made by the Company s
insurance provider under its insurance policy since the Company s 0.5 million retention was previously exhausted. On April 3, 2024,
the Court approved the settlement. 

In addition to these legal
proceedings, the Company is subject to various other claims that may arise in the ordinary course of business. The Company does not believe
that any claims exist where the outcome of such matters would have a material adverse effect on the Company s condensed consolidated
financial position, operating results, or cash flows. However, there can be no assurance such legal proceedings will not have a material
impact on the Company s future results. 

million Standby Equity Purchase Agreement SEPA with Streeterville pursuant to which the Company has the right to
direct Streeterville during the 24 month term of the agreement to purchase common stock subject to certain limitations and
conditions set forth in the SEPA.

volume weighted average price of the shares of Common Stock for such trading day on the Nasdaq Stock Market during regular trading hours
as reported by Bloomberg L.P. The Company will use 10 of the proceeds associated with each Advance to redeem the outstanding Series A
Preferred Stock held by Streeterville. 

Upon
execution of the SEPA, the Company issued thousand shares of common stock for payment of the commitment fee equal to 1 of the 10
million commitment and Streeterville purchased 
 thousand shares for a purchase price of 0.01 per common share pre-delivery shares ). Following termination of the
SEPA Streeterville will deliver to the Company the same amount of pre delivery shares and the Company will pay 0.01 per pre delivery
share. 

During the quarter ended September

Series A Preferred Stock 

On March 15, 2024, the Company
filed a certificate of designation of preferences and rights (the Certificate of Designation of Series A Preferred Stock
(the Series A Stock ), with the Secretary of State of Delaware, designating shares of preferred stock, par value 
of the Company, as Series A Preferred Stock. Each share of Series A Stock shall have a stated face value of 1,100.00 Stated Value ).
The Series A Stock is not convertible into common shares of the capital stock of the Company and as such is non-dilutive to current stockholders. 

Each share of Series A Stock
shall accrue a rate of return on the Stated Value at the rate of 10 per year, compounded annually from the date of issuance and
payable quarterly in cash or the issuance of additional shares of Series A Stock. 

Commencing on the one-year
anniversary of the issuance date of each share of Series A Stock to the two-year anniversary, each share of Series A Stock shall accrue
an automatic quarterly dividend, calculated on the Stated Value at a rate of 2.5 per quarter. For all periods following the two-year
anniversary of the issuance date of each share of Series A Stock, the quarterly dividend shall be 5 . The quarterly dividend shall be
payable quarterly in cash or the issuance of additional shares of Series A Stock. In the event the Company is unable to pay the Quarterly
Dividend of Preferred Return in cash and no remaining shares of Series A Stock are available for issuance, the Quarterly Dividend and
Preferred Return will continue to accrue until such time the Company can make payment. The Company classified the Series A Preferred Stock
as equity as all events that could trigger redemption are fully within the Company s control. 

On March 15, 2024, the Company
entered into an Exchange Agreement with Streeterville Capital that exchanged million in debt for shares of newly created Series
A Preferred Stock. 

On April 3, 2024, the Company

shares of our common stock. All of these exchanges were made pursuant to the exemption from the registration requirements afforded by
Section 3(a)(9) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. 

On September 18, 2024, the
Company redeemed shares of Series A Preferred Stock in conjunction with the sale of Common Stock under the SEPA. Also, during the quarter
ended September 2024, the Company redeemed shares of Series A Preferred Stock. 

Through September 30, 2024,
the Company has paid a preferred return of million through the issuance of additional shares of Series A Preferred Stock.

sold to certain purchasers shares of the Company s common stock together with accompanying common stock purchase warrants
to purchase shares of common stock, at a purchase price of 1.95 per share (or common stock equivalent) and two accompanying
Common Stock Purchase Warrants, for net proceeds of approximately million. The Common Stock Purchase Warrants will be exercisable

the Promissory Note, the Company shall make Weekly Payments to Scott in the amount of thousand per week. Interest accrues on the balance
of the Promissory Note at a rate of .0 per annum, compounded daily. In connection with the issuance of the Promissory Note, the Company

On March 20, 2024, the Company
entered into an additional invoice financing arrangement pursuant to a note purchase agreement with Scott, according to which, among other
things, Scott purchased from the Company a second Promissory Note 2 in the aggregate principal amount of thousand in exchange for
 thousand to the Company. The Promissory Note 2 is non-interest bearing and matures on . 

On April 2, 2024, the Company
reduced the principal balance due under the Promissory Note by 0.1 million which reflected the amount due from Scott for the exercise
of common stock purchase warrants. 

On April 19, 2024, Scott
entered into a private placement subscription agreement to convert the aggregate outstanding balance of million for both notes in
exchange for common stock and common stock purchase warrants.

Overview 

Intrusion offers businesses
of all sizes and industries products and services that leverage the Company s exclusive threat intelligence database of over 8.5
billion IP addresses and domain names. After many years of gathering intelligence and providing our INTRUSION TraceCop and
 Savant solutions exclusively to government entities, we released our first commercial product in 2021, the INTRUSION
 Shield . INTRUSION Shield was designed to allow businesses to incorporate a Zero Trust, reputation-based security
solution into their existing infrastructure to observe traffic flow and instantly block known malicious or unknown connections from both
entering or exiting a network, making it an ideal solution for protecting from Zero-Day and ransomware attacks. 

As discussed in more detail
below on September 30, 2024, we had 1.1 million in cash. If we are not able to raise adequate funds under the Company s ATM program
or obtain additional equity financing, the Company may be unable to implement the Company s business plan, fund its liquidity needs
or even continue its operations.

Revenues . Revenue
for the three and nine month periods ended September 30, 2024, was 1.5 and 4.1 million compared to 1.5 and 4.2 million for the same
periods in 2023. Revenue from consulting totaled 1.1 and 2.9 million for the three and nine month periods ended September 30, 2024,
compared to 1.0 and 3.1 million for the three and nine month periods ended September 30, 2023. The continuing resolution and delay in
the approval of a federal budget for the 2024 year which did not occur until March 22, 2024, impacted the timing of renewals and task
orders received for long-standing contracts which resulted in a decline in consulting revenues for the nine month period ended September
30, 2024. INTRUSION Shield revenues were 0.4 and 1.2 million for the three and nine month periods ended September 30,
2024, which is flat when compared to the prior year periods but represents a 49 increase over the June 2024 quarter. Shield revenues
for the June 2024 quarter had declined as a result of the loss of a large early INTRUSION Shield customer that had implemented
a highly customized and non-standard configuration of the product. The loss of revenues from this customer has been fully offset by revenues
from new customers signed in recent quarters. We believe the revenues from these new customers and several transactions that we anticipate
will close in the fourth quarter will drive INTRUSION Shield revenue growth into 2025. 

Concentration of Revenues .
For the three and nine month periods ended and September 30, 2024, revenues from sales to various U.S. government entities totaled 1.3
and 3.3 million, or 86 and 80 of revenues compared to 0.6 and 1.9 million, or 43 and 46 of revenues, for the same periods in 2023.
Although we expect our concentration of revenues to vary among customers in future periods depending upon the timing of certain sales,
we anticipate that sales to government customers will continue to account for a significant portion of our revenues in future periods.
Sales to the government present risks in addition to those involved in sales to commercial customers which could adversely affect our
revenues, including, without limitation, potential disruption to appropriation and spending patterns and the government s reservation
of the right to cancel contracts and purchase orders for its convenience. Although we do not anticipate that any of our revenues from
government customers will be renegotiated, any cancelled or renegotiated government orders could have a material adverse effect on our
financial results. As a result of sales to U.S. government entities representing a higher percentage of our revenues in 2024, no commercial
customer individually represented more than 10 of our total revenues as compared to two commercial customers in the 2023 period. Our
similar product and service offerings are not viewed as individual segments, as management analyzes the business as a whole and expenses
are not allocated to each product offering. 

18 

Gross Profit . Gross
profit was 1.2 and 3.2 million or 77.1 and 77.5 of revenues for the three and nine month periods ended September 30, 2024, compared
to 1.1 and 3.3 million or 77.9 and 77.2 of revenues for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023. The gross profit margin
will vary depending on product mix. INTRUSION Shield revenues represent between 27 to 30 of revenues for the three and
nine month periods ended September 30, 2024, and 2023. 

Operating Expenses .
Operating expenses for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, totaled 3.2 and 9.7 million, representing a decrease of 17 
and 25 when compared to 3.8 and 12.9 million for the same periods in 2023. The decrease was most notably due to a reduction in staffing
and contract labor expenses in addition to reduced spend on litigation defense costs, sales, and marketing. 

In late March 2023 we implemented
cost reduction measures that resulted in the reduction of sixteen permanent positions, the reduced use of contractors and renegotiating
or replacing spend on certain sales support and marketing services with less costly programs. Many of the reductions were in Research
and Development, which will impact the number and frequency of product releases. As we grow our customer base and increase our revenues,
we may choose to accelerate our product development in future periods, which would result in increased spending. Headcount on September
30, 2024, and 2023 was 50 and 49, respectively. 

Sales and Marketing .
Sales and marketing expenses decreased to 1.2 and 3.5 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 1.4
and 4.5 million for the three and nine month periods ended September 30, 2023. The 2024 nine month period includes approximately 0.2
million in one-time negotiated contract savings. Certain discretionary spend, inclusive of participation in trade shows, utilization of
third-party contractors for content and product messaging and travel, are likely to vary over time based on savings initiatives that may
be necessary. 

Research and Development .
Research and development expenses totaled 1.2 and 3.2 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 1.2
and 4.4 million for the same periods in 2023. The savings for the nine month period is a result of cost reduction measures implemented
in late March 2023 which included the reduction of 13 FTEs and the reduced use of contractors. Research and development costs may vary
over time as we determine the frequency of new releases, improved functionality and enhancements needed to be competitive with our product
offering. 

General and Administrative .
General and administrative expenses totaled 0.8 and 3.0 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to
 1.3 and 4.0 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023. The 1.0 million reduction in the nine month period relates
to the elimination of two positions, reduced share-based compensation, and one-time negotiated cost savings of 0.2 million. 

Interest Expense .
Interest expense for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, was 12 thousand and 274 thousand consisting principally of
the stated interest related to the Streeterville and Scott notes, and finance leases. Interest expense for the three and nine months ended
September 30, 2023, was 211 thousand and 729 thousand. The decreased interest expense resulted principally from the aggregate exchange
of the Streeterville debt to both common and preferred stock. On September 30, 2024, only 520 thousand of the Streeterville Note One
remains outstanding. Interest expenses will vary in the future based on our cash flow and borrowing needs. 

Interest Accretion and
Amortization of Debt Issuance Costs. During the quarter ended March 31, 2024, the Company entered into exchange agreements to convert
 9.5 million in Streeterville debt to 9.3 million of Series A preferred stock and 0.2 million to common stock and, as a result, the
Company reversed the interest accretion associated with the ability to stock-settle principal redemptions and wrote-off the remaining
deferred debt issue costs resulting in a net credit to interest expense of 1.0 million. For the three and nine months ended September
30, 2023, the interest accretion and amortization of debt issuance costs totaled 0.3 and 0.7 million. 

Other (Expense) Income,
Net. Other income and expenses were nominal amounts for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, and 2023. 

19 

Liquidity and Capital Resources 

As of September 30, 2024,
we had cash and cash equivalents of 1.1 million and a working capital deficit of (1.0) million. Management plans to fund the operations
of the Company through the continued use of the ATM and or additional equity financings. If the Company is not able to raise adequate
funds, the Company may be unable to implement the Company s business plan, fund its liquidity needs or even continue its operations. 

Sources of Liquidity 

Our principal sources of
cash for funding operations for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, has been proceeds received from the issuance of common stock
in a series of transactions which include 4.8 million from ATM sales, 2.6 million from a private placement, and 0.6 million from the
exercise of warrants. Our principal source of cash for funding operations in 2023 was 3.0 million from sales of common stock utilizing
the ATM program and changes in working capital which includes the receipt of 1.4 million in Employee Retention Tax Credit refunds recorded
in 2022. 

Standby Equity Purchase Agreement 

On July 3, 2024, we entered
into a 10 million Standby Equity Purchase Agreement SEPA with Streeterville Capital, LLC Streeterville pursuant to which the Company has the right to direct Streeterville during the 24 month term of the agreement to purchase common stock
subject to certain limitations and conditions set forth in the SEPA. 

The shares of common stock
purchased pursuant to SEPA will be at a purchase price equal to 95 of the lowest daily VWAP of the shares of Common Stock during the
three consecutive trading days commencing on the date of the delivery of an advance notice. VWAP is defined as the daily
volume weighted average price of the shares of Common Stock for such trading day on the Nasdaq Stock Market during regular trading hours
as reported by Bloomberg L.P. 

Under applicable Nasdaq rules
and the terms of the SEPA, in no event may the Company issue to Streeterville under the SEPA shares of Common Stock equal to greater than
19.99 of the shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to the execution of the SEPA (the Exchange Cap ), unless
(i) the Company obtains stockholder approval to issue shares of Common Stock in excess of the Exchange Cap in accordance with applicable
Nasdaq rules, or (ii) the average price per share paid by Streeterville for all of the shares of Common Stock that the Company directs
Streeterville to purchase from the Company pursuant to the SEPA, if any, equals or exceeds the lower of (a) the official closing price
of the Common Stock on Nasdaq immediately preceding the execution of the SEPA or (b) the average official closing price of the Common
Stock on Nasdaq for the five consecutive trading days immediately preceding the execution of the SEPA, adjusted as required by Nasdaq.
Moreover, the Company may not issue or sell any shares of Common Stock to Streeterville under the SEPA which, when aggregated with all
other shares of Common Stock then beneficially owned by Streeterville and its affiliates (as calculated pursuant to Section 13(d) of the
Exchange Act and Rule 13d-3 thereunder), would result in Streeterville beneficially owning more than 19.99 of the outstanding shares
of Common Stock. At the 2024 annual meeting stockholders approved the sale, issuance or potential issuance by the Company of Common Stock
(or securities convertible into or exercisable for our Common Stock) in excess of 20 of the shares of our Common Stock outstanding immediately
prior to the SEPA at an exercise price less than the Minimum Price in connection with the SEPA. 

During the quarter ended September
30, 2024, we sold 150,000 shares of Common Stock to Streeterville for an aggregate purchase price of 131,460. Future sales of shares
of Common Stock to Streeterville as an advance under the SEPA will depend on a variety of factors to be determined by the Company from
time to time, which may include, among other things, market conditions, the trading price of the Common Stock and determinations by the
Company as to the appropriate sources of funding for our business and operations. The Company will use 10 of the proceeds associated
with each Advance to redeem the outstanding Series A Preferred Stock held by Streeterville. 

20 

At-The-Market Program 

B. Riley Securities, Inc.
acts as sales agent under the Company s at-the-market program, which allowed us to potentially sell up to 50.0 million of its common
stock using the shelf registration statement on Form S-3 filed on August 5, 2021. On April 11, 2023, Instruction I.B.6 of Form S-3 and
in agreement with the terms of the sales agreement, the company revised the aggregate offering price of shares of common stock that we
can sell pursuant to the ATM program to 15 million. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we received 4.8 million, net of
fees for sales of common stock were made pursuant to the program. As of September 30, 2024, the remaining aggregate offering price of
shares of common stock that we can sell pursuant to the ATM program based on gross proceeds was 5.2 million. 

Notes Payable 

In March 2024, we entered
into an agreement with Streeterville to exchange 0.2 million in principal for 52.2 thousand shares of common stock. Also in March 2024,
we exchanged 9.3 million in Streeterville debt for 9,275 shares of our newly created Series A Preferred. The issuance of both common
and preferred shares was made pursuant to the exemption from the registration requirements afforded by the Securities Act, as amended.
The designations for the Series A Preferred preclude the Company from repaying any indebtedness for so long as any Series A Preferred
shares are outstanding. The Series A Preferred shares have a stated value of 1,100 per share and are subject to preferences and designations
as more fully described in our Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation filed on March 15, 2024. Following the exchanges noted herein,
the remaining balance on Note One was 0.5 million on September 30, 2024. The maturity date for Note One is September 2024 which conflicts
with the Series A Preferred designation prohibiting repayment of any indebtedness. We are in discussions with Streeterville to modify
the terms of the Note One agreement. 

On September 30, 2024, we
entered into a note purchase agreement with Streeterville where Streeterville purchased a note payable in the principal amount of 0.6
million in exchange for 0.5 million in cash after redemption of 0.1 million of Series A preferred stock. The note called for weekly
payments of 25 thousand until the maturity on November 18, 2024. In the event the note is not repaid on the maturity date weekly payments
increase to 50 thousand. The note bears no interest. 

During the quarter ended
March 31, 2024, we entered into two separate note purchase agreements with our Chief Executive Officer, Anthony Scott. On January 2, 2024,
Scott purchased a note payable in the principal amount of 1.1 million in exchange for 1.0 million in cash. The note called for weekly
payments of 40,000 until maturity on June 15, 2024. Interest accrued on the balance of the note at 7 per annum compounding daily. During
the quarter ended March 31, 2024, we made 200 thousand in principal payments. On March 20, 2024, Scott purchased a second note payable
in the principal amount of 343 thousand in exchange for 340 thousand in cash. The note was non-interest bearing and matured on April
19, 2024. On April 2, 2024, we reduced the principal balance due under the note by 101 thousand which reflected the amount due from Scott
for the exercise of common stock purchase warrants. On April 19, 2024, Scott entered into a private placement subscription agreement to
convert the aggregate remaining outstanding balance of 1.1 million for both notes in exchange for common stock and common stock purchase
warrants.

Critical Accounting Policies and Use of Estimates 

Our condensed consolidated
financial statements have been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The preparation of these condensed consolidated financial statements
requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, expenses, and related
disclosures. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the
circumstances. We evaluate our estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis. Actual results may differ from these estimates. To the extent
that there are material differences between these estimates and our actual results, our future financial statements will be affected. 

We believe the critical accounting
policies and estimates discussed under Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 
included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, filed with the SEC on April 1, 2024, reflect our more
significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of the condensed consolidated financial statements. There have been no significant
changes to our critical accounting policies and estimates as filed in such report. 

22 

Item 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 

Not applicable. 

Item 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 

We maintain disclosure
controls and procedures, as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Exchange Act, that are designed to ensure that information required
to be disclosed by us in reports we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time
periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including
our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.
In designing and evaluating our disclosure controls and procedures, management recognized that disclosure controls and procedures, no
matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives, and we must
apply our reasonable judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of potential disclosure controls and procedures. 

As of September 30, 2024,
our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, evaluated the effectiveness of the design and
operation of our disclosure controls and procedures and concluded that the disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of September
30, 2024. 

There have not been any changes
in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the quarter ended September 30, 2024, that have materially affected,
or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

PART II OTHER INFORMATION 

Item 1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS 

Stockholder Derivative Claim 

On June 3, 2022, a stockholder
derivative complaint was filed in U.S. District Court, District of Delaware the Court by the Plaintiff Stockholder on behalf of Intrusion
against Defendants. Plaintiff alleges that Defendants through various actions breached their fiduciary duties, wasted corporate assets,
and unjustly enriched Defendants by (a) incurring costs and expenses in connection with the ongoing SEC investigation, (b) incurring costs
and expenses to defend us with respect to the consolidated class action, (c) settling class-wide liability with respect to the consolidated
class action, as well as ancillary claims regarding sales of our common stock by certain of the Defendants. On September 28, 2023, we
agreed to settle the claim. On October 2, 2023, public notice of the settlement agreement was given. The settlement agreement provides
in part for (i) an amendment to our Bylaws, committee Charters, and other applicable corporate policies to implement certain measures
set forth more fully therein, to remain in effect for no less than three years; (ii) attorneys fees and expenses to plaintiff s
counsel of 0.3 million; and (iii) the dismissal of all claims against the Defendants, including the Company, in connection with the action.
The 0.3 million settlement payment was made by our insurance provider under our insurance policy since our 0.5 million retention was
previously exhausted. On April 3, 2024, the Court approved the settlement. 

In addition to these legal
proceedings, we are subject to various other claims that may arise in the ordinary course of business. We do not believe that any claims
exist where the outcome of such matters would have a material adverse effect on our condensed consolidated financial position, operating
results, or cash flows. However, there can be no assurance such legal proceedings will not have a material impact on our future results. 

Item 1A. RISK FACTORS 

In addition to the information
set forth elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and the risk factor set forth below, you should carefully consider the risk
factors we previously disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K, filed with the SEC on April 1, 2024, as of and for the year ended December
31, 2023 (the Annual Report ). These risks could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results
of operations, and cash flows. However, these risks are not the only risks we face. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known
to us or that we currently deem immaterial also may impair our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows. 

Nasdaq may delist our common stock from
trading on its exchange, which could limit stockholders ability to trade our common stock. 

On October 28, 2024, the Company
received a written notice from the Listing Qualifications department of Nasdaq Stock Market indicating that the Company is not in compliance
with the 1.00 minimum bid price requirement set forth in Nasdaq Listing Rule 5550(a)(2) for continued listing on the Nasdaq Capital Market. 

If the Company is not able
to resolve the minimum bid price requirement the Company s stock may be delisted. 

24 

Our stock price is likely to be highly volatile
because of several factors, including a limited public float. 

The market price of our common
stock has been volatile in the past and the market price of our common stock is likely to be highly volatile in the future. You may not
be able to resell shares of our common stock following periods of volatility because of the market s adverse reaction to volatility. 

Other factors that could cause
such volatility may include, among other things: 

actual or anticipated fluctuations in our operating results; 

the absence of securities analysts covering us and distributing research and recommendations about us; 

we may have a low trading volume for a number of reasons, including that a large portion of our stock is closely held; 

overall stock market fluctuations; 

announcements concerning our business or those of our competitors; 

actual or perceived limitations on our ability to raise capital when we require it, and to raise such capital on favorable terms; 

conditions or trends in the industry; 

litigation; 

changes in market valuations of other similar companies; 

future sales of common stock; 

departure of key personnel or failure to hire key personnel; and 

general market conditions. 

Any of these factors could
have a significant and adverse impact on the market price of our common stock. In addition, the stock market in general has at times experienced
extreme volatility and rapid decline that has often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of particular companies.
These broad market fluctuations may adversely affect the trading price of our common stock, regardless of our actual operating performance. 

Substantial future sales of shares of common
stock could cause the market price of our shares of common stock to decline. 

We have agreed, at our expense,
to prepare and file with the SEC certain registration statements providing for the resale of shares of common stock, including this registration
statement. The resale, or expected or potential resale, of a substantial number of our shares of common stock in the public market could
adversely affect the market price for our shares of common stock and make it more difficult for you to sell your shares of common stock
at times and prices that you feel are appropriate. In particular, as a result of the SEPA, Streeterville is an underwriter 
as such term is defined in Section 2(a)(11) of Securities Act, and the SEPA contemplates that Streeterville expects to resell any
shares of common stock we may issue and sell pursuant thereto. Furthermore, we expect that, because there will be a large number of shares
registered, Streeterville will continue to offer such covered securities for a significant period of time, the precise duration of which
cannot be predicted. Accordingly, the adverse market and price pressures resulting from an offering pursuant to a registration statement
may continue for an extended period of time. 

25 

The issuances of additional shares of common
stock under the SEPA may result in dilution of holders of common stock and have a negative impact on the market price of the common stock. 

Pursuant to the SEPA, we may
issue and sell up to 10 million worth of shares of common stock Advance Shares to Streeterville. The price at which we
may issue and sell shares is at 95 of the lowest daily VWAP of the common stock during the three trading days following a notice to sell
to Streeterville. Assuming that (a) we issue and sell the full 10 million worth of shares of common stock under the SEPA to Streeterville,
(b) no beneficial ownership limitations, and (c) the issue price for such sales is 1.08 per share, such additional issuances
would represent in the aggregate approximately 1,195,666 additional shares of common stock or approximately 16.5 of the total number
of shares of common stock outstanding as of the date hereof, after giving effect to such issuance. In addition, the Company issued 92,592
shares of common stock (the Streeterville Commitment Shares to Streeterville upon the effective date of the SEPA as consideration
for its irrevocable commitment to purchase shares of common stock at our direction, from time to time after the date of this prospectus.
Furthermore, the Company issued 216,921 shares of common stock (the Pre-Delivery Shares to Streeterville for the purchase
price of 0.01 per share upon the effective date of the SEPA as further consideration for its irrevocable commitment to purchase shares
of common stock at our direction, from time to time after the date of this prospectus. If the beneficial ownership limitation is not waived,
we may issue approximately 670,365 shares of common stock, or approximately 9.99 of the total number of shares of common stock outstanding
as of the date hereof, after giving effect to such issuance. The timing, frequency, and the price at which we issue shares of common stock
are subject to market prices and management s decision to sell shares of common stock, if at all. 

Upon effectiveness of this
registration statement, Streeterville may resell all, some or none of their shares of common stock beneficially owned by them from time
to time in their discretion and at different prices subject to the terms of the SEPA. As a result, investors will likely pay different
prices for those shares, and so may experience different levels of dilution (and in some cases substantial dilution) and different outcomes
in their investment results. Investors may experience a decline in the value of the shares they purchase as a result of future issuances
by the Company, whether to Streeterville or others at prices lower than the prices such investors paid for their shares. In addition,
if we issue a substantial number of shares to such parties, or if investors expect that we will do so, the actual sales of shares or the
mere existence of the SEPA may adversely affect the price of our common stock or make it more difficult for us to sell equity or equity-related
securities in the future at a desirable time and price, or at all. 

The issuance, if any, of common
stock would not affect the rights or privileges of the Company s existing stockholders, except that the economic and voting interests
of existing stockholders would be diluted. Although the number of shares of common stock that existing stockholders own would not decrease
as a result of these additional issuances, the shares of common stock owned by existing stockholders would represent a smaller percentage
of the total outstanding shares of common stock after any such issuance, potentially significantly smaller. 

Future sales of our common stock may depress
our share price. 

As of November 14, 2024, we
had 8,056,021 shares of our common stock outstanding. Sales of a number of shares of common stock in the public market or issuances of
additional shares pursuant to the exercise of our outstanding warrants, or the expectation of such sales or exercises, could cause the
market price of our common stock to decline. We may also sell additional shares of common stock or securities convertible into or exercisable
or exchangeable for common stock in subsequent public or private offerings or other transactions, which may adversely affect the market
price of our common stock. 

Item 2. UNREGISTERED SALES OF EQUITY SECURITIES
AND USE OF PROCEEDS AND ISSUER PURCHASES OF EQUITY SECURITIES 

On August 22, 2024, we agreed
to exchange 130 shares of Series A Preferred Stock for 110,852 shares of our common stock. 

 This exchange and sale was
made pursuant to an exemption from registration as set forth as set forth in Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act and/or Rule 506 of
Regulation D promulgated under the Securities Act. 

On July 10, 2024, we agreed to exchange 123,740
shares of common stock to settle a vendor liability of 0.1 million. 

Item 3. DEFAULTS UPON SENIOR SECURITIES 

None. 

Item 4. MINE SAFETY DISCLOSURES 

Not applicable. 

27 

Item 5. OTHER INFORMATION 

(a) 
 None. 

(b) 
 There have been no material changes to procedures by which security holders may recommend nominees to the Company s Board of Directors since the Company last provided disclosure in response to the requirements of Item 407(c)(3) of Regulation S-K. 

(c) 
 During the quarter ended September 30, 2024, no director or officer or any Rule 10b5-1 trading arrangement or non-Rule 10b5-1 trading arrangement, as each term is defined in Item 408(a) of Regulation S-K.
