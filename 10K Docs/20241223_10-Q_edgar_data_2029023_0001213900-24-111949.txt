total proceeds of . Out of the aggregate amount of , the amount of from the sale of the Private Placement
Units are added to the net proceeds from the Initial Public Offering held in a trust account (the Trust Account and the
balance of is receivable from the Sponsors, which will be presented as a reduction to stockholders deficit. The proceeds
received from the sale of the Private Placement Units held in the Trust Account was used partially to pay some general and administrative
expenses. 

Transaction costs amounted to , consisting
of of cash underwriting fees, of deferred underwriting fees which will be paid on the consummation of initial Business
Combination, and of other offering costs. 

Business Combination 

If the Company is unable to complete an
initial Business Combination within the period (the Combination Period ), it may seek an amendment to amended
and restated memorandum and articles of association to extend the period of time to complete an initial Business Combination beyond 21
months. The Company s amended and restated memorandum and articles of association requires at least a special resolution of shareholders
as a matter of Cayman Islands law, meaning that such an amendment be approved by at least two-thirds of ordinary shares who, being entitled
to do so, attend and vote (either in person or by proxy) at a general meeting of the company. If the Company seeks shareholder approval
to extend beyond the 21-month period in which to complete an initial Business Combination to a later date, The Company is required to
offer public shareholders the right to have their public ordinary shares redeemed for a pro rata share of the aggregate amount then on
deposit in the trust account, including interest (less permitted withdrawals and up to of interest to pay dissolution expenses).
There are no limitations to the number of times that the Company may seek shareholder approval or that shareholders may approve to extend
beyond the 21-month period in which to complete a Business Combination at a later date. If the initial Business Combination is not completed
in the period provided, the membership interests of the Sponsor become worthless.

. As of November 8, 2024 (after completion of the Initial Public Offering), the Company
had in its operating bank account and a working capital surplus of . The Company has incurred and expects to continue
to incur significant costs to operate as a publicly traded company, to evaluate business opportunities, and to close on a Business Combination.
Such costs will be incurred prior to generating any operating revenues. These factors, among others, raise substantial doubt about the
Company s ability to continue as a going concern. However, based on management s current cash flow forecast, management expects
the Company will have sufficient liquidity to fund the Company s operations for a period beyond twelve months from the date the
accompanying financial statements are issued. Consequently, management determined substantial doubt about the Company s ability
to continue as a going concern has been alleviated. 

Risks and Uncertainties 

Management continues
to evaluate the impact of significant global events such as the Russia/Ukraine and Israel/Palestine conflicts, on the industry and has
concluded that while it is reasonably possible that these could have a negative effect on the Company s financial position, results
of its operations and/or search for a target company, the specific impact is not readily determinable as of the date of these financial
statements. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.

or saleable until 30 days after the completion of initial business combination except pursuant to limited exceptions.

certain offering costs of the Company in consideration for Class B ordinary shares of the Company (after giving effect to a
share surrender effected on June 5, 2024). The initial shareholders have not forfeited Founder Shares as the over-allotment option was
exercised in full by the underwriter. The Founder Shares represent of the Company s issued and outstanding shares after the
Initial Public Offering. 

Administrative Services Agreement 

 The Company has entered into an agreement, commencing
on the effective date of the Initial Public Offering through the earlier of the Company s consummation of a Business Combination
and its liquidation, to pay the Sponsor a total of up to per month for office space and administrative and support services. As
of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, had been incurred and billed under the administrative services agreement. 

Promissory Note Related Party 

During June 2024, the Sponsor agreed to loan the
Company up to pursuant to a promissory note (the Note ). The Note was non-interest bearing, unsecured and due upon
the earlier of June 6, 2025 and the closing of the Initial Public Offering. During the period ended September 30, 2024, the Company borrowed

in connection with a Business Combination, the Sponsor, members of the Company s founding team or any of their affiliates may, but
are not obligated to, loan the Company funds as may be required Working Capital Loans ). If the Company completes a Business
Combination, the Company will repay the Working Capital Loans out of the proceeds of the Trust Account released to the Company. Otherwise,
the Working Capital Loans would be repaid only out of funds held outside the Trust Account. In the event that a Business Combination does
not close, the Company may use a portion of proceeds held outside the Trust Account to repay the Working Capital Loans, but no proceeds
held in the Trust Account would be used to repay the Working Capital Loans. The Working Capital Loans would either be repaid upon consummation
of a Business Combination, without interest, or, at the lenders discretion, up to of such Working Capital Loans may
be convertible into private placement units at a price of per unit. Except for the foregoing, the terms of such Working Capital
Loans, if any, have not been determined and no written agreements exist with respect to such loans. As of September 30, 2024, the Company
had no outstanding Working Capital Loans.

Class A Ordinary Shares The Company
is authorized to issue Class A ordinary shares with par value. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, there
were no Class A ordinary shares issued or outstanding. As a result of Initial Public Offering on November 8, 2024, the Company issued

Placement Units, each of which entitles the holder thereof to one Class A ordinary share. 

Class B Ordinary Shares The Company
is authorized to issue Class B ordinary shares with par value. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, there
were Class B ordinary shares issued and outstanding. 

Holders of the Class B ordinary shares have the
right to appoint all the Company s directors prior to an initial Business Combination. On any other matter submitted to a vote of
the Company s shareholders, holders of the Class A ordinary shares and holders of the Class B ordinary shares will vote together
as a single class, except as required by law or share exchange rule; provided, that the holders of Class B ordinary shares are be entitled
to vote as a separate class to increase the authorized number of Class B ordinary shares. Each share of ordinary share has one vote on
all such matters. 

The Class B ordinary shares automatically convert
into Class A ordinary shares at the time of the initial Business Combination at a ratio such that the number of Class A ordinary shares
issuable upon conversion of all Class B ordinary shares, will equal, in the aggregate, on an as-converted basis, of the sum of (i)
the total number of shares issued in the Initial Public Offering, including shares issued in connection with the underwriter exercise
of their option to purchase additional Units, plus (ii) the total number of Class A ordinary shares issued or deemed issued or issuable
upon conversion or exercise of any equity-linked securities (as defined herein) or rights issued or deemed issued, by the Company in connection
with or in relation to the consummation of the initial Business Combination, excluding any Class A ordinary shares or equity-linked securities
exercisable for or convertible into Class A ordinary shares issued, deemed issued, or to be issued, to any seller in the initial Business
Combination and any private placement rights issued to the Sponsor, its affiliates or any member of the management team upon conversion

rights at November 8, 2024. The rights are not remeasured to fair value on a recurring basis. 

As of November 8, 2024, there were public
rights and private rights included in the Private Placement Units outstanding. Each holder of one right will receive one Class
A ordinary share upon consummation of the initial business combination, whether or not the Company will be the surviving entity, even
if the holder of a public right converted all Class A ordinary shares held by them or it in connection with the initial business combination
or an amendment to the Company s memorandum and articles of association with respect to Company s pre-business combination
activities. In the event the Company will not be the survivor upon completion of the initial business combination, each holder of rights
will be required to affirmatively convert their rights in order to receive the Class A ordinary shares underlying the rights (without
paying any additional consideration) upon consummation of the business combination. The Company will not issue fractional Class A ordinary
shares in connection with an exchange of rights. No fractional shares will be issued upon exchange of rights. No additional consideration
will be required to be paid by a holder of rights in order to receive its additional shares upon consummation of a business combination.
If the Company is unable to complete an initial Business Combination within the required time period and the Company liquidates the funds
held in the Trust Account, holders of rights will not receive any of such funds with respect to their rights, nor will they receive any
distribution from the Company s assets held outside of the Trust Account with respect to such rights, and the rights will expire
worthless. Further, there are no contractual penalties for failure to deliver securities to the holders of the rights upon consummation
of an initial Business Combination. Accordingly, the rights may expire worthless.

Overview 

We are a blank check company incorporated on May 10, 2023 as a Cayman
Islands exempted company for the purpose of effecting a merger, share exchange, asset acquisition, share purchase, reorganization or similar
business combination with one or more businesses. 

As of September 30, 2024, we had not yet commenced operations. All
activity through September 30, 2024 relates to our formation and our Initial Public Offering which is described below, and since the Initial
Public Offering, our search for a Business Combination. We will not generate any operating revenues until after the completion of our
initial Business Combination, at the earliest. We generate non-operating income from the proceeds held in the Trust Account (as defined
below). We have selected December 31 as our fiscal year end. 

The registration statement for the Company s
Initial Public Offering was declared effective on November 7, 2024. On November 8, 2024, the Company consummated the Initial Public Offering
of 23,000,000 Units including 3,000,000 additional public units as the underwriters over-allotment option was exercised in full
at 10.00 per Unit, generating gross proceeds of 230,000,000. 

Simultaneously with the consummation of the Initial
Public Offering and the sale of the Units, the Company consummated the Private Placement of 422,500 Private Placement Units including
7,500 additional Private Placement Units as the underwriters over-allotment option was exercised in full to the Sponsor, at a price
of 10.00 per Private Placement Unit, generating total proceeds of 4,225,000. Out of the aggregate amount of 4,225,000, the amount of
 4,040,000 from the sale of the Private Placement Units are added to the net proceeds from the Initial Public Offering held in the Trust
Account and the balance of 185,000 is receivable from the Sponsor, which will be presented as a reduction to stockholders deficit.
The proceeds received from the sale of the Private Placement Units held in the Trust Account was used partially to pay some general and
administrative expenses. 

13 

If the Company is unable to complete an initial
Business Combination within the Combination Period, it may seek an amendment to amended and restated memorandum and articles of association
to extend the period of time to complete an initial Business Combination beyond 21 months. The Company s amended and restated memorandum
and articles of association requires at least a special resolution of shareholders as a matter of Cayman Islands law, meaning that such
an amendment be approved by at least two-thirds of ordinary shares who, being entitled to do so, attend and vote (either in person or
by proxy) at a general meeting of the company. If the Company seeks shareholder approval to extend beyond the 21-month period in which
to complete an initial Business Combination to a later date, The Company is required to offer public shareholders the right to have their
public ordinary shares redeemed for a pro rata share of the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account, including interest
(less permitted withdrawals and up to 100,000 of interest to pay dissolution expenses). There are no limitations to the number of times
that the Company may seek shareholder approval or that shareholders may approve to extend beyond the 21-month period in which to complete
a Business Combination at a later date. If the initial Business Combination is not completed in the period provided, the membership interests
of the Sponsor become worthless. 

Going Concern Consideration

the Company had a working capital deficit of 744,297. As of November 8, 2024 (after completion of the Initial Public Offering), the Company
had 1,974,498 in its operating bank account and a working capital surplus of 1,910,213. The Company has incurred and expects to continue
to incur significant costs to operate as a publicly traded company, to evaluate business opportunities, and to close on a Business Combination.
Such costs will be incurred prior to generating any operating revenues. These factors, among others, raise substantial doubt about the
Company s ability to continue as a going concern within one year after the date that the financial statements are issued. However,
based on management s current cash flow forecast, management expects the Company will have sufficient liquidity to fund the Company s
operations for a period beyond twelve months from the date the accompanying financial statements are issued. Consequently, management
determined substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern has been alleviated. 

Results of Operations 

Our entire activity since inception up to September 30, 2024 relates
to our formation and the Initial Public Offering, and since the Initial Public Offering, our search for a Business Combination. We will
not generate any operating revenues until the closing and completion of our initial Business Combination, at the earliest. We generate
non-operating income from the proceeds held in the Trust Account. 

For the three months ended September 30, 2024,
we had a net loss of 85,810, which consisted of operating costs, compared to a net loss of zero for the three months ended September
30, 2023. 

For the nine months ended September 30, 2024,
we had a net loss of 116,235, which consisted of operating costs, compared to a net loss of 13,392 for the nine months ended September
30, 2023. 

Contractual Obligations 

Administrative Services Agreement 

The Company has entered into an agreement, commencing
on the effective date of the Initial Public Offering through the earlier of the Company s consummation of a Business Combination
and its liquidation, to pay the Sponsor a total of up to 55,556 per month for office space and administrative and support services. As
of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, 0 had been incurred and billed under the administrative services agreement. 

Promissory Note Related Party 

During June 2024, the Sponsor agreed to loan the
Company up to 300,000 pursuant to the Note. The Note was non-interest bearing, unsecured and due upon the earlier of June 6, 2025 and
the closing of the Initial Public Offering. During the period ended September 30, 2024, the Company borrowed 132,984 under the Note to
pay for offering costs, of which 93,228 was settled through risk capital funding. As of September 30, 2024, the Company had an outstanding
balance of 39,756 under the Note, of which 5,000 was subsequently settled through risk capital funding and 34,756 was repaid from the
proceeds of the Initial Public Offering placed in the Trust Account. 

14 

Working Capital Loans 

In addition, in order to finance transaction costs
in connection with a Business Combination, the Sponsor, members of the Company s founding team or any of their affiliates may, but
are not obligated to, loan the Company Working Capital Loans. If the Company completes a Business Combination, the Company will repay
the Working Capital Loans out of the proceeds of the Trust Account released to the Company. Otherwise, the Working Capital Loans would
be repaid only out of funds held outside the Trust Account. In the event that a Business Combination does not close, the Company may use
a portion of proceeds held outside the Trust Account to repay the Working Capital Loans, but no proceeds held in the Trust Account would
be used to repay the Working Capital Loans. The Working Capital Loans would either be repaid upon consummation of a Business Combination,
without interest, or, at the lenders discretion, up to 1,500,000 of such Working Capital Loans may be convertible into private
placement units at a price of 10.00 per unit. Except for the foregoing, the terms of such Working Capital Loans, if any, have not been
determined and no written agreements exist with respect to such loans. As of September 30, 2024, the Company had no outstanding Working
Capital Loans. 

Critical Accounting Policies 

This management s discussion and analysis of our financial condition
and results of operations is based on our financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The preparation
of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues
and expenses and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities in our financial statements. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our
estimates and judgments, including those related to fair value of financial instruments and accrued expenses. We base our estimates on
historical experience, known trends and events and various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the
results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent
from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. We have not identified any
critical accounting policies. 

Recent Accounting Pronouncements 

Management does not believe that any recently issued, but not yet effective,
accounting standards, if currently adopted, would have a material effect on the Company s financial statements. 

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 

As of September 30, 2024, we did not have any off-balance sheet arrangements
as defined in Item 303(a)(4)(ii) of Regulation S-K. 

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 

We are a smaller reporting company as defined by Rule 12b-2 of the
Exchange Act and are not required to provide the information otherwise required under this item. 

Item 4. Controls and Procedures 

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

Under the supervision and with the participation of our management,
including our Co-Chief Executive Officers, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness, of our disclosure controls and procedures
as of September 30, 2024, as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act. Based on this evaluation, our
principal executive officers and principal financial and accounting officer have concluded that due to inadequate segregation of duties
within account processes and insufficient written policies and procedures for accounting, IT and financial reporting and record keeping,
during the period covered by this report, our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective at a reasonable assurance level and,
accordingly, provided reasonable assurance that the information required to be disclosed by us in reports filed under the Exchange Act
is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms. 

Disclosure controls and procedures are designed to ensure that information
required to be disclosed by us in our Exchange Act reports is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified
in the SEC s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Co-Chief
Executive Officers or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 

Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 

There was no change in our internal control over financial reporting
that occurred during the fiscal quarter ended September 30, 2024 covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q that has materially affected,
or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

PART II-OTHER INFORMATION 

Item 1. Legal Proceedings 

None. 

Item 1A. Risk Factors 

Factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from
those in this Quarterly Report are any of the risks described in our final prospectus for the Initial Public Offering filed with the SEC
on November 7, 2024. Any of these factors could result in a significant or material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial
condition. Additional risk factors not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also impair our business or results
of operations. As of the date of this Quarterly Report, there have been no material changes to the risk factors disclosed in our final
prospectus for the Initial Public Offering filed with the SEC, except we may disclose changes to such factors or disclose additional factors
from time to time in our future filings with the SEC. 

Item 2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds 

On November 8, 2024, we consummated our Initial Public Offering of
23,000,000 Units, which includes the exercise in full of the underwriters option to purchase an additional 3,000,000 Units at 10.00
per Unit, generating gross proceeds of 230,000,000. 

Simultaneously with the consummation of the Initial Public Offering
and the sale of the Units, the Company consummated the Private Placement of 422,500 Private Placement Units including 7,500 additional
Private Placement Units as the underwriters over-allotment option was exercised in full to the Sponsor, at a price of 10.00 per
Private Placement Unit, generating total proceeds of 4,225,000. 

Transaction costs amounted to 10,951,368, consisting
of 975,000 of cash underwriting fees, 9,200,000 of deferred underwriting fees which will be paid on the consummation of initial Business
Combination, and 776,368 of other offering costs. 

On November 8, 2024, a total of 234,040,000 of
the net proceeds from the sale of the Units in the IPO and the Private Placement were deposited in a trust account established for the
benefit of the Company s public shareholders at JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. maintained by Continental Stock Transfer Trust Company,
acting as trustee. 

For a description of the use of the proceeds generated in our Initial
Public Offering, see Part I, Item 2 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.
