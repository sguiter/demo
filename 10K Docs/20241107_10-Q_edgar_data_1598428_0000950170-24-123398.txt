million and million, respectively, in funding related to this program and recorded the funding as a current liability on the Consolidated Balance Sheets and as investing within the Consolidated Cash Flows. There was million in capital spending in the third quarter of 2024 related to assets associated with government-funded projects. The Company will apply the guidance within "International Accounting Standards ("IAS") 20 - Accounting for Government Grants and Disclosure of Government Assistance" and will record the funding received as a reduction to property, plant and equipment at the completion of the project, as the primary conditions for receipt of these funds are to build-out new assets to support increased artillery shell production for the United States Army. In October 2024, the Company received an additional million in government funding. There are no other current ASUs issued, but not adopted, that are expected to have a material impact on the Company.

Non-service related pension and other postretirement benefit income, for all years, consists primarily of the interest cost, expected return on plan assets and amortization components of net periodic cost. The Company's Bargaining Unit Pension Plan ("Bargaining Plan"), the Supplemental Pension Plan ("Supplemental Plan") and the recently terminated Retirement Plan ("Salaried Plan") each have a provision that permits employees to elect to receive their pension benefits in a lump sum upon retirement. In the first quarter of 2024, the cumulative cost of all lump sum payments was expected to exceed the sum of the service cost and interest cost components of net periodic pension cost for the Salaried Plan. As a result, the Company completed a full remeasurement of its pension obligations and plan assets associated with the Salaried Plan during the first quarter of 2024 and recorded a loss of million. 

 10 

Table of Contents 

 million from the remeasurement of the Salaried Plan was recognized for the three months ended June 30, 2024. The loss was primarily due to investment losses on plan assets of million partially offset by a decrease in the liability due to an increase in the discount rate of million. In addition, the three months ended June 30, 2024 included a million gain as a result of the completion of the Salaried Plan annuitization. A gain of million from the remeasurement of the Salaried Plan was recognized for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The gain for the three months ended September 30, 2023 was due to a million decrease in the liability mainly driven by an increase in the discount rate, partially offset by million of investment losses on plan assets. For the nine months ended September 30, 2023 , the loss of million was primarily related to investment losses on plan assets of million and lump sum basis losses of million, partially offset by a decrease in the pension liability of million due to an increase in the discount rate. For more details on the aforementioned remeasurements, refer to Note 9 - Retirement and Postretirement Plans. During 2023, the Company recognized insurance recoveries of million related to the 2022 Faircrest melt shop unplanned downtime. In the first quarter of 2023, the Company recognized recoveries of million, of which million was received during the first quarter and million was received in the second quarter of 2023. In the second quarter of 2023, a million insurance recovery was received, and the remaining million was received in the first quarter of 2024. The 2022 insurance claims were closed in the first quarter of 2024. For further information related to previous insurance recoveries, refer to "Note 7 - Other (Income) Expense, net" in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 . 

Effective tax rate 

Income tax expense for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was calculated using forecasted multi-jurisdictional annual effective tax rates to determine a blended annual effective tax rate. The effective tax rate for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 was and , respectively, compared to a rate of and for the prior year. The decrease in the effective tax rate is primarily related to lower income before income taxes for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024. In addition to lower income before income taxes, the decrease for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023 is also impacted by the deductibility of the loss on extinguishment of debt on the Convertible Senior Notes due 2025 and a state net operating loss discrete adjustment that both impacted 2023. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 , Metallus made million in U.S. federal tax payments, million in state and local tax payments, and million in foreign tax payments. For the nine months ended September 30, 2023 , Metallus made million in U.S. federal payments, million in state and local tax payments, and million in foreign tax payments.

 million shares for the three months ended September 30, 2024. For the three months ended September 30, 2024, common share equivalents for shares issuable for equity-based awards were excluded from the computation of diluted earnings (loss) per share, because the effect of their inclusion would have been anti-dilutive. Common share equivalents for shares issuable for equity-based awards amounted to million shares for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, million shares were excluded from the computation of diluted earnings (loss) per share, primarily related to options with exercise prices above the average market price of our common shares (i.e., underwater options), because the effect of their inclusion would have been anti-dilutive. The difference between the remaining million shares assumed issued and the million shares assumed purchased with potential proceeds for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 were included in the denominator of the diluted earnings (loss) per share calculation. Common share equivalents for shares issuable for equity-based awards amounted to million shares for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 , million shares and million shares, respectively, were excluded from the computation of diluted earnings (loss) per share, primarily related to options with exercise prices above the average market price of our common shares (i.e., underwater options), because the effect of their inclusion would have been anti-dilutive . The difference between the remaining million shares and million shares assumed issued and the million shares and million shares assumed purchased with potential proceeds for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively, were included in the denominator of the diluted earnings (loss) per share calculation. Convertible Notes Common share equivalents for shares issuable upon the conversion of outstanding Convertible Notes were excluded in the computation of diluted earnings (loss) per share for the three months ended September 30, 2024 as these shares would be anti-dilutive. Common share equivalents for shares issuable upon the conversion of outstanding Convertible Notes were included in the computation of diluted earnings (loss) per share for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as these shares would be dilutive. The reduction in the dilutive effect on convertible notes is attributable to the repurchase of outstanding Convertible Notes that occurred in the first quarter of 2023. For additional details regarding the Convertible Notes please refer to Note 14 - Financing Arrangements in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023.

Convertible Senior Notes due 2025 The principal amount of the Convertible Senior Notes due 2025 upon issuance was million. Transaction costs related to the Convertible Senior Notes due 2025 incurred upon issuance were million. These costs are amortized to interest expense over the term of the notes. The Convertible Senior Notes due 2025 mature on December 1, 2025. The Indenture for the Convertible Senior Notes due 2025 provides that notes will become convertible during a quarter when the share price for trading days during the final trading days of the immediately preceding quarter was greater than of the conversion price. This criterion was met during the third quarter of 2024 and as such the notes can be converted at the option of the holders beginning October 1 through December 31, 2024. Whether the notes will be convertible following such period will depend on if this criterion, or another conversion condition, is met in the future. As such, the Convertible Senior Notes due 2025 are classified as a current liability in the Consolidated Balance Sheets as of September 30, 2024. This criterion was also met as of December 31, 2023. To date, no holders have elected to convert their notes during any optional conversion periods. For details regarding all conversion mechanics and methods of settlement, refer to the Indenture for the Convertible Senior Notes due 2025 filed as an exhibit to a Form 8-K on December 15, 2020 and incorporated by reference in our most recent 10-K filing. In the first quarter of 2023, the Company repurchased a total of million aggregate principal amount of its Convertible Senior Notes due 2025. Total cash paid to noteholders was million. A loss on extinguishment of debt of million was recognized, including a charge of million for unamortized debt issuance costs related to the portion of debt extinguished, as well as the related transaction costs.

 million, respectively. Fair Value Measurement The fair value of the Convertible Senior Notes due 2025 was approximately million as of September 30, 2024.The fair value of the Convertible Senior Notes due 2025, which falls within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy as defined by applicable accounting guidance, is based on a valuation model primarily using observable market inputs and requires a recurring fair value measurement on a quarterly basis. Metallus Credit Facility is variable-rate debt. As such, any outstanding carrying value is a reasonable estimate of fair value as interest rates on these borrowings approximate current market rates. This valuation falls within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy and is based on quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets that are observable either directly or indirectly. There were outstanding borrowings on the Credit Facility as of September 30, 2024. Interest (Income) Expense, net

Treasury Shares On December 20, 2021 Metallus announced that its Board of Directors authorized a share repurchase program under which the Company may repurchase up to million of its outstanding common shares. On November 2, 2022, the Board of Directors authorized an additional million towards its share repurchase program and on May 6, 2024 the Board of Directors authorized an additional million. The share repurchase program is intended to return capital to shareholders while also offsetting dilution from annual equity compensation awards. The share repurchase program does not require the Company to acquire any dollar amount or number of shares and may be modified, suspended, extended or terminated by the Company at any time without prior notice. These authorizations reflect the continued confidence of the Board and senior leadership in the Company s ability to generate sustainable through-cycle profitability while maintaining a strong balance sheet and cash flow. For the three months ended September 30, 2024 , the Company repurchased approximately million common shares in the open market at an aggregate cost of million, which equates to an average repurchase price of per share. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 , the Company repurchased approximately million common shares in the open market at an aggregate cost of million, which equates to an average repurchase price of per share. As of September 30, 2024 , the Company had a balance of million remaining on its authorized share repurchase program.

On May 15, 2024, the Company entered into an agreement to purchase a group annuity contract from Prudential in connection with the annuitization of the Salaried Plan. The Salaried Plan annuitization settled approximately million of the Company s remaining U.S. pension obligations. Prudential began future benefit payments under the group annuity contract starting August 1, 2024 for all remaining participants in the Salaried Plan. Benefits payable to Salaried Plan participants were not reduced as a result of the annuitization. The group annuity contract was purchased using existing assets of the Salaried Plan and requires no cash contribution from the Company.

The Bargaining Plan, Supplemental Plan and the recently terminated Salaried Plan have a provision that permits employees to elect to receive their pension benefits in a lump sum upon retirement. The Company's accounting policy is to recognize settlements during the quarter in which it is projected that the costs of all settlements during the year will be greater than the sum of the service cost and interest cost components. In the first quarter of 2024, the cumulative cost of all lump sum payments was expected to exceed the sum of the service cost and interest cost components of net periodic pension cost for the Salaried Plan. As a result, the Company completed a full r emeasurement of its pension obligations and plan assets associated with the Salaried Plan during the first quarter of 2024. On May 1, 2024, in advance of the annuitization of the Salaried plan and upon the election of certain participants, the Company made million in lump sum payments. The Company remeasured the Salaried Plan ahead of the annuitization on May 15, 2024. In the first quarter of 2023, in anticipation of receiving the regulatory approval to move forward with the plan termination process, the cumulative costs of all lump sum payments and other settlements were projected to exceed this threshold during 2023 for the Salaried Plan. Ultimately, these costs did not exceed this threshold for the Salaried Plan during 2023. The Salaried Plan's pension obligations and plan assets were remeasured during each quarter of 2023. 

 time-based restricted stock units and performance-based restricted stock units, which relates to the annual grant to our employees and grants to the Board of Directors. During the nine months ended September 30, 2023 the Board of Directors granted time-based restricted stock units and performance-based restricted stock units, which relates to the annual grant to our employees and Board of Directors. Time-based restricted stock units are issued with the fair value equal to the closing market price of Metallus common shares on the date of grant. These restricted stock units do not have any performance conditions for vesting. Expense is recognized over the service period, adjusted for any forfeitures that occur during the vesting period. The weighted average fair value of the restricted stock units granted during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was per share. Performance-based restricted stock units issued in 2024 vest based on achievement of a total shareholder return TSR metric. The TSR metric is considered a market condition, which requires Metallus to reflect it in the fair value on grant date using an advanced option-pricing model. The fair value of each performance share was therefore determined using a Monte Carlo valuation model, a generally accepted lattice pricing model under ASC 718 Stock-based Compensation. The Monte Carlo valuation model, among other factors, uses commonly-accepted economic theory underlying all valuation models, estimates fair value using simulations of future share prices based on stock price behavior and considers the correlation of peer company returns in determining fair value. The fair value of the performance-based restricted stock units granted during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was per share. In the fourth quarter of 2023, the Board approved and authorized a performance-based Transformation Incentive Grant program

 Net Sales 
 The charts below present net sales and shipments for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. 

Net sales for the three months ended September 30, 2024 were 227.2 million, a decrease of 127.0 million, or 35.9 compared with the three months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease in net sales was primarily driven by lower volumes, unfavorable surcharges and price/mix. Lower volumes of 55.9 thousand ship tons resulted in a net sales decrease of 83.3 million. The decrease in surcharges of 41.4 million was primarily due to a reduction in raw material surcharge revenue per ton as a result of lower scrap and alloy prices. Unfavorable price/mix of 2.3 million was driven by lower base prices across industrial and energy end-market sectors, partially offset by favorable base prices in automotive and aerospace defense end-market sectors. Excluding surcharges, net sales decreased 85.6 million or 32.0 .

Non-service related pension and other postretirement benefit income, for all years, consists primarily of the interest cost, expected return on plan assets and amortization components of net periodic cost. 
 The Company's Bargaining Unit Pension Plan ("Bargaining Plan"), the Supplemental Pension Plan ("Supplemental Plan") and the recently terminated Retirement Plan ("Salaried Plan") each have a provision that permits employees to elect to receive their pension benefits in a lump sum upon retirement. In the first quarter of 2024, the cumulative cost of all lump sum payments was expected to exceed the sum of the service cost and interest cost components of net periodic pension cost for the Salaried Plan. As a result, the Company completed a full remeasurement of its pension obligations and plan assets associated with the Salaried Plan during the first quarter of 2024 and recorded a loss of 0.8 million. 
 In the second quarter of 2024, the Company entered into an agreement to purchase a group annuity contract from The Prudential Insurance Company of America Prudential in connection with the annuitization of the Salaried Plan. The Company remeasured the Salaried Plan upon annuitization on May 15, 2024. A loss of 1.0 million from the remeasurement of the Salaried Plan was recognized for the three months ended June 30, 2024. The loss was primarily due to investment losses on plan assets of 1.8 million partially offset by a decrease in the liability due to an increase in the discount rate of 0.7 million. In addition, the three months ended June 30, 2024 included a 0.1 million gain as a result of the completion of the Salaried Plan annuitization. The Salaried Plan may incur additional expenses in the fourth quarter of 2024 based on final plan expenses and participant transfers. 
 A gain of 1.0 million from the remeasurement of the Salaried Plan was recognized for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The gain for the three months ended September 30, 2023 was due to a 6.5 million decrease in the liability mainly driven by an increase in the discount rate, partially offset by 5.5 million of investment losses on plan assets. For the nine months ended September 30, 2023, the loss of 1.7 million was primarily related to investment losses on plan assets of 5.6 million and lump sum basis losses of 1.3 million, partially offset by a decrease in the pension liability of 5.2 million due to an increase in the discount rate.

 During 2023, the Company recognized insurance recoveries of 31.3 million related to the 2022 Faircrest melt shop unplanned downtime. In the first quarter of 2023, the Company recognized recoveries of 9.8 million, of which 0.8 million was received during the first quarter and 9.0 million was received in the second quarter of 2023. In the second quarter of 2023, a 1.5 million insurance recovery was received, and the remaining 20.0 million was received in the first quarter of 2024.

The benefit for income taxes for the quarter ended September 30, 2024 was 1.2 million compared to a provision for income taxes of 9.8 million in 2023. The change in the effective tax rate is primarily related to lower income before income taxes for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024. In addition to lower income before income taxes, the decrease for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023 is also impacted by the deductibility of the loss on extinguishment of debt on the Convertible Senior Notes due 2025 and a state net operating loss discrete adjustment that both impacted 2023.

 Non-GAAP Financial Measures 
 Net Sales, Excluding Surcharges 
 The tables below present net sales by end-markets, adjusted to exclude surcharges, which represents a financial measure that has not been determined in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States U.S. GAAP ). We believe presenting net sales by end-markets, both on a gross basis and on a per ton basis, adjusted to exclude raw material and energy surcharges, provides additional insight into key drivers of net sales such as base price and product mix. Due to the fact that the surcharge mechanism can introduce volatility to our net sales, net sales adjusted to exclude surcharges provides management and investors clarity of our core pricing and results. Presenting net sales by end-markets, adjusted to exclude surcharges including on a per ton basis, allows management and investors to better analyze key market indicators and trends and allows for enhanced comparison between our end-markets. 
 When surcharges are included in a customer agreement and are applicable (i.e., reach the threshold amount), based on the terms outlined in the respective agreement, surcharges are then included as separate line items on a customer s invoice. These additional surcharge line items adjust base prices to match cost fluctuations due to market conditions. Each month, the Company will post on the surcharges page of its external website, as well as our customer portal, the scrap, alloy, and energy surcharges that will be applied (as a separate line item) to invoices dated in the following month (based upon shipment volumes in the following month). All surcharges invoiced are included in GAAP net sales.

 Amended Credit Agreement 
 On September 30, 2023, the Company, as borrower, and certain domestic subsidiaries of the Company, as subsidiary guarantors (the Subsidiary Guarantors ), entered into a Fourth Amended and Restated Credit Agreement (the Amended Credit Agreement ), with JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as administrative agent (the Administrative Agent ), and the lenders party thereto (collectively, the Lenders ), which further amended and restated the Company s existing secured Third Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, dated as of October 15, 2019. 
 The Amended Credit Agreement extended the maturity date of the asset-based revolving credit facility (the Credit Facility from October 2024 to September 2027. Following the amendment, Credit Facility capacity remained at 400.0 million. Pursuant to the terms of the Amended Credit Agreement, the interest rate to be paid on any borrowings under the Credit Facility is now based on a two-tiered schedule rather than a three-tiered schedule with applicable rates decreasing by 25 basis points, references to LIBOR rates were updated with references to SOFR rates, the advance rate on investment-grade eligible accounts receivable was increased from 85 to 90 , and there was an improvement in the springing fixed charge coverage ratio from 1.1x to 1.0x. The Credit Facility remains undrawn at this time. 
 
 Refer to Note 8 - Financing Arrangements in the Notes to the unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. 
 Convertible Notes 
 In May 2016, the Company issued 75.0 million aggregate principal amount of Convertible Senior Notes due 2021, plus an additional 11.3 million principal amount to cover over-allotments. 
 In December 2020, the Company entered into separate, privately negotiated exchange agreements with a limited number of holders of the Company s then outstanding Convertible Senior Notes due 2021. Pursuant to the exchange agreements, the Company exchanged 46.0 million aggregate principal amount of Convertible Senior Notes due 2021 for 46.0 million aggregate principal amount of its new Convertible Senior Notes due 2025. The net amount of this exchange was 44.5 million, after deducting the initial underwriters fees and paying other transaction costs. The Company did not receive any cash proceeds from the issuance of the Convertible Senior Notes due 2025. 
 The Convertible Senior Notes due 2025 bear cash interest at a rate of 6.0 per year, payable semiannually on June 1 and December 1, beginning on June 1, 2021. The Convertible Senior Notes due 2025 will mature on December 1, 2025, unless earlier repurchased or converted. The Convertible Senior Notes due 2025 are convertible at the option of holders in certain circumstances and during certain periods into the Company s common shares, cash, or a combination thereof, at the Company s election. The Indenture for the Convertible Senior Notes due 2025 provides that notes will become convertible during a quarter when the share price for 20 trading days during the final 30 trading days of the immediately preceding quarter was greater than 130 of the conversion price. This criterion was met during the third quarter of 2024 and as such the notes can be converted at the option of the holders beginning October 1 through December 31, 2024. Whether the notes will be convertible following such period will depend on if this criterion, or another conversion condition, is met in the future. To date, no holders have elected to convert their notes during any optional conversion periods. For additional details regarding the Convertible Notes please refer to Note 14 - Financing Arrangements in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023.

(1) As of September 30, 2024, and December 31, 2023, Metallus had less than 400.0 million in collateral assets to borrow against. 
 Our principal sources of liquidity are cash and cash equivalents, cash flows from operations and available borrowing capacity under our Amended Credit Agreement. As of September 30, 2024, taking into account our view of industrial, automotive, aerospace defense and energy market demand for our products, and our 2024 operating and long-range plan, we believe that our cash balance as of September 30, 2024, projected cash generated from operations, borrowings available under the Amended Credit Agreement and committed government funding to support capital investments, will be sufficient to satisfy our working capital needs, capital expenditures and other liquidity requirements associated with our operations, including servicing our debt and pension and postretirement benefit obligations, for at least the next twelve months. We expect capital expenditures to be approximately 65 million in 2024, inclusive of approximately 15 million of capital expenditures funded by the U.S. government. 
 
 In the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company contributed a total of 37.5 million in pension contributions, most of which related to the Bargaining Plan. In October 2024, the Company contributed an additional 5.3 million to the Bargaining Plan, resulting in total 2024 pension contributions of 42.8 million. 
 To the extent our liquidity needs prove to be greater than expected or cash generated from operations is less than anticipated, and cash on hand or credit availability is insufficient, we would seek additional financing to provide additional liquidity. We regularly evaluate our potential access to the equity and debt capital markets as sources of liquidity and we believe additional financing would likely be available if necessary, although we can make no assurance as to the form or terms of any such financing. 
 We continue to evaluate the best use of our liquidity which would allow us to invest in profitable growth, maintain a strong balance sheet, and return capital to shareholders. 
 
 In the first quarter of 2023, we repurchased a total of 7.5 million aggregate principal amount of our Convertible Senior Notes Due 2025. In addition to reducing outstanding debt and generating annual interest savings of 0.5 million, the repurchases of convertible notes reduced weighted average diluted shares outstanding for the year ended December 31, 2023 by 0.7 million shares and, on a go-forward basis, reduced diluted shares outstanding by 1.0 million shares. 
 For the three months ended September 30, 2024, the Company repurchased approximately 1.2 million common shares in the open market at an aggregate cost of 20.1 million, which equates to an average repurchase price of 17.29 per share. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company repurchased approximately 1.8 million common shares in the open market at an 
 32 

Table of Contents 

 aggregate cost of 34.1 million, which equates to an average repurchase price of 18.82 per share. As of September 30, 2024, the Company had a balance of 106.3 million remaining on its authorized share repurchase program. 
 Cash Flows 
 The following table reflects the major categories of cash flows for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. For additional details, please refer to the unaudited Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows included in this quarterly report.

Operating activities 
 Net cash provided by operating activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 26.4 million compared to net cash provided of 51.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The change was primarily driven by lower profitability and pension contributions, partially offset by a decrease in the use of cash for working capital during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023. 
 Investing activities 
 Net cash used by investing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 3.6 million compared to net cash used of 34.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The change was due to proceeds from government funding in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 2023, partially offset by higher capital spending in the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 
 Financing activities 
 Net cash used by financing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 48.2 million, consistent with the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Lower repurchases of Convertible Notes in 2024 were offset by higher shares surrendered for taxes and common share repurchases compared to the same period in 2023. Refer to Note 8 - Financing Arrangements for more detail related to the Convertible Senior Notes due in 2025 and the share repurchase program.

 Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 
 Our financial statements are prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the periods presented. We review our critical accounting policies throughout the year. 
 New Accounting Guidance 
 See Note 2 - Recent Accounting Pronouncements in the Notes to the unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements. 
 Forward-Looking Statements 
 Certain statements set forth in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q (including our forecasts, beliefs and expectations) that are not historical in nature are forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. In particular, Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations contains numerous forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements generally will be accompanied by words such as anticipate, aspire, believe, could, estimate, expect, forecast, outlook, intend, may, plan, possible, potential, predict, project, seek, should, strategic direction, strategy, target, will, would, or other similar words, phrases or expressions that convey the uncertainty of future events or outcomes. You are cautioned not to place undue reliance on forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date of this Form 10-Q. We caution readers that actual results may differ materially from those expressed or implied in forward-looking statements made by or on behalf of us due to a variety of factors, such as: 
 
 the effects of fluctuations in customer demand on sales, product mix and prices in the industries in which we operate. This includes: our ability to respond to rapid changes in customer demand including but not limited to changes in customer operating schedules due to supply chain constraints or unplanned work stoppages; the ability of customers to obtain financing to purchase the Company s products or equipment that contains its products; the effects of customer bankruptcies or liquidations; the impact of changes in industrial business cycles; and whether conditions of fair trade exist in the U.S. markets; 

changes in operating costs, including the effect of changes in our manufacturing processes; changes in costs associated with varying levels of operations and manufacturing capacity; availability of raw materials and energy; our ability to mitigate the impact of fluctuations in raw materials and energy costs and the effectiveness of our surcharge mechanism; changes in the expected costs associated with product warranty claims; changes resulting from inventory management, cost reduction initiatives and different levels of customer demands; the effects of unplanned work stoppages; availability of skilled labor; and changes in the cost of labor and benefits; 

the success of our operating plans, announced programs, initiatives and capital investments; the consistency to meet demand levels following unplanned downtime; and our ability to maintain appropriate relations with the union that represents our associates in certain locations in order to avoid disruptions of business; 

whether we are able to successfully implement actions designed to improve profitability on anticipated terms and timetables and whether we are able to fully realize the expected benefits of such actions; 

the Company's pension obligations and investment performance; 

with respect to the Company's ability to achieve its sustainability goals, including its 2030 environmental goals, the ability to meet such goals within the expected timeframe, changes in laws, regulations, prevailing standards or public policy, the alignment of the scientific community on measurement and reporting approaches, the complexity of commodity supply chains and the evolution of and adoption of new technology, including traceability practices, tools and processes; 

availability of property insurance coverage at commercially reasonable rates or insufficient insurance coverage to cover claims or damages; 

34 

Table of Contents 

 the availability of financing and interest rates, which affect the Company's cost of funds and/or ability to raise capital; 

the effects of the conditional conversion feature of the Convertible Senior Notes due 2025, which, if triggered, entitles holders to convert the notes at any time during specified periods at their option and therefore could result in potential dilution if the holder elects to convert and the Company elects to satisfy a portion or all of the conversion obligation by delivering common shares instead of cash; 

the impacts from any repurchases of our common shares and convertible notes, including the timing and amount of any repurchases; 

competitive factors, including changes in market penetration; increasing price competition by existing or new foreign and domestic competitors; the introduction of new products by existing and new competitors; and new technology that may impact the way our products are sold or distributed; 

deterioration in global economic conditions, or in economic conditions in any of the geographic regions in which we conduct business, including additional adverse effects from global economic slowdown, terrorism or hostilities. This includes: political risks associated with the potential instability of governments and legal systems in countries in which we or our customers conduct business, and changes in currency valuations; 

the impact of global conflicts on the economy, sourcing of raw materials, and commodity prices; 

climate-related risks, including environmental and severe weather caused by climate changes, and legislative and regulatory initiatives addressing global climate change or other environmental concerns; 

unanticipated litigation, claims or assessments, including claims or problems related to intellectual property, product liability or warranty, employment matters, regulatory compliance and environmental issues and taxes, among other matters; 

cyber-related risks, including information technology system failures, interruptions and security breaches; 

the potential impact of pandemics, epidemics, widespread illness or other health issues; 

with respect to the equipment investments to support the U.S. Army s mission of ramping up munitions production in the coming years, whether the funding awarded to support these investments is received on the anticipated timetable, whether the Company is able to successfully complete the installation and commissioning of the new assets on the targeted budget and timetable, and whether the anticipated increase in throughput is achieved; and 

those items identified under the caption Risk Factors in our Annual Report on Form 10-K. 

You are cautioned that it is not possible to predict or identify all of the risks, uncertainties and other factors that may affect future results, and that the above list should not be considered to be a complete list. Except as required by the federal securities laws, we undertake no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statement, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. Further, this report includes our current policy and intent and is not intended to create legal rights or obligations. Certain standards of measurement and performance contained in this report are developing and based on assumptions, and no assurance can be given that any plan, objective, initiative, projection, goal, mission, commitment, expectation, or prospect set forth in this report can or will be achieved. Inclusion of information in this report is not an indication that the subject or information is material to our business or operating results.

 Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 
 Interest Rate Risk 
 Our borrowings include both fixed and variable-rate debt. The variable-rate debt consists principally of borrowings under our Credit Agreement. We are exposed to the risk of rising interest rates to the extent we fund our operations with these variable-rate borrowings. As of September 30, 2024, we have 13.2 million of aggregate debt outstanding. None of our outstanding debt as of September 30, 2024 has variable interest rates, thus a rise in interest rates would not impact our interest expense at this point in time. 
 Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Risk 
 Fluctuations in the value of the U.S. dollar compared to foreign currencies may impact our earnings. Geographically, our sales are primarily made to customers in the United States. Currency fluctuations could impact us to the extent they impact the currency or the price of raw materials in foreign countries in which our competitors operate or have significant sales. 
 Commodity Price Risk 
 In the ordinary course of business, we are exposed to market risk with respect to commodity price fluctuations, primarily related to our purchases of raw materials and energy, principally scrap steel, other ferrous and non-ferrous metals and alloys. Additionally, the current and potential future global conflicts could also exacerbate inflationary pressures throughout the global economy and lead to potential market disruptions, such as significant volatility in commodity prices and supply chain disruptions. Although our business has not been materially impacted by current conflicts to date, it is difficult to predict the extent to which our operations, or those of our suppliers, will be impacted in the future. 
 Whenever possible, we manage our exposure to commodity risks primarily through the use of supplier pricing agreements that enable us to establish the purchase prices for certain inputs that are used in our manufacturing business. We utilize a raw material surcharge as a component of pricing steel to pass through the cost increases of scrap, alloys and other raw materials, as well as energy. From time to time, we may use financial instruments to hedge a portion of our exposure to commodity price risk. In periods of stable demand for our products, the surcharge mechanism has worked effectively to reduce the normal time lag in passing through higher raw material costs so that we can maintain our gross margins. When demand and cost of raw materials are lower, however, the surcharge impacts sales prices to a lesser extent. 
 Item 4. C ontrols and Procedures 
 (a) Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 As of the end of the period covered by this quarterly report, we carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(e)). Based upon that evaluation, the principal executive officer and principal financial officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of the end of the period covered by this quarterly report. 
 (b) Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
 During the Company s most recent fiscal quarter, there have been no changes in the Company s internal control over financial reporting that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company s internal control over financial reporting.

 Part II. O ther Information 
 Item 1. L egal Proceedings 
 We are involved in various claims and legal actions arising in the ordinary course of business. In the opinion of our management, the ultimate disposition of these matters will not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. 
 Item 1A. R isk Factors 
 We are subject to various risks and uncertainties in the course of our business. The discussion of such risks and uncertainties may be found under Risk Factors in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 filed with the SEC.

 (1) The Company may utilize various methods to repurchase shares, which could include open market repurchases, including repurchases through Rule 10b5-1 plans, privately-negotiated transactions or by other means. The actual timing, number and value of shares repurchased under the program will depend on a number of factors, including the price of the Company's shares, general market and economic conditions, capital needs and other factors. 
 
 (2) The average price paid per share excludes any broker commissions. 
 
 (3) On December 20, 2021, the Company announced that its Board of Directors authorized a share repurchase program under which the Company may repurchase up to 50.0 million of its outstanding common shares. On November 2, 2022, the Board of Directors authorized an additional 75.0 million share repurchase program. On May 6, 2024, the Board of Directors again authorized an additional 100.0 million share repurchase program. The share repurchase program does not require the Company to acquire any dollar amount or number of shares and does not have an expiration date.
