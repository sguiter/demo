 The Company paid a total of million in cash as of the DocFox Acquisition Date. Included in the total cash paid was million for DocFox common stock options that were cash settled on the DocFox Acquisition Date. The million fair value of the DocFox common stock options was allocated between consideration transferred and post combination expense in the amounts of million and million, respectively. As there was no future service requirement due to accelerated vesting of these options, the entire million was recorded as transaction cost immediately following the acquisition and not in consideration transferred. The million is included within general and administrative expense for the three months ended April 30, 2024. The estimated fair value of the consideration transferred was million on the DocFox Acquisition Date. 
 In addition, the Company issued RSUs with an approximate fair value of million to certain employees of DocFox, which will vest over subject to such employees' continued employment. The RSUs will be recorded as stock-based compensation expense post-acquisition as the RSUs vest and has been excluded from the purchase consideration.

 The transaction was accounted for using the acquisition method and, as a result, tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed were recorded at their estimated fair values at the DocFox Acquisition Date. Any excess consideration over the fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed was recognized as goodwill and is subject to revision as the purchase price allocation is complete. The Company determined the acquisition date contract assets and liabilities in accordance with ASC 606. 
 Due to the timing of the transaction, initial accounting for the acquisition is not complete, and further measurement period adjustments may occur in fiscal year 2025, but no later than one year from the DocFox Acquisition Date. The Company has estimated the preliminary fair value of net assets acquired based on information currently available and with the assistance of independent third-party valuations and will continue to adjust those estimates as additional information becomes available, valuations are finalized and the tax returns for the pre-acquisition period are completed. The primary areas of the acquisition accounting that remain preliminary relate to, but are not limited to, (i) finalizing the review and valuation of intangible assets (including key assumptions, inputs and estimates), (ii) finalizing the Company's review of certain assets acquired and liabilities assumed, (iii) finalizing the evaluation and valuation of certain legal matters and/or loss contingencies, including those that the Company may not yet be aware of but meet the requirement to qualify as a pre-acquisition contingency, (iv) finalizing our estimate of the impact of acquisition accounting on deferred income taxes or liabilities, including uncertain tax positions, and (v) finalizing the Company s review of the acquired contracts and related contract assets and liabilities. As the initial acquisition accounting is based on preliminary assessments, actual values may differ materially when final information becomes available. The Company believes the information gathered to date provides a reasonable basis for estimating the preliminary fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed. The Company will continue to evaluate these items until they are satisfactorily resolved and make necessary adjustments, within the allowable measurement period.

 Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 
 The following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations should be read together with our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements and related notes and other financial information included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2024 filed with the SEC on March 26, 2024. The following discussion contains forward-looking statements that reflect our plans, estimates and beliefs. Our actual results could differ materially from those discussed in the forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause or contribute to these differences include those discussed below and elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and in our Annual Report on Form 10-K, particularly in the section titled Risk Factors. Our historical results are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for any period in the future. Our fiscal year ends on January 31 of each year and references in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q to a fiscal year mean the year in which that fiscal year ends. For example, references in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q to "fiscal 2025" refer to the fiscal year ended January 31, 2025. 
 
 Overview 
 Through its single software-as-a-service ("SaaS") platform, nCino helps financial institutions ("FI") serving corporate and commercial, small business, consumer, and mortgage customers modernize and more effectively onboard clients, open accounts, make loans and navigate the loan lifecycle, and effectively monitor and manage their portfolio. With the nCino Bank Operating System, FIs can: 
 digitally serve their clients across lines of business, 
 improve efficiency, 
 elevate employee experience and performance, 
 manage risk and compliance more effectively, 
 establish an active data, audit, and business intelligence hub, and 
 embrace the value of intelligent automation and uncover data-driven insights. 
 nCino was originally founded in a bank to improve that FI s operations and client service. After realizing that the same problems cumbersome legacy technology, fragmented data, disconnected business functions, and a disengaged workforce made it difficult to maintain relevancy in their clients' lives were endemic across the financial services industry, nCino spun out as a separate company in late 2011. This heritage is the foundation of our deep banking domain expertise, which differentiates us, continues to drive our strategy, and makes us uniquely qualified to help FIs become more efficient by providing an end-to-end platform that spans business lines and combines capabilities for a seamless experience. 
 The nCino Bank Operating System was initially designed to help transform commercial and small business lending for community and regional banks. This solution was introduced to enterprise banks in the United States ("U.S.") in 2014, and then internationally in 2017, and has subsequently expanded across North America, Europe, the Middle East, South Africa and Asia-Pacific. Throughout this market expansion, we broadened the nCino Bank Operating System by adding functionality for consumer lending, client onboarding, deposit account opening, analytics and artificial intelligence and machine learning. In fiscal 2020, we made two acquisitions as part of our strategy to build out our nIQ capabilities and we established our nCino K.K joint venture to facilitate our entry into the Japanese market. An acquisition in fiscal 2022 expanded our capabilities to the U.S. point-of-sale mortgage market. 
 On March 20, 2024 (the "DocFox Acquisition Date"), we acquired DocFox, Inc. ("DocFox") which provides a solution for automating onboarding experiences for commercial and business banking, for an aggregate preliminary purchase price of 74.3 million. We funded the purchase consideration with 75.0 million borrowed under the 2022 Credit Facility as further described in Note 11 "Revolving Credit Facility" of the notes to our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements included in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. We have included the financial results of DocFox in our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements from the DocFox Acquisition Date. 
 We acquired Integrated Lending Technologies, LLC ("ILT") on April 1, 2024 (the "ILT Acquisition Date"), which provides consumer loan origination software that streamlines direct and indirect lending operations, for an aggregate purchase 
 25

 price of 20.0 million in cash. We have included the financial results of ILT in our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements from the ILT Acquisition Date. 
 See Note 7 "Business Combinations" of the notes to our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements included in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for more information on the DocFox and ILT acquisitions. 
 In November 2024, we acquired Artesian Solutions Limited, operating as ("FullCircl"), a UK-based SaaS platform built to help financial institutions automate and accelerate onboarding and improve client lifecycle management. We funded 129.7 million of the purchase consideration with borrowings made in October 2024 under the 2024 Credit Facility as further described in Note 11 "Revolving Credit Facility" of the notes to our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements included in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. See Note 15 "Subsequent Event" of the notes to our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements included in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for more information on the FullCircl acquisition. 
 We generally offer the nCino Bank Operating System on a subscription basis pursuant to non-cancellable multi-year contracts that typically range from three to five years, and we employ a land and expand business model. The nCino Bank Operating System is designed to scale with our customers, and once our solution is deployed, we seek to have our customers expand adoption within and across lines of business. 
 We sell our solutions directly through our business development managers, account executives, field sales engineers, and customer success managers. Our sales efforts in the U.S. are organized around FIs based on size, whereas internationally, we focus our sales efforts by geography. As of October 31, 2024, we had 205 sales and sales support personnel in the U.S. and 99 sales and support personnel in offices outside the U.S. 
 To help customers go live with our solutions, we offer professional services including configuration and implementation, training, and advisory services. For enterprise FIs, we generally work with system integration ("SI") partners such as Accenture, Deloitte, and PwC for the delivery of professional services for the nCino Bank Operating System. For regional FIs, we work with SIs such as West Monroe Partners, and for community banks, we work with SIs or perform configuration and implementation ourselves. We expect enterprise FIs to make up a greater proportion of our nCino Bank Operating System sales. 
 For the three months ended October 31, 2023 and 2024, our total revenues were 121.9 million and 138.8 million, respectively, representing a 13.8 increase. For the three months ended October 31, 2023 and 2024, our subscription revenues were 104.8 million and 119.9 million, respectively, representing a 14.4 increase. Due to our investments in growth, we recorded net losses attributable to nCino, Inc. of 16.4 million and 5.3 million for the three months ended October 31, 2023 and 2024, respectively. For the nine months ended October 31, 2023 and 2024, our total revenues were 352.9 million and 399.3 million, respectively, representing a 13.2 increase. For the nine months ended October 31, 2023 and 2024, our subscription revenues were 302.0 million and 344.2 million, respectively, representing a 14.0 increase. Due to our investments in growth, we recorded net losses attributable to nCino, Inc. of 43.5 million and 19.3 million for the nine months ended October 31, 2023 and 2024, respectively. 
 
 Factors Affecting Our Operating Results 
 Market Adoption of Our Solution . Our future growth depends on our ability to expand our reach to new FI customers and increase adoption with existing customers as they broaden their use of our solutions within and across lines of business. Our success in growing our customer base and expanding adoption of our solutions by existing customers requires a focused direct sales engagement and the ability to convince key decision makers at FIs to replace legacy third-party point solutions or internally developed software with our solutions. In addition, growing our customer base will require us to increasingly penetrate markets outside the U.S., which accounted for 21.3 of total revenues for the three months ended October 31, 2024 and 20.8 for the nine months ended October 31, 2024. For new customers, our sales cycles are typically lengthy, generally ranging from six to nine months for smaller FIs to 12 to 18 months or more for larger FIs. Key to landing new customers is our ability to successfully take our existing customers live and help them achieve measurable returns on their investment, thereby turning them into referenceable accounts. If we are unable to successfully address the foregoing challenges, our ability to grow our business and achieve profitability will be adversely affected, which may in turn reduce the value of our common stock. 
 Mix of Subscription and Professional Services Revenues. The initial deployment of our solutions by our customers requires a period of implementation and configuration services that typically range from three months to 18 months, 
 26

 depending on the scope. As a result, during the initial go-live period for a customer on the nCino Bank Operating System, professional services revenues generally make up a substantial portion of our revenues from that customer, whereas over time, revenues from established customers are more heavily weighted to subscriptions. While professional services revenues will fluctuate as a percentage of total revenues in the future and tend to be higher in periods of faster growth, over time we expect subscription revenues will make up an increasing proportion of our total revenues as our overall business grows. 
 Macroeconomic Environment. We are currently operating in a higher interest rate environment as the U.S. Federal Reserve has raised interest rates as a means to manage inflation. These rate increases have had an impact on the real estate market in the U.S. and specifically, the demand for mortgages and mortgage-related products and services, which has had a negative impact on our nCino Mortgage business. 
 We will continue to monitor the impact the macroeconomic environment may have on our business. 
 Continued Investment in Innovation and Growth . We have made substantial investments in product development, sales and marketing, and strategic acquisitions since our inception to achieve a leadership position in our market and grow our revenues and customer base. We intend to continue to increase our investment in product development in the coming years to maintain and build on this advantage. We also intend to invest in sales and marketing both in the U.S. and internationally to further grow our business. To capitalize on the market opportunity we see ahead of us, we expect to continue to optimize our operating plans for revenue growth and profitability. 
 
 Components of Results of Operations 
 Revenues 
 We derive our revenues from subscription and professional services and other revenues. 
 Subscription Revenues . Our subscription revenues consist principally of fees from customers for accessing our solutions and maintenance and support services that we generally offer under non-cancellable multi-year contracts, which typically range from three to five years for the nCino Bank Operating System and one to three years for nCino Mortgage. Specifically, we offer: 
 Client onboarding, loan origination, and deposit account opening applications targeted at a FI s commercial, small business, and retail lines of business, for which we generally charge on a per seat basis. 
 nIQ for which we generally charge based on the asset size of the customer or on a usage basis. 
 Through nCino Mortgage, a digital homeownership solution uniting people, systems, and stages of the mortgage process into a seamless end-to-end journey for which we generally charge on a per seat basis. 
 Maintenance and support services as well as internal-use or sandbox development licenses, for which we generally charge as a percentage of the related subscription fees. 
 Our subscription revenues are generally recognized ratably over the term of the contract beginning upon activation. For new customers, we may activate a portion of seats at inception of the agreement, with the balance activated at contractually specified points in time thereafter, to pattern our invoicing after the customer s expected rate of implementation and adoption. Where seats are activated in stages, we charge subscription fees from the date of activation through the anniversary of the initial activation date, and annually thereafter. Subscription fees associated with the nCino Bank Operating System are generally billed annually in advance while subscription fees for nCino Mortgage are generally billed monthly in advance. Maintenance and support fees, as well as development licenses, are provided over the same periods as the related subscriptions, so fees are invoiced and revenues are recognized over the same periods. Subscription fees invoiced are recorded as deferred revenue pending recognition as revenues. In certain cases, we are authorized to resell access to Salesforce s CRM solution along with the nCino Bank Operating System. When we resell such access, we charge a higher subscription price and remit a higher subscription fee to Salesforce for these subscriptions. 
 Professional Services and Other Revenues . Professional services and other revenues consist of fees for implementation and configuration assistance, training, and advisory services. For enterprise and larger regional FIs, we generally work with SI partners to provide the majority of implementation services for the nCino Bank Operating System, for which these SI partners bill our customers directly. We have historically delivered professional services ourselves for 
 27 

Table of Contents 

 community banks and smaller credit unions and nCino Mortgage has historically provided professional services directly to its customers. Revenues for implementation, training, and advisory services are generally recognized on a proportional performance basis, based on labor hours incurred relative to total budgeted hours. To date, our losses on professional services contracts have not been material. During the initial go-live period for a customer on the nCino Bank Operating System, professional services revenues generally make up a substantial portion of our revenues from that customer, whereas over time, revenues from established customers are more heavily weighted to subscriptions. While professional services revenues will fluctuate as a percentage of total revenues in the future and tend to be higher in periods of faster growth, over time we expect to see subscription revenues make up an increasing proportion of our total revenues. 
 Cost of Revenues and Gross Margin 
 Cost of Subscription Revenues . Cost of subscription revenues consists of fees paid to Salesforce for access to the Salesforce Platform, including Salesforce s hosting infrastructure and data center operations, along with certain integration fees paid to other third parties. When we resell access to Salesforce s CRM solution, cost of subscription revenues also includes the subscription fees we remit to Salesforce for providing such access. We also incur costs associated with access to other platforms. In addition, cost of subscription revenues includes personnel-related costs associated with delivering maintenance and support services, including salaries, benefits and stock-based compensation expense, travel and related costs, amortization of acquired developed technology, and allocated overhead. Our subscription gross margin will vary from period to period as a function of the utilization of support personnel and the extent to which we recognize subscription revenues from the resale of Salesforce s CRM solution. 
 Cost of Professional Services and Other Revenues . Cost of professional services and other revenues consists primarily of personnel-related costs associated with delivery of these services, including salaries, benefits and stock-based compensation expense, travel and related costs, and allocated overhead. The cost of providing professional services is significantly higher as a percentage of the related revenues than for our subscription services due to direct labor costs. The cost of professional services revenues has increased in absolute dollars as we have added new customer subscriptions that require professional services and built-out our international professional services capabilities. Realized effective billing and utilization rates drive fluctuations in our professional services and other gross margin on a period-to-period basis. 
 Operating Expenses 
 Sales and Marketing. Sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of personnel costs of our sales and marketing employees, including salaries, sales commissions and incentives, benefits and stock-based compensation expense, travel and related costs. We capitalize incremental costs incurred to obtain contracts, primarily consisting of sales commissions, and subsequently amortize these costs over the expected period of benefit, which we have determined to be approximately four years. Sales and marketing expenses also include outside consulting fees, marketing programs, including lead generation, costs of our annual user conference, advertising, trade shows, other event expenses, amortization of intangible assets, and allocated overhead. We expect sales and marketing expenses will decrease as a percentage of revenues as we leverage the investments we have made to date. 
 Research and Development. Research and development expenses consist primarily of salaries, benefits and stock-based compensation associated with our engineering, product and quality assurance personnel, as well as allocated overhead. Research and development expenses also include the cost of third-party contractors. Research and development costs are expensed as incurred. We expect research and development costs will decrease as a percentage of revenues as we leverage the investments we have made to date. 
 General and Administrative. General and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries, benefits and stock-based compensation associated with our executive, finance, legal, human resources, information technology, compliance and other administrative personnel. General and administrative expenses also include accounting, auditing and legal professional services fees, travel and other corporate-related expenses, and allocated overhead, as well as acquisition-related expenses, which are primarily related to legal, consulting and other professional services fees. We expect general and administrative expenses will decrease as a percentage of revenues over the long term as we leverage the investments we have made to date. 
 Non-Operating Income (Expense) 
 Interest Income. Interest income consists primarily of interest earned on our cash and cash equivalents. 
 28 

Table of Contents 

 Interest Expense. Interest expense consists primarily of interest related to our financing obligations along with interest expense on borrowings, commitment fees, and amortization of debt issuance costs associated with our secured revolving credit facility. 
 Other Income (Expense), Net. Other income (expense), net consists primarily of foreign currency gains and losses, the majority of which is due to intercompany transactions denominated in currencies other than the underlying functional currency of the applicable entity. 
 Income Tax Provision. Income tax provision consists of federal and state income taxes in the U.S. and income taxes in foreign jurisdictions.

 Sales and Marketing 
 Sales and marketing expenses decreased 8.7 million for the three months ended October 31, 2024 compared to the three months ended October 31, 2023, primarily attributable to the decrease in amortization expense of 10.7 million due to no amortization for the SimpleNexus trade name intangible asset as a result of the rebranding of the SimpleNexus solution to nCino Mortgage during the third quarter of fiscal 2024, partially offset by an increase of 0.6 million in amortization expense for the DocFox and ILT acquisitions. The decrease in sales and marketing expenses was also partially offset by an increase of 1.0 million in personnel costs primarily due to an increase in headcount, an increase in stock-based compensation expense, and

 an increase in tax equalization expense, partially offset by prior year payroll tax adjustments from certain of our foreign subsidiaries. 
 Sales and marketing expenses decreased 11.1 million for the nine months ended October 31, 2024 compared to the nine months ended October 31, 2023, primarily attributable to the decrease in amortization expense of 11.9 million due to no amortization for the SimpleNexus trade name intangible asset as a result of the rebranding of the SimpleNexus solution to nCino Mortgage during fiscal 2024, partially offset by an increase of 1.7 million in amortization expense for the DocFox and ILT acquisitions.

The decrease in sales and marketing expenses was partially offset by an increase of 0.5 million in marketing costs. 
 Our sales and marketing headcount increased by 7 from October 31, 2023 to October 31, 2024. We expect sales and marketing expenses will decrease as a percentage of revenues as we leverage the investments we have made to date. 
 Research and Development 
 Research and development expenses increased 4.0 million for the three months ended October 31, 2024 compared to the three months ended October 31, 2023, primarily due to an increase of 2.6 million in personnel costs, mainly from an increase in headcount.

 Research and development expenses increased 10.2 million for the nine months ended October 31, 2024 compared to the nine months ended October 31, 2023, primarily due to an increase of 7.9 million in personnel costs, mainly from an increase in headcount and stock-based compensation expense. The increase in research and development also included an increase of 1.9 million in third-party professional fees primarily attributable to increased contract research and development spend. 
 Our research and development headcount increased by 24 from October 31, 2023 to October 31, 2024. We expect research and development expenses will decrease as a percentage of revenues as we leverage the investments we have made to date. 
 General and Administrative 
 General and administrative expenses increased 3.8 million for the three months ended October 31, 2024 compared to the three months ended October 31, 2023, primarily due to an increase of 2.5 million in personnel costs, mostly attributable to a 1.5 million increase in stock-based compensation expense and headcount. The increase in general and administrative spend also included an increase of 2.1 million in third-party professional fees, mostly attributable to an increase for acquisition-related expenses for DocFox, ILT, and FullCircl, partially offset by a decrease in other professional fees.

 Interest income decreased 0.2 million for the three months ended October 31, 2024 compared to the three months ended October 31, 2023, due to a decrease in our accounts earning interest. Interest expense increased 0.8 million for the three months ended October 31, 2024 compared to the three months ended October 31, 2023, due to borrowing on our revolving credit facility. The decrease of 2.8 million in other income (expense), net for the three months ended October 31, 2024 compared to the three months ended October 31, 2023, was primarily driven by intercompany loans and transactions that are denominated in currencies other than the underlying functional currency of the applicable entity. 
 Interest income decreased 0.6 million for the nine months ended October 31, 2024 compared to the nine months ended October 31, 2023, due to a decrease in our accounts earning interest. Interest expense increased 1.7 million for the nine months ended October 31, 2024 compared to the nine months ended October 31, 2023, due to borrowing on our revolving credit facility.

 Income Tax Provision

 Income tax provision was 2.6 million for the three months ended October 31, 2024 compared to a provision of 1.8 million for the three months ended October 31, 2023, and resulted in an effective tax rate of (165.6) and (11.6) , respectively. 
 Income tax provision was 1.4 million for the nine months ended October 31, 2024 compared to a provision of 4.7 million for the nine months ended October 31, 2023, and resulted in an effective tax rate of (8.4) and (11.7) , respectively. The change in the effective tax rate for the nine months ended October 31, 2024 compared to the effective tax rate for the nine months ended October 31, 2023 was primarily due to a reduction of our valuation allowance offset by profitable foreign jurisdictions and uncertain tax positions. 
 Prior to the DocFox acquisition, we continued to maintain a valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets in several jurisdictions, including the U.S. On the DocFox Acquisition Date, the Company measured and recorded net U.S. deferred tax liabilities, most of which relate to identifiable intangible assets. The deferred tax liabilities recognized provide additional positive evidence that a portion of the Company's U.S. deferred tax assets are realizable. As a result, the Company reduced the valuation allowance by 3.6 million during the first quarter of the Company s fiscal 2025. 
 
 Non-GAAP Financial Measure 
 In addition to providing financial measurements based on GAAP, we provide an additional financial metric that is not prepared in accordance with GAAP (non-GAAP). Management uses this non-GAAP financial measure, in addition to GAAP financial measures, to understand and compare operating results across accounting periods, for financial and operational decision making, for planning and forecasting purposes, and to evaluate our financial performance. We believe that this non-GAAP financial measure helps us to identify underlying trends in our business that could otherwise be masked by the effect of the expenses that we exclude in the calculations of the non-GAAP financial measure. 
 Accordingly, we believe that this financial measure reflects our ongoing business in a manner that allows for meaningful comparisons and analysis of trends in the business and provides useful information to investors and others in understanding and evaluating our operating results, and enhancing the overall understanding of our past performance and future prospects. Although the calculation of non-GAAP financial measures may vary from company to company, our detailed 
 34 

Table of Contents 

 presentation may facilitate analysis and comparison of our operating results by management and investors with other peer companies, many of which use a similar non-GAAP financial measure to supplement their GAAP results in their public disclosures. This non-GAAP financial measure is non-GAAP operating income, as discussed below. 
 Non-GAAP operating income. Non-GAAP operating income is defined as loss from operations as reported in our unaudited condensed consolidated statements of operations excluding the impact of amortization of intangible assets, stock-based compensation expense, acquisition-related expenses, legal expenses related to certain litigation, and restructuring and related charges. Non-GAAP operating income is widely used by securities analysts, investors, and other interested parties to evaluate the profitability of companies. Non-GAAP operating income eliminates potential differences in performance caused by these items that are not indicative of the Company's ongoing operating performance and hinders comparability with prior and future performance. 
 This non-GAAP financial measure does not replace the presentation of our GAAP financial results and should only be used as a supplement to, not as a substitute for, our financial results presented in accordance with GAAP. There are limitations in the use of non-GAAP measures because they do not include all of the expenses that must be included under GAAP and because they involve the exercise of judgment concerning exclusions of items from the comparable non-GAAP financial measure. In addition, other companies may use other measures to evaluate their performance, or may calculate non-GAAP measures differently, all of which could reduce the usefulness of our non-GAAP financial measures as tools for comparison. 
 The following table reconciles non-GAAP operating income to loss from operations, the most directly comparable financial measure, calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP (in thousands):

 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 As of October 31, 2024, we had 257.9 million in cash and cash equivalents. In November 2024, we used approximately 129.7 million of our cash for the FullCircl acquisition. See Note 15 "Subsequent Event" of the notes to our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements included in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for more information on the FullCircl acquisition. As of October 31, 2024, we had an accumulated deficit of 369.8 million. Our net losses have been driven by our investments in developing the nCino Bank Operating System and scaling our sales and marketing organization and finance and administrative functions to support our rapid growth. 
 To date, we have funded our capital needs through issuances of common stock including our initial public offering in July 2020, operating cash flows, and starting fiscal 2023, our revolving line of credit. We generally bill and collect from our customers annually in advance. Our billings are subject to seasonality, with billings in the first and fourth quarters of our fiscal year substantially higher than in the second and third quarters. Because we recognize revenues ratably, our deferred revenue balance mirrors the seasonality of our billings. 
 On March 17, 2024, the Company entered into the Second Amendment for the 2022 Credit Facility which, among other things, increased our borrowing availability to 100.0 million. In March 2024, we borrowed 75.0 million under the 2022 Credit Facility to fund the acquisition of DocFox. In April 2024, July 2024, and October 2024 we repaid 20.0 million, 
 35 

Table of Contents 

 15.0 million, and 10.0 million, respectively, under the 2022 Credit Facility. On October 28, 2024, the Company entered into the 2024 Credit Facility, which increased our borrowing availability to 250.0 million. The Company borrowed 166.0 million under the 2024 Credit Facility to fund the acquisition of FullCircl and repay the 30.0 million outstanding under the 2022 Credit Facility. The Company expects to pay an additional 15.0 million in two years for the FullCircl acquisition upon the satisfaction and performance of certain warranties and covenants. As of October 31, 2024, the applicable interest rate was 6.72 . The Company had 166.0 million outstanding and no letters of credit issued under the 2024 Credit Facility and was in compliance with all covenants as of October 31, 2024. See Note 11 "Revolving Credit Facility" of the notes to our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements included in Part I, Item I of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for more information. 
 We believe that current cash and cash equivalents as well as borrowings available under the Credit Facility will be sufficient to fund our operations and capital requirements for at least the next 12 months. Our future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including our growth rate, the timing and extent of spending to support research and development efforts to enhance the nCino Bank Operating System and introduce new applications, market acceptance of our solutions, the continued expansion of our sales and marketing activities, capital expenditure requirements, and any potential future acquisitions. We expect to incur capital expenditures in fiscal 2025 and 2026 for planned office build-outs to accommodate our growth, primarily for an international office, which we estimate to spend approximately 2.0 million and 6.0 million in fiscal 2025 and 2026, respectively. We may from time-to-time seek to raise additional capital to support our growth. Any equity financing we may undertake could be dilutive to our existing stockholders, and any debt financing we may undertake could require debt service and financial and operational covenants that could adversely affect our business. There is no assurance we would be able to obtain future financing on acceptable terms or at all. 
 nCino K.K. 
 In fiscal 2020, we established nCino K.K., a Japanese company in which we own a controlling interest, for purposes of facilitating our entry into the Japanese market. We have consolidated the results of operations and financial condition of nCino K.K. since its inception. Pursuant to an agreement with the holders of the non-controlling interest in nCino K.K., beginning in 2027 we may redeem the non-controlling interest, or be required to redeem such interest by the holders thereof, based on a prescribed formula derived from the relative revenues of nCino K.K. and the Company. The balance of the redeemable non-controlling interest is reported on our balance sheet below total liabilities but above stockholders equity at the greater of the initial carrying amount adjusted for the redeemable non-controlling interest s share of earnings or losses and other comprehensive income or loss, or its estimated redemption value. As of January 31, 2024 and October 31, 2024, the redeemable non-controlling interest was 3.4 million and 5.2 million, respectively. 
 As part of our joint venture obligations, we made an additional cash capital contribution of 1.0 million to nCino K.K. during the third quarter of fiscal 2024.

The 5.9 million used in investing activities in the nine months ended October 31, 2023 was comprised of 3.1 million for the purchase of property and equipment and leasehold improvements to support the expansion of our business, 2.5 million for the purchase of preferred stock in Rich Data Co, and 0.4 million for the final cash consideration relating to an asset acquisition completed in August 2022. 
 Net Cash Provided by (Used in) Financing Activities 
 The 168.4 million provided by financing activities in the nine months ended October 31, 2024 was comprised principally of 241.0 million proceeds from borrowings on the 2022 and 2024 Credit Facility to fund the acquisition of DocFox and FullCircl, 2.5 million of proceeds from stock issuances under the employee stock purchase plan, and 2.2 million of proceeds from the exercise of stock options. The cash provided by financing activities was partially offset by payments of 75.0 million on the 2022 Credit Facility, payments of debt issuance costs of 1.4 million, and principal payments of 0.9 million on financing obligations. The 24.0 million used in financing activities in the nine months ended October 31, 2023 was comprised principally of payments of 30.0 million on the Credit Facility and principal payments of 0.9 million on financing obligations. The cash used in financing activities was partially offset by 3.2 million of proceeds from the exercise of stock options, 2.7 million of proceeds from stock issuances under the employee stock purchase plan, and 1.0 million in proceeds from the non-controlling interest in our Japan Joint venture. 
 
 Contractual Obligations and Commitments 
 Our estimated future obligations principally consist of leases related to our facilities, purchase obligations related primarily to licenses and hosting services, financing obligations for leases for which we are considered the owners for accounting purposes and the Credit Facility. See Note 10 "Leases," Note 11 "Revolving Credit Facility," and Note 12 "Commitments and Contingencies" of the notes to our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements included in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for more information. 
 
 Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 
 Our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of these financial statements requires our management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, expenses and related disclosures. Our estimates are based on our historical experience and on various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these judgments and estimates under different assumptions or conditions and any such differences may be significant.

Table of Contents 

 There have been no material changes in our critical accounting policies or estimates as compared to those disclosed in the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2024 filed with the SEC on March 26, 2024. 
 
 Recent Accounting Pronouncements 
 See Note 2 "Summary of Significant Accounting Policies" of the notes to our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements included in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for recently adopted accounting pronouncements and recently issued accounting pronouncements not yet adopted, if applicable. 
 
 Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 
 We are exposed to market risks in the ordinary course of our business. Market risk represents the risk of loss that may impact our financial position due to adverse changes in financial market prices and rates. Our market risk exposure is primarily the result of fluctuations in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates. 
 Interest Rate Risk 
 At October 31, 2024, we had cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash of 258.3 million, which consisted primarily of bank deposits and money market funds. Interest-earning instruments carry a degree of interest rate risk. However, our historical interest income has not fluctuated significantly. A hypothetical 10 change in interest rates would not have had a material impact on our financial results included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. We do not enter into investments for trading or speculative purposes and have not used any derivative financial instruments to manage our interest rate risk exposure. 
 Our 2024 Credit Facility is a senior secured revolving credit facility of up to 250.0 million. Borrowings bear interest, at the Borrower s option, at: (i) a base rate equal to the greatest of (a) the Agent s prime rate , (b) the federal funds rate plus 0.50 , and (c) the Term SOFR rate plus 1.00 (provided that the base rate shall not be less than 0.00 ), plus a margin of 1.00 ; or (ii) the Term SOFR rate (provided that the Term SOFR shall not be less than 0.00 ), plus a margin of 2.00 , in each case with such margin subject to step ups based on certain leverage ratios. As a result, we are exposed to increased interest rate risk as we make draws. At October 31, 2024, we had 166.0 million outstanding under the 2024 Credit Facility. A hypothetical 100 basis point change in interest rates would not have had a material impact on our financial results included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. See Note 11 "Revolving Credit Facility" of the notes to our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements included in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for additional information. 
 Foreign Currency Exchange Risk 
 Our reporting currency is the U.S. dollar and the functional currency of each of our subsidiaries is its local currency. The assets and liabilities of each of our subsidiaries are translated into U.S. dollars at exchange rates in effect at each balance sheet date. Revenues and expenses are translated using the average exchange rate for the relevant period. Equity transactions are translated using historical exchange rates. Decreases in the relative value of the U.S. dollar to other currencies may negatively affect revenues and other operating results as expressed in U.S. dollars. Foreign currency translation adjustments are accounted for as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) within stockholders equity. Gains or losses due to transactions in foreign currencies are included in non-operating income (expense), other in our unaudited condensed consolidated statements of operations. Furthermore, our customers outside of the U.S. typically pay us in local currency. We have not engaged in hedging of foreign currency transactions to date, although we may choose to do so in the future. We do not believe that an immediate 10 increase or decrease in the relative value of the U.S. dollar to other currencies would have a material effect on operating results or financial condition. 
 At October 31, 2024, based on the balances of our cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash denominated in foreign currencies, a hypothetical 10 increase or decrease in foreign currency exchange rates would have had an impact of approximately 7.0 million on our cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash at October 31, 2024. 
 
 Item 4. Controls and Procedures 
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 Disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act ), means controls and other procedures of a company that are designed to provide 
 38 

Table of Contents 

 reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported, within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to the company s management, including its principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Our management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures at October 31, 2024, the last day of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Based on this evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that, at October 31, 2024, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective at the reasonable assurance level. 
 Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 There was no change in our internal control over financial reporting identified in connection with the evaluation required by Rule 13a-15(d) and 15d-15(d) of the Exchange Act that occurred during the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 
 Inherent Limitations on the Effectiveness of Controls 
 Our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, do not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures or our internal control over financial reporting will prevent all errors and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within the Company have been detected. These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty, and that breakdowns can occur because of a simple error or mistake. Additionally, controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people or by management override of the controls. The design of any system of controls is also based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions; over time, controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or the degree of compliance with policies or procedures may deteriorate. Because of the inherent limitations in a cost-effective control system, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected. 
 
 PART II. OTHER INFORMATION 
 
 Item 1. Legal Proceedings 
 See Note 12 "Commitments and Contingencies" of the notes to our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements included in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for information regarding certain legal proceedings in which we are involved, which is incorporated by reference into this Part II, Item 1. 
 
 Item 1A. Risk Factors 
 There are no material changes to the risk factors in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2024 filed with the SEC on March 26, 2024 under the heading "Risk Factors." You should consider and read carefully these risks, as well as other information included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, including the section titled "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" and our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements and related notes before making an investment decision with respect to our common stock. Those risks are not the only ones we face. The occurrence of any of those risks or additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently believe to be immaterial could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operation. In such case, the trading price of our common stock could decline, and you may lose all or part of your investment.
