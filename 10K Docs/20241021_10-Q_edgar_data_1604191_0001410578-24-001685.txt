 million and an accumulated deficit of approximately million. Subsequent to June 30, 2024, the Company raised aggregate gross proceeds of approximately million from a July 2024 inducement offering. The Company has incurred recurring losses, has experienced recurring negative operating cash flows, and requires significant cash resources to execute its business plans. Based on its cash on hand at June 30, 2024, together with proceeds from the July 2024 exercise of warrants, the Company anticipates having sufficient cash to fund planned operations into November 2024. Historically, the Company s major sources of cash have been comprised of proceeds from various public and private offerings of its capital stock. The Company is dependent on obtaining additional working capital funding from the sale of equity and/or debt securities in order to continue to execute its development plans and continue operations. The Company has been, and is expected to continue to, explore various potential strategies available including but not limited to raising capital, restructuring its indebtedness and identifying and evaluating potential strategic alternatives but there can be no assurance that these efforts will be successful, that the Company will be able to raise necessary capital on acceptable terms, reach agreement with lenders, or that the strategic review process will result in the Company pursuing any transaction or that any transaction, if pursued, will be completed on attractive terms or at all. The Company is evaluating all potential strategic options, including a merger, reverse merger, sale, wind-down, liquidation and dissolution or other strategic transaction. Additionally, there can be no assurances that any particular course of action, business arrangement or transaction, or series of transactions, will be pursued, successfully consummated or lead to increased stakeholder value or that it will make any cash distributions to stockholders. Any failure in these efforts could force the Company to delay, limit or terminate operations, make reductions in its workforce, discontinue research and development programs, liquidate all or a portion of assets or pursue other strategic alternatives, and/or seek protection under the provisions of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. Without adequate working capital, the Company may not be able to meet its obligations and continue as a going concern. These conditions raise substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern one year from the date these financial statements are issued. If the Company is not able to obtain necessary capital, it may be required to terminate operations, liquidate all or a portion of assets and/or seek bankruptcy protection. As a result, the Company concluded that its plans at this stage do not alleviate substantial doubt about the ability to continue as a going concern. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.

Our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The following discussion and analysis contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the Securities Act and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act ), including, without limitation, statements regarding our expectations, beliefs, intentions or future strategies that are signified by the words expect, anticipate, intend, believe, or similar language. All forward-looking statements included in this document are based on information available to us on the date hereof, and we assume no obligation to update any such forward-looking statements. Our business and financial performance are subject to substantial risks and uncertainties. Actual results could differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements. In evaluating our business, you should carefully consider the information set forth under the heading Risk Factors included in this Report and in our Annual Report filed on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 filed with the SEC on March 29, 2024. Readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements. Overview We are engaged in the research and development of targeted, non-systemic therapies for the treatment of patients with gastrointestinal GI diseases. Non-systemic therapies are non-absorbable drugs that act locally, i.e., in the intestinal lumen, skin or mucosa, without reaching an individual s systemic circulation. Our therapeutic pipeline primarily consists of multiple late-stage clinical programs built around three proprietary technologies the biologic Adrulipase, a recombinant lipase enzyme designed to enable the digestion of fats and other nutrients in cystic fibrosis and chronic pancreatitis patients with exocrine pancreatic insufficiency; Capeserod, a selective 5-HT4 receptor partial agonist which we are developing for the treatment of gastroparesis; and Niclosamide, an oral small molecule with anti-inflammatory properties for patients with inflammatory bowel diseases such as ulcerative colitis and Crohn s disease. We are currently focusing on our Adrulipase and Capeserod programs and are exploring strategic alternatives for our Niclosamide program. In May 2024, we changed our name from First Wave Biopharma, Inc. to Entero Therapeutics, Inc. In March 2024, we announced the closing of a merger with ImmunogenX, Inc. IMGX (the Company s acquisition of IMGX, the Merger ), a private, clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company founded in 2013, which is developing the biologic Latiglutenase for the treatment of celiac disease. IMGX is also developing CypCel, a metabolic marker compound that can measure the state of small-intestinal recovery of celiac patients undergoing gluten-free diets GFDs ). We have initiated a plan to dispose of certain assets and liabilities of IMGX, including Latiglutenase and CypCel, within 12 months of the date of the Merger with IMGX. As of June 30, 2024, these were reclassified as assets and liabilities held for sale and due to the short period of time since the close of the Merger, are reported at their fair value less cost to sell. We determined that the discontinued operations of IMGX represents a strategic shift that will have a major effect on our operations and financial statements. In December 2023, we announced that we have entered into a non-binding term sheet to sell our Niclosamide program. The non-binding term sheet includes a low seven-figure upfront payment to us for rights to Niclosamide, as well as economics related to future milestones and royalties. This transaction is not expected to move forward at this time.

If such registration statement is not so filed or declared effective, on each applicable monthly anniversary for which such registration even is not achieved or cured, we are required to pay to the holder an amount in cash, as partial liquidated damages and not as a penalty, equal to the product of 1.0 multiplied by the product of the most recent closing price of our Common Stock on the applicable event date, and the number of shares underlying such warrants, until the shares underlying such warrants are freely tradeable under Rule 144 of the Securities Act or we regain compliance with the registration rights. If we fail to pay partial liquidated damages required thereby within seven (7) days after the date payable, we are required to pay interest thereon at a rate of 12 per annum (or such lesser maximum amount that is permitted to be paid by applicable law) to the holder, accruing daily from the date such partial liquidated damages are due until such amounts, plus all such interest thereon, are paid in full. The partial liquidated damages provisions apply on a daily pro rata basis for any applicable portion of a month. July 2024 Inducement Offering On July 10, 2024, we entered into a warrant exercise inducement offer letter (the Inducement Letter with a holder (the Holder of warrants to purchase shares of our Common Stock (the Existing Warrants pursuant to which the Holder agreed to exercise for cash their Existing Warrants to purchase 1,762,674 shares of our Common Stock (the Existing Warrant Shares ), in the aggregate, at a reduced exercised price of 1.09 per share, in exchange for our agreement to issue new warrants (the Inducement Warrants on substantially the same terms as the Existing Warrants as described below, to purchase up to 3,525,348 shares of our Common Stock (the Inducement Warrant Shares ). The Inducement Warrants will be exercisable upon the receipt of stockholder approval and may be exercised until the fifth anniversary of the date on which such stockholder approval is obtained. We received aggregate gross proceeds of approximately 1.9 million from the exercise of the Existing Warrants by the Holder and the sale of the Inducement Warrants. We engaged Roth Capital Partners, LLC Roth to act as our financial advisor in connection with the transactions summarized above and paid Roth approximately 96,000 for its services, in addition to reimbursement for certain expenses.

 Nasdaq Continued Listing Requirements On August 17, 2023, we received a letter from the Listing Qualifications Staff (the Staff of The Nasdaq Stock Market LLC Nasdaq indicating that we were not in compliance with the 2.5 million minimum stockholders equity requirement for continued listing of our common stock on Nasdaq as set forth in Nasdaq Listing Rule 5550(b)(1) (the Minimum Stockholder s Equity Rule ). In that regard, we reported stockholders equity of 881,960 in our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the period ended June 30, 2023 (we did not then, and do not now, meet the alternative compliance standards relating to the market value of listed securities of 35.0 million or net income from continuing operations of 0.5 million in the most recently completed fiscal year or in two of the last three most recently completed fiscal years). On April 1, 2024, we received a determination from the Staff that we are back in compliance with the Minium Stockholder s Equity Rule and that the matter is closed. On October 26, 2023, we received a notice from the Staff of Nasdaq indicating that in connection with an offering completed in July 2023 (the July 2023 Offering ), we were not in compliance with Nasdaq s shareholder approval requirements set forth in listing rule 5635(d), which requires prior shareholder approval for transactions, other than public offerings, involving the issuance of 20 or more of the pre-transaction shares outstanding at less than the Minimum Price, defined as a price that is the lower of: (i) the Nasdaq official closing Price (as reflected on Nasdaq.com) immediately preceding the signing of the binding agreement; or (ii) the average Nasdaq official Closing Price of the common stock (as reflected on Nasdaq.com) for the five trading days immediately preceding the signing of the binding agreement. On December 12, 2023, during the Special Meeting, our stockholders ratified our entry into the July 2023 Offering as we received the affirmative vote of the majority of the votes cast by shares of our common stock present or represented by proxy and entitled to vote at the Special Meeting. On March 19, 2024, we received a Letter of Reprimand from the Nasdaq Listing Qualifications Staff (the Letter of Reprimand stating that, while we failed to comply with Nasdaq s continued listing requirements, our violation of listing rule 5635 (d) does not appear to have been the result of a deliberate intent to avoid compliance, and as such, the Staff does not believe that delisting our securities is an appropriate sanction and that it is appropriate to close these matters by issuing the Letter of Reprimand. On August 7, 2024, we notified the Staff of Nasdaq that, as the result of the resignations of two of our directors, we were no longer in compliance with Nasdaq Rule 5605(c)(2) (the Audit Committee Rule ), which requires a Nasdaq-listed company to have an audit committee of the Board comprised of at least three independent directors meeting the eligibility requirements of the Audit Committee Rule. On August 8, 2024, our Board, having determined that both individuals meet the eligibility requirements of the Audit Committee Rule, appointed Chaitan Khosla and Alastair Riddell to the audit committee of the Board (the Audit Committee to fill the vacancies on the Audit Committee created by the aforementioned resignations. Additionally, the Board appointed the existing Audit Committee member, Edward J. Borkowski, as chair of the Audit Committee. As a result of the appointments, the Audit Committee now has three members, as required by the Audit Committee Rule. On September 6, 2024, we received a letter from the Staff of Nasdaq indicating that, based upon the closing bid price of our Common Stock for the last 30 consecutive business days, we are not currently in compliance with the requirement to maintain a minimum bid price of 1.00 per share for continued listing on The Nasdaq Capital Market, as set forth in Nasdaq Listing Rule 5550(a)(2) (the Notice . The Notice has no immediate effect on the continued listing status of our common stock on The Nasdaq Capital Market, and, therefore, our listing remains fully effective. We are provided a compliance period of 180 calendar days from the date of the Notice, or until March 5, 2025, to regain compliance with the minimum closing bid requirement, pursuant to Nasdaq Listing Rule 5810(c)(3)(A). If at any time before March 5, 2025, the closing bid price of our common stock closes at or above 1.00 per share for a minimum of 10 consecutive business days, subject to Nasdaq s discretion to extend this period pursuant to Nasdaq Listing Rule 5810(c)(3)(H), Nasdaq will provide written notification that we have achieved compliance with the minimum bid price requirement, and the matter would be resolved. If we do not regain compliance during the compliance period ending March 5, 2025, then Nasdaq may grant us a second 180 calendar day period to regain compliance, provided we meet the continued listing requirement for market value of publicly-held shares and all other initial listing standards for The Nasdaq Capital Market, other than the minimum closing bid price requirement, and notifies Nasdaq of its intent to cure the deficiency.

 Rationalization Activities and Developments As of December 31, 2023, we had 9 employees, which increased to 15 employees in March 2024 following the IMGX Merger. In connection with certain cost reduction measures we have taken, on July 16, 2024, we reduced our headcount to 11 employees, and Dr. Syage agreed to reduce his annual base salary to 66,560, effective July 1, 2024. On August 1, 2024, in order to further reduce costs and conserve resources, we approved the termination of all non-essential employees and determined to vacate our Boca Raton office. On August 2, 2024, in connection with the reduction in workforce, the Board approve the termination of (i) the employment agreement with our Chief Executive Officer, James Sapirstein (the Sapirstein Employment Agreement ), and (ii) the offer letter between us and our President, Jack Syage. In connection with the termination of the Sapirstein Employment Agreement, on August 2, 2024, we entered into a consulting agreement with Mr. Sapirstein (the Sapirstein Consulting Agreement ), whereby he will continue to serve as our Chief Executive Officer, and pursuant to which Mr. Sapirstein will be paid 400 an hour monthly for services rendered to us. The Sapirstein Consulting Agreement has an initial term of six months, subject to early termination by either party for any reason at any time, and may be extended on a month-to-month basis upon mutual agreement after the expiration of the initial six-month term. Additionally, on August 2, 2024, as part of the reduction in workforce described above, the Board approved the payout of unused vacation time for all employees accrued through August 1, 2024, including Mr. Sapirstein, Dr. Syage, and our Chief Financial Officer, Sarah Romano. We paid Mr. Sapirstein, Dr. Syage, and Ms. Romano 69,230, 1,920, and 45,590, respectively, to compensate for their unused vacation time accrued through August 1, 2024. As a result of the rationalization, we have paused development of Latiglutenase, Adrulipase, Niclosamide, Capeserod, and any other non-essential research and development activities. We are exploring strategic alternatives, including a sale or wind-down of the IMGX entity, as well as other potential strategic options, including a merger, reverse merger, sale, wind-down, liquidation and dissolution or other strategic transaction, however our board of directors has not yet approved any strategic transactions. We are dependent on obtaining, and are continuing to pursue, the necessary funding from outside sources, including obtaining additional funding from the sale of securities in order to continue our operations. We have no committed source of additional capital and if we are unable to raise additional capital in sufficient amounts or on terms acceptable to us, we may be forced to delay, reduce or terminate our business activities. Notice of Default and Acceleration As previously disclosed in our Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the SEC on March 14, 2024, we acquired ImmunogenX in a merger transaction, the terms of which included, among other things, our wholly owned subsidiary, IMGX, assuming the debt of ImmunogenX. On August 2, 2024, IMGX received a Notice of Default and Acceleration (the Notice relating to that certain Credit Agreement, dated as of October 3, 2022 (as amended, modified, supplemented or restated from time to time, the Credit Agreement by and among Mattress Liquidators, Inc. (the Lender and ImmunogenX. The Notice informed IMGX that one or more events of default under the Credit Agreement Event of Defaults were existing and continuing. Such outstanding Events of Default include, among others, IMGX suffering an adverse change in its financial condition which would reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect (as defined in the Credit Agreement). The Notice indicated that, as a result of the outstanding Events of Default, pursuant to the terms of Section 8.3 of the Credit Agreement, (a) the outstanding principal balance of the loan made under the Credit Agreement, all interest and fees related thereto, and all other outstanding obligations are accelerated and declared immediately due and payable, and that the Lender demands immediate payment of all obligations, and (b) the Lender is increasing the effective interest rate to the Default Rate (as defined in the Credit Agreement). The Credit Agreement affords IMGX thirty (30) days to cure Events of Default (the Cure Period ), with a possible extension of an additional thirty (30) days, provided that in no event shall the Cure Period be greater than sixty (60) days in the aggregate. If IMGX is not able to cure the Events of Default within the Cure Period, IMGX may also be deemed to be in default of the stockholder notes ImmunogenX entered into with Jack Syage and Peter Felker as part of the acquisition of ImmunogenX by us (the Stockholder Notes ), the entry into such notes having been previously disclosed by us on our Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the SEC on March 14, 2024. If IMGX is deemed to have defaulted under the Stockholder Notes, the holders of the Stockholder Notes may, at their option and upon notice to IMGX, declare the outstanding principal of, and all accrued interest on, the Stockholder Notes immediately due and payable.

 As of the date of the Notice, the aggregate outstanding obligations under the Credit Agreement were 6,997,583 (comprised of (i) 5,360,000 in respect of outstanding principal, (ii) 1,637,583 of accrued and unpaid interest, and (iii) other, presently unliquidated, amounts for fees and expenses (including legal fees) payable in accordance with the Credit Agreement and related documents). This outstanding amount does not include any additional obligations incurred following the date of the Notice (including additional interest, which shall continue to accrue on the outstanding obligations following the date of the Notice). As previously disclosed in our Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the SEC on September 3, 2024, on August 29, 2024, after discussions with the Lender, ImmunogenX received a letter (the Letter from the Lender informing ImmunogenX that at this time, the Lender is suspending the MAE Default. The Letter additionally provided that the Lender s suspension of the MAE Default is not, and shall not be construed as, a waiver of the MAE Default and the Lender expressly reserves all rights with respect to its enforcement of the MAE Default. Letter of Intent with Data Vault Holdings, Inc. On September 9, 2024, we entered into the Letter of Intent with Data Vault Holdings, Inc. DVHI for the licensing of certain clinical trial software owned by DVHI and associated intellectual property (the Assets ). The Letter of Intent contemplates a worldwide exclusive license to the Assets with the right to grant sublicenses, and a right of first refusal for the Company to fully acquire the Assets in exchange for the issuance of 250,000 of shares of the Company s junior convertible preferred stock (the Preferred Shares priced at a price per preferred share equal to 180 of the five (5) trading day Volume-Weighted Average Price VWAP of the Company s common stock (the Common Share Price ), immediately preceding the closing of the Proposed Transaction multiplied by 1,000 (the Preferred Share Price ), and single digit royalties on net sales (the Proposed Transaction ). Entry into definitive documentation for the Proposed Transaction will be conditioned upon the Company receiving no less than 500,000 of strategic investment (the Strategic Investment ), with a target of ultimately securing up to 3.0 million of strategic investment with the assistance of DVHI. There can be no assurance that the Proposed Transaction will be completed on the terms contemplated in the Letter of Intent or otherwise. Liquidity and Capital Resources To date, we have not generated any revenues and have experienced net losses and negative cash flows from our activities. As of June 30, 2024, we had cash and cash equivalents of approximately 0.7 million and had sustained cumulative losses attributable to common stockholders of approximately 187.6 million. Subsequent to June 30, 2024, the Company raised aggregate gross proceeds of approximately 1.9 million from a July 2024 inducement offering. Based on our cash on hand at June 30, 2024, together with proceeds from the July 2024 exercise of warrants, we anticipate having sufficient cash to fund planned operations into November 2024. We believe that we will need to raise substantial additional capital in the near term to fund our continuing operations, satisfy existing and future obligations and liabilities, and otherwise support our working capital needs and business activities. The acceleration or reduction of cash outflows by management can significantly impact the timing for the need to raise additional capital to complete development of our products. In order to manage our operating costs, we have reduced headcount and paused development activities, and we are exploring strategic alternatives for the purpose of maximizing value of all of our stakeholders of the Company. We have been, and expect to continue to, explore various potential strategies available to us including but not limited to raising capital, restructuring our indebtedness and identifying and evaluating potential strategic alternatives but there can be no assurance that these efforts will be successful, that we will be able to raise necessary capital on acceptable terms, reach agreement with our lenders, or that the strategic review process will result in us pursuing any transaction or that any transaction, if pursued, will be completed on attractive terms or at all. We are evaluating all potential strategic options, including a merger, reverse merger, sale, wind-down, liquidation and dissolution or other strategic transactions. However, there can be no assurances that any particular course of action, business arrangement or transaction, or series of transactions, will be pursued, successfully consummated or lead to increased stakeholder value or that we will make any cash distributions to our stockholders. Any failure in these efforts could force us to delay, limit or terminate our operations, make reductions in our workforce, discontinue our research and development programs, liquidate all or a portion of our assets or pursue other strategic alternatives, and/or seek protection under the provisions of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. We evaluated whether there are certain conditions and events, considered in the aggregate, that raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern within one year after the date that the condensed consolidated financial statements are issued. As described herein, if we are not able to obtain necessary capital, we may be required to terminate our operations, liquidate all or a portion of our assets and/or seek bankruptcy protection. As a result, management has concluded that its plans at this stage do not alleviate substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern.

 Under current Securities and Exchange Commission regulations, because our public float was less than 75.0 million at the relevant measurement period pursuant to General Instruction I.B.6. to Form S-3, the amount we can raise through primary public offerings of securities in any subsequent twelve-month period under our shelf registration statement is limited to an aggregate of one-third of our public float until such time, if any, as our public float is 75.0 million or more. Due to the late filing of our Form 10-Q for the quarter ended June 30, 2024, we are prohibited from registering shares under a Form S-3 for 12 months from the original filing due date, or August 14, 2025. Our ability to issue securities is subject to market conditions. Each issuance under the shelf registration statements will require the filing of a prospectus supplement identifying the amount and terms of the securities to be issued.

The credit agreement was amended in September 2023 (the First Amendment to increase the maximum borrowings of the Revolver to 7.5 million. The credit agreement was amended and restated on March 13, 2024 (the Second Amendment ). Terms under the Second Amendment include a maturity date of September 13, 2025, interest per annum of the prime rate plus 6.0 , and no further draws on the line of credit after March 13, 2024. As of June 30, 2024, the Revolver and accrued interest has been reclassified to liabilities of the disposal group held for sale. Promissory notes In connection with the IMGX acquisition, we assumed two promissory notes, one of which is with a related party. The notes are each in the amount of 0.5 million, accrue interest at a rate of the prime rate plus 4.5 per annum, and have a maturity date of September 30, 2025. As of June 30, 2024, the promissory notes and all accrued interest has been reclassified to liabilities of the disposal group held for sale. EIDL loan In connection with the IMGX acquisition, we assumed an EIDL loan with a principal balance of 0.5 million bearing interest of 3.75 per annum, with interest payable monthly in arrears. All unpaid principal and interest are due at maturity on June 30, 2050. As of June 30, 2024, the EIDL loan and all accrued interest has been reclassified to liabilities of the disposal group held for sale.

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Our accounting policies are essential to understanding and interpreting the financial results reported on the consolidated financial statements. The significant accounting policies used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements are summarized in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto found in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. Certain of those policies are considered to be particularly important to the presentation of our financial results because they require us to make difficult, complex or subjective judgments, often as a result of matters that are inherently uncertain. During the six months ended June 30, 2024, there were no material changes to matters discussed under the heading Critical Accounting Policies and Significant Judgments and Estimates in Part II, Item 7 of the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023.

Based on that evaluation, our CEO and our CFO each concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures are effective to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act, (i) is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission s rules and forms and (ii) is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our CEO and our CFO, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting identified in management s evaluation pursuant to Rules 13a - 15(d) or 15d - 15(d) of the Exchange Act during the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10 - Q that materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

 PART II OTHER INFORMATION ITEM 1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS None. ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS Except as described below, there have been no material changes in or additions to the risk factors included in our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the period ended June 30, 2024 or our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. There is substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern, and we will require substantial additional funding to finance our near- and long-term operations. If we are unable to raise additional capital, we have delayed, and could be forced to further delay, reduce or terminate certain of our products or other operations. We have incurred substantial operating losses since inception and expect to continue to incur significant operating losses for the foreseeable future. As of June 30, 2024, we had cash and cash equivalents of approximately 0.7 million and have sustained cumulative losses attributable to common stockholders of approximately 187.6 million. Based on our cash on hand at October 21, 2024, we anticipate having sufficient cash to fund planned operations into November 2024. The acceleration or reduction of cash outflows by management can significantly impact the timing for the need to raise additional capital to complete development of our products. We believe that we will need to raise substantial additional capital in the near term to fund our continuing operations, satisfy existing and future obligations and liabilities, and otherwise support our working capital needs and business activities. In order to manage our operating costs, we have paused development activities for Latiglutenase, Capeserod and Adrulipase, and we are exploring strategic alternatives for Latiglutenase and Niclosamide. We have not yet achieved profitability and anticipate that we will continue to incur net losses for the foreseeable future. We expect that our expenses will continue to grow and, as a result, we will need to generate significant product revenues to achieve profitability. We may never achieve profitability. Therefore, we are dependent on obtaining, and are continuing to pursue, the necessary funding from outside sources, including obtaining additional funding from the sale of securities in order to continue our operations. We are actively working to obtain additional funding. However, there are currently no commitments in place for further financing nor is there any assurance that such financing will be available to us on favorable terms, if at all. We believe these conditions may raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. If we are unable to secure additional capital, we may be required to delay or curtail any future development of products, and we may take additional measures to reduce expenses in order to conserve our cash in amounts sufficient to sustain operations and meet our obligations. This would negatively impact our business and operations, which would likely cause the price of our Common Stock to decline or ultimately force us to cease our operations. We have recently rationalized our operations and may further rationalize or terminate our operations if we cannot obtain sufficient capital. We are dependent on obtaining, and are continuing to pursue, the necessary funding from outside sources, including obtaining additional funding from the sale of securities in order to continue our operations. We have no committed source of additional capital and if we are unable to raise additional capital in sufficient amounts or on terms acceptable to us, we may be forced to delay, reduce or terminate our business activities. As of December 31, 2023, we had 9 employees, which increased to 15 employees in March 2024 following the IMGX Merger. In connection with certain cost reduction measures we have taken, on July 16, 2024, we reduced our headcount to 11 employees, and Dr. Syage agreed to reduce his annual base salary to 66,560, effective July 1, 2024. On August 1, 2024, in order to further reduce costs and conserve resources, we approved the termination of all non-essential employees. On August 2, 2024, in connection with the reduction in workforce, the Board approve the termination of (i) the employment agreement with our Chief Executive Officer, James Sapirstein (the Sapirstein Employment Agreement ), and (ii) the offer letter between us and our President, Jack Syage. In connection with the termination of the Sapirstein Employment Agreement, on August 2, 2024, we entered into a consulting agreement with Mr. Sapirstein (the Sapirstein Consulting Agreement ), whereby he will continue to serve as our Chief 

 -40- 

Table of Contents 
 Executive Officer, and pursuant to which Mr. Sapirstein will be paid 400 an hour monthly for services rendered to us. The Sapirstein Consulting Agreement has an initial term of six months, is subject to early termination by either party for any reason at any time, and may be extended on a month-to-month basis upon mutual agreement after the expiration of the initial six-month term. Additionally, on August 2, 2024, as part of the reduction in workforce described above, the Board approved the payout of unused vacation time for all employees accrued through August 1, 2024, including Mr. Sapirstein, Dr. Syage, and our Chief Financial Officer, Sarah Romano. We paid Mr. Sapirstein, Dr. Syage, and Ms. Romano 69,230, 1,920, and 45,590, respectively, to compensate for their unused vacation time accrued through August 1, 2024. As a result of the rationalization, we have paused research and development activities for our Latiglutenase, Adrulipase and Capeserod product candidates and any other non-essential research and development activities. We are exploring strategic alternatives for Niclosamide and are evaluating all potential strategic options, including a merger, reverse merger, sale, wind-down, liquidation and dissolution or other strategic transaction, including a potential sale or wind-down of the IMGX assets and liabilities. Additionally, there can be no assurances that any particular course of action, business arrangement or transaction, or series of transactions, will be pursued, successfully consummated or lead to increased stakeholder value or that we will make any cash distributions to our stockholders. Any failure in these efforts could force us to delay, limit or terminate our operations, make reductions in our workforce, discontinue our research and development programs, liquidate all or a portion of our assets or pursue other strategic alternatives, and/or seek protection under the provisions of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. Due to the significant resources required for the development of our product candidates, we must prioritize development of certain product candidates and/or certain disease indications, and deprioritize others. We may expend our limited resources, as they become available, on candidates or indications that do not yield a successful product and fail to capitalize on product candidates or indications that may be more profitable or for which there is a greater likelihood of success. Our goal is to develop a pipeline of product candidates to treat GI and other diseases. Due to the significant resources required for the development of product candidates, we must focus our attention and resources on specific diseases and/or indications and decide which product candidates to pursue and the amount of resources to allocate to each. We intend to focus our resources, as they become available, on the development of our product candidates Adrulipase and Capeserod. Our decisions concerning the allocation of research, development, collaboration, management and financial resources toward particular product candidates or therapeutic areas may not lead to the development of any viable commercial product and may divert resources away from better opportunities. Similarly, any decision to delay, terminate or collaborate with third parties in respect of certain programs or product candidates may subsequently prove to be suboptimal and could cause us to miss valuable opportunities. If we make incorrect determinations regarding the viability or market potential of any of our programs or product candidates or misread trends in the GI, CF, CP, COVID-19, ICI-AC or biotechnology industry, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected. As a result, we may fail to capitalize on viable commercial products or profitable market opportunities, be required to forego or delay pursuit of opportunities with other product candidates or other diseases and indications that may later prove to have greater commercial potential than those we choose to pursue, or relinquish valuable rights to such product candidates through collaboration, licensing or other royalty arrangements in cases in which it would have been advantageous for us to invest additional resources to retain development and commercialization rights. ITEM 2. UNREGISTERED SALES OF EQUITY SECURITIES AND USE OF PROCEEDS Sale of Unregistered Securities In a series of transactions during the three months ended June 30, 2024, we issued an aggregate of 250,000 shares of Common Stock to consultants with a grant date fair value of 760,995, or approximately 3.04 per share, for investor relations services provided. Such issuances were each exempt from registration under 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act. ITEM 3. DEFAULTS UPON SENIOR SECURITIES None.

outstanding shares of Common Stock shall be determined after giving effect to the conversion or exercise of securities of the Company, including any shares of Series B Preferred Stock, by such holder of Series B Preferred Stock or its Affiliates or Attribution Parties since the date as of which such number of outstanding shares of Common Stock was reported.

Any such increase in the Beneficial Ownership Limitation will not be effective until the 61st day after such notice is delivered to the Company. The provisions of this paragraph shall be construed and implemented in a manner otherwise than in strict conformity with the terms of this Section 7(a) to correct this paragraph (or any portion hereof) which may be defective or inconsistent with the intended Beneficial Ownership Limitation herein contained or to make changes or supplements necessary or desirable to properly give effect to such limitation.

Redemption . (a) The Company shall have no right to redeem the Series B Preferred Stock except as set forth in this Section 9 . (b) In the event Stockholder Approval is not received on or prior to the ninetieth (90 th day following the Final Closing, subject to extension upon the prior written approval of the holders of at least a majority of the Series B Preferred Stock then outstanding (the Stockholder Approval Deadline ), the Company shall repurchase all of the then outstanding shares of Series B Preferred Stock at a price equal to 150 times the

(f) Any Mandatory Cash Redemption pursuant to this Section 9 shall be payable out of any cash legally available therefor. At the time of the Mandatory Cash Redemption, the Company shall take all actions required or permitted under Delaware law to permit the Mandatory Cash Redemption and to make funds legally available for such Mandatory Cash Redemption.

Promptly after receipt of such notice, each Holder shall surrender any certificate or certificates representing such shares of Series C Preferred Stock to the Company at its principal office (or such other office or agency of the Company as the Company may designate by notice in writing to the holder or holders of the Series C Preferred Stock), together with a properly completed statement of the name or names (with address), subject to compliance with applicable laws to the extent such 
 9 

designation shall involve a transfer, in which the certificate or certificates for shares of Common Stock (or Prefunded Warrants, as applicable) shall be issued, at any time during its usual business hours, as of the date set forth in such notice. c) Conversion Price . The conversion price for the Series C Preferred Stock shall equal 0.75, subject to adjustment herein (the Conversion Price ). d) Mechanics of Conversion . i. Delivery of Conversion Shares Upon Conversion . Not later than the earlier of (i) two (2) Trading Days and (ii) the number of Trading Days comprising the Standard Settlement Period (as defined below) after each Conversion Date (the Share Delivery Date ), the Company shall deliver, or cause to be delivered, to the converting Holder the number of Conversion Shares being acquired upon the conversion of the Series C Preferred Stock which, if (A) there is an effective registration statement permitting the issuance of the Conversion Shares to or resale of the Conversion Shares by such Holder or (B) the Conversion Shares are eligible for resale by the Holder without volume or manner-of-sale limitations pursuant to Rule 144, shall be free of restrictive legends and trading restrictions (other than those which may then be required by any Purchase Agreement). If (A) there is an effective registration statement permitting the issuance of the Conversion Shares to or resale of the Conversion Shares by such Holder following a conversion of Series C Preferred Stock or (B) the Conversion Shares issuable upon a conversion of Series C Preferred Stock are eligible for resale by the Holder without volume or manner-of-sale limitations pursuant to Rule 144, the Company shall deliver the Conversion Shares required to be delivered by the Company under this Section 6 electronically through the Depository Trust Company or another established clearing corporation performing similar functions. As used herein, Standard Settlement Period means the standard settlement period, expressed in a number of Trading Days, on the Company s primary Trading Market with respect to the Common Stock as in effect on the date of delivery of the Notice of Conversion. ii. Failure to Deliver Conversion Shares . If, in the case of any Notice of Conversion, such Conversion Shares are not delivered to or as directed by the applicable Holder by the Share Delivery Date, the Holder shall be entitled to elect by written notice to the Company at any time on or before its receipt of such Conversion Shares, to rescind such Conversion, in which event the Company shall promptly return to the Holder any original Series C Preferred Stock certificate delivered to the Company and the Holder shall promptly return to the Company the Conversion Shares issued to such Holder pursuant to the rescinded Conversion Notice. iii. Obligation Absolute; Partial Liquidated Damages . The Company s obligation to issue and deliver the Conversion Shares upon conversion of Series C Preferred Stock in accordance with the terms hereof are absolute and unconditional, 
 10 

irrespective of any action or inaction by a Holder to enforce the same, any waiver or consent with respect to any provision hereof, the recovery of any judgment against any Person or any action to enforce the same, or any setoff, counterclaim, recoupment, limitation or termination, or any breach or alleged breach by such Holder or any other Person of any obligation to the Company or any violation or alleged violation of law by such Holder or any other person, and irrespective of any other circumstance which might otherwise limit such obligation of the Company to such Holder in connection with the issuance of such Conversion Shares; provided , however , that such delivery shall not operate as a waiver by the Company of any such action that the Company may have against such Holder. In the event a Holder shall elect to convert any or all of the Stated Value of its Series C Preferred Stock, the Corporation may not refuse conversion based on any claim that such Holder or any one associated or affiliated with such Holder has been engaged in any violation of law, agreement or for any other reason, unless an injunction from a court, on notice to Holder, restraining and/or enjoining conversion of all or part of the Series C Preferred Stock of such Holder shall have been sought and obtained, and the Corporation posts a surety bond for the benefit of such Holder in the amount of 150 of the Stated Value of Series C Preferred Stock which is subject to the injunction, which bond shall remain in effect until the completion of arbitration/litigation of the underlying dispute and the proceeds of which shall be payable to such Holder to the extent it obtains judgment. In the absence of such injunction, the Corporation shall issue Conversion Shares upon a properly noticed conversion. If the Company fails to deliver to a Holder such Conversion Shares pursuant to Section 6(d)(i) by the Share Delivery Date applicable to such conversion, the Company shall pay to such Holder, in cash, as liquidated damages and not as a penalty, for each 5,000 of Stated Value of Series C Preferred Stock being converted, 50 per Trading Day (increasing to 100 per Trading Day on the third Trading Day and increasing to 200 per Trading Day on the sixth Trading Day after such damages begin to accrue) for each Trading Day after the Share Delivery Date until such Conversion Shares are delivered or Holder rescinds such conversion. Nothing herein shall limit a Holder s right to pursue actual damages for the Company s failure to deliver Conversion Shares within the period specified herein and such Holder shall have the right to pursue all remedies available to it hereunder, at law or in equity including, without limitation, a decree of specific performance and/or injunctive relief. The exercise of any such rights shall not prohibit a Holder from seeking to enforce damages pursuant to any other Section hereof or under applicable law. iv. Compensation for Buy-In on Failure to Timely Deliver Conversion Shares Upon Conversion . In addition to any other rights available to the Holder, if the Company fails for any reason to deliver to a Holder the applicable Conversion Shares by the Share Delivery Date pursuant to Section 6(d)(i), and if after such Share Delivery Date such Holder is required by its brokerage firm to purchase (in an open market transaction or otherwise), or the Holder s brokerage firm otherwise purchases, shares of Common Stock to deliver in satisfaction of a sale by such 
 11 

Holder of the Conversion Shares which such Holder was entitled to receive upon the conversion relating to such Share Delivery Date (a Buy-In ), then the Company shall (A) pay in cash to such Holder (in addition to any other remedies available to or elected by such Holder) the amount, if any, by which (x) such Holder s total purchase price (including any brokerage commissions) for the Common Stock so purchased exceeds (y) the product of (1) the aggregate number of shares of Common Stock that such Holder was entitled to receive from the conversion at issue multiplied by (2) the actual sale price at which the sell order giving rise to such purchase obligation was executed (including any brokerage commissions) and (B) at the option of such Holder, either reissue (if surrendered) the shares of Series C Preferred Stock equal to the number of shares of Series C Preferred Stock submitted for conversion (in which case, such conversion shall be deemed rescinded) or deliver to such Holder the number of shares of Common Stock that would have been issued if the Company had timely complied with its delivery requirements under Section 6(d)(i). For example, if a Holder purchases shares of Common Stock having a total purchase price of 11,000 to cover a Buy In with respect to an attempted conversion of shares of Series C Preferred Stock with respect to which the actual sale price of the Conversion Shares (including any brokerage commissions) giving rise to such purchase obligation was a total of 10,000 under clause (A) of the immediately preceding sentence, the Company shall be required to pay such Holder 1,000. The Holder shall provide the Company written notice indicating the amounts payable to such Holder in respect of the Buy In and, upon request of the Company, evidence of the amount of such loss. Nothing herein shall limit a Holder s right to pursue any other remedies available to it hereunder, at law or in equity including, without limitation, a decree of specific performance and/or injunctive relief with respect to the Company s failure to timely deliver the Conversion Shares upon conversion of the shares of Series C Preferred Stock as required pursuant to the terms hereof. v. Reservation of Shares Issuable Upon Conversion . The Company covenants that it will at all times reserve and keep available out of its authorized and unissued shares of Common Stock for the sole purpose of issuance upon conversion of the Series C Preferred Stock, free from preemptive rights or any other actual contingent purchase rights of Persons other than the Holder (and the other holders of the Series C Preferred Stock), not less than such aggregate number of shares of the Common Stock as shall (subject to the terms and conditions set forth in any Purchase Agreement) be issuable (taking into account the adjustments and restrictions of Sections 6(f) and 7) upon the conversion of the then outstanding shares of Series C Preferred Stock, including all accrued and accumulated dividends. The Company covenants that all shares of Common Stock that shall be so issuable shall, upon issue, be duly authorized, validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable. vi. Fractional Shares . No fractional shares or scrip representing fractional shares of Common Stock (or Prefunded Warrants to purchase fractional 
 12 

shares of Common Stock, as applicable) shall be issued upon the conversion of the Series C Preferred Stock. As to any fraction of a share of Common Stock which the Holder would otherwise be entitled to purchase upon such conversion, the Company shall at its election, either pay a cash adjustment in respect of such final fraction in an amount equal to such fraction multiplied by the Conversion Price or round up to the next whole share. vii. Transfer Taxes and Expenses . The issuance of Conversion Shares on conversion of this Series C Preferred Stock shall be made without charge to any Holder for any documentary stamp or similar taxes that may be payable in respect of the issue or delivery of such Conversion Shares, provided that the Company shall not be required to pay any tax that may be payable in respect of any transfer involved in the issuance and delivery of any such Conversion Shares upon conversion in a name other than that of the Holders of such shares of Series C Preferred Stock and the Company shall not be required to issue or deliver such Conversion Shares unless or until the Person or Persons requesting the issuance thereof shall have paid to the Company the amount of such tax or shall have established to the satisfaction of the Company that such tax has been paid. The Company shall pay all Transfer Agent fees required for same-day processing of any Notice of Conversion and all fees to the Depository Trust Company (or another established clearing corporation performing similar functions) required for same day electronic delivery of the Conversion Shares. e) Beneficial Ownership Limitation . The Company shall not effect any conversion of the Series C Preferred Stock, and a Holder shall not have the right to convert any portion of the Series C Preferred Stock, to the extent that, after giving effect to the conversion set forth on the applicable Notice of Conversion, such Holder (together with such Holder s Affiliates, and any Persons acting as a group together with such Holder or any of such Holder s Affiliates (such Persons, Attribution Parties )) would beneficially own in excess of the Beneficial Ownership Limitation (as defined below). For purposes of the foregoing sentence, the number of shares of Common Stock beneficially owned by such Holder and its Affiliates and Attribution Parties shall include the number of shares of Common Stock issuable upon conversion of the Series C Preferred Stock with respect to which such determination is being made, but shall exclude the number of shares of Common Stock which are issuable upon (i) conversion of the remaining, unconverted Series C Preferred Stock beneficially owned by such Holder or any of its Affiliates or Attribution Parties and (ii) exercise or conversion of the unexercised or unconverted portion of any other securities of the Company subject to a limitation on conversion or exercise analogous to the limitation contained herein (including, without limitation, the Series C Preferred Stock or the Warrants) beneficially owned by such Holder or any of its Affiliates or Attribution Parties. Except as set forth in the preceding sentence, for purposes of this Section 6(e), beneficial ownership shall be calculated in accordance with Section 13(d) of the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder. To the extent that the limitation contained in this Section 6(e) applies, the determination of whether the Series C Preferred Stock is convertible (in relation to other securities owned 
 13 

by such Holder together with any Affiliates and Attribution Parties) and of how many shares of Series C Preferred Stock are convertible shall be in the sole discretion of such Holder, and the submission of a Notice of Conversion shall be deemed to be such Holder s determination of whether the shares of Series C Preferred Stock may be converted (in relation to other securities owned by such Holder together with any Affiliates and Attribution Parties) and how many shares of the Series C Preferred Stock are convertible, in each case subject to the Beneficial Ownership Limitation. To ensure compliance with this restriction, each Holder will be deemed to represent to the Company each time it delivers a Notice of Conversion that such Notice of Conversion has not violated the restrictions set forth in this paragraph and the Company shall have no obligation to verify or confirm the accuracy of such determination. In addition, a determination as to any group status as contemplated above shall be determined in accordance with Section 13(d) of the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder. For purposes of this Section 6(e), in determining the number of outstanding shares of Common Stock, a Holder may rely on the number of outstanding shares of Common Stock as stated in the most recent of the following: (i) the Company s most recent periodic or annual report filed with the Commission, as the case may be, (ii) a more recent public announcement by the Company or (iii) a more recent written notice by the Company or the Transfer Agent setting forth the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding. Upon the written or oral request of a Holder, the Company shall within two Trading Days confirm orally and in writing to such Holder the number of shares of Common Stock then outstanding. In any case, the number of outstanding shares of Common Stock shall be determined after giving effect to the conversion or exercise of securities of the Company, including the Series C Preferred Stock, by such Holder or its Affiliates or Attribution Parties since the date as of which such number of outstanding shares of Common Stock was reported. The Beneficial Ownership Limitation shall be 4.99 of the number of shares of the Common Stock outstanding immediately after giving effect to the issuance of shares of Common Stock issuable upon conversion of Series C Preferred Stock held by the applicable Holder. A Holder, upon notice to the Company, may increase or decrease the Beneficial Ownership Limitation provisions of this Section 6(e) applicable to its Series C Preferred Stock provided that the Beneficial Ownership Limitation in no event exceeds 9.99 of the number of shares of the Common Stock outstanding immediately after giving effect to the issuance of shares of Common Stock upon conversion of this Series C Preferred Stock held by the Holder and the provisions of this Section 6(e) shall continue to apply. Any such increase in the Beneficial Ownership Limitation will not be effective until the 61 st day after such notice is delivered to the Company and shall only apply to such Holder and no other Holder. The provisions of this paragraph shall be construed and implemented in a manner otherwise than in strict conformity with the terms of this Section 6(e) to correct this paragraph (or any portion hereof) which may be defective or inconsistent with the intended Beneficial Ownership Limitation contained herein or to make changes or supplements necessary or desirable to properly give effect to such limitation. The limitations contained in this paragraph shall apply to a successor holder of Series C Preferred Stock. f) Issuance Limitations . Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, except to the extent the Company has previously obtained effective Stockholder Approval, 
 14 

the Company may not issue, upon conversion of the Series C Preferred Stock, a number of shares of Common Stock (or Prefunded Warrants covering a number of shares of Common Stock, as applicable) which would exceed 6,186,966 shares of Common Stock in the aggregate, subject to adjustment for forward and reverse stock splits, recapitalizations and the like (such number of shares, the Issuable Maximum ). Section 7 . Certain Adjustments . a) Stock Dividends and Stock Splits . If the Company, at any time while this Series C Preferred Stock is outstanding: (i) pays a stock dividend or otherwise makes a distribution or distributions payable in shares of Common Stock on shares of Common Stock or any other Common Stock Equivalents (which, for avoidance of doubt, shall not include any shares of Common Stock issued by the Company upon conversion of, or payment of a dividend on, this Series C Preferred Stock), (ii) subdivides outstanding shares of Common Stock into a larger number of shares, (iii) combines (including by way of a reverse stock split) outstanding shares of Common Stock into a smaller number of shares, or (iv) issues, in the event of a reclassification of shares of the Common Stock, any shares of capital stock of the Company, then the Conversion Price shall be multiplied by a fraction of which the numerator shall be the number of shares of Common Stock (excluding any treasury shares of the Company) outstanding immediately before such event, and of which the denominator shall be the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately after such event. Any adjustment made pursuant to this Section 7(a) shall become effective immediately after the record date for the determination of stockholders entitled to receive such dividend or distribution and shall become effective immediately after the effective date in the case of a subdivision, combination or re-classification. b) [Intentionally Omitted] . c) Subsequent Rights Offerings . In addition to any adjustments pursuant to Section 7(a) above, if at any time the Company grants, issues or sells any Common Stock Equivalents or rights to purchase stock, warrants, securities or other property pro rata to the record holders of any class of shares of Common Stock (the Purchase Rights ), then each Holder of Series C Preferred Stock will be entitled to acquire, upon the terms applicable to such Purchase Rights, the aggregate Purchase Rights which the Holder could have acquired if the Holder had held the number of shares of Common Stock acquirable upon complete conversion of such Holder s Series C Preferred Stock (without regard to any limitations on exercise hereof, including without limitation, the Beneficial Ownership Limitation) immediately before the date on which a record is taken for the grant, issuance or sale of such Purchase Rights, or, if no such record is taken, the date as of which the record holders of shares of Common Stock are to be determined for the grant, issue or sale of such Purchase Rights (provided, however, to the extent that the Holder s right to participate in any such Purchase Right would result in the Holder exceeding the Beneficial Ownership Limitation, then the Holder shall not be entitled to participate in such Purchase Right to such extent (or beneficial ownership of such shares of Common Stock as a result of such Purchase Right to such extent) and such Purchase Right to such extent shall be held 
 15 

in abeyance for the Holder until such time, if ever, as its right thereto would not result in the Holder exceeding the Beneficial Ownership Limitation). d) Pro Rata Distributions . During such time as this Series C Preferred Stock is outstanding, if the Company declares or makes any dividend or other distribution of its assets (or rights to acquire its assets) to holders of shares of Common Stock, by way of return of capital or otherwise (including, without limitation, any distribution of cash, stock or other securities, property or options by way of a dividend, spin off, reclassification, corporate rearrangement, scheme of arrangement or other similar transaction) (a Distribution ), at any time after the issuance of this Series C Preferred Stock, then, in each such case, the Holder shall be entitled to participate in such Distribution to the same extent that the Holder would have participated therein if the Holder had held the number of shares of Common Stock acquirable upon complete conversion of this Series C Preferred Stock (without regard to any limitations on conversion hereof, including without limitation, the Beneficial Ownership Limitation) immediately before the date of which a record is taken for such Distribution, or, if no such record is taken, the date as of which the record holders of shares of Common Stock are to be determined for the participation in such Distribution provided , however , to the extent that the Holder s right to participate in any such Distribution would result in the Holder exceeding the Beneficial Ownership Limitation, then the Holder shall not be entitled to participate in such Distribution to such extent (or in the beneficial ownership of any shares of Common Stock as a result of such Distribution to such extent) and the portion of such Distribution shall be held in abeyance for the benefit of the Holder until such time, if ever, as its right thereto would not result in the Holder exceeding the Beneficial Ownership Limitation). e) Fundamental Transaction . If, at any time while this Series C Preferred Stock is outstanding, (i) the Company, directly or indirectly, in one or more related transactions effects any merger or consolidation of the Company with or into another Person, (ii) the Company, directly or indirectly, effects any sale, lease, license, assignment, transfer, conveyance or other disposition of all or substantially all of its assets in one or a series of related transactions, (iii) any, direct or indirect, purchase offer, tender offer or exchange offer (whether by the Company or another Person) is completed pursuant to which holders of Common Stock are permitted to sell, tender or exchange their shares for other securities, cash or property and has been accepted by the holders of 50 or more of the outstanding Common Stock, (iv) the Company, directly or indirectly, in one or more related transactions effects any reclassification, reorganization or recapitalization of the Common Stock or any compulsory share exchange pursuant to which the Common Stock is effectively converted into or exchanged for other securities, cash or property, or (v) the Company, directly or indirectly, in one or more related transactions consummates a stock or share purchase agreement or other business combination (including, without limitation, a reorganization, recapitalization, spin-off or scheme of arrangement) with another Person whereby such other Person acquires more than 50 of the outstanding shares of Common Stock (not including any shares of Common Stock held by the other Person or other Persons making or party to, or associated or affiliated with the other Persons making or party to, such stock or share purchase agreement or other business combination) (each a 
 16 

Fundamental Transaction ), then, upon any subsequent conversion of this Series C Preferred Stock, the Holders shall have the right to receive, for each Conversion Share that would have been issuable upon such conversion immediately prior to the occurrence of such Fundamental Transaction (without regard to any limitation in Section 6(e) and Section 6(f) on the conversion of this Series C Preferred Stock), the number of shares of Common Stock of the successor or acquiring corporation or of the Company, if it is the surviving corporation, and any additional consideration (the Alternate Consideration receivable as a result of such Fundamental Transaction by a holder of the number of shares of Common Stock for which this Series C Preferred Stock is convertible immediately prior to such Fundamental Transaction (without regard to any limitation in Section 6(e) and Section 6(f) on the conversion of this Series C Preferred Stock). For purposes of any such conversion, the determination of the Conversion Price shall be appropriately adjusted to apply to such Alternate Consideration based on the amount of Alternate Consideration issuable in respect of one share of Common Stock in such Fundamental Transaction, and the Company shall apportion the Conversion Price among the Alternate Consideration in a reasonable manner reflecting the relative value of any different components of the Alternate Consideration. If holders of Common Stock are given any choice as to the securities, cash or property to be received in a Fundamental Transaction, then the Holders shall be given the same choice as to the Alternate Consideration it receives upon any conversion of this Series C Preferred Stock following such Fundamental Transaction. To the extent necessary to effectuate the foregoing provisions, any successor to the Company or surviving entity in such Fundamental Transaction shall file a new Certificate of Designation with the same terms and conditions and issue to the Holders new preferred stock consistent with the foregoing provisions and evidencing the Holders right to convert such preferred stock into Alternate Consideration. The Company shall cause any successor entity in a Fundamental Transaction in which the Company is not the survivor (the Successor Entity to assume in writing all of the obligations of the Company under this Certificate of Designation and the other Transaction Documents in accordance with the provisions of this Section 7(e) pursuant to written agreements in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Holders and approved by the Holders (without unreasonable delay) prior to such Fundamental Transaction and shall, at the option of the holder of this Series C Preferred Stock, deliver to the Holders in exchange for this Series C Preferred Stock a security of the Successor Entity evidenced by a written instrument substantially similar in form and substance to this Series C Preferred Stock which is convertible for a corresponding number of shares of capital stock of such Successor Entity (or its parent entity) equivalent to the shares of Common Stock acquirable and receivable upon conversion of this Series C Preferred Stock (without regard to any limitations on the conversion of this Series C Preferred Stock) prior to such Fundamental Transaction, and with a conversion price which applies the conversion price hereunder to such shares of capital stock (but taking into account the relative value of the shares of Common Stock pursuant to such Fundamental Transaction and the value of such shares of capital stock, such number of shares of capital stock and such conversion price being for the purpose of protecting the economic value of this Series C Preferred Stock immediately prior to the consummation of such Fundamental Transaction), and which is reasonably satisfactory in form and substance to the Holders. Upon the occurrence of any such Fundamental 
 17 

Transaction, the Successor Entity shall succeed to, and be substituted for (so that from and after the date of such Fundamental Transaction, the provisions of this Certificate of Designation and the other Transaction Documents referring to the Company shall refer instead to the Successor Entity), and may exercise every right and power of the Company and shall assume all of the obligations of the Company under this Certificate of Designation and the other Transaction Documents with the same effect as if such Successor Entity had been named as the Company herein. f) Calculations . All calculations under this Section 7 shall be made to the nearest cent or the nearest 1/100th of a share, as the case may be. For purposes of this Section 7, the number of shares of Common Stock deemed to be issued and outstanding as of a given date shall be the sum of the number of shares of Common Stock (excluding any treasury shares of the Company) issued and outstanding. g) Notice to the Holders . i. Adjustment to Conversion Price . Whenever the Conversion Price is adjusted pursuant to any provision of this Section 7, the Company shall promptly deliver to each Holder a notice pursuant to Section 8(a) setting forth the Conversion Price after such adjustment and setting forth a brief statement of the facts requiring such adjustment. ii. Notice to Allow Conversion by Holder . If (A) the Company shall declare a dividend (or any other distribution in whatever form) on the Common Stock, (B) the Company shall declare a special nonrecurring cash dividend on or a redemption of the Common Stock, (C) the Company shall authorize the granting to all holders of the Common Stock of rights or warrants to subscribe for or purchase any shares of capital stock of any class or of any rights, (D) the approval of any stockholders of the Company shall be required in connection with any reclassification of the Common Stock, any consolidation or merger to which the Company is a party, any sale or transfer of all or substantially all of the assets of the Company, or any compulsory share exchange whereby the Common Stock is converted into other securities, cash or property or (E) the Company shall authorize the voluntary or involuntary dissolution, liquidation or winding up of the affairs of the Company, then, in each case, the Company shall cause to be filed at each office or agency maintained for the purpose of conversion of this Series C Preferred Stock, and shall cause to be delivered by to each Holder at its last e-mail address or address as it shall appear upon the stock books of the Company, at least twenty (20) calendar days prior to the applicable record or effective date hereinafter specified, a notice stating (x) the date on which a record is to be taken for the purpose of such dividend, distribution, redemption, rights or warrants, or if a record is not to be taken, the date as of which the holders of the Common Stock of record to be entitled to such dividend, distributions, redemption, rights or warrants are to be determined or (y) the date on which such reclassification, consolidation, merger, sale, transfer or share exchange is expected to become effective or close, and the date as of which it is expected that holders of the Common Stock of record shall be entitled to 
 18 

exchange their shares of the Common Stock for securities, cash or other property deliverable upon such reclassification, consolidation, merger, sale, transfer or share exchange; provided that the failure to deliver such notice or any defect therein or in the delivery thereof shall not affect the validity of the corporate action required to be specified in such notice. To the extent that any notice provided hereunder constitutes, or contains, material, non-public information regarding the Company or any of the Subsidiaries, the Company shall simultaneously file such notice with the Commission pursuant to a Current Report on Form 8-K.

The Corporation s obligation to issue and deliver the Conversion Shares upon conversion of Preferred Stock in accordance with the terms hereof are absolute and unconditional, irrespective of any action or inaction by a Holder to enforce the same, any waiver or consent with respect to any provision hereof, the recovery of any judgment against any Person or any action to enforce the same, or any setoff, counterclaim, recoupment, limitation or termination, or any breach or alleged breach by such Holder or any other Person of any obligation to the Corporation or any violation or alleged violation of law by such Holder or any other person, and irrespective of any other circumstance which might otherwise limit such obligation of the Corporation to such Holder in connection with the issuance of such Conversion Shares; provided , however , that such delivery shall not operate as a waiver by the Corporation of any such action that the Corporation may have against such Holder. In the event a Holder shall elect to convert any or all of its Preferred Stock, the Corporation may not refuse conversion based on any claim that such Holder or any Person associated or affiliated with such Holder has been engaged in any violation of law, agreement or for any other reason, unless an injunction from a court, on notice to Holder, restraining and/or enjoining conversion of all or part of the Preferred Stock of such Holder shall have been sought and obtained, and the Corporation posts a surety bond for the benefit of such Holder in the amount of 150 of the Stated Value of Preferred Stock which is subject to the injunction, which bond shall remain in effect until the completion of arbitration/litigation of the underlying dispute and the proceeds of which shall be payable to such Holder to the extent it obtains judgment in its favor. In the absence of such injunction, the Corporation shall issue Conversion Shares and, if applicable, cash, upon a properly noticed conversion. If the Corporation fails to deliver to a Holder such Conversion Shares pursuant to Section 6(c)(i) by the Share Delivery Date applicable to such conversion, the Corporation shall pay to such Holder, in cash, as liquidated damages and not as a penalty, for each 5,000 of Stated Value of Preferred Stock being converted, 10 per Trading Day (increasing to 20 per Trading Day on the fifth Trading Day after the Share Delivery Date and increasing to 50 per Trading Day on the tenth Trading Day after the Share Delivery Date) for each Trading Day after the Share Delivery Date until such Conversion Shares are delivered or Holder rescinds such conversion. Nothing herein shall limit a Holder s right to pursue actual damages for the Corporation s failure to deliver Conversion Shares within the period specified herein and such Holder shall have the right to pursue all remedies available to it hereunder, at law or in equity including, without limitation, 
 9 

a decree of specific performance and/or injunctive relief. The exercise of any such rights shall not prohibit a Holder from seeking to enforce damages pursuant to any other Section hereof or under applicable law. iv. Compensation for Buy-In on Failure to Timely Deliver Conversion Shares Upon Conversion . In addition to any other rights available to the Holder, if the Corporation fails for any reason to deliver to a Holder the applicable Conversion Shares by the Share Delivery Date pursuant to Section 6(c)(i), and if after such Share Delivery Date such Holder is required by its brokerage firm to purchase (in an open market transaction or otherwise), or the Holder s brokerage firm otherwise purchases, shares of Common Stock to deliver in satisfaction of a sale by such Holder of the Conversion Shares which such Holder was entitled to receive upon the conversion relating to such Share Delivery Date (a Buy-In ), then the Corporation shall (A) pay in cash to such Holder (in addition to any other remedies available to or elected by such Holder) the amount, if any, by which (x) such Holder s total purchase price (including any brokerage commissions) for the Common Stock so purchased exceeds (y) the product of (1) the aggregate number of shares of Common Stock that such Holder was entitled to receive from the conversion at issue multiplied by (2) the actual sale price at which the sell order giving rise to such purchase obligation was executed (including any brokerage commissions) and (B) at the option of such Holder, either reissue (if surrendered) the shares of Preferred Stock equal to the number of shares of Preferred Stock submitted for conversion (in which case, such conversion shall be deemed rescinded) or deliver to such Holder the number of shares of Common Stock that would have been issued if the Corporation had timely complied with its delivery requirements under Section 6(c)(i). For example, if a Holder purchases shares of Common Stock having a total purchase price of 11,000 to cover a Buy-In with respect to an attempted conversion of shares of Preferred Stock with respect to which the actual sale price of the Conversion Shares (including any brokerage commissions) giving rise to such purchase obligation was a total of 10,000 under clause (A) of the immediately preceding sentence, the Corporation shall be required to pay such Holder 1,000. The Holder shall provide the Corporation written notice indicating the amounts payable to such Holder in respect of the Buy-In and, upon request of the Corporation, evidence of the amount of such loss. Nothing herein shall limit a Holder s right to pursue any other remedies available to it hereunder, at law or in equity including, without limitation, a decree of specific performance and/or injunctive relief with respect to the Corporation s failure to timely deliver the Conversion Shares upon conversion of the shares of Preferred Stock as required pursuant to the terms hereof. v. Reservation of Shares Issuable Upon Conversion . From and after the Reverse Stock Split Date and until no shares of the Preferred Stock remain outstanding, the Corporation covenants that it will at all times reserve and keep available out of its authorized and unissued shares of Common Stock for the sole purpose of issuance upon conversion of the Preferred Stock as herein provided, free 
 10 

from preemptive rights or any other actual contingent purchase rights of Persons other than the Holder (and the other holders of the Preferred Stock), not less than such aggregate number of shares of the Common Stock as shall (subject to the terms and conditions set forth in the Purchase Agreement) be issuable (taking into account the adjustments and restrictions of Section 7) upon the conversion of the then outstanding shares of Preferred Stock. The Corporation covenants that following the Reverse Stock Split Date, all shares of Common Stock that shall be so issuable shall, upon issue, be duly authorized, validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable. vi. Fractional Shares . No fractional shares or scrip representing fractional shares shall be issued upon the conversion of the Preferred Stock. As to any fraction of a share which the Holder would otherwise be entitled to upon such conversion, the Corporation shall at its election, either pay a cash adjustment in respect of such final fraction in an amount equal to such fraction multiplied by the Conversion Price or round up to the next whole share. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, but consistent with the provisions of this subsection with respect to fractional Conversion Shares, nothing shall prevent any Holder from converting fractional shares of Preferred Stock. vii. Transfer Taxes and Expenses . The issuance of Conversion Shares on conversion of the Preferred Stock shall be made without charge to any Holder for any documentary stamp or similar taxes that may be payable in respect of the issue or delivery of such Conversion Shares, provided that the Corporation shall not be required to pay any tax that may be payable in respect of any transfer involved in the issuance and delivery of any such Conversion Shares upon conversion in a name other than that of the Holder of such shares of Preferred Stock and the Corporation shall not be required to issue or deliver such Conversion Shares unless or until the Person or Persons requesting the issuance thereof shall have paid to the Corporation the amount of such tax or shall have established to the satisfaction of the Corporation that such tax has been paid. The Corporation shall pay all Transfer Agent fees required for same-day processing of any Notice of Conversion and all fees to the Depository Trust Company (or another established clearing corporation performing similar functions) required for same-day electronic delivery of the Conversion Shares. d) Beneficial Ownership Limitation . Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth herein, the Corporation shall not effect any conversion of the Preferred Stock, and a Holder shall not have the right to convert any portion of the Preferred Stock, to the extent that, after giving effect to the conversion set forth on the applicable Notice of Conversion, such Holder (together with such Holder s Affiliates, and any Persons acting as a group together with such Holder or any of such Holder s Affiliates (such Persons, Attribution Parties )) would beneficially own in excess of the Beneficial Ownership Limitation (as defined below). For purposes of the foregoing sentence, the number of shares of Common Stock beneficially owned by such Holder and its Affiliates and Attribution Parties shall include the number of shares of Common Stock issuable upon conversion of the Preferred 
 11 

Stock with respect to which such determination is being made, but shall exclude the number of shares of Common Stock which are issuable upon (i) conversion of the remaining, unconverted Preferred Stock beneficially owned by such Holder or any of its Affiliates or Attribution Parties and (ii) exercise or conversion of the unexercised or unconverted portion of any other securities of the Corporation subject to a limitation on conversion or exercise analogous to the limitation contained herein (including, without limitation, the Preferred Stock) beneficially owned by such Holder or any of its Affiliates or Attribution Parties. Except as set forth in the preceding sentence, for purposes of this Section 6(d), beneficial ownership shall be calculated in accordance with Section 13(d) of the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder. To the extent that the limitation contained in this Section 6(d) applies, the determination of whether the Preferred Stock is convertible (in relation to other securities owned by such Holder together with any Affiliates and Attribution Parties) and of how many shares of Preferred Stock are convertible shall be in the sole discretion of such Holder, and the submission of a Notice of Conversion shall be deemed to be such Holder s determination of whether the shares of Preferred Stock may be converted (in relation to other securities owned by such Holder together with any Affiliates and Attribution Parties) and how many shares of the Preferred Stock are convertible, in each case subject to the Beneficial Ownership Limitation. To ensure compliance with this restriction, each Holder will be deemed to represent to the Corporation each time it delivers a Notice of Conversion that such Notice of Conversion has not violated the restrictions set forth in this paragraph and the Corporation shall have no obligation to verify or confirm the accuracy of such determination. In addition, a determination as to any group status as contemplated above shall be determined in accordance with Section 13(d) of the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder. The Holder understands and acknowledges that the Corporation is not representing to the Holder that the calculations and determinations set forth in this Section 6(d) are in compliance with Section 13(d) of the Exchange Act and the Holder is solely responsible for any schedules required to be filed in accordance therewith. For purposes of this Section 6(d), in determining the number of outstanding shares of Common Stock, a Holder may rely on the number of outstanding shares of Common Stock as stated in the most recent of the following: (i) the Corporation s most recent periodic or annual report filed with the Commission, as the case may be, (ii) a more recent public announcement by the Corporation or (iii) a more recent written notice by the Corporation or the Transfer Agent setting forth the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding. Upon the written or oral request (which may be via email) of a Holder, the Corporation shall within one Trading Day confirm orally and in writing to such Holder the number of shares of Common Stock then outstanding. In any case, the number of outstanding shares of Common Stock shall be determined after giving effect to the conversion or exercise of securities of the Corporation, including the Preferred Stock, by such Holder or its Affiliates or Attribution Parties since the date as of which such number of outstanding shares of Common Stock was reported. The Beneficial Ownership Limitation shall be 4.99 (or, upon election by a Holder prior to the issuance of any shares of Preferred Stock, 9.99 of the number of shares of the Common Stock outstanding immediately after giving effect to the issuance of shares of Common Stock issuable upon conversion of Preferred Stock held by the applicable Holder. A Holder, upon 
 12 

notice to the Corporation submitted in writing (which may be via email) to the Secretary of the Corporation, may increase or decrease the Beneficial Ownership Limitation provisions of this Section 6(d) applicable to its Preferred Stock provided that the Beneficial Ownership Limitation in no event exceeds 9.99 of the number of shares of the Common Stock outstanding immediately after giving effect to the issuance of shares of Common Stock upon conversion of the Preferred Stock held by the Holder and the provisions of this Section 6(d) shall continue to apply. Any such increase in the Beneficial Ownership Limitation will not be effective until the 61 st day after such notice is delivered to the Corporation and shall only apply to such Holder and no other Holder. The Beneficial Ownership Limitation shall not be waived by the Corporation or the Holder. The provisions of this paragraph shall be construed and implemented in a manner otherwise than in strict conformity with the terms of this Section 6(d) to correct this paragraph (or any portion hereof) which may be defective or inconsistent with the intended Beneficial Ownership Limitation contained herein or to make changes or supplements necessary or desirable to properly give effect to such limitation. The limitations contained in this paragraph shall apply to a successor holder of Preferred Stock. Section 7 . Certain Adjustments . a) Stock Dividends and Stock Splits . If the Corporation, at any time while the Preferred Stock is outstanding: (i) pays a stock dividend or otherwise makes a distribution or distributions payable in shares of Common Stock on shares of Common Stock or any other Common Stock Equivalents (which, for avoidance of doubt, shall not include any shares of Common Stock issued by the Corporation upon conversion of, or payment of a dividend on, the Preferred Stock), (ii) subdivides outstanding shares of Common Stock into a larger number of shares, (iii) combines (including by way of a reverse stock split, including the Reverse Stock Split) outstanding shares of Common Stock into a smaller number of shares, or (iv) issues, in the event of a reclassification of shares of the Common Stock, any shares of capital stock of the Corporation, then the Conversion Price shall be multiplied by a fraction of which the numerator shall be the number of shares of Common Stock (excluding any treasury shares of the Corporation) outstanding immediately before such event, and of which the denominator shall be the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately after such event. Any adjustment made pursuant to this Section 7(a) shall become effective immediately after the record date for the determination of stockholders entitled to receive such dividend or distribution and shall become effective immediately after the effective date in the case of a subdivision, combination or re-classification. b) Subsequent Rights Offerings . In addition to any adjustments pursuant to Section 7(a) above, if at any time the Corporation grants, issues or sells any Common Stock Equivalents or rights to purchase stock, warrants, securities or other property pro rata to the record holders of any class of shares of Common Stock (the Purchase Rights ), then each Holder will be entitled to acquire, upon the terms applicable to such Purchase Rights, the aggregate Purchase Rights which the Holder could have acquired if the Holder had held the number of shares of Common Stock acquirable upon complete conversion of such 
 13 

Holder s Preferred Stock (without regard to any limitations on exercise hereof, including without limitation, the Beneficial Ownership Limitation) immediately before the date on which a record is taken for the grant, issuance or sale of such Purchase Rights, or, if no such record is taken, the date as of which the record holders of shares of Common Stock are to be determined for the grant, issue or sale of such Purchase Rights (provided, however, to the extent that the Holder s right to participate in any such Purchase Right would result in the Holder exceeding the Beneficial Ownership Limitation, then the Holder shall not be entitled to participate in such Purchase Right to such extent (or beneficial ownership of such shares of Common Stock as a result of such Purchase Right to such extent) and such Purchase Right to such extent shall be held in abeyance for the Holder until such time, if ever, as its right thereto would not result in the Holder exceeding the Beneficial Ownership Limitation). c) Pro Rata Distributions . During such time as the Preferred Stock is outstanding, if the Corporation declares or makes any dividend or other distribution of its assets (or rights to acquire its assets) to holders of shares of Common Stock, by way of return of capital or otherwise (including, without limitation, any distribution of cash, stock or other securities, property or options by way of a dividend, spin off, reclassification, corporate rearrangement, scheme of arrangement or other similar transaction (other than any dividend or distribution as to which an adjustment was effected pursuant to Section 7(a)) (a Distribution ), then, in each such case, each Holder shall be entitled to participate in such Distribution to the same extent that the Holder would have participated therein if the Holder had held the number of shares of Common Stock acquirable upon complete conversion of the Preferred Stock (without regard to any limitations on conversion hereof, including without limitation, the Beneficial Ownership Limitation) immediately before the date of which a record is taken for such Distribution, or, if no such record is taken, the date as of which the record holders of shares of Common Stock are to be determined for the participation in such Distribution provided , however , to the extent that the Holder s right to participate in any such Distribution would result in the Holder exceeding the Beneficial Ownership Limitation, then the Holder shall not be entitled to participate in such Distribution to such extent (or in the beneficial ownership of any shares of Common Stock as a result of such Distribution to such extent) and the portion of such Distribution shall be held in abeyance for the benefit of the Holder until such time, if ever, as its right thereto would not result in the Holder exceeding the Beneficial Ownership Limitation). d) Fundamental Transaction . If, at any time while the Preferred Stock is outstanding, (i) the Corporation, directly or indirectly, in one or more related transactions effects any merger or consolidation of the Corporation with or into another Person, (ii) the Corporation (and all of its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole), directly or indirectly, effects any sale, lease, license, assignment, transfer, conveyance or other disposition of all or substantially all of its assets in one or a series of related transactions, (iii) any, direct or indirect, purchase offer, tender offer or exchange offer (whether by the Corporation or another Person) is completed pursuant to which holders of Common Stock are permitted to sell, tender or exchange their shares for other securities, cash or property and has been accepted by the holders of 50 or more of the outstanding Common Stock, (iv) the 
 14 

Corporation, directly or indirectly, in one or more related transactions effects any reclassification, reorganization or recapitalization of the Common Stock or any compulsory share exchange pursuant to which the Common Stock is effectively converted into or exchanged for other securities, cash or property, or (v) the Corporation, directly or indirectly, in one or more related transactions consummates a stock or share purchase agreement or other business combination (including, without limitation, a reorganization, recapitalization, spin-off or scheme of arrangement) with another Person whereby such other Person acquires more than 50 of the outstanding shares of Common Stock (not including any shares of Common Stock held by the other Person or other Persons making or party to, or associated or affiliated with the other Persons making or party to, such stock or share purchase agreement or other business combination) (each a Fundamental Transaction ), then, upon any subsequent conversion of the Preferred Stock, the Holder shall have the right to receive, for each Conversion Share that would have been issuable upon such conversion immediately prior to the occurrence of such Fundamental Transaction (without regard to any limitation in Section 6(d) on the conversion of the Preferred Stock), the number of shares of Common Stock of the successor or acquiring corporation or of the Corporation, if it is the surviving corporation, and any additional consideration (the Alternate Consideration receivable as a result of such Fundamental Transaction by a holder of the number of shares of Common Stock for which the Preferred Stock is convertible immediately prior to such Fundamental Transaction (without regard to any limitation in Section 6(d) on the conversion of the Preferred Stock). For purposes of any such conversion, the determination of the Conversion Price shall be appropriately adjusted to apply to such Alternate Consideration based on the amount of Alternate Consideration issuable in respect of one share of Common Stock in such Fundamental Transaction, and the Corporation shall apportion the Conversion Price among the Alternate Consideration in a reasonable manner reflecting the relative value of any different components of the Alternate Consideration. If holders of Common Stock are given any choice as to the securities, cash or property to be received in a Fundamental Transaction, then the Holder shall be given the same choice as to the Alternate Consideration it receives upon any conversion of the Preferred Stock following such Fundamental Transaction. To the extent necessary to effectuate the foregoing provisions, any successor to the Corporation or surviving entity in such Fundamental Transaction shall file a new Certificate of Designation with the same terms and conditions and issue to the Holders new preferred stock consistent with the foregoing provisions and evidencing the Holders right to convert such preferred stock into Alternate Consideration. The Corporation shall cause any successor entity in a Fundamental Transaction in which the Corporation is not the survivor (the Successor Entity to assume in writing all of the obligations of the Corporation under this Certificate of Designation and the other Transaction Documents in accordance with the provisions of this Section 7(d) pursuant to written agreements in customary form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Holder and approved by the Holder (without unreasonable delay) prior to such Fundamental Transaction and shall, at the option of the Holder, deliver to the Holder in exchange for the Preferred Stock a security of the Successor Entity evidenced by a written instrument substantially similar in form and substance to the Preferred Stock which is convertible for a corresponding number of shares of capital stock of such Successor Entity (or its parent entity) equivalent to the shares of 
 15 

Common Stock acquirable and receivable upon conversion of the Preferred Stock (without regard to any limitations on the conversion of the Preferred Stock) prior to such Fundamental Transaction, and with a conversion price which applies the conversion price hereunder to such shares of capital stock (but taking into account the relative value of the shares of Common Stock pursuant to such Fundamental Transaction and the value of such shares of capital stock, such number of shares of capital stock and such conversion price being for the purpose of protecting the economic value of the Preferred Stock immediately prior to the consummation of such Fundamental Transaction), and which is reasonably satisfactory in form and substance to the Holder. Upon the occurrence of any such Fundamental Transaction, the Successor Entity shall succeed to, and be substituted for (so that from and after the date of such Fundamental Transaction, the provisions of this Certificate of Designation and the other Transaction Documents referring to the Corporation shall refer instead to the Successor Entity), and may exercise every right and power of the Corporation and shall assume all of the obligations of the Corporation under this Certificate of Designation and the other Transaction Documents with the same effect as if such Successor Entity had been named as the Corporation herein. e) Calculations . All calculations under this Section 7 shall be made to the nearest cent or the nearest 1/100th of a share, as the case may be. For purposes of this Section 7, the number of shares of Common Stock deemed to be issued and outstanding as of a given date shall be the sum of the number of shares of Common Stock (excluding any treasury shares of the Corporation) issued and outstanding. f) Notice to the Holders . i. Adjustment to Conversion Price . Whenever the Conversion Price is adjusted pursuant to any provision of this Section 7, the Corporation shall promptly deliver to each Holder by email a notice setting forth the Conversion Price after such adjustment and setting forth a brief statement of the facts requiring such adjustment, provided that the failure to deliver such notice or any defect therein or in the delivery thereof shall not affect the validity of the adjustment required to be specified in such notice. ii. Notice to Allow Conversion by Holder . If (A) the Corporation shall declare a dividend (or any other distribution in whatever form) on the Common Stock, (B) the Corporation shall declare a special nonrecurring cash dividend on the Common Stock or shall repurchase the Common Stock, (C) the Corporation shall authorize the granting to all holders of the Common Stock in their capacities as such rights or warrants to subscribe for or purchase any shares of capital stock of any class or of any rights, (D) the approval of any stockholders of the Corporation shall be required in connection with any reclassification of the Common Stock, any consolidation or merger to which the Corporation is a party, any sale or transfer of all or substantially all of the assets of the Corporation (and all of its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole), or any compulsory share exchange whereby the Common Stock is converted into other securities, cash or property or (E) the Corporation shall 
 16 

authorize the voluntary or involuntary dissolution, liquidation or winding up of the affairs of the Corporation, then, in each case, the Corporation shall email to each Holder at its last email address as it shall appear upon the stock ledger of the Corporation, at least twenty (20) calendar days prior to the applicable record or effective date hereinafter specified, a notice stating (x) the date on which a record is to be taken for the purpose of such dividend, distribution, redemption, rights or warrants, or if a record is not to be taken, the date as of which the holders of the Common Stock of record to be entitled to such dividend, distributions, redemption, rights or warrants are to be determined or (y) the date on which such reclassification, consolidation, merger, sale, transfer or share exchange is expected to become effective or close, and the date as of which it is expected that holders of the Common Stock shall be entitled to exchange their shares of the Common Stock for securities, cash or other property deliverable upon such reclassification, consolidation, merger, sale, transfer or share exchange, provided that the failure to deliver such notice or any defect therein or in the delivery thereof shall not affect the validity of the corporate action required to be specified in such notice. To the extent that any notice provided hereunder constitutes, or contains, material, non public information regarding the Corporation or any of the Subsidiaries, the Corporation shall simultaneously file such notice with the Commission pursuant to a Current Report on Form 8-K. The Holder shall remain entitled to convert its Preferred Stock (or any part hereof) during the 20-day period commencing on the date of such notice through the effective date of the event triggering such notice except as may otherwise be expressly set forth herein.

The Mandatory Conversion hereunder shall not be effective unless all of the Equity Conditions are met (unless waived in writing by a Holder with respect to such Holder) on the Mandatory Conversion Notice Date through and including the Mandatory Conversion Date. For purposes of clarification, a Mandatory Conversion shall be subject to all of the provisions of Section 6, including, without limitation, Section 6(d) and the provision requiring payment of liquidated damages. If any of the Equity Conditions shall cease to be satisfied at any time on or after 
 17 

the Mandatory Conversion Notice Date through and including the actual delivery of all of the Conversion Shares to the Holders, a Holder may elect to nullify the Mandatory Conversion as to such Holder by notice to the Corporation within two (2) Trading Days after the first day on which any such Equity Condition has not been satisfied (provided that if, by a provision of the Transaction Documents, the Corporation is obligated to notify the Holders of the non-existence of an Equity Condition, such notice period shall be extended to the second Trading Day after proper notice from the Corporation) in which case the Mandatory Conversion shall be null and void, ab initio .

The Corporation may not deliver a Forced Conversion Notice, and any Forced Conversion Notice delivered by the Corporation shall not be effective, unless all of the Equity Conditions have been met on the Forced Conversion Notice Date through and including the later of the Forced Conversion Date and the Trading Day after the date that the Conversion Shares issuable pursuant to such conversion are actually delivered to the Holders pursuant to the Forced Conversion Notice. Any Forced Conversion Notices shall be applied ratably to all of the Holders still holding shares of Preferred Stock based on each such Holder s initial purchases of Preferred Stock hereunder, provided that any voluntary conversions by a Holder shall be applied against such Holder s pro rata allocation, thereby decreasing the aggregate amount forcibly converted hereunder if less than all shares of the Preferred Stock are forcibly converted. For purposes of clarification, a Forced Conversion shall be subject to all of the provisions of Section 6, including, without limitation, the provisions requiring payment of liquidated damages and Section 6(d) on Beneficial Ownership Limitation on conversion.

 8 

Preferred Stock certificate delivered to the Corporation and the Holder shall promptly return to the Corporation the Conversion Shares issued to such Holder pursuant to the rescinded Notice of Conversion. iii. Obligation Absolute; Partial Liquidated Damages . The Corporation s obligation to issue and deliver the Conversion Shares upon conversion of Preferred Stock in accordance with the terms hereof are absolute and unconditional, irrespective of any action or inaction by a Holder to enforce the same, any waiver or consent with respect to any provision hereof, the recovery of any judgment against any Person or any action to enforce the same, or any setoff, counterclaim, recoupment, limitation or termination, or any breach or alleged breach by such Holder or any other Person of any obligation to the Corporation or any violation or alleged violation of law by such Holder or any other person, and irrespective of any other circumstance which might otherwise limit such obligation of the Corporation to such Holder in connection with the issuance of such Conversion Shares; provided , however , that such delivery shall not operate as a waiver by the Corporation of any such action that the Corporation may have against such Holder. In the event a Holder shall elect to convert any or all of its Preferred Stock, the Corporation may not refuse conversion based on any claim that such Holder or any Person associated or affiliated with such Holder has been engaged in any violation of law, agreement or for any other reason, unless an injunction from a court, on notice to Holder, restraining and/or enjoining conversion of all or part of the Preferred Stock of such Holder shall have been sought and obtained, and the Corporation posts a surety bond for the benefit of such Holder in the amount of 150 of the Stated Value of Preferred Stock which is subject to the injunction, which bond shall remain in effect until the completion of arbitration/litigation of the underlying dispute and the proceeds of which shall be payable to such Holder to the extent it obtains judgment in its favor. In the absence of such injunction, the Corporation shall issue Conversion Shares and, if applicable, cash, upon a properly noticed conversion. If the Corporation fails to deliver to a Holder such Conversion Shares pursuant to Section 6(c)(i) by the Share Delivery Date applicable to such conversion, the Corporation shall pay to such Holder, in cash, as liquidated damages and not as a penalty, for each 5,000 of Stated Value of Preferred Stock being converted, 10 per Trading Day (increasing to 20 per Trading Day on the fifth Trading Day after the Share Delivery Date and increasing to 50 per Trading Day on the tenth Trading Day after the Share Delivery Date) for each Trading Day after the Share Delivery Date until such Conversion Shares are delivered or Holder rescinds such conversion. Nothing herein shall limit a Holder s right to pursue actual damages for the Corporation s failure to deliver Conversion Shares within the period specified herein and such Holder shall have the right to pursue all remedies available to it hereunder, at law or in equity including, without limitation, a decree of specific performance and/or injunctive relief. The exercise of any such rights shall not prohibit a Holder from seeking to enforce damages pursuant to any other Section hereof or under applicable law. 
 9 

iv. Compensation for Buy-In on Failure to Timely Deliver Conversion Shares Upon Conversion . In addition to any other rights available to the Holder, if the Corporation fails for any reason to deliver to a Holder the applicable Conversion Shares by the Share Delivery Date pursuant to Section 6(c)(i), and if after such Share Delivery Date such Holder is required by its brokerage firm to purchase (in an open market transaction or otherwise), or the Holder s brokerage firm otherwise purchases, shares of Common Stock to deliver in satisfaction of a sale by such Holder of the Conversion Shares which such Holder was entitled to receive upon the conversion relating to such Share Delivery Date (a Buy-In ), then the Corporation shall (A) pay in cash to such Holder (in addition to any other remedies available to or elected by such Holder) the amount, if any, by which (x) such Holder s total purchase price (including any brokerage commissions) for the Common Stock so purchased exceeds (y) the product of (1) the aggregate number of shares of Common Stock that such Holder was entitled to receive from the conversion at issue multiplied by (2) the actual sale price at which the sell order giving rise to such purchase obligation was executed (including any brokerage commissions) and (B) at the option of such Holder, either reissue (if surrendered) the shares of Preferred Stock equal to the number of shares of Preferred Stock submitted for conversion (in which case, such conversion shall be deemed rescinded) or deliver to such Holder the number of shares of Common Stock that would have been issued if the Corporation had timely complied with its delivery requirements under Section 6(c)(i). For example, if a Holder purchases shares of Common Stock having a total purchase price of 11,000 to cover a Buy-In with respect to an attempted conversion of shares of Preferred Stock with respect to which the actual sale price of the Conversion Shares (including any brokerage commissions) giving rise to such purchase obligation was a total of 10,000 under clause (A) of the immediately preceding sentence, the Corporation shall be required to pay such Holder 1,000. The Holder shall provide the Corporation written notice indicating the amounts payable to such Holder in respect of the Buy-In and, upon request of the Corporation, evidence of the amount of such loss. Nothing herein shall limit a Holder s right to pursue any other remedies available to it hereunder, at law or in equity including, without limitation, a decree of specific performance and/or injunctive relief with respect to the Corporation s failure to timely deliver the Conversion Shares upon conversion of the shares of Preferred Stock as required pursuant to the terms hereof. v. Reservation of Shares Issuable Upon Conversion . From and after the Reverse Stock Split Date and until no shares of the Preferred Stock remain outstanding, the Corporation covenants that it will at all times reserve and keep available out of its authorized and unissued shares of Common Stock for the sole purpose of issuance upon conversion of the Preferred Stock as herein provided, free from preemptive rights or any other actual contingent purchase rights of Persons other than the Holder (and the other holders of the Preferred Stock), not less than such aggregate number of shares of the Common Stock as shall (subject to the terms and conditions set forth in the Purchase Agreement) be issuable (taking into account 
 10 

the adjustments and restrictions of Section 7) upon the conversion of the then outstanding shares of Preferred Stock. The Corporation covenants that following the Reverse Stock Split Date, all shares of Common Stock that shall be so issuable shall, upon issue, be duly authorized, validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable. vi. Fractional Shares. No fractional shares or scrip representing fractional shares shall be issued upon the conversion of the Preferred Stock. As to any fraction of a share which the Holder would otherwise be entitled to upon such conversion, the Corporation shall at its election, either pay a cash adjustment in respect of such final fraction in an amount equal to such fraction multiplied by the Conversion Price or round up to the next whole share. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, but consistent with the provisions of this subsection with respect to fractional Conversion Shares, nothing shall prevent any Holder from converting fractional shares of Preferred Stock. vii. Transfer Taxes and Expenses. The issuance of Conversion Shares on conversion of the Preferred Stock shall be made without charge to any Holder for any documentary stamp or similar taxes that may be payable in respect of the issue or delivery of such Conversion Shares, provided that the Corporation shall not be required to pay any tax that may be payable in respect of any transfer involved in the issuance and delivery of any such Conversion Shares upon conversion in a name other than that of the Holder of such shares of Preferred Stock and the Corporation shall not be required to issue or deliver such Conversion Shares unless or until the Person or Persons requesting the issuance thereof shall have paid to the Corporation the amount of such tax or shall have established to the satisfaction of the Corporation that such tax has been paid. The Corporation shall pay all Transfer Agent fees required for same-day processing of any Notice of Conversion and all fees to the Depository Trust Company (or another established clearing corporation performing similar functions) required for same-day electronic delivery of the Conversion Shares. d) Beneficial Ownership Limitation. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth herein, the Corporation shall not effect any conversion of the Preferred Stock, and a Holder shall not have the right to convert any portion of the Preferred Stock, to the extent that, after giving effect to the conversion set forth on the applicable Notice of Conversion, such Holder (together with such Holder s Affiliates, and any Persons acting as a group together with such Holder or any of such Holder s Affiliates (such Persons, Attribution Parties )) would beneficially own in excess of the Beneficial Ownership Limitation (as defined below). For purposes of the foregoing sentence, the number of shares of Common Stock beneficially owned by such Holder and its Affiliates and Attribution Parties shall include the number of shares of Common Stock issuable upon conversion of the Preferred Stock with respect to which such determination is being made, but shall exclude the number of shares of Common Stock which are issuable upon (i) conversion of the remaining, unconverted Preferred Stock beneficially owned by such Holder or any of its Affiliates or Attribution Parties and (ii) exercise or conversion of the unexercised or unconverted 
 11 

portion of any other securities of the Corporation subject to a limitation on conversion or exercise analogous to the limitation contained herein (including, without limitation, the Preferred Stock) beneficially owned by such Holder or any of its Affiliates or Attribution Parties. Except as set forth in the preceding sentence, for purposes of this Section 6(d), beneficial ownership shall be calculated in accordance with Section 13(d) of the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder. To the extent that the limitation contained in this Section 6(d) applies, the determination of whether the Preferred Stock is convertible (in relation to other securities owned by such Holder together with any Affiliates and Attribution Parties) and of how many shares of Preferred Stock are convertible shall be in the sole discretion of such Holder, and the submission of a Notice of Conversion shall be deemed to be such Holder s determination of whether the shares of Preferred Stock may be converted (in relation to other securities owned by such Holder together with any Affiliates and Attribution Parties) and how many shares of the Preferred Stock are convertible, in each case subject to the Beneficial Ownership Limitation. To ensure compliance with this restriction, each Holder will be deemed to represent to the Corporation each time it delivers a Notice of Conversion that such Notice of Conversion has not violated the restrictions set forth in this paragraph and the Corporation shall have no obligation to verify or confirm the accuracy of such determination. In addition, a determination as to any group status as contemplated above shall be determined in accordance with Section 13(d) of the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder. The Holder understands and acknowledges that the Corporation is not representing to the Holder that the calculations and determinations set forth in this Section 6(d) are in compliance with Section 13(d) of the Exchange Act and the Holder is solely responsible for any schedules required to be filed in accordance therewith. For purposes of this Section 6(d), in determining the number of outstanding shares of Common Stock, a Holder may rely on the number of outstanding shares of Common Stock as stated in the most recent of the following: (i) the Corporation s most recent periodic or annual report filed with the Commission, as the case may be, (ii) a more recent public announcement by the Corporation or (iii) a more recent written notice by the Corporation or the Transfer Agent setting forth the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding. Upon the written or oral request (which may be via email) of a Holder, the Corporation shall within one Trading Day confirm orally and in writing to such Holder the number of shares of Common Stock then outstanding. In any case, the number of outstanding shares of Common Stock shall be determined after giving effect to the conversion or exercise of securities of the Corporation, including the Preferred Stock, by such Holder or its Affiliates or Attribution Parties since the date as of which such number of outstanding shares of Common Stock was reported. The Beneficial Ownership Limitation shall be 4.99 (or, upon election by a Holder prior to the issuance of any shares of Preferred Stock, 9.99 of the number of shares of the Common Stock outstanding immediately after giving effect to the issuance of shares of Common Stock issuable upon conversion of Preferred Stock held by the applicable Holder. A Holder, upon notice to the Corporation submitted in writing (which may be via email) to the Secretary of the Corporation, may increase or decrease the Beneficial Ownership Limitation provisions of this Section 6(d) applicable to its Preferred Stock provided that the Beneficial Ownership Limitation in no event exceeds 9.99 of the number of shares of the Common 
 12 

Stock outstanding immediately after giving effect to the issuance of shares of Common Stock upon conversion of the Preferred Stock held by the Holder and the provisions of this Section 6(d) shall continue to apply. Any such increase in the Beneficial Ownership Limitation will not be effective until the 61 st day after such notice is delivered to the Corporation and shall only apply to such Holder and no other Holder. The Beneficial Ownership Limitation shall not be waived by the Corporation or the Holder. The provisions of this paragraph shall be construed and implemented in a manner otherwise than in strict conformity with the terms of this Section 6(d) to correct this paragraph (or any portion hereof) which may be defective or inconsistent with the intended Beneficial Ownership Limitation contained herein or to make changes or supplements necessary or desirable to properly give effect to such limitation. The limitations contained in this paragraph shall apply to a successor holder of Preferred Stock. Section 7 . Certain Adjustments . a) Stock Dividends and Stock Splits . If the Corporation, at any time while the Preferred Stock is outstanding: (i) pays a stock dividend or otherwise makes a distribution or distributions payable in shares of Common Stock on shares of Common Stock or any other Common Stock Equivalents (which, for avoidance of doubt, shall not include any shares of Common Stock issued by the Corporation upon conversion of, or payment of a dividend on, the Preferred Stock), (ii) subdivides outstanding shares of Common Stock into a larger number of shares, (iii) combines (including by way of a reverse stock split, including the Reverse Stock Split) outstanding shares of Common Stock into a smaller number of shares, or (iv) issues, in the event of a reclassification of shares of the Common Stock, any shares of capital stock of the Corporation, then the Conversion Price shall be multiplied by a fraction of which the numerator shall be the number of shares of Common Stock (excluding any treasury shares of the Corporation) outstanding immediately before such event, and of which the denominator shall be the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately after such event. Any adjustment made pursuant to this Section 7(a) shall become effective immediately after the record date for the determination of stockholders entitled to receive such dividend or distribution and shall become effective immediately after the effective date in the case of a subdivision, combination or re-classification. b) Subsequent Rights Offerings . In addition to any adjustments pursuant to Section 7(a) above, if at any time the Corporation grants, issues or sells any Common Stock Equivalents or rights to purchase stock, warrants, securities or other property pro rata to the record holders of any class of shares of Common Stock (the Purchase Rights ), then each Holder will be entitled to acquire, upon the terms applicable to such Purchase Rights, the aggregate Purchase Rights which the Holder could have acquired if the Holder had held the number of shares of Common Stock acquirable upon complete conversion of such Holder s Preferred Stock (without regard to any limitations on exercise hereof, including without limitation, the Beneficial Ownership Limitation) immediately before the date on which a record is taken for the grant, issuance or sale of such Purchase Rights, or, if no such record is taken, the date as of which the record holders of shares of Common Stock

If (a) at any time after the receipt of Stockholder Approval, the Corporation fails to electronically deliver (or cause its transfer agent to electronically deliver) the Conversion Shares to which a Holder is otherwise entitled pursuant to Section 6.4.1 on or prior to the second (2nd) Trading Day after the Share Delivery Date (other than due to a failure caused by (i) incorrect or incomplete information provided by a Holder to the Corporation or (ii) the application of the Beneficial Ownership Limitation), or (b) if Stockholder Approval is not obtained within six (6) months after the initial issuance of the Series G Non-Voting Preferred Stock, then, the Corporation shall, at such request of the Holder, to the extent permitted by applicable law, pay an amount equal to the Fair Value (as defined below) of such undelivered Conversion Shares to such Holder, with such payment to be made within two Business Days from the date of request by such Holder, whereupon the Corporation s obligations to deliver such Conversion Shares issuable upon the Automatic Conversion or underlying the Notice of Conversion shall be extinguished upon payment in full of the Fair Value of such undelivered shares. For purposes of this Section 6.4.3, the Fair Value of shares shall be fixed with reference to the last reported Closing Sale Price on the principal Trading Market on which the Common Stock is listed as of the Trading Day immediately prior to, in the case of the Automatic Conversion, the date of the Stockholder Approval, and in the case of an Optional Conversion, the Optional Conversion Date. For the avoidance of doubt, the cash settlement provisions set forth in this Section 6.4.3 shall be available irrespective of the reason for the Corporation s failure to timely deliver Conversion Shares (other than due to a failure caused by (i) incorrect or incomplete information provided by Holder to the Corporation or (ii) the application of the Beneficial Ownership Limitation), including due to limitations set forth in Section 6.4.5 or due to applicable Trading Market rules. 6.4.4 Buy-In on Failure to Timely Deliver Certificates Upon Conversion . If the Corporation fails to deliver to a Holder the applicable certificate or certificates or to provide documentation of book entry form, as applicable, by the Share Delivery Date pursuant to Section 6.4.1 (other than a failure caused by incorrect or incomplete information provided by Holder to the Corporation or the application of the Beneficial Ownership Limitation), and if after such Share Delivery Date such Holder is required by its brokerage firm to purchase (in an open market transaction or otherwise), or the Holder s brokerage firm otherwise purchases, shares of Common Stock to deliver in satisfaction of a sale by such Holder of the Conversion Shares which such Holder was entitled to receive upon the conversion relating to such Share Delivery Date (a Buy In ), then, at the option and election of such Holder in its sole discretion, the Corporation shall 
 -8- 

(A) pay in cash to such Holder (in addition to any other remedies available to and elected by such Holder to the extent such other remedies do not result in a recovery in excess of such Holder s applicable damages) the amount by which (x) such Holder s total purchase price (including any brokerage commissions) for the shares of Common Stock so purchased exceeds (y) the product of (1) the aggregate number of shares of Common Stock that such Holder was entitled to receive from the conversion at issue multiplied by (2) the actual sale price at which the sell order giving rise to such purchase obligation was executed (including any brokerage commissions), in which case any such cash payment by the Corporation shall satisfy and extinguish the Corporation s obligation to issue and deliver to such Holder the Conversion Shares which such Holder was entitled to receive upon the conversion relating to such Share Delivery Date, and (B) shall deliver to such Holder the number of shares of Common Stock that would have been issued if the Corporation had timely complied with its delivery requirements under Section 6.4.1 . For example, if a Holder effects a Buy-In by purchasing shares of Common Stock having a total purchase price of 11,000 to cover an attempted conversion of shares of Series G Non-Voting Preferred Stock with respect to which the actual sale price (including any brokerage commissions) giving rise to such purchase obligation was a total of 10,000 under clause (A) of the immediately preceding sentence, the Corporation shall be required to pay such Holder 1,000. The Holder shall provide the Corporation written notice, within three (3) Trading Days after the occurrence of a Buy-In, indicating the amounts payable to such Holder in respect of such Buy-In together with applicable confirmations and other evidence reasonably requested by the Corporation. Nothing herein shall limit a Holder s right to pursue any other remedies available to it hereunder, at law or in equity including, without limitation, a decree of specific performance and/or injunctive relief with respect to the Corporation s failure to timely deliver a certificate or certificates representing, or to provide documentation of book entry form of, shares of Common Stock upon conversion of the shares of Series G Non-Voting Preferred Stock as required pursuant to the terms hereof or the cash settlement remedy set forth in Section 6.4.3; provided, however , that such Holder shall not be entitled any recoveries in excess of the amount of such Holder s damages or losses from such failure by the Corporation. 6.4.5 Reservation of Shares Issuable Upon Conversion . The Corporation covenants that, contingent upon receipt of Stockholder Approval after the date hereof to increase the Corporation s shares of authorized Common Stock to a number of shares sufficient to be reserved for the conversion of all outstanding shares of Series G Non-Voting Preferred Stock, the Corporation will reserve and keep available out of its authorized and unissued shares of Common Stock for the sole purpose of issuance upon conversion of outstanding shares of Series G Non Voting Preferred Stock, free from preemptive rights or any other actual contingent purchase rights of Persons other than the Holders of the Series G Non-Voting Preferred Stock, not less than such aggregate number of shares of the Common Stock as shall be issuable (taking into account the adjustments of Section 7 upon the conversion of all outstanding shares of Series G Non-Voting Preferred Stock. The Corporation covenants that all shares of Common Stock that shall be so issuable shall, upon issue, be duly authorized, validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable. 6.4.6 Fractional Shares . No fractional shares or scrip representing fractional shares of Common Stock shall be issued upon conversion of the Series G Non-Voting Preferred Stock. In lieu of any fractional shares to which the holder would otherwise be entitled, the Corporation shall pay cash equal to such fraction multiplied by the Closing Sale Price of a share of Common Stock on the applicable conversion date. Whether or not fractional shares would 
 -9- 

be issuable upon such conversion shall be determined on the basis of the total number of shares of Series G Non-Voting Preferred Stock the Holder is at the time converting into Common Stock and the aggregate number of shares of Common Stock issuable upon such conversion. 6.4.7 Transfer Taxes . The delivery of certificates or book-entry documentation representing shares of the Common Stock upon conversion of the Series G Non Voting Preferred Stock shall be made without charge to any Holder for any documentary stamp or similar taxes that may be payable in respect of the delivery of such certificates; provided that the Corporation shall not be required to pay any tax that may be payable in respect of any transfer involved in the delivery of any such certificate, or any registration of book-entry shares, upon conversion in a name other than that of the registered Holder(s) of such shares of Series G Non Voting Preferred Stock and the Corporation shall not be required to deliver such certificates unless or until the Person or Persons requesting the delivery thereof shall have paid to the Corporation the amount of such tax or shall have established to the satisfaction of the Corporation that such tax has been paid. 6.5. Status as Stockholder. Upon each conversion of shares of Series G Non- Voting Preferred Stock, (i) such shares of Series G Non-Voting Preferred Stock being converted shall automatically convert into shares of Common Stock and (ii) the applicable Holder s rights as a holder of such converted shares of Series G Non-Voting Preferred Stock shall cease and terminate, excepting only the right to receive certificates or book-entry documentation for such shares of Common Stock in the manner provided herein and to any remedies provided herein or otherwise available at law or in equity to such Holder because of a failure by the Corporation to comply with the terms of this Certificate of Designation. In all cases, each applicable Holder shall retain all of its rights and remedies for the Corporation s failure to convert Series G Non-Voting Preferred Stock in accordance with terms of this Certificate of Designation. In no event shall the Series G Non-Voting Preferred Stock convert into shares of Common Stock prior to the Stockholder Approval. 7. Certain Adjustments . 7.1. Stock Dividends and Stock Splits . If the Corporation, at any time while any Series G Non-Voting Preferred Stock is outstanding: (A) pays a stock dividend or otherwise makes a distribution or distributions payable in shares of Common Stock (which, for avoidance of doubt, shall not include any shares of Common Stock issued by the Corporation upon conversion of the Series G Non-Voting Preferred Stock) with respect to the then outstanding shares of Common Stock; (B) subdivides outstanding shares of Common Stock into a larger number of shares; or (C) combines (including by way of a reverse stock split) outstanding shares of Common Stock into a smaller number of shares, then the Conversion Ratio shall be multiplied by a fraction of which the numerator shall be the number of shares of Common Stock (excluding any treasury shares of the Corporation) outstanding immediately after such event and of which the denominator shall be the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately before such event (excluding any treasury shares of the Corporation). Any adjustment made pursuant to this Section 7.1 shall become effective immediately after the record date for the determination of stockholders entitled to receive such dividend or distribution and shall become effective immediately after the effective date in the case of a subdivision or combination. 
 -10- 

7.2. Fundamental Transaction . If, at any time while the Series G Non-Voting Preferred Stock is outstanding, (A) the Corporation effects any merger or consolidation of the Corporation with or into another Person or any stock sale to, or other business combination (including, without limitation, a reorganization, recapitalization, spin-off, share exchange or scheme of arrangement) with or into another Person (other than any such transaction in which the Corporation is the surviving or continuing entity and the outstanding shares of its Common Stock are not exchanged for or converted into other securities, cash or property), (B) the Corporation effects any sale, lease, transfer or exclusive license of all or substantially all of its assets in one transaction or a series of related transactions, (C) any tender offer or exchange offer (whether by the Corporation or another Person) is completed pursuant to which more than 50 of the Common Stock not held by the Corporation or such Person is exchanged for or converted into other securities, cash or property, or (D) the Corporation effects any reclassification of the Common Stock or any compulsory share exchange pursuant (other than as a result of a dividend, subdivision or combination covered by Section 7 . 1 above) to which the Common Stock is effectively converted into or exchanged for other securities, cash or property (in any such case, a Fundamental Transaction ), then, upon any subsequent conversion of the Series G Non-Voting Preferred Stock the Holders shall have the right to receive, in lieu of the right to receive Conversion Shares, for each Conversion Share that would have been issuable upon such conversion immediately prior to the occurrence of such Fundamental Transaction, the same kind and amount of securities, cash or property as it would have been entitled to receive upon the occurrence of such Fundamental Transaction if it had been, immediately prior to such Fundamental Transaction, the holder of one (1) share of Common Stock (the Alternate Consideration ). For purposes of any such subsequent conversion, the determination of the Conversion Ratio shall be appropriately adjusted to apply to such Alternate Consideration based on the amount of Alternate Consideration issuable in respect of one (1) share of Common Stock in such Fundamental Transaction, and the Corporation shall adjust the Conversion Ratio in a reasonable manner reflecting the relative value of any different components of the Alternate Consideration. If holders of Common Stock are given any choice as to the securities, cash or property to be received in a Fundamental Transaction, then the Holders shall be given the same choice as to the Alternate Consideration it receives upon any conversion of the Series G Non-Voting Preferred Stock following such Fundamental Transaction. To the extent necessary to effectuate the foregoing provisions, any successor to the Corporation or surviving entity in such Fundamental Transaction shall file a new certificate of designations with the same terms and conditions and issue to the Holders new preferred stock consistent with the foregoing provisions and evidencing the Holders right to convert such preferred stock into Alternate Consideration. The terms of any agreement to which the Corporation is a party and pursuant to which a Fundamental Transaction is effected shall include terms requiring any such successor or surviving entity to comply with the provisions of this Section 7.2 and insuring that the Series G Non-Voting Preferred Stock (or any such replacement security) will be similarly adjusted upon any subsequent transaction analogous to a Fundamental Transaction. The Corporation shall cause to be delivered to each Holder, at its last address as it shall appear upon the stock books of the Corporation, written notice of any Fundamental Transaction at least twenty (20) calendar days prior to the date on which such Fundamental Transaction is expected to become effective or close. 7.3. Calculations . All calculations under this Section 7 shall be made to the nearest cent or the nearest 1/100th of a share, as the case may be. For purposes of this Section 7 , the number of shares of Common Stock deemed to be issued and outstanding as of a given date 
 -11- 

shall be the sum of the number of shares of Common Stock (excluding any treasury shares of the Corporation) issued and outstanding. 8. Redemption . The shares of Series G Non-Voting Preferred Stock shall not be redeemable at the option of the Corporation or the Holder thereof; provided, however , that the foregoing shall not limit the ability of the Corporation to purchase or otherwise deal in such shares to the extent otherwise permitted hereby and by law, nor shall the foregoing limit the Holder s rights under Section 6.4.3 . 9. Transfer . A Holder may transfer any shares of Series G Non-Voting Preferred Stock, held by such Holder without the consent of the Corporation: provided that such transfer is in compliance with applicable securities laws. The Corporation shall in good faith (i) do and perform, or cause to be done and performed, all such further acts and things, and (ii) execute and deliver all such other agreements, certificates, instruments and documents, in each case, as any Holder may reasonably request in order to carry out the intent and accomplish the purposes of this Section 9 . 10. Series G Non-Voting Preferred Stock Register .

The Corporation may treat the person in whose name any share of Series G Non-Voting Preferred Stock is registered on the register as the owner and holder thereof for all purposes. 11. Notices .

Applicants for a new certificate under such circumstances shall also comply with such other reasonable regulations and procedures and pay such other reasonable third-party costs as the Corporation may prescribe. 14. Waiver . Notwithstanding any provision in this Certificate of Designation to the contrary, any provision contained in this Certificate of Designation and any right of the Holders of Series G Non-Voting Preferred Stock granted under this Certificate of Designation may be waived as to all shares of Series G Non-Voting Preferred Stock (and the Holders thereof) upon the written consent of the Holders of not less than a majority of the shares of Series G Non-Voting Preferred Stock then outstanding, unless a higher percentage is expressly required by the DGCL, in which case the written consent of the Holders of not less than such higher percentage shall be required. 15. Severability . Whenever possible, each provision hereof shall be interpreted in a manner as to be effective and valid under applicable law, but if any provision hereof is held to be prohibited by or invalid under applicable law, then such provision shall be ineffective only to the extent of such prohibition or invalidity, without invalidating or otherwise adversely affecting the remaining provisions hereof. 16. Status of Converted Series G Non-Voting Preferred Stock . If any shares of Series G Non-Voting Preferred Stock shall be converted or repurchased by the Corporation, such shares shall be retired and, upon retirement, resume the status of authorized but unissued shares of preferred stock and shall no longer be designated as Series G Non-Voting Preferred Stock and may be reissued as part of a new series of Preferred Stock to be created by resolution or resolutions of the Board of Directors.
