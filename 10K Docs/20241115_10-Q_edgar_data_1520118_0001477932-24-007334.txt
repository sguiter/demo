Leases Mezzanine Stock-Based Compensation F-8 Table of Contents Revenue Recognition Online sales, net We recognize revenue in accordance with ASC 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers. This standard provides a single comprehensive model to be used in the accounting for revenue arising from contracts with customers, including industry-specific guidance. The standard s stated core principle is that an entity should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. To achieve this core principle, ASC 606 includes provisions within a five-step model that includes identifying the contract with a customer, identifying the performance obligations in the contract, determining the transaction price, allocating the transaction price to the performance obligations, and recognizing revenue when, or as, an entity satisfies a performance obligation. Digital Asset Mining To generate revenue from mining bitcoin, the Company has entered into a digital asset mining pool by executing a contract, as amended from time to time, with the mining pool operator to provide computing power to the mining pool. The contract is terminable at any time by either party without penalty and the Company s enforceable right to compensation only begins when the Company provides computing power to the mining pool operator. In exchange for providing computing power, we are entitled to a Full-Pay-Per-Share payout of Bitcoin based on a contractual formula, which primarily calculates the hash rate provided by us to the mining pool as a percentage of total network hash rate, and other inputs. We are entitled to consideration even if a block is not successfully placed by the mining pool operator. Providing computing power to solve complex cryptographic algorithms in support of the Bitcoin blockchain (in a process known as solving a block is an output of the Company s ordinary activities. The provision of providing such computing power is the only performance obligation in the Company s contracts with the mining pool operator. The transaction consideration the Company receives is net of a contractually agreed upon pool fee percentage charged and kept by the mining pool operator and is noncash, in the form of Bitcoin, which the Company measures at fair value on the date Bitcoin is received. This value is not materially different than the fair value at the moment we meet the performance obligation, which can be recalculated based on the contractual formula. The consideration is variable. The amount of consideration recognized is constrained to the amount of consideration received, which is when it is probable a significant reversal will not occur. There is no significant financing component or risk of a significant revenue reversal in these transactions due to the performance obligations and settlement of the transactions being on a daily basis. F-9 Table of Contents F-10 Table of Contents Net Income (Loss) Per Share Weighted average common stock payable Fair Value of Financial Instruments Assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis We recognize financial instruments under the following fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value into three levels as follows: Level 1: quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities; Level 2: observable inputs other than Level 1, quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar assets and liabilities in markets that are not active, and model-derived prices whose inputs are observable or whose significant value drivers are observable; and Level 3: assets and liabilities whose significant value drivers are unobservable. The fair value hierarchy also requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value. Assets and liabilities measured at fair value are classified in their entirety based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement. The Company will update its assumptions each reporting period based on new developments and record such amounts at fair value based on the revised assumptions until the agreements expire or contingency is resolved, as applicable. F-11 Table of Contents Assets and liabilities not measured at fair value on a recurring basis In addition to assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis, we also measure certain assets and liabilities at fair value on a nonrecurring basis. Our non-financial assets, including goodwill, property and equipment, intangible assets, and operating lease right-of-use assets are measured at fair value when there is an indication of impairment and the carrying amount exceeds the asset s projected undiscounted cash flows. These assets are recorded at fair value only when an impairment charge is recognized. As of September 30, 2024 and June 30, 2024, the fair values of cash, prepaid expenses and other current assets, accounts payable, and accrued expenses approximated their carrying values because of their short-term nature. Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements Reclassifications and the Company had an accumulated deficit of . These conditions raise substantial doubt about the Company's ability to continue as a going concern. The accompanying financial statements have been prepared in conformity with U.S. GAAP, which contemplate continuation of the Company as a going concern and the realization of assets and satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business. The ability of the Company to reach and maintain a successful level of operations is dependent on the execution of management s plans, which include the raising of capital through the debt and/or equity markets, until such time that funds provided by operations are sufficient to fund working capital requirements. If the Company were not to continue as a going concern, it would likely not be able to realize its assets at values comparable to the carrying value or the fair value estimates reflected in the balances set out in the preparation of the financial statements.

Important factors that might cause our actual results to differ materially from the results contemplated by the forward-looking statements are contained in the Risk Factors section of and elsewhere in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended June 30, 2024 filed on September 30, 2024 and in our subsequent filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The following discussion of our results of operations should be read together with our financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this report. GENERAL We were incorporated in the State of Nevada on March 22, 2011 under the name Lightcollar, Inc. In March 2015, we changed our name to EMS Find, Inc. On May 30, 2017, Integrated Ventures, Inc. Integrated Ventures ), a Nevada corporation, was formed as a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company. Pursuant to an Agreement and Plan of Merger dated May 30, 2017, Integrated Ventures was merged into the Company, with the Company being the surviving corporation and changing its name to Integrated Ventures, Inc. In July 2024, the Company formed three wholly-owned subsidiaries, MedWell Direct, LLC MedWell Direct ), MedWell Facilities, LLC MedWell Facilities ), and MedWell USA, LLC MedWell USA ), all of which were organized in the State of Nevada. On August 29, 2024, the Company, through MedWell Direct, consummated its acquisition of 51 of the membership interests of Healthy Lifestyle USA LLC, a Florida limited liability company Healthy Lifestyle ). We are a diversified holdings company that develops, acquires, operates, and invests in unique and profitable businesses. Our business focus is acquiring, launching, and operating companies in the digital asset sector, mainly in digital asset mining and sales of branded mining rigs. Subsequent to June 30, 2024, we strategically entered into the rapidly growing health and wellness sector. Financial Through June 6, 2024, we operated our digital asset mining operations in one hosted facility in Granbury, Texas. The hosting and power purchase agreement for this facility requires the Company to pay monthly a contractual rate per kilowatt hour of electricity consumed in the Company s digital asset mining operations. As of June 7, 2024, all miners were disconnected from their power source and have not been reconnected through the date of the issuance of these financial statements. During the three months ended September 30, 2024, the Company began online sales of health and wellness products and services through the Company s websites, including prescription drugs and medical consultation services and post-consultation service support provided by Affiliated Medical Groups. Revenues from digital asset mining operations were 0 and 1,059,064 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Revenues from online sales were 1,148 and 0 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. 3 Table of Contents When funds are available and market conditions allow, we also invest in certain denominations of digital assets to complement our mining operations. As of September 30, 2024, our digital assets at fair value totaled 172,992 and were comprised of Bitcoin (BTC). Historically, we have funded our operations primarily from cash generated from our digital asset mining operations and proceeds from convertible notes payable and preferred stock. During the three months ended September 30, 2024, the Company s digital asset mining operations remained disconnected but we were able to fund operations by selling Bitcoin on hand as of June 30, 2024 for cash. During the three months ended September 30, 2024, we generated negative cash flow from operations. We did not incur additional debt or issue securities for cash. Recent Material Developments On June 6, 2024, without notice or demand, Mara Holdings, Inc. MARA ), terminated hosting services for all of our miners (approximately 2,500) which were located at MARA s Granbury, Texas facility. According to news reports, MARA disconnected approximately 15,000 miners they were hosting at their Granbury, Texas facility on or around June 6, 2024. At the time our miners were disconnected, we were informed by MARA s other hosting clients that the facility was no longer interested in providing hosting services for third parties and was planning to undergo infrastructure upgrades, related to noise complaints from local residents. Thus, the Company s miners were disconnected and removed from the mining containers, palletized and stored in MARA s warehouse. Later, MARA requested that the Company sign a termination agreement, which the Company did not sign. As this appears to be an intentional breach of our valid hosting agreement, in October 2024, the Company engaged legal counsel to negotiate a resolution with MARA, including exploring various remedies available to us. Given the uncertainty and timing of our dispute with MARA and the age and efficiency of our miners, it is uncertain if or when the Company will be able to reconnect these miners. Once our miners are released, the Company intends to sell them and purchase newer models, such as Antiminer S21 or Whatsminer M66. Acquisition of Healthy Lifestyle On August 29, 2024, Integrated Ventures, Inc., through MedWell Direct, a Nevada limited liability company and a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, consummated its acquisition of 51 of the membership interests of Healthy Lifestyle USA LLC, a Florida limited liability company Healthy Lifestyle ), pursuant to execution and delivery of that certain membership interest purchase agreement, dated as of August 14, 2024 (the Purchase Agreement ), between MedWell Direct, Healthy Lifestyle, and the members (the Selling Members of Healthy Lifestyle. The purchase price for the Membership Interests was 350,000, consisting of 250,000 in cash and 97,087 shares of the Company s common stock (the Purchase Shares with a market value of 100,000. The number of Purchased Shares was based on the 1.03 closing price of the Company s common stock on the OTCQB marketplace on August 28, 2024, the date immediately preceding the closing date. The Selling Members are also entitled to a potential post-closing earn-out payment based on Healthy Lifestyle s financial performance. Financial Operations Review We are incurring increased costs because of being a publicly traded company. As a public company, we incur significant legal, accounting, and other expenses that we did not incur as a private company. We also have paid compensation through the issuance of shares of our common stock, Series B preferred stock and warrants, the valuation of which has resulted in significant stock-based compensation. In addition, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, as well as new rules subsequently implemented by the Securities and Exchange Commission, have required changes in corporate governance practices of public companies and will require us to comply with these rules. These new rules and regulations have will increase our legal and financial compliance costs and have made some activities more time-consuming and costlier. In addition, these new rules and regulations have made it more difficult and more expensive for us to obtain director and officer liability insurance, which we currently cannot afford to do. As a result of the new rules, it may become more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified persons to serve on our Board of Directors or as executive officers. We cannot predict or estimate the amount of additional costs we may incur as a result of being a public company or the timing of such costs. 4 Table of Contents RESULTS OF OPERATIONS THREE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2024 COMPARED TO THE THREE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2023 Revenues Our digital asset mining revenues decreased to 0 during the three months ended September 30, 2024 from 1,059,064 during the three months ended September 30, 2023. This decrease was a result of the Company s miners being disconnected from their power source on June 6, 2024. Our online sales revenues increased to 1,148 during the three months ended September 30, 2024 from 0 during the three months ended September 30, 2023. This increase was a result of the Company beginning online sales of health and wellness products and services after their acquisition of 51 of Healthy Lifestyle in August 2024. Cost of Revenues Cost of revenues energy, hosting, and other was 0 and 839,811 in the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Expenses associated with running our digital asset mining operations, such as energy and hosting costs, operating supplies, and consulting services are recorded as cost of revenues energy, hosting, and other. The decrease in cost of revenues energy, hosting, and other was a result of the Company s miners being disconnected from their power source on June 6, 2024. Cost of revenues online products was 388 and 0 in the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Expenses associated with fulfilling orders placed by our online sales customers are recorded as cost of revenues online products. The increase in cost of revenues online products was a result of the Company beginning online sales of health and wellness products and services after their acquisition of 51 of Healthy Lifestyle in August 2024. General and administrative expenses decreased to 335,214 in the three months ended September 30, 2024 from 8,489,017 in three months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease resulted primarily from non-cash stock-based compensation expense. We reported non-cash, related party stock-based compensation of 0 and 8,300,000 in the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Depreciation and amortization decreased to 483,700 in the three months ended September 30, 2024 from 733,564 in the three months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease resulted primarily from a reduction in the cost basis of the Company s digital asset miners. Change in fair value of Bitcoin increased to a 19,538 gain for the three months ended September 30, 2024 from a 60,325 loss in the three months ended September 30, 2023. The gain recognized in the current period was attributable to increases in the price of Bitcoin and the loss recognized in the prior period was attributable to decreases in the price of Bitcoin. In addition to the digital assets received as compensation for our mining services, we purchased various digital assets totaling 1,160,102 and 0 during the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. We also converted digital assets from one denomination to another based on our assessment of market conditions for each respective digital asset. The market values of individual digital asset denominations continually fluctuate, and the fluctuations may be material from day to day. During the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, we received total proceeds of 2,449,448 and 766,544, respectively, from the sale of digital assets and incurred transactions fees totaling 13,019 and 11,637, respectively, which are recorded in General and administrative expenses in our Statement of Operations. We realized a loss on sale of digital assets of 271,276 and realized a gain of 6,806 in the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. 5 Table of Contents During the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, we did not report any gain or loss on the disposal of property and equipment and impaired mining equipment and recognized impairment expense of 103,410 and 0, respectively. Other Income (Expense) Our other income (expense) was comprised of the following for the three months ended September 30: Three Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 Interest expense (13,060 (23,030 Loss on settlement of payables (56,887 - Total other income (expense) (69,947 (23,030 During the three months ended September 30, 2023, we had one note payable outstanding for 500,000 which accrued interest at 18 per annum. During the three months ended September 30, 2024, we had the same note payable outstanding with a reduced interest rate of 10 per annum (agreed to by the lender effective April 1, 2024), thus resulting in a decrease in interest expense compared to the prior period. During the three months ended September, 2024 and 2023, we recognized a 56,887 and 0 loss on settlement of payables with a third-party vendor. Net Loss Attributable to shareholders As a result, during the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, we reported a net loss attributable to shareholders of 1,216,047 and 9,287,674, respectively. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Overview As of September, 2024, we had total current assets of 1,763,477, including cash of 749,745 and prepaid expenses and other current assets of 1,013,732 and total current liabilities of 3,739,160. We had total stockholders deficit of 4,523,969 as of September 30, 2024 compared to a stockholders deficit of 3,865,451 as of June 30, 2024. Sources and Uses of Cash During the three months ended September 30, 2024, we used cash in operations of 244,885 as a result of our net loss of 1,243,249, non-cash gain on change in fair market value of digital assets of 19,538, realized loss on sale of digital assets of 271,276, lease payments exceeding lease costs of 7,000, other non-cash expenses of 643,997, decrease in receivables of 1,200, and increases in accounts payable of 74,166, accrued expenses of 12,778, and due to related party of 25,413 offset by increases in prepaid expenses of 3,928. During the three months ended September 30, 2023, we used cash in operations of 934,287 as a result of our net loss of 9,079,877, non-cash loss on change in fair market value of digital assets of 60,325, non-cash stock-based compensation-related party of 8,300,000, non-cash realized gain on sale of digital assets of 6,806, other non-cash expenses of 746,378, increases in revenue recognized from Bitcoin mined of 1,059,064, increases in accounts payable of 44,525, accrued expenses of 23,000, and due to related party of 40,997 offset by increases in prepaid expenses of 3,765. 6 Table of Contents During the three months ended September 30, 2024, we provided net cash in investing activities of 936,815, comprised of net proceeds from the sale of digital assets of 2,449,448, cash acquired in acquisition of Healthy Lifestyle of 4,711, cash deposit received from subtenant of 7,500 offset by purchase of 51 interest in Healthy Lifestyle of 250,000, purchase of digital assets of 1,160,102 and purchase of property and equipment of 2,242. During the three months ended September 30, 2023, we provided net cash in investing activities of 780,991, comprised of net proceeds from the sale of digital currencies. During the three months ended September 30, 2024, we had no net cash provided or used in financing. During the three months ended September 30, 2023, we used net cash in financing activities of 47,030, comprised of repayment of related party advance. Going Concern Historically, the Company has reported recurring net losses from operations and used net cash in operating activities. As of September 30, 2024, the Company s current liabilities exceeded its current assets by 1,975,683 had an accumulated deficit of 86,282,782. These conditions raise substantial doubt about the Company's ability to continue as a going concern. The accompanying financial statements have been prepared in conformity with U.S. GAAP, which contemplate continuation of the Company as a going concern and the realization of assets and satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business. The ability of the Company to reach a successful level of operations is dependent on the execution of management s plans, which include the raising of capital through the debt and/or equity markets, until such time that funds provided by operations are sufficient to fund working capital requirements. If the Company were not to continue as a going concern, it would likely not be able to realize its assets at values comparable to the carrying value or the fair value estimates reflected in the balances set out in the preparation of the financial statements. There can be no assurances that the Company will be successful in attaining a profitable level of operations or in generating additional cash from the equity/debt markets or other sources fund its operations. The financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability of assets and classification of assets and liabilities that might be necessary. Should the Company not be successful in its business plan or in obtaining the necessary financing to fund its operations, the Company would need to curtail certain or all operational activities and/or contemplate the sale of its assets, if necessary. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES Our significant accounting policies are disclosed in Note 2 to the accompanying financial statements. The following is a summary of those accounting policies that involve significant estimates and judgment of management. Use of Estimates The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. Because of the use of estimates inherent in the financial reporting process, actual results could differ significantly from those estimates. Digital Assets Digital assets are included in current assets in the Balance Sheets due to the Company s ability to sell bitcoin in a highly liquid marketplace and the sale of bitcoin to fund operating expenses to support operations. The proceeds from the sale of digital assets and the purchase of digital assets are included within investing activities in the accompanying Statement of Cash Flows. Digital Assets awarded to the Company through its mining activities are accounted for in connection with the Company s revenue recognition policy. Following the adoption of ASU 2023-08 effective July 1, 2023, the Company measures digital assets at fair value with changes recognized in operating expenses in the Statement of Comprehensive Income (Loss). The Company tracks its cost basis of digital assets by-wallet in accordance with the first-in-first-out FIFO method of accounting. 7 Table of Contents Property and Equipment Property and equipment, consisting primarily of computer and other cryptocurrency mining equipment (transaction verification servers), is stated at the lower of cost or estimated realizable value and is depreciated when placed into service using the straight-line method over estimated useful lives. Management has assessed the basis of depreciation of these assets and believes they should be depreciated over a three-year period due to technological obsolescence reflecting rapid development of hardware that has faster processing capacity and other factors. Maintenance and repairs are expensed as incurred and improvements are capitalized. Gains or losses on the disposition of property and equipment are recorded upon disposal. During the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, we impaired mining equipment and recognized impairment expense of 103,410 and 0, respectively. Management has determined that the three-year diminishing value best reflects the current expected useful life of transaction verification servers. This assessment takes into consideration the availability of historical data and management s expectations regarding the direction of the industry including potential changes in technology. Management will review this estimate annually and will revise such estimates as and when data becomes available. To the extent that any of the assumptions underlying management s estimate of useful life of its transaction verification servers are subject to revision in a future reporting period, either as a result of changes in circumstances or through the availability of greater quantities of data, then the estimated useful life could change and have a prospective impact on depreciation expense and the carrying amounts of these assets. Intangible Assets The Company accounts for its intangible assets in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB Accounting Standards Codification ASC Subtopic 350-30, General Intangibles Other Than Goodwill. ASC Subtopic 350-30, which requires assets to be measured based on the fair value of the consideration given or the fair value of the assets (or net assets) acquired, whichever is more clearly evident and, thus, more reliably measurable. Under ASC Subtopic 350-30 any intangible asset with a useful life is required to be amortized over that life and the useful life is to be evaluated every reporting period to determine whether events or circumstances warrant a revision to the remaining period of amortization. If the estimate of useful life is changed the remaining carrying amount of the intangible asset is amortized prospectively over the revised remaining useful life. Costs to renew or extend the term of intangible assets are recognized as an expense when incurred. Impairment of Long-Lived Assets All assets, including intangible assets subject to amortization, are reviewed for impairment when changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable in accordance with ASC 350 and ASC 360. If the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the expected undiscounted cash flows of the asset, an impairment charge is recognized equal to the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds fair value or net realizable value. The testing of these intangibles under established guidelines for impairment requires significant use of judgment and assumptions. Changes in forecasted operations and other assumptions could materially affect the estimated fair values. Changes in business conditions could potentially require adjustments to these asset valuations. During the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, we impaired mining equipment and recognized impairment expense of 103,410 and 0, respectively. Goodwill Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the net tangible and intangible assets acquired in a business combination. Goodwill is not amortized but is tested for impairment annually in the fourth quarter or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset may be impaired. The Company operates as one reporting unit. When testing goodwill for impairment, the Company may first perform an optional qualitative assessment. If the Company determines it is not more likely than not the reporting unit s fair value is less than its carrying value, then no further analysis is necessary. If the Company determines that it is more likely than not that the fair value of its reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, then the quantitative impairment test will be performed. Under the quantitative impairment test, if the carrying amount of the Company s reporting unit exceeds its fair value, the Company will recognize an impairment loss in an amount equal to that excess but limited to the total amount of goodwill. Goodwill of 670 thousand was acquired in fiscal year 2025. No goodwill impairment was recorded during the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. 8 Table of Contents Mezzanine Series C and D preferred stock that contain certain default provisions requiring mandatory cash redemption that are outside the control of the Company are recorded as Mezzanine in the accompanying balance sheets. Stock-Based Compensation The Company accounts for all equity-based payments in accordance with ASC Topic 718, Compensation Stock Compensation. ASC Topic 718 requires companies to recognize in the statement of operations the grant-date fair value of stock awards, stock options, warrants and other equity-based compensation issued to employees. The value of the portion of an award that is ultimately expected to vest is recognized as an expense over the requisite service periods using the straight-line attribution method. The fair value of a stock award is recorded at the fair market value of a share of the Company s stock on the grant date. The Company estimates the fair value of stock options and warrants at the grant date by using an appropriate fair value model such as the Black-Scholes option pricing model or multinomial lattice models. The Company accounts for non-employee share-based awards based upon ASC 505-50, Equity-Based Payments to Non-Employees. ASC 505-50 requires the costs of goods and services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments to be recognized using the fair value of the goods and services or the fair value of the equity award, whichever is more reliably measurable. The fair value of the equity award is determined on the measurement date, which is the earlier of the date that a performance commitment is reached or the date that performance is complete. Generally, our awards do not entail performance commitments. When an award vests over time such that performance occurs over multiple reporting periods, we estimate the fair value of the award as of the end of each reporting period and recognize an appropriate portion of the cost based on the fair value on that date. When the award vests, we adjust the cost previously recognized so that the cost ultimately recognized is equivalent to the fair value on the date the performance is complete. Revenue Recognition The following table presents the Company s revenue by revenue source: Three Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 Digital asset mining - 1,059,064 Online sales, net 1,148 - 1,148 1,059,064 We recognize revenue in accordance with ASC 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers. This standard provides a single comprehensive model to be used in the accounting for revenue arising from contracts with customers, including industry-specific guidance. The standard s stated core principle is that an entity should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. To achieve this core principle, ASC 606 includes provisions within a five-step model that includes identifying the contract with a customer, identifying the performance obligations in the contract, determining the transaction price, allocating the transaction price to the performance obligations, and recognizing revenue when, or as, an entity satisfies a performance obligation. 9 Table of Contents Digital Asset Mining To generate revenue from mining bitcoin, the Company has entered into a digital asset mining pool by executing a contract, as amended from time to time, with the mining pool operator to provide computing power to the mining pool. The contract is terminable at any time by either party without penalty and the Company s enforceable right to compensation only begins when the Company provides computing power to the mining pool operator. In exchange for providing computing power, we are entitled to a Full-Pay-Per-Share payout of Bitcoin based on a contractual formula, which primarily calculates the hash rate provided by us to the mining pool as a percentage of total network hash rate, and other inputs. We are entitled to consideration even if a block is not successfully placed by the mining pool operator. Providing computing power to solve complex cryptographic algorithms in support of the Bitcoin blockchain (in a process known as solving a block is an output of the Company s ordinary activities. The provision of providing such computing power is the only performance obligation in the Company s contracts with the mining pool operator. The transaction consideration the Company receives is net of a contractually agreed upon pool fee percentage charged and kept by the mining pool operator and is noncash, in the form of Bitcoin, which the Company measures at fair value on the date Bitcoin is received. This value is not materially different than the fair value at the moment we meet the performance obligation, which can be recalculated based on the contractual formula. The consideration is variable. The amount of consideration recognized is constrained to the amount of consideration received, which is when it is probable a significant reversal will not occur. There is no significant financing component or risk of a significant revenue reversal in these transactions due to the performance obligations and settlement of the transactions being on a daily basis. Online Sales The Company s online sales consist of sales of health and wellness products and services through the Company s websites, including prescription drugs. In contracts that contain prescription products issued as the result of a consultation, revenue also includes medical consultation services and post-consultation service support provided by Affiliated Medical Groups (defined below). The Company defines its customer as an individual who purchases products or services through its websites. The transaction price in the Company s contracts with customers is the total amount of consideration to which the Company expects to be entitled in exchange for transferring products or services to the customer. The Company s contracts that contain prescription products issued as the result of a consultation primarily include the following performance obligations: access to (i) products, as well as medication adjustments, as applicable, and (ii) consultation services, as well as post-consultation service support, as applicable. Revenue is recognized at the time the related performance obligation is satisfied by transferring the promised product to the customer and, in contracts that contain services, by the provision of consultation services to the customer. The Company satisfies its performance obligation for products at a point in time, which is upon delivery of the products to a third-party carrier. The Company satisfies its performance obligation for consultation services typically within one day and for post-consultation service support over the contract term. The customer obtains control of the products and services upon the Company s completion of its performance obligations. For contracts with multiple performance obligations, the transaction price is allocated to each performance obligation on a relative stand-alone selling price basis. The stand-alone selling price is based on market and cost plus estimates. For each of the three months ended September 30, 2024, service revenue represented less than 10 of consolidated revenues. To fulfill its promise to customers for contracts that include professional medical consultations, the Company maintains relationships with various Affiliated Medical Groups, which are professional corporations or other professional entities owned by licensed physicians and that engage licensed healthcare professionals (physicians, physician assistants, nurse practitioners, and mental health providers; collectively referred to as Providers or individually, a Provider to provide consultation services. The Company accounts for service revenue as a principal in the arrangement with its customers. This conclusion is reached because (i) the Company determines which Affiliated Medical Group and Provider provides the consultation to the customer; (ii) the Company is primarily responsible for the satisfactory fulfillment and acceptability of the services; (iii) the Company incurs costs for consultation services even for visits that do not result in a prescription and the sale of products; and (iv) the Company, in its sole discretion, sets all listed prices charged on its websites and mobile applications for products and services. 10 Table of Contents Additionally, to fulfill its promise to customers for contracts that include sale of prescription products, the Company maintains relationships with certain third-party pharmacies Partner Pharmacies or individually, a Partner Pharmacy ). The Company accounts for prescription product revenue as a principal in the arrangement with its customers. This conclusion is reached because (i) the Company has sole discretion in determining which pharmacy fills a customer s prescription; (ii) the pharmacies fill the prescription based on fulfillment instructions provided by the Company; (iii) the Company is primarily responsible to the customer for the satisfactory fulfillment and acceptability of the order; (iv) the Company is responsible for refunds of the prescription medication after transfer of control to the customer; and (v) the Company, in its sole discretion, sets all listed prices charged on its websites and mobile applications for products and services. Payment for prescription medication is typically collected from the customer a few days in advance of product shipment in accordance with contract terms. Contract liabilities are recorded when payments have been received from the customer for undelivered products or services and are recognized as revenue when the performance obligations are later satisfied. Fair Value of Financial Instruments Assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis We recognize financial instruments under the following fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value into three levels as follows: Level 1: quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities; Level 2: observable inputs other than Level 1, quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar assets and liabilities in markets that are not active, and model-derived prices whose inputs are observable or whose significant value drivers are observable; and Level 3: assets and liabilities whose significant value drivers are unobservable. The fair value hierarchy also requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value. Assets and liabilities measured at fair value are classified in their entirety based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement. The Company will update its assumptions each reporting period based on new developments and record such amounts at fair value based on the revised assumptions until the agreements expire or contingency is resolved, as applicable. The following tables present the Company s assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis: Fair value measured as of September 30, 2024 Total carrying value Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Bitcoin 172,992 172,992 - - Fair value measured as of June 30, 2024 Total carrying value Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Bitcoin 1,714,076 1,714,076 - - 11 Table of Contents OFF BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS As of September 30, 2024, we have no off-balance sheet arrangements. RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING POLICIES In December 2023, the FASB issued ASU No. 2023-08, Intangibles Goodwill and Other Crypto Assets (Subtopic 350-60): Accounting for and Disclosure of Crypto Assets. The amendments in ASU No. 2023-08 are intended to improve the accounting for certain crypto assets by requiring an entity to measure those crypto assets at fair value each reporting period with changes in fair value recognized in net income. The amendments also improve the information provided to investors about an entity s crypto asset holdings by requiring disclosure about significant holdings, contractual sale restrictions, and changes during the reporting period. The amendments are effective for all entities for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024, including interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted for both interim and annual financial statements. The Company elected to early adopt ASU 2023-08 for the year ended June 30, 2024, effective as of July 1, 2023, which had a material impact on the Financial Statements. Refer to Note to the Consolidated Financial Statement, Note 4. DIGITAL ASSETS, for further information. There were no new accounting pronouncements issued or proposed by the FASB during the year ended June 30, 2024 and through the date of filing this report which the Company believes will have a material impact on its financial statements. ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK As a smaller reporting company, as defined by Item 10 of Regulation S-K, the Company is not required to provide the information required by this item. ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES. Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures We carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e)). Based upon that evaluation, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer concluded that, as of the end of the period covered in this report, our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective to ensure that information required to be disclosed in reports filed under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the required time periods and is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, does not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures or our internal controls will prevent all error or fraud. A control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Due to the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, have been detected. To address the material weaknesses, we performed additional analysis and other post-closing procedures in an effort to ensure our financial statements included in this quarterly report have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. Accordingly, management believes that the financial statements included in this report fairly present in all material respects our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows for the periods presented. 12 Table of Contents Management s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act, as amended. Our management assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2024. In making this assessment, our management used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission COSO in Internal Control-Integrated Framework. A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the Company s annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. We have identified the following material weaknesses: 1. As of September 30, 2024, we did not maintain effective controls over the control environment. Specifically, the Board of Directors does not currently have any independent members and no director qualifies as an audit committee financial expert as defined in Item 407(d)(5)(ii) of Regulation S-K. Since these entity level programs have a pervasive effect across the organization, management has determined that these circumstances constitute a material weakness. 2. As of September 30, 2024, due to the inherent issue of segregation of duties in a small company, we have relied heavily on entity or management review controls and engaged an outside financial consultant to lessen the issue of segregation of duties over accounting, financial close procedures and controls over financial statement disclosure. Accordingly, management has determined that this control deficiency constitutes a material weakness. 3. As of September 30, 2024, we did not establish a written policy for the approval, identification and authorization of related party transactions. Accordingly, management has determined that this control deficiency constitutes a material weakness. Because of these material weaknesses, management has concluded that the Company did not maintain effective internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2024, based on the criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the COSO. Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting There have been no changes in the Company s internal control over financial reporting through the date of this report or during the quarter ended September 30, 2024, that materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company s internal control over financial reporting. Corrective Action Management plans to address the structure of the Board of Directors and discuss adding an audit committee during the fiscal year ending June 30, 2025. 13 Table of Contents PART II ITEM 1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS We are currently not involved in any litigation that we believe could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations, except as set forth below. There is no action, suit, proceeding, inquiry or investigation before or by any court, public board, government agency, self-regulatory organization or body pending or, to the knowledge of the executive officers of our company, threatened against or affecting our company, our common stock, or our company s directors, officers or affiliates, any owner of record or beneficiary of more than 5 of any class of our voting securities is a party adverse to us or has a material interest adverse to us. ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS There have been no material changes to the risk factors set forth in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2024. ITEM 2. UNREGISTERED SALES IN EQUITY SECURITIES, USE OF PROCEEDS, AND ISSUER PURCHASES OF EQUITY SECURITIES During the three months ended September 30, 2024, the Company issued 97,088 shares of common stock as part of the purchase price of Healthy Lifestyle USA LLC.
