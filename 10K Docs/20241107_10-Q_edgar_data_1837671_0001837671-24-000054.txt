 of the Retail Properties allowing current or future landlords to terminate the Retail Master Lease as to that property upon months prior written notice. This option is limited (for the Trust, but not for future landlords) to Retail Properties in any lease year. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, Retail Properties with landlord termination options were sold. As of September 30, 2024, the Trust had sold Retail Properties with landlord termination options, and there were remaining Retail Properties with landlord termination options. 
 
 Tenant Option Properties: On the Effective Date, the Retail Master Lease provided Penney Intermediate Holdings LLC an option to terminate the Retail Master Lease upon months prior written notice as to all or a portion of any one or more of specified properties. This option is limited to no more than Properties in any lease year. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, Retail Properties with tenant termination options were sold. As of September 30, 2024, the Trust had sold Retail Properties with tenant termination options, and there was remaining Retail Property with a tenant termination option. 
 
 Substitution Options and Go Dark Rights: The Retail Master Lease provides Penney Intermediate Holdings LLC an option to terminate the Retail Master Lease with respect to selected sub-performing properties upon replacement of such sub-performing properties with qualified replacement properties in accordance with the terms and conditions of the Retail Master Lease. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Penney Intermediate Holdings LLC shall only be entitled to exercise a substitution option (i) between the third and 15th anniversary of the commencement date of the Retail Master Lease and (ii) if the aggregate allocated base rent amounts for all Go Dark/Substitution Properties (as defined in the Retail Master Lease) during the applicable period (as described in the Retail Master Lease) is less than or equal to of the aggregate first year s base rent. The Retail Master Lease also provides Penney Intermediate Holdings LLC with the limited right to go dark (i.e., cease operations) at one or more Retail Properties in certain limited circumstances as set forth in the Retail Master Lease; provided that such right does not relieve Penney Intermediate Holdings LLC of its obligation to make any rent payments that are due and owing. As of September 30, 2024, Penney Intermediate Holdings LLC has not ceased operations at any of the Retail Properties. 
 
 Tenant Purchase Rights: On the Effective Date, the Master Leases contained preferential offer rights in favor of Penney Intermediate Holdings LLC with respect to of the Retail Properties and each of the Warehouses (the Tenant Purchase Rights ), which enable Penney Intermediate Holdings LLC, in connection with a potential sale of such Properties, to acquire such Properties for a price determined in accordance with the procedures set forth in the Master Leases. These Tenant Purchase Rights require the Trust to reoffer a property to the tenant in the event it is not sold within a specified period of time at a specified minimum price related to the preferential purchase price.

of these Retail Properties, of which were purchased by an affiliate of the tenant, and all of the Warehouses, of which none were purchased by the tenant, have been sold. 
 
 Lockout Periods: The Trust agreed not to deliver notice to Penney Intermediate Holdings LLC formally commencing the sales process at those Properties subject to the Tenant Purchase Rights prior to the dates specified in the applicable Master Lease for such Properties. All lockout periods with respect to the Tenant Purchase Rights for the Retail Properties have expired. 
 
 Environmental Matters 
 
 Federal law (and the laws of some states in which we own or may acquire properties) imposes liability on a landowner for the presence on the premises of hazardous substances or wastes (as defined by present and future federal and state laws and regulations). This liability is without regard to fault or knowledge of the presence of such substances and may be imposed jointly and severally upon all succeeding landowners. If such hazardous substance is discovered on a property owned by us, we could incur liability for the removal of the substances and the cleanup of the property. 
 
 There can be no assurance that we would have effective remedies against prior owners of the property. In addition, we may be liable to current or future tenants and may find it difficult or impossible to sell the property either prior to or following such a cleanup. There are no environmental matters that are expected to have a material effect on the Trust s consolidated financial statements. 
 
 Risk of Uninsured Property Losses 
 
 The Trust maintains property damage, fire loss, environmental, and liability insurance in addition to the insurance required to be maintained by the tenant pursuant to the Master Leases. However, there are certain types of losses (generally of a catastrophic nature) which may be either uninsurable or not economically insurable. Such excluded risks may include war, earthquakes, tornados, floods and certain other environmental hazards. Should such events occur, (i) we may suffer a loss of capital invested, (ii) tenant may suffer losses and may be unable to pay rent for the spaces, and (iii) we may suffer a loss of profits which might be anticipated from one or more properties. 
 
 Significant Risks and Uncertainties 
 
 Although disruptions stemming from the COVID-19 pandemic have subsided, inflation, fluctuations in interest rates, reduced consumer spending, labor shortages, supply chain disruptions and global capital markets volatility pose increasing risks to the Company and the U.S. economy. The ongoing and potential future impacts of global conflicts, such as between Russia and Ukraine and in the Middle East, among others are also contributing to economic and geopolitical uncertainty. While we did not incur any disruptions to our lease income and occupancy during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as a result of these adverse political and economic conditions, credit markets or other events, we continue to closely monitor the impact of these factors as they may have a negative impact on our or Penney Intermediate Holdings LLC s business. 
 
 Concentration of Credit Risk 
 
 As of September 30, 2024, all of the Properties were leased to Penney Intermediate Holdings LLC, and all of the Trust s lease income was derived from the Master Leases (see Note 3). The Properties' tenants constitute a significant asset concentration, as all tenants are subsidiaries of Penney Intermediate Holdings LLC, and Penney Intermediate Holdings LLC provides financial guarantees with respect to the Master Leases. Until the Trust materially diversifies the composition of tenants for its properties, an event that has a material adverse effect on Penney Intermediate Holdings LLC s business, financial condition or results of operations could have a material adverse effect on the Trust s business, financial condition or results of operations.

 Litigation 
 
 From time to time, the Trust may be subject to various legal proceedings and claims that arise in the ordinary course of business. There are no current matters that are expected to have a material effect on the Trust s consolidated financial statements. 
 
 Income Taxes 
 
 As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, there were uncertain tax positions and the balance of unrecognized tax benefits was .

When inputs used to measure fair value fall within different levels of the hierarchy, the level within which the fair value measurement is categorized is based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement. The fair values of cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable and accrued expenses, to the extent the underlying liability will be settled in cash, approximate their carrying values because of the short-term nature of these instruments. 
 
 Recurring Fair Value Measurements

 Principal External Factors that Affect our Results of Operations 
 
 Inflation Risk and Economic Conditions 
 
 Although disruptions stemming from the COVID-19 pandemic have subsided, inflation, fluctuating interest rates, reduced consumer spending, labor shortages, supply chain disruptions and global capital markets volatility pose continued risk to the Trust and the U.S. economy. The ongoing and potential future impacts of global conflicts, such as between Russia and Ukraine and in the Middle East, among others, are also contributing to economic and geopolitical uncertainty. Downturns in the global economy could cause a decline in the demand for our properties and our tenant's products. Our operations could also be impacted by inflation and changes in interest rates. Inflation did not have a material effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. 
 
 While we did not incur any disruptions to our lease income and occupancy during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 as a result of these adverse political and economic conditions, credit markets or other events, any of these events could materially adversely impact the Trust or Penney Intermediate Holdings LLC's business. The Trust continues to closely monitor economic, financial and social conditions, including the effects of inflation. 
 
 Climate Change and ESG Regulations 
 
 Our Properties are subject to comprehensive and frequently evolving federal, state and local environmental and occupational health and safety laws. We have made, and will continue to make, capital and other expenditures to comply with environmental requirements. While we do not currently anticipate any material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or competitive position as a result of our efforts to comply with such requirements, new or more stringent laws or regulations regarding environmental and worker health and safety laws could affect our operations and increase our operational and compliance expenditures. It is also possible that liabilities from newly-discovered non-compliance or contamination could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 

Executive Summary

Results of Operations 
 
 Comparison of three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 to the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 
 
 For the three months ended September 30, 2024, net income attributable to Certificateholders was 16,443 or 0.22 per Certificate, as compared to 19,693 or 0.26 per Certificate for the corresponding period in 2023. 
 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, net income attributable to Certificateholders was 52,094 or 0.69 per Certificate, as compared to 53,679 or 0.72 per Certificate for the corresponding period in 2023. 
 
 The following describes the changes on the Trust s consolidated statements of operations that affected net income attributable to Certificateholders during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the corresponding periods in 2023: 
 
 Lease income - The net decrease in lease income of 318 and 437 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, as compared to the corresponding periods in 2023, is due to the disposition of six Retail Properties between September 30, 2023 and September 30, 2024, partially offset by the CPI adjustment of base rent as of December 7, 2023. 
 
 Operating expenses - The net increase in operating expenses of 35 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the corresponding period in 2023, is primarily due to an increase in bank fees of 32. During the three months ended September 30, 2024, the Trust paid bank charges related to prior periods, along with charges for the current quarter. The net decrease in operating expenses of 259 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the corresponding period in 2023, is due to the Trust receiving a franchise tax refund during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 
 
 Depreciation and amortization - The decrease in depreciation and amortization of 233 and 441 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, as compared to the corresponding period in 2023, is due to the disposition of six Retail Properties between September 30, 2023 and September 30, 2024. 
 
 Provision for impairment of investment properties - During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Trust remeasured one investment property to fair value and recorded an impairment charge of 2,081. During the nine months ended September 30, 2023, no impairment charge was recorded. 
 
 General and administrative expenses - The increase in general and administrative expenses of 191 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the corresponding period in 2023, is primarily due to an increase in legal expenses. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, general and administrative expenses increased by 147 from the corresponding period in 2023 primarily due to an increase in legal expenses, partially offset by a decrease in insurance expense. 
 
 Gain on sales of investment properties, net - During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Trust disposed of five properties for aggregate net sales proceeds of 41,316, which resulted in an aggregate gain of 4,392. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, gain on sales of investment properties, net includes a gain of 78 in proceeds released from escrow due to a disposition that occurred in December 2022 and 154 of selling expenses from prior period dispositions. During the nine months ended September 30, 2023, the gain on sales of investment properties, net of 3,515 is due to the dispositions of two Retail Properties and includes a net gain of 1,324 from a prior year disposition. 
 
 Other income - Other income consists of interest income earned on investments in money market instruments and non-recurring income generated from the Retail Properties, including consent fees or other fees paid to the Trust. For the three months ended September 30, 2024, the decrease in other income of 37, as compared to the 
 20 

corresponding period in 2023, is due to a decrease of 52 in consent fees and other income, partially offset by an increase of 15 in interest income earned by the Trust. The Trust did not receive any consent fees or other income during the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 52 during the comparable period in 2023. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the decrease in other income of 421, as compared to the corresponding period in 2023, is due to a decrease of 572 in consent fees and other income received by the Trust, partially offset by an increase of 151 in interest income earned by the Trust. 

Net Operating Income ("NOI") 
 
 We define NOI as all revenues other than (i) straight-line rental income (non-cash), (ii) amortization of above and below market lease intangibles, (iii) interest income and (iv) non-cash ground lease reimbursement income, less all operating expenses other than non-cash ground rent expense, which is comprised of amortization of right-of-use lease assets and amortization of lease liabilities, depreciation and amortization, and formation expenses. We use NOI internally to evaluate our financial and operating performance. We believe that NOI, which is a supplemental non-GAAP financial measure, also provides an additional and useful operating perspective to investors not immediately apparent from Net income in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States ("GAAP"). We do not, nor do we suggest that investors should, consider such non-GAAP financial measures in isolation from, or as a substitute for, financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP. Comparison of our presentation of NOI to similarly titled measures for other entities may not necessarily be meaningful due to possible differences in definition and application by such entities. For reference and as an aid in understanding our computation of NOI, a reconciliation of net income as computed in accordance with GAAP to NOI for the Reporting Periods is as follows: 
 
 Three Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 2024 2023 Net income 16,443 19,693 52,094 53,679 Adjustments to reconcile to NOI: Depreciation and amortization of real estate 4,572 4,805 14,011 14,452 Provision for impairment of investment properties 2,081 2,081 Gain on sales of investment properties, net (1,866) (2,687) (4,316) (3,515) Straight-line rental income, net 568 585 1,719 1,763 Amortization of above and below market lease intangibles, net 617 546 1,760 1,667 Interest income (332) (317) (1,017) (866) Non-cash ground rent expense, net 1,495 1,495 4,486 4,486 Non-cash ground lease reimbursement income (1,027) (1,019) (3,089) (3,035) NOI 22,551 23,101 67,729 68,631 
 
 The decrease in NOI of 902 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023, is due to (i) a decrease in lease income of 1,936 resulting from the disposition of six Retail Properties, (ii) a decrease in consent fee income of 572 and (iii) a net increase in general and administrative expenses of 147; partially offset by (iv) an increase in lease income of 1,494 due to the CPI adjustment of base rent in December 2023 and (v) a net decrease in operating expenses of 259. 

21 

Funds from Operations 
 
 The National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts, or NAREIT, an industry trade group, has promulgated a financial measure known as funds from operations ("FFO"). As defined by NAREIT, FFO means net income computed in accordance with GAAP, excluding (i) depreciation and amortization related to real estate, (ii) gains from sales of real estate assets, (iii) gains and losses from change in control and (iv) provisions for impairment of investment properties. We have adopted the NAREIT definition in our computation of FFO attributable to Certificateholders. Management believes that, subject to the following limitations, FFO attributable to Certificateholders provides a basis for comparing our performance and operations to REITs. 
 
 We define Operating FFO attributable to Certificateholders as FFO attributable to Certificateholders excluding the impact of discrete non-operating transactions and other events which we do not consider representative of the comparable operating results of our real estate operating portfolio, which is our core business platform. Specific examples of discrete non-operating transactions and other events include, but are not limited to, the impact on earnings, which are not otherwise adjusted in our calculation of FFO attributable to Certificateholders. 
 
 We believe that FFO and Operating FFO, which are supplemental non-GAAP financial measures, provide an additional and useful means to assess our operating performance compared to REITs. FFO and Operating FFO do not represent alternatives to (i) Net income or Net income attributable to Certificateholders as indicators of our financial performance, or (ii) Cash flows from operating activities which is prepared in accordance with GAAP as measures of our capacity to fund cash needs, including the payment of distributions. Comparison of our presentation of Operating FFO to similarly titled measures for REITs may not necessarily be meaningful due to possible differences in definition and application by such REITs. 
 
 The following table presents a reconciliation of net income to FFO and Operating FFO: 
 
 Three Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 2024 2023 Net income 16,443 19,693 52,094 53,679 Depreciation and amortization of real estate 4,572 4,805 14,011 14,452 Provision for impairment of investment properties 2,081 2,081 Gain on sales of investment properties, net (1,866) (2,687) (4,316) (3,515) FFO 21,230 21,811 63,870 64,616 FFO per certificate outstanding basic and diluted 0.28 0.29 0.85 0.86 FFO 21,230 21,811 63,870 64,616 Dead deal costs 53 140 72 Operating FFO 21,230 21,864 64,010 64,688 Operating FFO per certificate outstanding basic and diluted 0.28 0.29 0.85 0.86 
 
 The decrease in FFO of 746 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023, is primarily due to (i) a net decrease in lease related income of 1,931 resulting from the disposition of six Retail Properties, (ii) a decrease in consent fee income of 572 and (iii) a net increase in general and administrative expenses of 147; partially offset by (iv) an increase in lease income of 1,494 due to the CPI adjustment of base rent in December 2023, (v) an increase in interest income of 151 and (vi) a net decrease in operating expenses of 259. 
 
 22 

The decrease in Operating FFO of 678 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to nine months ended September 30, 2023 is primarily due to (i) a net decrease in lease related income of 1,931 resulting from the disposition of six Retail Properties, (ii) a decrease in consent fee income of 572 and (iii) a net increase in general and administrative expenses of 79; partially offset by (iv) an increase in lease income of 1,494 due to the CPI adjustment of base rent in December 2023, (v) an increase in interest income of 151 and (vi) a net decrease in operating expenses of 259. 

Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 
 We anticipate that cash flows from the below-listed sources will provide adequate capital for the next 12 months and beyond for all Certificateholder distributions. 
 
 Our primary expected sources and uses of liquidity are as follows: 
 
 SOURCES USES Rental revenues Operating and general and administrative expenses Cash and cash equivalents Sales expenses Net proceeds from the sale of real estate Distribution payments 
 
 As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we had 46,115 and 38,026, respectively, of cash and cash equivalents. The Trust has adopted a policy to maintain its cash equivalents in a government money market fund administered by a major bulge bracket investment banking firm which invests its assets only in (i) cash and (ii) securities issued or guaranteed by the United States or certain U.S. government agencies and having a weighted average life and weighted average maturity of no more than 120 days and 60 days, respectively. Each of these government money market funds is managed to maintain a stable net asset value, thereby eliminating principal risk. 
 
 We had no indebtedness as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. 
 
 Debt Maturities 
 
 We have no scheduled maturities and principal amortization of our indebtedness, since we had no indebtedness as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. 
 
 Distributions 
 
 The Trust is required to distribute on a monthly basis, the net proceeds from lease payments under the Master Leases (until such time as all of the Properties have been sold) and all net sales proceeds from the disposition of Properties, in each case pro rata, to Certificateholders as of the record date immediately preceding the applicable distribution date. Such distributions shall be net of (i) tax payments to be made by the Trust, (ii) fees and expenses of the Trust, the Trustee, the Manager and any other professional advisors, and (iii) funds to be set aside for the Trustee s and Manager s reserve accounts. 
 
 We paid distributions to the Certificateholders of 101,853 or 1.36 per certificate during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, and 102,577 or 1.37 per certificate during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 
 23 

Dispositions 
 
 Net sales proceeds from the disposition of Properties were included in the distributions to Certificateholders. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, included in the amount we paid to Certificateholders was 33,176 and 33,875, respectively, of aggregate net sales proceeds. 
 
 Capital Expenditures 
 
 We anticipate that obligations related to capital improvements will not be significant as these are generally the responsibility of the tenant under the Master Leases and should otherwise be met with cash flows from operations. 
 
 Summary of Cash Flows 
 
 The following table summarizes our cash flows: 
 Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 Net cash provided by operating activities 68,626 69,368 Net cash provided by investing activities 41,316 18,224 Net cash used in financing activities (101,853) (102,577) Change in cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash 8,089 (14,985) Cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash, at beginning of period 38,026 48,922 Cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash, at end of period 46,115 33,937 
 
 Cash Flows from Operating and Investing Activities 
 
 Net cash provided by operating activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 68,626, as compared to 69,368 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease of 742 is primarily due to a decrease in NOI resulting from (i) a decrease in lease income due to the disposition of six Retail Properties between September 30, 2023 and September 30, 2024, (ii) a decrease in consent fee income and (iii) an increase in general and administrative expenses. These changes were partially offset by (iv) increases in lease income due to the CPI adjustment to base rent and (v) a net decrease in operating expenses. 
 
 Cash flows provided by investing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 were 41,316, as compared to 18,224 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Investing activities solely consists of proceeds from sales of investment properties, and the increase in net cash provided by investing activities is due to disposition activity in each Reporting Period. 
 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, total net cash provided by operating and investing activities was 109,942, however 101,853 was distributed to Certificateholders in 2024, of which 12,320 were distributions of cash flows from operating and investing activities received during December 2023.

ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 
 
 Interest Rate Risk 
 
 We are not exposed to interest rate risk because we currently do not hold any long-term debt or derivatives. If we were to enter into long-term debt arrangements, our interest rate risk management objectives would be to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to lower our overall borrowing costs. 
 
 25 

As of September 30, 2024, we did not hold any fixed or variable rate debt, and did not hold any derivative financial instruments to hedge exposures to changes in interest rates. 

ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 
 
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 
 Management, with the participation of the Principal Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer, has evaluated the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e)) as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based upon this evaluation, the Principal Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer concluded that, as of the end of the period covered by this quarterly report, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective and provide reasonable assurance that the information required to be disclosed in the reports we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported accurately and within the time periods specified in the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission's rules and forms, and that it is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Principal Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding the required disclosure. 
 
 Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
 
 There were no changes to our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) during the quarter ended September 30, 2024 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
