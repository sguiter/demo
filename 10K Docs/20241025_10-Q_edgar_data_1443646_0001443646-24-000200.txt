PGSC was founded in 1985 and headquartered in Rome, New York, and delivers differentiated services and solutions in strategic mission areas, including the provision of real-time communications and mobile situational awareness to maintain battlespace dominance for a range of government customers. The acquisition was funded with cash on hand. As a result of the transaction, PGSC became a wholly owned subsidiary of Booz Allen Hamilton Inc. 
 Under the terms of the purchase agreement, the purchase price is subject to post-closing working capital and other customary adjustments. The final purchase price allocations will be completed after the underlying information has been finalized and agreed upon by the seller and the Company. 
 The acquisition is accounted for under the acquisition method of accounting, which requires the total acquisition consideration to be allocated to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on an estimate of the acquisition date fair value, with the difference reflected in goodwill. The preliminary goodwill of million is primarily attributable to the expected synergies between the Company and PGSC and PGSC s specialized workforce and is deductible for tax purposes. 
 The Company preliminarily recognized million of intangible assets which consists primarily of contract assets and are being amortized over the estimated useful life of . 
 The valuation of PGSC s assets acquired and liabilities assumed are preliminary and based on valuation estimates and assumptions. Although the Company does not currently expect material changes to the initial value of net assets acquired, the Company continues to evaluate assumptions related to the valuation of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed. Any adjustments to our estimates of purchase price allocation will be made in the periods in which the adjustments are determined, and the cumulative effect of such adjustments will be calculated as if the adjustments had been completed as of the acquisition dates. 
 Goodwill 
 As of September 30, 2024 and March 31, 2024, goodwill was million and million, respectively. The million increase in the carrying amount of goodwill was attributable the Company's acquisition of PGSC.

Voluntary prepayments of Term Loan A and the Revolving Loans are permitted at any time, in minimum principal amounts, without premium or penalty. Booz Allen Hamilton s obligations and the guarantors guarantees under the Credit Agreement were secured by a first priority lien on substantially all of the assets (including capital stock of subsidiaries) of Booz Allen Hamilton, Investor and the subsidiary guarantors, subject to certain exceptions set forth in the Credit Agreement and related documentation; such security was released in connection with Booz Allen Hamilton obtaining investment grade ratings from both Moody's and S P. On September 7, 2022 (the Ninth Amendment Effective Date ), the previously outstanding Term Loan B loans under the Credit Agreement were prepaid in full. 
 On July 27, 2023 (the Tenth Amendment Effective Date ), Booz Allen Hamilton entered into a Tenth Amendment (the Amendment to the Credit Agreement (as amended prior to the Tenth Amendment Effective Date, the Existing Credit Agreement and, as amended by the Amendment, the Amended Credit Agreement with Bank of America, N.A., as administrative agent (in such capacity, the Administrative Agent ), and the lenders and other financial institutions party thereto, in order to make permanent certain changes to the Existing Credit Agreement in connection with Booz Allen Hamilton obtaining investment grade ratings from both Moody's and S P and prepaying the Term Loan B loans in full and to make certain additional changes in connection therewith, including, among other things, (i) removing the requirements for the obligations under the Amended Credit Agreement to be secured, (ii) removing the requirement for any subsidiary or other affiliate of Booz Allen Hamilton (other than the Company) to provide any guarantee of the obligations under the Amended Credit Agreement, and (iii) removing or modifying certain covenants applicable to Booz Allen Hamilton. Pursuant to the Amendment, all guarantees in respect of the Existing Credit Agreement have been released. The Amendment did not impact any of the terms of the Credit Agreement related to amortization or payments. 
 On the Tenth Amendment Effective Date in connection with the Amendment, the Company entered into a Guarantee Agreement (the Guarantee Agreement in favor of the Administrative Agent, pursuant to which the Company guarantees on an unsecured basis the obligations of Booz Allen Hamilton under the Amended Credit Agreement subject to certain conditions.

 Borrowings under Term Loan A, and if used, the Revolving Credit Facility, incur interest at a variable rate.

These instruments hedge the variability of cash outflows for interest payments on a portion of the Company s floating rate borrowings under the Credit Agreement.

 The Credit Agreement contains customary representations and warranties and customary affirmative and negative covenants. In connection with Booz Allen Hamilton obtaining investment grade ratings from both Moody's and S P, certain activities previously restricted by certain negative covenants are permitted subject to pro forma compliance with the financial covenants and no events of default having occurred or are continuing.

The Company mitigates this credit risk by entering into agreements with credit-worthy counterparties, diversifying across multiple counterparties, and regularly reviewing credit exposure and the creditworthiness of each counterparty.

 (1) The Company s interest rate swaps are considered over-the-counter derivatives and fair value is estimated based on the present value of future cash flows using a model-derived valuation that uses Level 2 observable inputs such as interest rate yield curves. See Note 9, Derivatives, to the condensed consolidated financial statements for further discussion on the Company s derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges. 
 (2) Investments in this category consist primarily of mutual funds whose fair values are determined by reference to the quoted market price per unit in active markets multiplied by the number of units held without consideration of transaction costs.

 Long-term Debt 
 The Company's long-term debt is carried at amortized cost and is measured at fair value quarterly for disclosure purposes. The estimated fair values are determined using quoted prices or other market information obtained from recent trading activity of the debt in markets that are not active (Level 2 inputs). The fair value is corroborated by prices derived from the interest rate spreads of recently completed leveraged loan transactions of a similar credit profile, industry, and terms to that of the Company. The fair value of the Senior Notes are determined using quoted prices or other market information obtained from recent trading activity in the high-yield bond market (Level 2 inputs).

 Government Contracting Matters - Provision for Claimed Costs 
 For the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, approximately and , respectively, of the Company's revenue was generated from contracts where the end user was an agency or department of the U.S. government, including contracts where the Company performed either as a prime contractor or subcontractor, and regardless of the geographic location in which the work was performed. For both the six months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 , approximately of the Company's revenue was generated from such contracts. As noted in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2024, in the ordinary course of business, agencies of the U.S. government, including the Defense Contract Audit Agency DCAA ), audit the Company s claimed costs and conduct inquiries and investigations of our business practices with respect to government contracts to determine whether the Company's operations are conducted in accordance with these requirements and the terms of the relevant contracts. 
 Based upon information obtained from DCAA s audit findings over four historical rate years, the Company changed its estimate and reduced a portion of its provision for claimed costs during the second quarter of fiscal 2025, which resulted in a million increase to revenue, to reflect our best estimate of the final cost rates for the outstanding audit years. Operating income for the three and six months ended September 30, 2024 was accordingly increased by million and net income was increased by million (or of basic and diluted earnings per common share for the three and six months ended September 30, 2024). Our final cost rates for the recently audited years remain subject to negotiation with the Defense Contract Management Agency DCMA Administrative Contracting Officer. Management believes it has recorded the appropriate provision for claimed costs for any audit, inquiry, or investigation of which it is aware that may be subject to any reductions and/or penalties. As of September 30, 2024 and March 31, 2024, the Company had recorded liabilities of approximately million and million, respectively, for estimated adjustments to claimed costs based on its historical DCAA audit results, including the final resolution of such audits with DCMA, for claimed costs incurred subsequent to fiscal 2011.

 Financial and Other Highlights 
 During the second quarter of fiscal 2025, the Company generated year over year revenue growth and increased client staff headcount. 
 Revenue increased 18.0 to 3,146.4 million in the three months ended September 30, 2024 from 2,666.3 million in the three months ended September 30, 2023, and increased 14.4 to 6,088.2 million in the six months ended September 30, 2024 from 5,320.8 million in the six months ended September 30, 2023. The increase was primarily driven by strong demand for our services and solutions as well as continued headcount growth and higher billable expenses. In addition, revenue was positively impacted by 121.7 million representing the reduction to our provision for claimed costs recorded during the second quarter of fiscal 2025. See Note 15, Commitments and Contingencies, to the condensed consolidated financial statements for further information. 
 Operating income increased 105.5 to 548.6 million in the three months ended September 30, 2024 from 267.0 million in the three months ended September 30, 2023, which reflects an increase in operating margin from 10.0 to 17.4 . Operating income increased 60.3 to 803.8 million in the six months ended September 30, 2024 from 501.4 million in the six months ended September 30, 2023, which reflects an increase in operating margin from 9.4 to 13.2 . The increase in operating income and operating margin was primarily driven by revenue growth and a decrease in general and administrative expenses resulting from 115.3 million in insurance recoveries from claims related to the Company s fiscal 2024 settlement as described in Note 20, Commitments and Contingencies, to the consolidated financial statements contained within the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2024.

 Non-GAAP Measures 
 We publicly disclose certain non-GAAP financial measurements, including Revenue, Excluding Billable Expenses, Adjusted Operating Income, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA Margin on Revenue, Adjusted EBITDA Margin on Revenue, Excluding Billable Expenses, Adjusted Net Income, and Adjusted Diluted Earnings Per Share, or Adjusted Diluted EPS. We view Adjusted Operating Income, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA Margin on Revenue, Adjusted EBITDA Margin on Revenue, Excluding Billable Expenses, Adjusted Net Income, and Adjusted Diluted EPS as measures of our core operating business, which exclude the impact of the items detailed below, as these items are generally not operational in nature. These non-GAAP measures also provide another basis for comparing period to period results by excluding potential differences caused by non-operational and unusual or non-recurring items. In addition, we use Revenue, Excluding Billable Expenses because it provides management useful information about the Company's operating performance by excluding the impact of costs that are not indicative of the level of productivity of our client staff headcount and our overall direct labor, which management believes provides useful information to our investors about our core operations. We also utilize and discuss Free Cash Flow because management uses this measure for business planning purposes, measuring the cash generating ability of the operating business, and measuring liquidity generally. We present these supplemental measures because we believe that these measures provide investors and securities analysts with important supplemental information with which to evaluate our performance, long-term earnings potential, or liquidity, as applicable, and to enable them to assess our performance on the same basis as management. These supplemental performance measurements may vary from and may not be comparable to similarly titled measures by other companies in our industry. Revenue, Excluding Billable Expenses, Adjusted Operating Income, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA Margin on Revenue, Adjusted EBITDA Margin on Revenue, Excluding Billable Expenses, Adjusted Net Income, Adjusted Diluted EPS, and Free Cash Flow are not recognized measurements under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, or GAAP, and when analyzing our performance or liquidity, as applicable, investors should (i) evaluate each adjustment in our reconciliation of revenue to Revenue, Excluding Billable Expenses, operating income to Adjusted Operating Income, net income to Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA Margin on Revenue, Adjusted EBITDA Margin on Revenue, Excluding Billable Expenses, Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted Diluted Earnings Per Share, and net cash provided by operating activities to Free Cash Flow, (ii) use Revenue, Excluding Billable Expenses, Adjusted Operating Income, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA Margin on Revenue, Adjusted EBITDA Margin on Revenue, Excluding Billable Expenses, Adjusted Net Income, and Adjusted Diluted EPS in addition to, and not as an alternative to, revenue, operating income, net income or diluted EPS, as measures of operating results, each as defined under GAAP and (iii) use Free Cash Flow in addition to, and not as an alternative to, net cash provided by operating activities as a measure of liquidity, each as defined under GAAP. We have defined the aforementioned non-GAAP measures as follows: 
 Revenue, Excluding Billable Expenses represents revenue less billable expenses. We use Revenue, Excluding Billable Expenses because it provides management useful information about the Company's operating performance by excluding the impact of costs that are not indicative of the level of productivity of our client staff headcount and our overall direct labor, which management believes provides useful information to our investors about our core operations. 
 Adjusted Operating Income represents operating income before change in provision for claimed costs for historical rate years, acquisition and divestiture costs, financing transaction costs, significant acquisition amortization, the reserve associated with the U.S. Department of Justice investigation disclosed in Note 20, Commitments and Contingencies, in the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2024, and insurance recoveries related to the Company s fiscal 2024 settlement disclosed in Note 20, Commitments and Contingencies, in the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2024. We prepare Adjusted Operating Income to eliminate the impact of items we do not consider indicative of ongoing operating performance due to their inherent unusual, extraordinary, or non-recurring nature or because they result from an event of a similar nature. 
 Adjusted EBITDA represents net income before income taxes, net interest and other expense and depreciation and amortization and before certain other items, including change in provision for claimed costs for historical rate years, acquisition and divestiture costs, financing transaction costs, the reserve associated with the U.S. Department of Justice investigation disclosed in Note 20, Commitments and Contingencies, in the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2024, and insurance recoveries related to the Company s fiscal 2024 settlement disclosed in Note 20, Commitments and Contingencies, in the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2024. Adjusted EBITDA Margin on Revenue is calculated as Adjusted EBITDA divided by revenue. Adjusted EBITDA Margin on Revenue, Excluding Billable Expenses is calculated as Adjusted EBITDA divided by Revenue, Excluding Billable Expenses. The Company prepares Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA Margin on Revenue, and Adjusted EBITDA Margin on Revenue, Excluding Billable Expenses to eliminate the impact of items it does not consider indicative of ongoing operating performance due to their inherent unusual, extraordinary or non-recurring nature or because they result from an event of a similar nature.

 Adjusted Net Income represents net income before: (i) change in provision for claimed costs for historical rate years, (ii) acquisition and divestiture costs, (iii) financing transaction costs, (iv) significant acquisition amortization, (v) the reserve associated with the U.S. Department of Justice investigation disclosed in Note 20, Commitments and Contingencies, in the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2024, (vi), insurance recoveries related to the Company s fiscal 2024 settlement disclosed in Note 20, Commitments and Contingencies, in the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2024, and (vii) amortization or write-off of debt issuance costs and debt discount, in each case net of the tax effect where appropriate calculated using an assumed effective tax rate. We prepare Adjusted Net Income to eliminate the impact of items, net of tax, we do not consider indicative of ongoing operating performance due to their inherent unusual, extraordinary, or non-recurring nature or because they result from an event of a similar nature. We view Adjusted Net Income as an important indicator of performance consistent with the manner in which management measures and forecasts the Company's performance and the way in which management is incentivized to perform. 
 Adjusted Diluted EPS represents diluted EPS calculated using Adjusted Net Income as opposed to net income. Additionally, Adjusted Diluted EPS does not contemplate any adjustments to net income as required under the two-class method as disclosed in the footnotes to the condensed consolidated financial statements. 
 Free Cash Flow represents the net cash generated from operating activities less the impact of purchases of property, equipment, and software. "Free Cash Flow Conversion" is calculated as Free Cash Flow divided by Adjusted Net Income. 
 Below is a reconciliation of Revenue, Excluding Billable Expenses, Adjusted Operating Income, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA Margin on Revenue, Adjusted EBITDA Margin on Revenue, Excluding Billable Expenses, Adjusted Net Income, Adjusted Diluted EPS, and Free Cash Flow to the most directly comparable financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP.

 Factors and Trends Affecting Our Results of Operations 
 Our results of operations have been, and we expect them to continue to be, affected by the following factors, which may cause our future results of operations to differ from our historical results of operations discussed under Results of Operations. 
 Business Environment and Key Trends in Our Markets 
 We believe that the following trends and developments in the U.S. government services industry and our markets may influence our future results of operations: 
 uncertainty around the timing, extent, nature and effect of Congressional and other U.S. government actions to approve funding of the U.S. government, address budgetary constraints, including caps on the discretionary budget for defense and non-defense departments and agencies, as established by the Bipartisan Budget Control Act of 2011 BCA and subsequently adjusted by the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012, the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2013, the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2015, the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018, and the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2019, the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (the CARES Act ), and the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2021, and address the ability of Congress to determine how to allocate the available budget authority and pass appropriations bills to fund both U.S. government departments and agencies that are, and those that are not, subject to the caps; 
 budget deficits and the growing U.S. national debt increasing pressure on the U.S. government to reduce federal spending across all federal agencies together with associated uncertainty about the size and timing of those reductions; 
 cost-cutting and efficiency initiatives, current and future budget restrictions, continued implementation of Congressionally mandated automatic spending cuts, and other efforts to reduce U.S. government spending could cause clients to reduce or delay funding for orders for services or invest appropriated funds on a less consistent or rapid basis or not at all, particularly when considering long-term initiatives and in light of current uncertainty around Congressional efforts to craft a long-term agreement on the U.S. government's ability to incur indebtedness in excess of its current limits, and generally in the current political environment, there is a risk that clients will not issue task orders in sufficient volume to reach current contract ceilings, alter historical patterns of contract awards, including the typical increase in the award of task orders or completion of other contract actions by the U.S. government in the period before the end of the U.S. government's fiscal year on September 30, delay requests for new proposals and contract awards, rely on short-term extensions and funding of current contracts, or reduce staffing levels and hours of operation; 
 delays in the completion of future U.S. government s budget processes, which have in the past and could in the future delay procurement of the products, services, and solutions we provide; 
 changes in the relative mix of overall U.S. government spending and areas of spending growth, with lower spending on homeland security, intelligence, defense-related programs as certain overseas operations end, and continued increased spending on cybersecurity, Command, Control, Communications, Computers, Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (C4ISR), advanced analytics, technology integration, and healthcare, including as a result of the presidential and administration transition; 
 the extent, nature and effect of disease outbreaks, pandemics and widespread health epidemics, such as COVID-19, including the impact on federal budgets, current and pending procurements, supply chains, demand for services, deployment and productivity of our employees and the economic and societal impact of a pandemic, and the expected continued volatility in billable expenses; 
 increased inflationary pressure that could impact the cost of doing business and/or reduce customer buying power; 
 risks related to a possible recession and volatility or instability of the global financial system, including bank failures and the resulting impact on counterparties and business conditions generally; 
 legislative and regulatory changes, or shifts in regulatory priorities as a result of U.S. administration transitions, including limitations on the amount of allowable executive compensation permitted under flexibly priced contracts following implementation of interim rules adopted by federal agencies pursuant to the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2013, which substantially further reduce the amount of allowable executive compensation under these contracts and extend these limitations to a larger segment of our executives and our entire contract base;

 efforts by the U.S. government to address organizational conflicts of interest and related issues and the impact of those efforts on us and our competitors; 
 increased audit, review, investigation, and general scrutiny by U.S. government agencies of government contractors' performance under U.S. government contracts and compliance with the terms of those contracts and applicable laws; 
 the federal focus on refining the definition of inherently governmental work, including proposals to limit contractor access to sensitive or classified information and work assignments, which will continue to drive pockets of insourcing in various agencies, particularly in the intelligence market; 
 negative publicity and increased scrutiny of government contractors in general, including us, relating to U.S. government expenditures for contractor services and incidents involving the mishandling of sensitive or classified information; 
 U.S. government agencies awarding contracts on a technically acceptable/lowest cost basis, which could have a negative impact on our ability to win certain contracts; 
 increased competition from other government contractors and market entrants seeking to take advantage of certain of the trends identified above, and an industry trend towards consolidation, which may result in the emergence of companies that are better able to compete against us; 
 cost cutting and efficiency and effectiveness efforts by U.S. civilian agencies with a focus on increased use of performance measurement, program integrity efforts to reduce waste, fraud and abuse in entitlement programs, and renewed focus on improving procurement practices for and interagency use of IT services, including through the use of cloud based options and data center consolidation; 
 restrictions by the U.S. government on the ability of federal agencies to use lead system integrators, in response to cost, schedule, and performance problems with large defense acquisition programs where contractors were performing the lead system integrator role; 
 increasingly complex requirements and enforcement and reporting landscapes of the Department of Defense and the U.S. intelligence community, including cybersecurity, managing federal health care cost growth, competition, and focus on reforming existing government regulation of various sectors of the economy, such as financial regulation and healthcare; and 
 increasing small business regulations across the Department of Defense and civilian agency clients continue to gain traction, agencies are required to meet high small business set aside targets, and large business prime contractors are required to subcontract in accordance with considerable small business participation goals necessary for contract award. 
 Sources of Revenue 
 Substantially all of our revenue is derived from services provided under contracts and task orders with the U.S. government, primarily by our client staff and, to a lesser extent, our subcontractors. Funding for our contracts and task orders is generally linked to trends in budgets and spending across various U.S. government agencies and departments. We provide services under a large portfolio of contracts and contract vehicles to a broad client base, and we believe that our diversified contract and client base lessens potential volatility in our business; however, a reduction in the amount of services that we are contracted to provide to the U.S. government or any of our significant U.S. government clients could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. In particular, the Department of Defense is one of our significant clients, and the BCA originally required nine automatic spending cuts (referred to as sequestration of 109 billion annually from 2013 to 2021, half of which was intended to come from defense programs, though less than 1 billion has been cut for defense programs per year under the BCA. Mandatory sequestrations under the BCA were subsequently extended by the Bipartisan Budget Acts of 2013, 2015, 2018 and 2019, the Military Retired Pay Restoration Act, the CARES Act and the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act. The extension of the mandatory sequestration applies an 8.3 reduction in defense spending in each year from 2021 through 2031. This could result in a commensurate reduction in the amount of services that we are contracted to provide to the Department of Defense and could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations, and given the uncertainty of when and how these automatic reductions required by the BCA may return and/or be applied, we are unable to predict the nature or magnitude of the potential adverse effect. 
 Contract Types 
 We generate revenue under the following three basic types of contracts: 
 28 

Table of Contents 

 Cost-Reimbursable Contracts. Cost-reimbursable contracts provide for the payment of allowable costs incurred during performance of the contract, up to a ceiling based on the amount that has been funded, plus a fixed fee or award fee. As we increase or decrease our spending on allowable costs, our revenue generated on cost-reimbursable contracts will increase, up to the ceiling and funded amounts, or decrease, respectively. We generate revenue under two general types of cost-reimbursable contracts: cost-plus-fixed-fee and cost-plus-award-fee, both of which reimburse allowable costs and provide for a fee. The fee under each type of cost-reimbursable contract is generally payable upon completion of services in accordance with the terms of the contract. Cost-plus-fixed-fee contracts offer no opportunity for payment beyond the fixed fee. Cost-plus-award-fee contracts also provide for an award fee that varies within specified limits based upon the client s assessment of our performance against a predetermined set of criteria, such as targets for factors like cost, quality, schedule, and performance. 
 Time-and-Materials Contracts. Under contracts in this category, we are paid a fixed hourly rate for each direct labor hour expended, and we are reimbursed for billable material costs and billable out-of-pocket expenses inclusive of allocable indirect costs. We assume the financial risk on time-and-materials contracts because our costs of performance may exceed negotiated hourly rates. To the extent our actual direct labor, including allocated indirect costs, and associated billable expenses decrease or increase in relation to the fixed hourly billing rates provided in the contract, we will generate more or less profit, respectively, or could incur a loss. 
 Fixed-Price Contracts. Under a fixed-price contract, we agree to perform the specified work for a predetermined price. To the extent our actual direct and allocated indirect costs decrease or increase from the estimates upon which the price was negotiated, we will generate more or less profit, respectively, or could incur a loss. Some fixed-price contracts have a performance-based component, pursuant to which we can earn incentive payments or incur financial penalties based on our performance. Fixed-price level of effort contracts require us to provide a specified level of effort (i.e., labor hours), over a stated period of time, for a fixed price. 
 The amount of risk and potential reward varies under each type of contract. Under cost-reimbursable contracts, there is limited financial risk, because we are reimbursed for all allowable costs up to a ceiling. However, profit margins on this type of contract tend to be lower than on time-and-materials and fixed-price contracts. Under time-and-materials contracts, we are reimbursed for the hours worked using the predetermined hourly rates for each labor category. In addition, we are typically reimbursed for other contract direct costs and expenses at cost. We assume financial risk on time-and-materials contracts because our labor costs may exceed the negotiated billing rates. Profit margins on well-managed time-and-materials contracts tend to be higher than profit margins on cost-reimbursable contracts as long as we are able to staff those contracts with people who have an appropriate skill set. Under fixed-price contracts, we are required to deliver the objectives under the contract for a predetermined price. Compared to time-and-materials and cost-reimbursable contracts, fixed-price contracts generally offer higher profit margin opportunities because we receive the full benefit of any cost savings but generally involve greater financial risk because we bear the impact of any cost overruns. In the aggregate, the contract type mix in our revenue for any given period will affect that period's profitability. Changes in contract type as a result of re-competes and new business could influence the percentage/mix in unanticipated ways. 
 The table below presents the percentage of total revenue for each type of contract as of the respective periods presented: 
 Three Months Ended September 30, Six Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 2024 2023 Cost-reimbursable 57 55 56 55 Time-and-materials 23 24 23 24 Fixed-price 20 21 21 21 
 Contract Diversity and Revenue Mix 
 We provide services to our clients through a large number of single award contracts, contract vehicles, and multiple award contract vehicles. Most of our revenue is generated under indefinite delivery/indefinite quantity, or IDIQ, contract vehicles, which include multiple award government wide acquisition contract vehicles, or GWACs, and General Services Administration Multiple Award Schedule Contracts, or GSA schedules, and certain single award contracts. GWACs and GSA schedules are available to all U.S. government agencies. Any number of contractors typically competes under multiple award IDIQ contract vehicles for task orders to provide particular services, and we earn revenue under these contract vehicles only to the extent that we are successful in the bidding process for task orders. 
 29 

Table of Contents 

 We generate revenue under our contracts and task orders through our provision of services as both a prime contractor and subcontractor, as well as from the provision of services by subcontractors under contracts and task orders for which we act as the prime contractor. The mix of these types of revenue affects our operating margin. Substantially all of our operating margin is derived from direct client staff labor, as the portion of our operating margin derived from fees we earn on services provided by our subcontractors is not significant. We view growth in direct client staff labor as the primary driver of earnings growth. Direct client staff labor growth is driven by client staff headcount growth, after attrition, and total backlog growth. 
 Our People 
 Revenue from our contracts is derived from services delivered by client staff and, to a lesser extent, from our subcontractors. Our ability to hire, retain, and deploy talent with skills appropriately aligned with client needs is critical to our ability to grow our revenue. We continuously evaluate whether our talent base is properly sized and appropriately compensated, and contains an optimal mix of skills to be cost competitive and meet the rapidly evolving needs of our clients. We seek to achieve that result through recruitment and management of capacity and compensation. As of September 30, 2024 and 2023, we employed approximately 35,800 and 33,100 people, respectively, of which approximately 32,700 and 30,200, respectively, were client staff. 
 Contract Backlog 
 We define backlog to include the following three components: 
 Funded Backlog. Funded backlog represents the revenue value of orders for services under existing contracts for which funding is appropriated or otherwise authorized less revenue previously recognized on these contracts. 
 Unfunded Backlog. Unfunded backlog represents the revenue value of orders (including optional orders) for services under existing contracts for which funding has not been appropriated or otherwise authorized. 
 Priced Options. Priced contract options represent 100 of the revenue value of all future contract option periods under existing contracts that may be exercised at our clients option and for which funding has not been appropriated or otherwise authorized. 
 Our backlog does not include contracts that have been awarded but are currently under protest and also does not include any task orders under IDIQ contracts, except to the extent that task orders have been awarded to us under those contracts. 
 The following table summarizes the value of our contract backlog as of the respective periods presented: 
 September 30, 2024 September 30, 2023 (In millions) Backlog (1): Funded 6,612 6,282 Unfunded 10,317 10,128 Priced options 24,325 18,630 Total backlog 41,254 35,040 (1) Backlog presented includes backlog acquired from the Company s acquisition of PGSC during the six months ended September 30, 2024. Total backlog acquired from PGSC was approximately 230.5 million at the date of acquisition. 
 
 Our total backlog consists of remaining performance obligations, certain orders under contracts for which the period of performance has expired, and unexercised option period and other unexercised optional orders. As of September 30, 2024 and March 31, 2024, the Company had 11.0 billion and 8.7 billion of remaining performance obligations, respectively. We expect to recognize approximately 70 of the remaining performance obligations as of September 30, 2024 as revenue over the next 12 months, and approximately 80 over the next 24 months. The remainder is expected to be recognized thereafter. However, given the uncertainties discussed below, as well as the risks described in Item 1A. Risk Factors of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2024, we can give no assurance that we will be able to convert our backlog into revenue in any particular period, if at all. Our backlog includes orders under contracts that in some cases extend for several years. The U.S. Congress generally appropriates funds for our clients on a yearly basis, even though their contracts with us may call for performance that is expected to take a number of years to complete. As a result, contracts typically are only partially funded at any point during their term and all or some of the work to be performed under the contracts may remain unfunded unless and until the U.S. Congress makes subsequent appropriations and the procuring agency allocates funding to the contract.

 We view growth in total backlog and client staff headcount as the two key measures of our potential business growth. Growing and deploying client staff is the primary means by which we are able to achieve profitable revenue growth. To the extent that we are able to hire additional client staff and deploy them against funded backlog, we generally recognize increased revenue. Total backlog increased by 17.7 from September 30, 2023 to September 30, 2024. Additions to funded backlog during the twelve months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 totaled 11.8 billion and 10.8 billion, respectively, as a result of the conversion of unfunded backlog to funded backlog, the award of new contracts and tas k orders under which funding was appropriated, and the exercise and subsequent funding of priced options. We report internally on our backlog on a monthly basis and review backlog upon occurrence of certain events to determine if any adjustments are necessary. 
 We cannot predict with any certainty the portion of our backlog that we expect to recognize as revenue in any future period and we cannot guarantee that we will recognize any revenue from our backlog. The primary risks that could affect our ability to recognize such revenue on a timely basis or at all are: program schedule changes, contract modifications, and our ability to assimilate and deploy new client staff against funded backlog; cost-cutting initiatives and other efforts to reduce U.S. government spending, which could reduce or delay funding for orders for services; and delayed funding of our contracts due to delays in the completion of the U.S. government's budgeting process and the use of continuing resolutions by the U.S. government to fund its operations. The amount of our funded backlog is also subject to change, due to, among other factors: changes in congressional appropriations that reflect changes in U.S. government policies or priorities resulting from various military, political, economic, or international developments; changes in the use of U.S. government contracting vehicles, and the provisions therein used to procure our services and adjustments to the scope of services, or cancellation of contracts, by the U.S. government at any time. In our recent experience, none of the following additional risks have had a material negative effect on our ability to realize revenue from our funded backlog: the unilateral right of the U.S. government to cancel multi-year contracts and related orders or to terminate existing contracts for convenience or default; in the case of unfunded backlog, the potential that funding will not be made available; and, in the case of priced options, the risk that our clients will not exercise their options. 
 In addition, contract backlog includes orders under contracts for which the period of performance has expired, and we may not recognize revenue on the funded backlog that includes such orders due to, among other reasons, the tardy submission of invoices by our subcontractors and the expiration of the relevant appropriated funding in accordance with a predetermined expiration date such as the end of the U.S. government's fiscal year. The revenue value of orders included in contract backlog that has not been recognized as revenue due to period of performance expirations has not exceeded approximately 4.5 of total backlog as of September 30, 2024 or during any of the three preceding fiscal quarters. 
 We expect to recognize revenue from a substantial portion of funded backlog as of September 30, 2024 within the next twelve months. However, given the uncertainties discussed above, as well as the risks described in Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors, of our fiscal 2024 Annual Report on Form 10-K, we can give no assurance that we will be able to convert our backlog into revenue in any particular period, if at all. 
 Government Audit Impact on Operating Income 
 As noted in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2024 , in the ordinary course of business, agencies of the U.S. government for which the Company is engaged as a prime contractor or a subcontractor, including the Defense Contract Audit Agency, audit the Company s claimed costs and conduct inquiries and investigations of our business practices with respect to government contracts. Such audits may result in, and have historically resulted in, the Company s inability to retain certain claimed costs, including executive and employee compensation, due to differing views of the allowability and reasonableness of such costs. 
 Following the settlement of the civil and criminal investigation of the Company by the U.S. Department of Justice DOJ previously disclosed in Note 20, Commitments and Contingencies, to the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2024, audits for years subsequent to the Company s fiscal year 2011 have resumed and remain subject to final resolution. As discussed in Note 15, Commitments and Contingencies, to the condensed consolidated financial statements, the Company recognized a reserve for estimated adjustments to historical claimed costs in respect of the years subsequent to fiscal 2011. As audits of the periods subsequent to 2011 are completed, our estimates of adjustment to claimed costs for these periods could change. Any such change could materially impact our reported revenue, operating income, net income and basic and diluted earnings per common share. 
 Operating Costs and Expenses 
 Costs associated with compensation and related expenses for our people are the most significant component of our operating costs and expenses. The principal factors that affect our costs are additional people as we grow our business and are awarded new contracts, task orders, and additional work under our existing contracts, and the hiring of people with specific skill sets and security clearances as required by our additional work. 
 Our most significant operating costs and expenses are described below. 
 31 

Table of Contents 

 Cost of Revenue . Cost of revenue includes direct labor, related employee benefits, and overhead. Overhead consists of indirect costs, including indirect labor relating to infrastructure, management and administration, and other expenses. 
 Billable Expenses. Billable expenses include direct subcontractor expenses, travel expenses, and other expenses incurred to perform on contracts. 
 General and Administrative Expenses. General and administrative expenses include indirect labor of executive management and corporate administrative functions, marketing and bid and proposal costs, legal costs, and other discretionary spending. 
 Depreciation and Amortization . Depreciation and amortization includes the depreciation of computers, leasehold improvements, furniture and other equipment, and the amortization of internally developed software, as well as third-party software that we use internally, and of identifiable long-lived intangible assets over their estimated useful lives. 
 Seasonality 
 The U.S. government's fiscal year ends on September 30 of each year. While not certain, it is not uncommon for U.S. government agencies to award extra tasks or complete other contract actions in the weeks before the end of its fiscal year in order to avoid the loss of unexpended fiscal year funds. In addition, we also have historically experienced higher bid and proposal costs in the months leading up to the U.S. government's fiscal year end as we pursue new contract opportunities being awarded shortly after the U.S. government fiscal year end as new opportunities are expected to have funding appropriated in the U.S. government's subsequent fiscal year. We may continue to experience this seasonality in future periods, and our future periods may be affected by it. While not certain, changes in the government's funding and spending patterns have altered historical seasonality trends, supporting our approach to managing the business on an annual basis. 
 Seasonality is just one of a number of factors, many of which are outside of our control, which may affect our results in any period. See Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors, of our fiscal 2024 Annual Report on Form 10-K. 
 
 Critical Accounting Estimates and Policies 
 Our critical accounting estimates and policies are disclosed in the Critical Accounting Estimates and Policies section in Part II, Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended March 31, 2024. Other than the change in estimate resulting in a reduction to our provision for claimed costs, there were no other material changes to our critical accounting policies, estimates or judgments that occurred during the periods covered by this report. See Note 15 , Commitments and Contingencies, to our condensed consolidated financial statements for additional information related to the aforementioned change in estimate.

 Revenue 
 Revenue increased 18.0 to 3.1 billion, and 14.4 to 6.1 billion, respectively for the three and six months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the prior year period. The increase was primarily driven by strong demand for our services and solutions as well as continued headcount growth and higher billable expenses. In addition, revenue was positively impacted by 121.7 million representing the reduction to our provision for claimed costs recorded during the second quarter of fiscal 2025. See Note 15, Commitments and Contingencies, to the condensed consolidated financial statements for further information. Total headcount as of September 30, 2024 increased by approximately 2,700 as compared to September 30, 2023. 
 Cost of Revenue 
 Cost of revenue as a percentage of revenue was 43.3 and 46.2 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 , respectively, and 44.9 and 46.7 for the six months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 , respectively. Cost of revenue increased 10.5 and 10.0 for the three and six months ended September 30, 2024 , respectively, as compared to the three and six months ended September 30, 2023 . The increases were primarily due to increases in salaries and salary-related benefits of 149.2 million and 284.5 million, respectively, driven by increased headcount and salary increases, partially offset by decreases in other business expenses and professional fees of 10.6 million and 29.9 million, respectively, as compared to the prior year. 
 Billable Expenses 
 Billable expenses as a percentage of revenue were 30.8 and 30.9 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 , respectively, and 31.4 and 30.8 for the six months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 , respectively. Billable expenses increased 17.4 and 16.9 for the three and six months ended September 30, 2024 , respectively, as compared to the three and six months ended September 30, 2023 . The increases were primarily attributable to increases in the use of subcontractors driven by client demand and timing of client needs, as well as increases in expenses from contracts requiring the Company to incur other direct expenses and travel on behalf of clients as compared to the prior year. 
 General and Administrative Expenses 
 General and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue were 7.2 and 11.3 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 , respectively, and 9.1 and 11.6 for the six months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 , respectively. General and administrative expenses decreased 25.1 and 9.8 for the three and six months ended September 30, 2024 , respectively, as compared to the three and six months ended September 30, 2023 .

 Fiscal 2025 r eflects 115.3 million in insurance recoveries from claims related to the Company s fiscal 2024 settlement as described in Note 20, Commitments and Contingencies, to the consolidated financial statements contained within the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2024. Partially offsetting the above were increases in salary and salary related benefits of 22.0 million and other business expenses of 8.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the prior year. 
 In addition to the insurance recoveries noted above, the year-to date period was also impacted by a 27.5 million reserve from fiscal 2024 associated with the U.S. Department of Justice's investigation of the Company, not present in the current year, partially offset by increases in salary and salary related benefits of 41.1 million and increases in other business expenses and professional fees of 27.7 million as compared to the prior year. 
 Depreciation and Amortization 
 Depreciation and amortization expense increased 2.8 and 0.5 for the three and six months ended September 30, 2024 , respectively, as compared to the three and six months ended September 30, 2023 , primarily driven by intangible amortization related to acquisitions and asset purchases to support the business. 
 Interest Expense 
 Interest expense increased 5.1 and 15.9 for the three and six months ended September 30, 2024 , respectively, as compared to the three and six months ended September 30, 2023 , primarily due to increases of approximately 3.4 million and 13.1 million, respectively, in bond interest expense related to the 650.0 million Senior Notes due 2033, issued by the Company in August of fiscal 2024. 
 Other Income, net 
 Other income (expense), net increased to 11.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 from 3.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023 , and increased to 16.9 million for the six months ended September 30, 2024 from 5.5 million for the six months ended September 30, 2023 . The increases in other income, net were primarily driven by an increase of 11.2 million in the fair value of the Company s investments reflected in the second quarter of fiscal 2025. 
 Income Tax Expense 
 Income tax expense increased to 123.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 from 55.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023 , an increase of 123.8 , and increased to 172.4 million for the six months ended September 30, 2024 from 94.6 million for the six months ended September 30, 2023 , an increase of 82.3 . The effective tax rate decreased to 24.0 from 24.4 , primar ily due to excess tax benefits from stock based compensation and a reduction in non-deductible expense. 
 
 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 As of September 30, 2024, our total liquidity was 1.6 billion, consisting of 558.7 million of cash and cash equivalents and 998.6 million available under the Revolving Credit Facility. In the opinion of management, we will be able to meet our liquidity and cash needs through a combination of cash flows from operating activities, available cash balances, and available borrowing under the Revolving Credit Facility. If these resources need to be augmented, additional cash requirements would likely be financed through the issuance of debt or equity securities. 
 The following table presents selected financial information as of September 30, 2024 and March 31, 2024 and for the first six months of fiscal 2025 and 2024: 
 September 30, 2024 March 31, 2024 (Unaudited) (In thousands) Cash and cash equivalents 558,724 554,257 Total debt 3,393,275 3,411,816

 Six Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 (Unaudited) (Unaudited) (In thousands) Net cash provided by (used in) operating activities 639,219 (118,917) Net cash used in investing activities (153,272) (37,002) Net cash (used in) provided by financing activities (481,480) 308,353 Net increase in cash and cash equivalents 4,467 152,434 
 From time to time, we evaluate alternative uses for excess cash resources once our operating cash flow and required debt servicing needs have been met. Some of the possible uses of our remaining excess cash at any point in time may include funding strategic acquisitions, further investment in our business and returning value to shareholders through share repurchases, quarterly dividends, and special dividends. 
 Historically, we have been able to generate sufficient cash to fund our operations, mandatory debt and interest payments, capital expenditures, and discretionary funding needs. However, due to fluctuations in cash flows, including as a result of the trends and developments described above under Factors and Trends Affecting Our Results of Operations relating to U.S. government shutdowns, U.S. government cost-cutting, reductions or delays in the U.S. government appropriations and spending process and other budgetary matters, it may be necessary from time-to-time in the future to borrow under our Credit Agreement to meet cash demands. While the timing and financial magnitude of these possible actions are currently indeterminable, we expect to be able to manage and adjust our capital structure to meet our liquidity needs. Our expected liquidity and capital structure may also be impacted by discretionary investments and acquisitions that we could pursue. We anticipate that cash provided by operating activities, existing cash and cash equivalents, and borrowing capacity under our Revolving Credit Facility will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash requirements for the next twelve months, which primarily include: 
 operating expenses, including salaries; 
 working capital requirements to fund both organic and inorganic growth of our business; 
 capital expenditures which primarily relate to the purchase of computers, business systems, furniture and leasehold improvements to support our operations; 
 the ongoing maintenance around all financial management systems; 
 commitments and other discretionary investments; 
 debt service requirements for borrowings under our Credit Agreement and interest payments for the Senior Notes due 2028, Senior Notes due 2029 and Senior Notes due 2033; and 
 cash taxes to be paid. 
 Our ability to fund our operating needs depends, in part, on our ability to generate positive cash flows from operations or, if necessary, raise cash in the capital markets. In addition, from time to time we evaluate conditions to opportunistically access the financing markets to secure additional debt capital resources and improve the terms of our indebtedness. 
 On June 7, 2024, the Company completed the acquisition of PAR Government Systems Corporation PGSC ), a wholly owned subsidiary of PAR Technology Corporation, for approximately 98.7 million, net of post-closing adjustments and incurred transaction costs as part of the acquisition. See Note 5, Acquisition, Goodwill and Intangible Assets, to our condensed consolidated financial statements for additional information related to the acquisition of PGSC. 
 Cash Flows 
 Cash received from clients, either from the payment of invoices for work performed or for advances in excess of costs incurred, is our primary source of cash. We generally do not begin work on contracts until funding is appropriated by the client. Billing timetables and payment terms on our contracts vary based on a number of factors, including whether the contract type is cost-reimbursable, time-and-materials, or fixed-price. We generally bill and collect cash more frequently under cost-reimbursable and time-and-materials contracts, as we are authorized to bill as the costs are incurred or work is performed. In contrast, we may be limited to bill certain fixed-price contracts only when specified milestones, including deliveries, are achieved. In addition, a number of our contracts may provide for performance-based payments, which allow us to bill and collect cash prior to completing the work.

Table of Contents 

 Accounts receivable is the principal component of our working capital and is generally driven by revenue growth with other short-term fluctuations related to the payment practices of our clients. Our accounts receivable reflects amounts billed to our clients as of each balance sheet date. Our clients generally pay our invoices within 30 days of the invoice date, although we experience a longer billing and collection cycle with our global commercial customers. At any month-end, we also include in accounts receivable the revenue that was recognized in the preceding month, which is generally billed early in the following month. Finally, we include in accounts receivable amounts related to revenue accrued in excess of amounts billed, primarily on our fixed-price and cost-reimbursable-plus-award-fee contracts. The total amount of our accounts receivable can vary significantly over time, but is generally sensitive to revenue levels and customer mix. 
 Operating Cash Flow 
 Net cash provided by operations is primarily affected by the overall profitability of our contracts, our ability to invoice and collect cash from clients in a timely manner, our ability to manage our vendor payments and the timing of cash paid for income taxes. Continued uncertainty in global economic conditions, including any potential impact of the U.S. government s failure to raise the debt ceiling, may also affect our business as customers and suppliers may decide to downsize, defer, or cancel contracts, which could negatively affect our operating cash flows. Net cash provided by operations was 639.2 million for the six months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 118.9 million of net cash used in operations in the prior year period. Operating cash was primarily driven by strong collections and overall revenue growth. In addition, fiscal 2025 reflects 115.3 million in insurance recoveries from claims related to the Company s fiscal 2024 settlement as described in Note 20, Commitments and Contingencies, to the consolidated financial statements contained within the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2024. The Company also changed its payroll cadence during the second quarter of fiscal 2025, resulting in a positive operating cash flow impact at period end. 
 Beginning in fiscal 2023, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 eliminated the option to deduct research and development expenditures immediately in the year incurred and requires taxpayers to amortize such expenditures over five years for U.S. based research and development. This provision negatively impacted our fiscal 2024 cash from operations, but had an offsetting impact on the deferred tax asset. The Company expects a similar impact in fiscal 2025, although the impact to cash and deferred taxes is expected to be smaller than in fiscal 2024. Prospectively, the future impact of this provision will depend on if and when this provision is deferred, modified, or repealed by Congress, including if retroactively, any guidance issued by the Treasury Department regarding the identification of appropriate costs for capitalization, and the amount of future research and development expenses paid or incurred (among other factors). While the largest impact was to fiscal 2023 cash from operations, the impact will continue over the five year amortization period, but will decrease over the period and is expected to be less significant in year six. 
 Investing Cash Flow 
 Net cash used in investing activities was 153.3 million in the six months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 37.0 million in the prior year period. The increase in investing cash used over the prior year was primarily due to the Company's acquisition of PGSC. 
 Financing Cash Flow 
 Net cash used in financing activities was 481.5 million in the six months ended September 30, 2024 compared to net cash provided by financing activities of 308.4 million in the prior year period. The increase in financing cash used year over year was primarily due to a 500.0 million draw on the Company s revolving credit facility in the prior year, not present this year, partially offset by an increase of 139.4 million in share repurchases year over year. 
 Dividends and Share Repurchases 
 On October 25, 2024, the Company announced a regular quarterly cash dividend in the amount of 0.51 per share. The quarterly dividend is payable on December 4, 2024 to stockholders of record on November 15, 2024. 
 During the three and six months ended September 30, 2024 , quarterly cash dividends of 0.51 and 1.02 per share, respectively, were declared and paid totaling 65.8 million and 133.0 million , respectively. During the three and six months ended September 30, 2023 , quarterly cash dividends of 0.47 and 0.94 per share, respectively, were declared and paid totaling 62.1 million and 125.1 million, respectively. 
 On December 12, 2011, the Board of Directors approved a share repurchase program, which was most recently increased by 525.0 million to 3,085.0 million on May 22, 2024 . The Company may repurchase shares pursuant to the program by means of open market repurchases, directly negotiated repurchases or through agents acting pursuant to negotiated repurchase agreements. During the first six months of fiscal 2025, the Company purchased 2.1 million shares of the Company's Class A Common Stock for an aggregate of 308.5 million. As of September 30, 2024, the Company had approximately 699.7 million remaining under the repurchase program.

 Any determination to pursue one or more of the above alternative uses for excess cash is subject to the discretion of our Board of Directors, and will depend upon various factors, including our results of operations, financial condition, liquidity requirements, restrictions that may be imposed by applicable law, our contracts, and our Credit Agreement as amended and other factors deemed relevant by our Board of Directors. 
 Indebtedness 
 Booz Allen Hamilton Inc. Booz Allen Hamilton ), Booz Allen Hamilton Investor Corporation Investor ), and certain wholly owned subsidiaries of Booz Allen Hamilton are parties to a Credit Agreement dated as of July 31, 2012, as amended (the Credit Agreement ), with certain institutional lenders and Bank of America, N.A., as Administrative Agent, Collateral Agent and Issuing Lender. As of September 30, 2024, the Credit Agreement provided Booz Allen Hamilton with a 1,567.5 million Term Loan A Term Loan A and a 1.0 billion revolving credit facility (the Revolving Credit Facility ), with a sub-limit for letters of credit of 200.0 million. As of September 30, 2024, the maturity date of Term Loan A and the Revolving Commitments is September 7, 2027. Voluntary prepayments of Term Loan A and the Revolving Loans are permitted at any time, in minimum principal amounts, without premium or penalty. Booz Allen Hamilton s obligations and the guarantors guarantees under the Credit Agreement were secured by a first priority lien on substantially all of the assets (including capital stock of subsidiaries) of Booz Allen Hamilton, Investor and the subsidiary guarantors, subject to certain exceptions set forth in the Credit Agreement and related documentation; such security was released in connection with Booz Allen Hamilton obtaining investment grade ratings from both Moody's and S P. On September 7, 2022 (the Ninth Amendment Effective Date ), the previously outstanding Term Loan B loans under the Credit Agreement were prepaid in full. 
 On July 27, 2023 (the Tenth Amendment Effective Date ), Booz Allen Hamilton entered into a Tenth Amendment (the Amendment to the Credit Agreement (as amended prior to the Tenth Amendment Effective Date, the Existing Credit Agreement and, as amended by the Amendment, the Amended Credit Agreement with Bank of America, N.A., as administrative agent (in such capacity, the Administrative Agent ), and the lenders and other financial institutions party thereto, in order to make permanent certain changes to the Existing Credit Agreement in connection with Booz Allen Hamilton obtaining investment grade ratings from both Moody's and S P and prepaying the Term Loan B loans in full and to make certain additional changes in connection therewith, including, among other things, (i) removing the requirements for the obligations under the Amended Credit Agreement to be secured, (ii) removing the requirement for any subsidiary or other affiliate of Booz Allen Hamilton (other than the Company) to provide any guarantee of the obligations under the Amended Credit Agreement and (iii) removing or modifying certain covenants applicable to Booz Allen Hamilton. Pursuant to the Amendment, all guarantees in respect of the Existing Credit Agreement have been released. The Amendment did not impact any of the terms of the Credit Agreement related to amortization or payments. 
 On the Tenth Amendment Effective Date in connection with the Amendment, the Company entered into a Guarantee Agreement (the Guarantee Agreement in favor of the Administrative Agent, pursuant to which the Company guarantees on an unsecured basis the obligations of Booz Allen Hamilton under the Amended Credit Agreement subject to certain conditions. Pursuant to the Amended Credit Agreement Booz Allen Hamilton has the option, though not any obligation, to join one or more of its domestic subsidiaries as a guarantor under the Guarantee Agreement. 
 Term Loan A amortizes in consecutive quarterly installments in an amount equal to (i) on the last business day of each full fiscal quarter that begins after the Ninth Amendment Effective Date but on or before the two year anniversary of the Ninth Amendment Effective Date, 0.625 of the stated principal amount of Term Loan A and (ii) on the last business day of each full fiscal quarter that begins after the two year anniversary of the Ninth Amendment Effective Date but before the five year anniversary of the Ninth Amendment Effective Date, 1.25 of the stated principal amount of Term Loan A. The remaining balance of Term Loan A will be payable upon maturity. 
 The rate at which Term Loan A and the Revolving Loans bear interest will be based either on Term SOFR (subject to a 0.10 adjustment and a floor of zero) for the applicable interest period or a base rate (equal to the highest of (i) the administrative agent s prime corporate rate, (ii) the overnight federal funds rate plus 0.50 and (iii) three-month Term SOFR (subject to a 0.10 adjustment and a floor of zero) plus 1.00 ), in each case plus an applicable margin, payable at the end of the applicable interest period and in any event at least quarterly. The applicable margin for Term Loan A and the Revolving Loans ranges from 1.00 to 2.00 for Term SOFR loans and zero to 1.00 for base rate loans, in each case based on the lower of (i) the applicable rate per annum determined pursuant to a consolidated total net leverage ratio grid and (ii) the applicable rate per annum determined pursuant to a ratings grid. Unused Revolving Commitments are subject to a quarterly fee ranging from 0.10 to 0.35 based on the lower of (i) the applicable fee rate per annum determined pursuant to a consolidated total net leverage ratio grid and (ii) the applicable fee rate per annum determined pursuant to a ratings grid. Booz Allen Hamilton has also agreed to pay customary letter of credit and agency fees. 
 The Company occasionally borrows under the Revolving Credit Facility for our working capital needs. There were no borrowings during the second quarter of fiscal 2025 and as of September 30, 2024 and March 31, 2024, respectively, there was no outstanding balance on the Revolving Credit Facility. 
 37 

Table of Contents 

 Borrowings under Term Loan A, and if used, the Revolving Credit Facility, incur interest at a variable rate. As of September 30, 2024, Booz Allen Hamilton had interest rate swaps with an aggregate notional amount of 550.0 million. These instruments hedge the variability of cash outflows for interest payments on the Credit Agreement. The Company's objectives in using cash flow hedges are to reduce volatility due to interest rate movements and to add stability to interest expense. See Note 9, Derivatives, to our condensed consolidated financial statements for further information. 
 The Credit Agreement contains customary representations and warranties and customary affirmative and negative covenants. In connection with Booz Allen Hamilton obtaining investment grade ratings from both Moody's and S P, certain activities previously restricted by certain negative covenants are permitted subject to pro forma compliance with the financial covenants and no events of default having occurred or are continuing. In addition, Booz Allen Hamilton is required to meet certain financial covenants at each quarter end, specifically the consolidated net total leverage ratio. As of September 30, 2024 and March 31, 2024, Booz Allen Hamilton was in compliance with all financial covenants associated with its debt and debt-like instruments. 
 As of September 30, 2024 and March 31, 2024, the Company was contingently liable under open standby letters of credit and bank guarantees issued by our banks in favor of third parties that totaled 4.5 million and 4.4 million, respectively. These letters of credit and bank guarantees primarily support insurance and bid and performance obligations. At September 30, 2024 and March 31, 2024, respectively, approximately 1.4 million and 1.3 million of these instruments reduced the available borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility. The remainder is guaranteed under a separate 7.5 million facility of which 4.5 million and 4.4 million was available to the Company at September 30, 2024 and March 31, 2024, respectively.
