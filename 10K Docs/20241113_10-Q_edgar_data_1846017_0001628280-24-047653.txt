 Loans are recorded at amortized cost, which includes principal balance, net deferred fees or costs, premiums and discounts. The Company elected to exclude accrued interest receivable from amortized cost. Accrued interest receivable is reported separately in the consolidated balance sheets and totaled million and million at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. Loan origination fees and certain direct loan origination costs are deferred and the net fee or cost is recognized in interest income as an adjustment of yield.

 The portfolio classes in the above table have unique risk characteristics with respect to credit quality: 
 Payment on multifamily and commercial real estate mortgages is driven principally by operating results of the managed properties or underlying business and secondarily by the sale or refinance of such properties. Both primary and secondary sources of repayment and the value of the properties in liquidation, may be affected to a greater extent by adverse conditions in the real estate market or the economy in general. 
 Properties underlying construction loans often do not generate sufficient cash flows to service debt and thus repayment is subject to the ability of the borrower and, if applicable, guarantors, to complete development or construction of the property and carry the project, often for extended periods of time. As a result, the performance of these loans is contingent upon future events whose probability at the time of origination is uncertain.

 Other Fair Value Disclosures 
 Fair value estimates, methods and assumptions for the Company s financial instruments that are not recorded at fair value on a recurring or non-recurring basis are set forth below. 
 Securities held-to-maturity : The Company s securities held-to-maturity portfolio is carried at amortized cost less allowance for credit losses. The fair values of debt securities held-to-maturity are provided by a third-party pricing service. The pricing service may use quoted market prices of comparable instruments or a variety of other forms of analysis, incorporating inputs that are currently observable in the markets for similar securities. Inputs that are often used in the valuation methodologies include, but are not limited to, benchmark yields, credit spreads, default rates, prepayment speeds and non-binding broker quotes. 
 Loans, net : Fair values are estimated for portfolios of loans with similar financial characteristics. Loans are segregated by type, such as residential mortgage and consumer. Each loan category is further segmented into fixed and adjustable rate interest terms and by performing and non-performing categories. Estimated fair value of loans is determined using a discounted cash flow model that employs an exit discount rate that reflects the current market pricing for loans with similar characteristics and remaining maturity, adjusted for estimated credit losses inherent in the portfolio at the balance sheet date. 
 Time deposits : The fair value of time deposits is based on the discounted value of contractual cash flows. The discount rate is estimated using rates for currently offered deposits of similar remaining maturities.

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 
 Our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our condensed consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of income and expenses during the reporting periods. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates and assumptions. Our actual results could differ from these estimates. 
 
 Comparison of Operating Results for the Three Months Ended September 30, 2024 and 2023

Interest income for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was 21.5 million, an increase of 1.4 million, or 6.7 , from 20.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023, driven by increases in the rates earned on all categories of interest-earning assets, partially offset by a decrease in the average balances of all categories of interest-earning assets. The yield on average interest-earning assets increased 35 basis points to 4.32 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 from 3.97 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. 
 Interest Expense . Interest expense was 12.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 10.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023, an increase of 2.1 million primarily driven by increases in rates paid on interest-bearing liabilities. The average balance of time deposits increased 130.3 million, while the average balances of interest-bearing core deposits and FHLB advances decreased 86.2 million and 48.3 million, respectively, when compared to the third quarter of 2023. The cost of average interest-bearing liabilities increased 54 basis points to 3.03 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 from 2.49 for the three months ended September 30, 2023.

 Provision for Credit Losses . The Company recorded a 248 thousand provision for credit losses for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to a 717 thousand release of provision for credit losses for the same period of 2023. During the three months ended September 30, 2024, the provision for off-balance sheet exposures of 264 thousand was driven by an increase in unused lines and commitments to originate loans.

 Non-interest Income . Non-interest income totaled 387 thousand and 369 thousand for the third quarters of 2024 and 2023, respectively, an increase of 18 thousand, or 4.9 , when comparing the two periods. 
 Non-interest Expense . Non-interest expense increased 873 thousand to 13.3 million for the third quarter of 2024 when compared to the same period in 2023. The increase was primarily driven by increases of 666 thousand in compensation and benefits expenses, 167 thousand in professional fees and 126 thousand in occupancy and equipment expense, partially offset by decreases of 61 thousand in data processing expense and 27 thousand in FDIC premiums. 
 Income Tax Expense . The Company did not record a tax benefit for the loss incurred during the current or previous year quarter due to the full valuation allowance required on its deferred tax assets. The Company s current tax position reflects the previously established full valuation allowance on its deferred tax assets.

Comparison of Operating Results for the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 
 General . The Company recorded a net loss of 9.2 million and 4.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. 
 Interest Income. Interest income totaled 63.7 million and 58.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. This represents an increase of 4.9 million, or 8.3 , driven primarily by increases in rates earned on all categories of interest-earning assets.

The yield on average interest-earning assets increased 39 basis points to 4.30 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, from 3.91 for the same period in 2023. 
 Interest Expense . For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, interest expense increased 9.5 million to 35.6 million when compared to the 2023 period due primarily to increases in the rates paid on interest-bearing liabilities. Average interest-bearing deposit balances increased 37.0 million when compared to the 2023 period, while average borrowings decreased 43.3 million. The cost of average interest-bearing liabilities increased 78 basis points to 2.93 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from 2.15 for the same period in 2023.

The release of provision on loans and securities totaled 1.1 million and 36 thousand, respectively, while a provision was recorded on commitments and letters of credit of 94 thousand for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. The decrease in the provision for credit losses was primarily driven by forecasted improvements to economic drivers utilized to model credit losses, coupled with a decline in loan balances. The provision on commitments and letters of credit for the 2024 period was due to an increase in unused lines. 
 Non-interest Income . For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, non-interest income was 1.4 million and 1.2 million, respectively. The increase of 141 thousand, or 11.4 , was due, in part, to a gain on sale of REO property of 123 thousand recorded in the second quarter of 2024. 
 Non-interest Expense . Non-interest expense totaled 39.7 million and 39.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, an increase of 705 thousand. The increase was primarily driven by increases of 938 thousand in compensation and benefits expense and 474 thousand in occupancy and equipment expense. These increases were partially offset by decreases in data processing of 475 thousand and professional fees of 224 thousand. The Company added a branch to its network in the fourth quarter of 2023. 
 Income Tax Expense . The Company did not record a tax benefit for the loss incurred during the first nine months of the current or previous year due to the full valuation allowance required on its deferred tax assets. The Company s current tax position reflects the previously established full valuation allowance on its deferred tax assets.

Comparison of Financial Condition at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 
 Total Assets. Total assets were 2.06 billion and 2.04 billion at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. 
 Cash and cash equivalents . Cash and cash equivalents increased 30.1 million, or 65 , to 76.1 million at September 30, 2024 from 46.0 million at December 31, 2023 as deposit growth and loan repayments outpaced loan originations. 
 Securities available-for-sale. Securities available-for-sale increased 7.0 million, or 2.5 , to 290.8 million at September 30, 2024 from 283.8 million at December 31, 2023, driven by a favorable increase of 7.8 million in the unrealized loss on available-for-sale securities, partially offset by maturities, calls and paydowns that outpaced purchases during the period. 
 Securities held-to-maturity. Held-to-maturity securities totaled 33.1 million and 33.3 million at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. 
 FHLB stock and other investments. Other investments decreased 2.1 million to 18.2 million at September 30, 2024 due to a decrease in the amount of Federal Home Loan Bank stock held by the Company as a result of a reduction of borrowings from FHLB. 
 Gross Loans . Gross loans held for investment decreased 9.7 million to 1.55 billion at September 30, 2024, from 1.56 billion at December 31, 2023. Residential loans and multifamily loans decreased 34.2 million and 16.3 million, respectively, partially offset by increases in construction loans of 19.7 million, commercial real estate loans of 9.2 million and consumer loans of 7.7 million. During the third quarter, the Company purchased 7.8 million of residential loans and an 8.0 million participation in a pool of consumer loans. Year-to-date in 2024, loan fundings include 17.2 million in construction loans, 7.0 million in commercial and industrial loans and 2.7 million in junior liens. 
 The following table presents loans at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 allocated by loan category: 
 September 30, 2024 December 31, 2023 (In thousands) Residential 516,754 550,929 Multifamily 666,304 682,564 Commercial real estate 241,711 232,505 Construction 80,081 60,414 Junior liens 24,174 22,503 Commercial and industrial 14,228 11,768 Consumer and other 7,731 47 Total loans 1,550,983 1,560,730 Less: Allowance for credit losses 13,012 14,154 Loans receivable, net 1,537,971 1,546,576

 Total Deposits. Total deposits were 1.32 billion at September 30, 2024, an increase of 73.8 million, or 5.9 , from December 31, 2023. Time deposits increased 104.6 million, or 17.5 , to 701.3 million at September 30, 2024 from 596.6 million at December 31, 2023. Checking and savings accounts decreased 30.9 million, or 4.8 , to 617.4 million at September 30, 2024 from 648.3 million at December 31, 2023. Uninsured and uncollateralized deposits to third party customers were 159.6 million, or 12 of total deposits, at the end of the quarter. 
 The following table presents the totals of deposit accounts by account type, at the dates shown below: 
 September 30, 2024 December 31, 2023 (In thousands) Non-interest bearing deposits 22,254 27,739 NOW and demand accounts (1) 357,503 361,139 Savings (1) 237,651 259,402 Core deposits 617,408 648,280 Time deposits 701,262 596,624 Total deposits 1,318,670 1,244,904 
 (1) Money market accounts are included within the NOW and demand accounts and savings captions. 
 Borrowings. The Company had 348.5 million of borrowings at September 30, 2024, a decrease of 49.0 million, or 12.3 from 397.5 million at December 31, 2023 as the increase in deposits were partially used to pay down borrowings. Borrowings consist solely of Federal Home Loan Bank of New York advances. 
 Total Shareholders Equity. Total shareholders equity decreased by 16.3 million, or 4.6 , to 339.3 million at September 30, 2024 compared to 355.6 million at December 31, 2023. The decrease was primarily driven by the repurchase of treasury shares, including net shares, of 1,464,390 shares at a cost of 14.4 million or 9.80 per share. Additionally, the year-to-date loss, partially offset by favorable changes in accumulated other comprehensive income, also contributed to the decrease. 
 Off-Balance Sheet. To help manage our interest rate position, the Company had 274.0 million in interest rate hedges at September 30, 2024, with a weighted average duration of 2.5 years and a weighted average rate of 2.16 . This represents a increase of 15.0 million from December 31, 2023, when we had 259.0 million in interest rate hedges with a weighted average duration of 3.2 years and a weighted average rate of 2.58 . See Note 8, Derivatives and Hedging Activities, of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 1- Financial Statements.

ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURE ABOUT MARKET RISK 
 Qualitative Analysis . Our most significant form of market risk is interest rate risk because, as a financial institution, the majority of our assets and liabilities are sensitive to changes in interest rates. Therefore, a principal part of our operations is to manage interest rate risk and limit the exposure of our balance sheet and results of operations to changes in market interest rates. Our ALCO/Investment Committee, which consists of members of management, is responsible for evaluating the interest rate risk inherent in our assets and liabilities, for determining the level of risk that is appropriate, given our business strategy, operating environment, capital, liquidity and performance objectives, and for managing this risk consistent with the policy and guidelines approved by our board of directors. We currently utilize a modeling program, on a quarterly basis, to evaluate our sensitivity to changing interest rates, given our business strategy, operating environment, capital, liquidity and performance objectives, and for managing this risk consistent with the guidelines approved by the board of directors. 
 We have sought to manage our interest rate risk in order to minimize the exposure of our earnings and capital to changes in interest rates. We have implemented the following strategies to manage our interest rate risk: growing target deposit accounts, such as small business accounts; utilizing our investment securities portfolio and interest rate swaps as part of our balance sheet asset and liability and interest rate risk management strategy to reduce the impact of movements in interest rates on net interest income and economic value of equity, which can create temporary valuation adjustments to equity in Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income; continuing the diversification of our loan portfolio by adding more commercial loans, which typically have shorter maturities and/or balloon payments. 
 By following these strategies, we believe that we are positioned to react to increases and decreases in market interest rates. 
 Other than cash flow hedging on interest expense, we generally do not engage in hedging activities such as engaging in futures or options, or investing in high-risk mortgage derivatives such as collateralized mortgage obligation residual interests, real estate mortgage investment conduit residual interests or stripped mortgage-backed securities. 
 The Company has entered into derivative financial instruments to reduce risk associated with interest rate volatility by matching asset maturities and liability maturities. These derivatives had an aggregate notional amount of 274.0 million as of September 30, 2024. 
 Quantitative Analysis. We compute amounts by which the net present value of our cash flow from assets, liabilities and off-balance-sheet items would change in the event of a range of assumed changes in market interest rates. The economic value of equity EVE analysis estimates the change in the net present value NPV of assets and liabilities and off-balance-sheet contracts over a range of immediate rate shock interest rate scenarios. This model uses a discounted cash flow analysis and an option-based pricing approach to measure the interest rate sensitivity of net portfolio value. The model estimates the economic value of each type of asset, liability and off-balance-sheet contract under the assumption that the United States Treasury yield curve increases or decreases instantaneously by 100 to 200 basis points in 100 basis point increments. A basis point equals one-hundredth of one percent, and 100 basis points equals one percent. An increase in interest rates from 3 to 4 would mean, for example, a 100-basis point increase in the Basis Point Change in Interest Rates column below. 
 The following table sets forth, at September 30, 2024, the calculation of the estimated changes to the Bank s net interest income, at the Bank level, that would result from the specified immediate changes in the United States Treasury yield curve. For purposes of this table, 100 basis points equals 1 . 
 Net Interest Income Change in Interest Rates (basis points) Amount Change Percent (Dollars in thousands) +200 42,686 (1,003) (2.3) +100 43,363 (326) (0.7) 0 43,689 -100 45,913 2,224 5.1 -200 47,813 4,124 9.4 
 
 46 

The following table sets forth, at September 30, 2024, the calculation of the estimated changes in our net portfolio value, at the Bank level, that would result from the specified immediate changes in the United States Treasury yield curve. For purposes of this table, 100 basis points equals 1 . 
 EVE NPV as a Percent of Portfolio Value of Assets Change in Interest Rates (basis points) Estimated EVE Estimated Increase (Decrease) Amount Percent NPV Ratio Change (Dollars in thousands) +200 134,348 (79,013) (37.0) 6.5 (3.8) +100 174,039 (39,322) (18.4) 8.5 (1.9) 0 213,361 10.4 -100 250,637 37,276 17.5 12.2 1.8 -200 287,124 73,763 34.6 14.0 3.6 
 The tables above indicates that at September 30, 2024, in the event of an instantaneous 100 basis point increase in interest rates, we would experience a 18 decrease in EVE. In the event of an instantaneous 100 basis point decrease in interest rates, we would experience a 17 increase in EVE. 
 Certain short comings are inherent in the methodologies used in the above interest rate risk measurements. Modeling changes require making certain assumptions that may or may not reflect the manner in which actual yields and costs respond to changes in market interest rates. The above tables assume that the composition of our interest sensitive assets and liabilities existing at the date indicated remains constant uniformly across the yield curve regardless of the duration or repricing of specific assets and liabilities. Accordingly, although the table provides an indication of our interest rate risk exposure at a particular point in time, the data does not reflect any actions we may take in response to changes in interest rates. In addition, such measurements are not intended to and do not provide a precise forecast of the effect of changes in market interest rates on our NPV and will differ from actual results. 
 
 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 Liquidity is the ability to meet current and future financial obligations of a short-term and long-term nature. Our primary sources of funds consist of deposit inflows, principal and interest payments on loans and securities, maturity of securities, borrowings from the Federal Home Loan Bank of New York and, to a lesser extent, proceeds from the sale of securities. While maturities and scheduled amortization of loans and securities are predictable sources of funds, deposit flows, calls of investment securities and borrowed funds and prepayments on loans are greatly influenced by general interest rates, economic conditions and competition. 
 Management regularly adjusts our investments in liquid assets based upon an assessment of (1) expected loan demand, (2) expected deposit flows, (3) yields available on interest-earning deposits and securities, and (4) the objectives of our interest-rate risk and investment policies. 
 At September 30, 2024, we had 31.3 million in commitments to originate loans and unused lines of credit totaled 74.6 million. We anticipate that we will have sufficient funds available to meet our current loan origination and lines of credit commitments. Certificates of deposit that are scheduled to mature in less than one year from September 30, 2024 totaled 689.3 million. Management expects, based on historical experience, that a deposit relationship will be retained with a substantial portion of certificate holders. However, if a substantial portion of these deposits is not retained, we may borrow against our available borrowing capacity or raise interest rates on deposits to attract new accounts, which may result in higher levels of interest expense. Available borrowing capacity at September 30, 2024 was 255.7 million with Federal Home Loan Bank of New York, a 30.0 million line of credit with a correspondent bank and a 48.2 million line of credit with the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. Total available borrowing capacity is 2.6 times total uninsured and uncollateralized deposits to third-party customers. The estimated fair market value of unencumbered securities totaled 261.5 million or 81.7 of the portfolio at September 30, 2024. 
 
 47 

We are a party to financial instruments with off-balance-sheet risk in the normal course of business to meet the financing needs of our customers. These financial instruments include commitments to originate loans, unused lines of credit and standby letters of credit, which involve elements of credit and interest rate risk in excess of the amount recognized in the consolidated balance sheets. Our exposure to credit loss is represented by the contractual amount of the instruments. We use the same credit policies in making commitments that we do for on-balance sheet instruments. Management believes that our current sources of liquidity are more than sufficient to fulfill our obligations as of September 30, 2024 pursuant to off-balance-sheet arrangements and contractual obligations. 
 
 The Bank is subject to various regulatory capital requirements administered by the New Jersey Department of Banking and Insurance NJDOBI and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation FDIC ). At September 30, 2024, the Bank exceeded all applicable regulatory capital requirements, and was considered well capitalized under regulatory guidelines.
