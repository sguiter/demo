Deferred Compensation Plan 
 
 The Company established a non-qualified deferred compensation plan ("DCP" or the Plan in April 2023 for eligible employees and members of the Board of Directors. The Plan provides eligible participants the opportunity to defer and invest a specified percentage of their compensation, including the Company stock awards upon vesting. The Plan is a non-qualified plan that is informally funded by assets in a rabbi trust, which restricts the Company's use and access to the assets held but is subject to the claims of the Company's creditors in the event that the Company becomes insolvent. The amount of compensation to be deferred by participants are based on their own elections and are adjusted for any investment changes that the participants direct. This plan does not provide for employer contributions. 
 
 The Plan permits diversification of vested shares (common stock) into other equity securities subject to a six-month holding period subsequent to vesting. Accounting for deferred common stock will be under either plan C or plan D. Accounting will depend on whether or not the employee has diversified the common stock. Under plan C, diversification is permitted but the employee has not diversified. Under plan D, diversification is permitted and the employee has diversified. 
 
 For common stock that have not been diversified, the employer stock held in the deferred compensation plan is classified in a manner similar to treasury stock and presented separately on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets as Company common stock held by the non-qualified deferred compensation plan. Common stock will be recorded at fair value of the stock at the time it vested, subsequent changes in the value of the common stock is not recognized. The deferred compensation obligations are measured independently at fair value of the common stock with a corresponding charge or credit to compensation cost. Fair value is determined as the product of the common stock and the closing price of the stock each reporting period. 
 
 Under plan D, assets held by the rabbi trust are subject to applicable GAAP. The deferred compensation obligation is measured independently at fair value of the underlying assets. 
 
 The Company previously presented certain DCP transactions within existing financial statement line items of the condensed consolidated balance sheets and condensed consolidated statement of stockholders equity for periods ended September 30, 2023 and December 31, 2023. The Company has reflected these DCP transactions related corrections in the accompanying condensed consolidated balance sheets and condensed consolidated statement of stockholders equity for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024. The transactions resulted in reclassifying equity balances related to "Non-qualified deferred compensation plan share awards" as mezzanine equity for million and they were combined with stock-based compensation expense in the condensed consolidated statement of stockholders equity for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024. The Company has evaluated the errors both qualitatively and quantitatively and has concluded that they have immaterial impact on the periods presented.

. Stock-based compensation related to performance share grants are measured based on grant date fair value and expensed on a graded basis over the service period of the awards, which is generally a performance period of . The performance conditions are based on the Company's achievement of revenue growth and return on invested capital over the performance period, and are evaluated for the probability of vesting at the end of each reporting period with changes in expected results cumulatively recognized as an adjustment to expense. The assumptions used to calculate the fair value of restricted stock grants are evaluated and revised, as necessary, to reflect market conditions and the Company s experience.

 Concrete Construction Products Revenue. Concrete construction products represented approximately and of total net sales for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. 
 
 Customer acceptance criteria. Generally, there are no customer acceptance criteria included in the Company's standard sales agreement with customers. When an arrangement with the customer does not meet the criteria to be accounted for as a revenue contract under the standard, the Company recognizes revenue in the amount of nonrefundable consideration received when the Company has transferred control of the goods or services and has stopped transferring (and has no obligation to transfer) additional goods or services. The Company offers certain customers discounts for paying invoices ahead of the due date, which are generally 30 to 60 days after the issue date. 
 
 Other revenue . Service sales, representing after-market repair and maintenance, engineering activities and software license sales and services were approximately of total net sales and recognized as the services are completed or by transferring control over a product to a customer at a point in time. Services may be sold separately or in bundled packages. The typical contract length for services is generally less than one year. For bundled packages, the Company accounts for individual services separately when they are distinct within the context of the contract. A distinct service is separately identifiable from other items in the bundled package if a customer can benefit from it on its own or with other resources that are readily available to the customer. The consideration (including any discounts) is allocated between separate services in a bundle based on their stand-alone selling prices. The stand-alone selling prices are determined based on the prices at which the Company separately sells the services. 
 
 Reconciliation of contract balances 
 
 Contract assets are the right to receive consideration in exchange for goods or services that the Company has transferred to a customer when that right is conditional on something other than the passage of time. Contract liabilities are recorded for any services billed to customers and not yet recognizable if the contract period has commenced or for the amount collected from customers in advance of the contract period commencing. 
 
 Contract liabilities consist of billings in excess of costs and earnings and other deferred revenue on cancellable contracts. The time period between when consideration was received to when performa nce obligations are complete may not be significant. As

Under the 2011 Plan, the Company may grant restricted stock and restricted stock units. The Company currently intends to award only performance-based stock units ("PSUs") and/or time-based restricted stock units ("RSUs"). 
 
 The Company allocates stock-based compensation expense amongst cost of sales, research and development and other engineering expense, selling expense, or general and administrative expense based on the job functions performed by the employees to whom the stock-based compensation is awarded. Stock-based compensation capitalized in inventory was immaterial for all periods presented. The Company recognized stock-based compensation expense related to its equity plans for employees of million and million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and million and million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. 
 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company granted an aggregate of RSUs and PSUs to the Company's employees, including officers at an estimated weighted-average fair value of per share based on the closing price (adjusted for certain market factors primarily the present value of dividends) of the Company's common stock on the grant date. The RSUs and PSUs granted to the Company's employees may be time-based, performance-based, or time and performance-based. Certain of the PSUs are granted to officers and key employees, where the number of performance-based awards to be issued is based on the achievement of certain Company performance criteria established in the award agreement over a cumulative period. These awards cliff vest after . In addition, these same officers and key employees also receive time-based RSUs, which vest pursuant to a graded vesting schedule. Time based RSUs are granted to the Company's employees excluding officers and certain key employees, vest ratably over the vesting-term of the award. 
 
 The Company s non-employee directors are entitled to receive an aggregate of approximately million in equity compensation annually under the Company's non-employee director compensation program. The number of shares ultimately granted are based on the average closing share price for the Company's common stock over the day period prior to approval of the award in the second quarter of each year. In May 2024, the Company granted shares of the Company's common stock to the non-employee directors, based on the average closing price of per share and recognized million of expense.

Overview 
 
 We design, manufacture and sell building construction products that are of high quality and performance, easy to use and cost-effective for customers. We operate in three business segments determined by geographic region: North America, Europe and Asia/Pacific. Within the North America segment, our sales efforts are aligned to customer market teams dedicated to serving the following markets: 
 
 Residential; 
 Commercial; 
 Original Equipment Manufacturers ("OEM"); 
 National Retail; and 
 Component Manufacturers 
 
 Our organic growth opportunities are focused on expanding our product lines with our current customers while also identifying new market share gain opportunities within our core product and market competencies. 
 
 In order to grow in these markets, we aspire to be among the leaders in engineered load-rated construction building products and systems and digital product offerings. We also aspire to leverage our engineering expertise, deep-rooted relationships with top builders, engineers, contractors, code officials and distributors, along with our ongoing commitment to testing, research and innovation. Importantly, we currently have existing products, testing results, distribution and manufacturing capabilities to support our Company ambitions. This will ultimately be a function of expanding our sales and/or marketing functions to promote our products to different end users and distribution channels, expanding our customer base, and introducing new products in the future. 
 
 Our commitment to continuous improvement has fostered our core Company ambitions, which we continue to pursue including: 
 
 Strengthen our values-based culture; 
 Be the partner of choice; 
 Be an innovative leader in the markets we operate; 
 Above market growth relative to the United States housing starts (exceeding our historical average volume performance in North America of approximately 250 basis points above the housing starts market); 
 An operating income margin within the top quartile of our proxy peers; and 
 Long-term, return to the top quartile of our proxy peers for return on invested capital. 
 
 We have made progress towards our key growth initiatives since they were first announced in 2021. A number of recent examples include: 
 
 The continued integration of ETANCO which has resulted in additional scale for our legacy European operations, as well as the opportunity to realize synergies in those operations; 
 North America sales volume grew by 500 basis points ahead of U.S. housing starts over the trailing twelve months ending September 30, 2024; 
 Acquisitions of a software company and a manufacturer of equipment used by component manufacturers as well as a manufacturer of pre-engineered structural support systems to expand our offering of solutions and potentially accelerate growth in the market; 
 Formed a new relationship agreement with a large independent co-op serving more than 12,000 retail hardware stores, home centers, and pro lumber dealers, which led to significant conversions of our connectors, fasteners and anchor products; 
 Recaptured a number of lumber dealers and a large Northwest pro-dealer in North America with the opportunity to expand the products lines; 
 Developed a national relationship with a leading building products manufacturer in North America to provide connectors and fasteners for their offsite construction solutions; 
 Rolled out 47 new products, globally, during the first three quarters of 2024; and 
 Converted component manufacturers to using our truss software and purchasing our truss plate and connector solution sets, including a major component manufacture. 
 
 We believe this progress is the result of our high service levels, increasingly diverse portfolio of products and software as well as our commitment to innovation and developing complete solutions for the markets we serve. As we continue to make progress on our key growth initiatives, we believe we can continue to achieve above market growth in the North America relative to 
 26 

United States housing starts for fiscal 2024 and beyond. These examples further emulate our Founder, Barclay Simpson s, nine principles of doing business, and more specifically the focus and obsession on customers and users. 
 
 Non-GAAP Financial Measures 
 
 In addition to financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP, we use Adjusted EBITDA as a non-GAAP financial measure in evaluating the ongoing operating performance of our business. The Company defines adjusted EBITDA as net income (loss) before income taxes, adjusted to exclude depreciation and amortization, integration, acquisition and restructuring costs, non-qualified deferred compensation adjustments, goodwill impairment, gain on bargain purchase, net loss or gain on disposal of assets, interest income or expense, and foreign exchange and other expense (income). We use adjusted EBITDA to provide additional insight into the Company s operating performance in light of the significant levels of growth investment we are continuing to make in our operations and the effect accelerated depreciation and acquisition and integration costs will have on our operating results. We believe this will also provide a better approximation of our cash flows compared to operating income. This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"). 
 
 Factors Affecting Our Results of Operations 
 
 The Company s business, financial condition and results of operations depend in large part on the level of United States housing starts and residential construction activity. Overall housing starts decreased 1.6 over the trailing twelve months ending September, 30, 2024 compared to the trailing twelve months ending September 30, 2023. Lower housing starts in the United States could result in lower demand, which would affect the Company's sales and possibly operating profit. 
 
 Unlike lumber or other products that have a more direct correlation to United States housing starts, our products are used to a greater extent in areas that are subject to natural forces, such as seismic or wind events. Our products are generally used in a sequential progression that follows the construction process. Residential and commercial construction begins with the foundation, followed by the wall and the roof systems, and then the installation of our products, which flow into a project or a house according to these schedules. 
 
 In prior years, our sales were heavily seasonal with operating results varying from quarter to quarter depending on weather conditions that could delay construction starts. Our sales and income have historically been lower in the first and fourth quarters than in the second and third quarters of a fiscal year. Increasing interest rates, rising energy costs, volatility in the steel market and stressed product transportation systems, as well as political events like elections, can also have an effect on our gross and operating profits as well. Due to efforts in diversifying our global footprint with the acquisition of ETANCO and changing our path to market in the United States, sales from our product line, customer base and customer purchases are becoming less seasonal. Changes in raw material cost could impact the amount of inventory on-hand, and negatively affect our gross profit and operating margins depending on the timing of raw material purchases or how much sales prices can be increased to offset any increases in raw material costs. 
 
 Our operations also expose us to risks associated with pandemics, epidemics or other public health crises. 
 
 Business Segment Information 
 
 Historically, our North America segment has generated more revenues from wood construction products compared to concrete construction products. North America net sales decreased slightly for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Our wood construction product net sales decreased 0.9 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to September 30, 2023. Our concrete construction product sales increased 5.9 over the same periods. We believe the United States 2024 housing starts market will be down relative to fiscal year 2023 housing starts. For the trailing twelve month period, housing starts have decreased compared to the prior twelve month period, while the Company's North America sales volumes increased over that same period. With the investments we have made and continue to make, we believe we will be able to continue to grow above the US housing starts market, one of our company ambitions. 
 
 Operating income decreased 39.2 million on lower gross profits as well as increased personnel costs (including engineering services), professional fees, and advertising and trade shows costs . Fiscal 2024 operating margins have and will include anticipated acquisition and integration related costs. North America 2024 results were impacted by economic headwinds but we believe in the long term potential given the on-going housing shortage. 
 
 During 2024, work continued on our Columbus, Ohio facility expansion as well as the building of the replacement of our Gallatin, Tennessee facility. We expect the expansion and replacement of these facilities will improve our overall service, 
 27 

production efficiencies and safety in the workplace, as well as reduce our reliance on certain outsourced finished goods and component products and continue to ensure we have ample capacity to meet our customer needs. These investments reinforce our core business model differentiators to remain the partner of choice as we continue to produce products locally and ensure superior levels of customer service. 
 
 Europe net sales decrease d slightly for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023, due to lower sales volumes and some regional price decreases, offset by the positive effect of 3.1 million in foreign currency translation , Wood construction product sales were flat f or the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to September 30, 2023 and concrete construction product sales, which are mostly project based, decreased slightly over the same periods. Gross profit decrea sed 5.4 million primarily due to increased factory overhead, warehouse and freight costs, as a percentage of net sales . Operating income decreased 9.9 million o n lower gross profits and higher operating expenses, partly offset by lower integration expenses. Fiscal 2024 operating margins will include anticipated acquisition and integration related costs estimated to range between 3.5 million to 4.0 million . We currently anticipate Europe 2024 results to be impacted by economic headwinds but also believe in the long term potential given Europe's on-going housing shortage (with an increasing use of wood construction) and new environmental regulations for which we have products and solutions. 
 
 Our Asia/Pacific segment has generated revenues from both wood and concrete construction products. We believe that the Asia/Pacific segment is not significant to our overall performance. 
 
 Business Outlook 
 
 The Company updated its financial outlook for the full fiscal year ending December 31, 2024 based on three quarters of actual results, and its latest expectations regarding demand trends, raw material costs and operating expenses as follows: 
 
 Operating margin is estimated to be in the range of 19.0 to 19.5 , including approximately 85.0 million in depreciation and amortization expense. 
 
 The effective tax rate is estimated to be in the range of 25.3 to 25.8 , including both federal and state income tax rates as well as international income tax rates, and assuming no tax law changes are enacted. 
 
 Capital expenditures are estimated to range between 175.0 and 185.0 million, which includes 90.0 to 100.0 million for the Columbus, Ohio facility expansion and the new Gallatin, Tennessee fastener facility construction with the remaining spend carrying over into 2025.

Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 
 We have historically met our capital needs through a combination of cash flows from operating activities and, when necessary, borrowings under our credit facilities. Our principal uses of capital include the costs and expenses associated with our operations, including financing working capital requirements and continuing our capital allocation strategy, which includes supporting capital expenditures, paying cash dividends, repurchasing the Company's common stock, and financing other investment opportunities from time to time. 
 
 On March 30, 2022, the Company entered into an Amended and Restated Credit Agreement. The Amended and Restated Credit Agreement provides for a 5-year revolving credit facility of 450.0 million, which includes a letter of credit sub-facility up to 50.0 million and for a 5-year term loan facility of 450.0 million. As of September 30, 2024, the Company had borrowings of 75.0 million under the revolving credit facility and 393.8 million under the term loan facility, and has 375.0 million available to borrow under the revolving credit facility. 
 
 As of September 30, 2024, our cash and cash equivalents consisted of deposits and money market funds held with established national financial institutions including 118.3 million that are held in the local currencies of our foreign operations and could be subject to additional taxation if repatriated to the U.S. The Company is maintaining a permanent reinvestment assertion on its foreign earnings relative to remaining cash held outside the United States. 
 
 The following table shows selected financial information as of September 30, 2024, December 31, 2023 and September 30, 2023, respectively: 
 As of September 30, As of December 31, As of September 30, (in thousands) 2024 2023 2023 Cash and cash equivalents 339,427 429,822 571,006 Property, plant and equipment, net 495,822 418,612 382,508 Equity investment, goodwill and intangible assets 962,502 883,079 854,154 Working capital excluding cash and cash equivalents 617,388 521,362 479,624 
 
 The following table presents the significant categories of cash flows was used or provided during the nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively: 
 Nine Months Ended September 30, (in thousands) 2024 2023 Net cash provided by (used in): Operating activities 222,365 398,177 Investing activities (202,115) (66,554) Financing activities (111,032) (58,175) 
 
 Cash flows from operating activities result primarily from our earnings before non-cash items such as depreciation, amortization, and stock-based compensation, and are also affected by changes in operating assets and liabilities which consist primarily of working capital balances. Our revenues are derived from manufacturing and sales of building construction materials. Our operating cash flows are impacted by prevailing macro-economic conditions and subject to seasonality, which is cyclically associated with the volume and timing of construction project starts. For example, as a result of seasonality our trade accounts receivable are generally lowest at the end of the fourth quarter and increases during the first, second and third quarters as construction activity ramps in markets we serve. 
 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, operating activities provided 222.4 million in cash, as a result of 266.8 million from net income plus 75.6 million non-cash expenses such as depreciation and amortization and stock-based compensation. This amount was partly offset by 120.0 million used for the net change in operating assets and liabilities. The net change in operating assets and liabilities included increases of 73.5 million in trade accounts receivable and 28.1 million in inventory. 
 
 35 

Cash used in investing activities of 202.1 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily used for facility expansion projects, and machinery and equipment purchases as well as the acquisitions of Calculated Structured Designs, Inc., Monet DeSauw Inc. and certain properties of Callaway Properties, LLC and QuickFrames USA, LLC. Due to updated forecasts on the timing of the spend and subject to future events and circumstances, capital expenditures are estimated to range between 175.0 million and 185.0 million for 2024 including the expected spend of 90.0 million to 100.0 million on our previously announced Columbus, Ohio facility expansion and the construction of a new Gallatin, Tennessee facility, with the remaining spend estimated to range between 65.0 million and 75.0 million carrying over to 2025. The remaining capital expenditures will be primarily focused on purchases of new equipment to support increased productivity and efficiencies, enhancements to our existing facilities to expand our manufacturing footprint in-line with increasing customer needs, as well as investments for adjacencies and key growth initiatives. 
 
 Cash used in financing activities of 111.0 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 consisted primarily of 50.0 million in stock repurchases, 34.7 million used to pay dividends to our stockholders and 20.1 million used for debt repayment. 
 
 On October 23, 2024, the Company's Board of Directors (the "Board") declared a quarterly cash dividend of 0.28 per share payable on January 23, 2025, to the Company's stockholders of record on January 2, 2025, and authorized the Company to repurchase up to 100.0 million of the Company's common stock, effective January 1, 2025 through December 31, 2025. 
 
 From October 1, 2024 to November 5, 2024, the Company purchased 275,906 shares of the Company's common stock at an average price of 181.22 per share, for a total of 50.0 million. 
 
 Since the beginning of 2021 through November 5, 2024, we have returned 418.4 million to stockholders, which represents 47.5 of our free cash flow from operations during the same period, and over the same period the Company has repurchased ov er 1.9 million shares of the Company's common stock, which represents approximately 4.5 of the outstanding shares of the Company's common stock at the start of 2021. 
 
 Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures 
 (In thousands) (Unaudited) 
 
 A reconciliation of adjusted EBITDA to net income, the most directly comparable GAAP measure, is set forth below.

 Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 
 
 We did not have any off-balance sheet arrangements as of September 30, 2024. 

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk. 
 
 We have operations both within the United States and internationally, and are exposed to market risks in the ordinary course of our business. 
 
 36 

Foreign Exchange Risk 
 
 We have foreign exchange rate risk in our international operations, and through purchases from foreign vendors. Changes in the values of currencies of foreign countries affect our financial position, income statement and cash flows when translated into U.S. Dollars. We estimate that if the exchange rate were to change by 10 in any one country where we have our operations, the change in net income would not be material to our operations taken as a whole. 
 
 We may manage our exposure to transactional exposures by entering into foreign currency forward contracts for forecasted transactions and projected cash flows for foreign currencies in future periods. In 2022 and 2023, we entered into financial contracts at various times to hedge the risk of fluctuations associated with the Euro and the Chinese Yuan during 2023. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we have not entered into foreign currency contracts. 
 
 Interest Rate Risk 
 
 Our primary exposure to interest rate risk results from outstanding borrowings under the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, which bears interest at variable rates. As of September 30, 2024, the outstanding debt under the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement subject to interest rate fluctuations was 468.8 million. The variable interest rates on the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement fluctuate and expose us to short-term changes in market interest rates as our interest obligation on this instrument is based on prevailing market interest rates. Interest rates fluctuate as a result of many factors, including governmental monetary and tax policies, domestic and international economic and political considerations and other factors that are beyond our control. 
 
 We have an interest rate swap agreement converting the variable interest rate on the balances outstanding under our Amended and Restated Credit Agreement to fixed interest rates. The objective of the interest rate swap agreement is to eliminate the variability of the interest payment cash flows associated with the variable interest rate outstanding under the borrowings. We designated the interest rate swaps as cash flow hedges. Refer to Note 8 , "Derivatives and Hedging Instruments", for further information on our interest rate swap contracts in effect as of September 30, 2024. 
 
 Commodity Price Risk 
 
 In the normal course of business, we are exposed to market risk related to our purchase of steel, a significant raw material upon which our manufacturing depends. Steel cost started to stabilize by the end of 2023 and continue to be stable through the first nine months of 2024 . While steel is typically available from numerous suppliers, the price of steel is a commodity subject to fluctuations that apply across broad spectrums of the steel market. We do not use any derivative or hedging instruments to manage steel price risk. If the price of steel increases, our variable costs would also increase. While historically we have successfully mitigated these increased costs through the implementation of price increases, in the future we may not be able to successfully mitigate these costs, which could cause our operating margins to decline. 

Item 4. Controls and Procedures. 
 
 Disclosure Controls and Procedures. As of September 30, 2024, the Company carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of the Company s management, including the chief executive officer the CEO and the chief financial officer (the CFO ), of the effectiveness of the Company s disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) and 15-d-15(e) under the Exchange Act of 1934. Based on this evaluation, the Company s CEO and CFO have concluded that the Company s disclosure controls and procedures were effective at the reasonable assurance level. Disclosure controls and procedures are controls and other procedures designed reasonably to assure that information required to be disclosed in the Company s reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures are also designed reasonably to assure that this information is accumulated and communicated to the Company s management, including the CEO and the CFO, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 
 
 The Company s management, including the CEO and the CFO, does not, however, expect that the Company s disclosure controls and procedures or the Company s internal control over financial reporting will prevent all fraud and material errors. Internal control over financial reporting, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. In addition, the design of a control system must reflect the facts that there are resource constraints and that the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. The inherent limitations in internal control over financial reporting include the realities that judgments can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake. Controls also can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people, or by management override of controls. The design of any system of internal control is also based in part 
 37 

on assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be only reasonable, not absolute assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential events and conditions. Over time, controls may become inadequate because of changes in circumstances, or the degree of compliance with the policies and procedures may deteriorate. 
 
 Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting . There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting identified in management's evaluation pursuant to Rules 13a-15(d) or 15d-15(d) of the Exchange Act during the three months ended September 30, 2024, that materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company's internal control over financial reporting. 

PART II OTHER INFORMATION 

Item 1. Legal Proceedings. 
 
 From time to time, the Company is involved in various legal proceedings and other matters arising in the normal course of business. Corrosion, hydrogen embrittlement, cracking, material hardness, wood pressure-treating chemicals, misinstallations, misuse, design and assembly flaws, manufacturing defects, labeling defects, product formula defects, inaccurate chemical mixes, adulteration, environmental conditions, or other factors can contribute to failure of fasteners, connectors, anchors, adhesives, specialty chemicals, such as fiber reinforced polymers, and tool products. In addition, inaccuracies may occur in product information, descriptions and instructions found in catalogs, packaging, data sheets, and the Company s website. 
 
 The Company currently is not a party to any legal proceedings which the Company expects individually or in the aggregate to have a material adverse effect on the Company s financial condition, cash flows or results of operations. Nonetheless, the resolution of any claim or litigation is subject to inherent uncertainty and we could in the future incur judgments, enter into settlements of claims or revise our expectations regarding the outcome of the various legal proceedings and other matters we are currently involved in, which could materially impact our financial condition, cash flows or results of operations. Refer to Note 13, Commitments and Contingencies, to the accompanying unaudited interim consolidated financial statements for a discussion of recent developments related to certain of the legal proceedings in which we are involved.
