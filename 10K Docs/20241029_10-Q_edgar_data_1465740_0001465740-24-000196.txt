 million, with million paid upon closing and million recognized as a payable to Freedom within the other liabilities line item on the Company s condensed consolidated balance sheet as of September 30, 2023. The Company performed a provisional allocation of the consideration of million to RoundPoint s assets and liabilities, as set forth below. During the three months ended December 31, 2023, the Company recognized a total of million in measurement period adjustments, resulting in a final purchase price of million. The remaining payable to Freedom of million was paid in January 2024. The allocation of the adjusted purchase price of million to RoundPoint s assets and liabilities is also set forth below. The determination of fair value of assets and liabilities required the use of significant assumptions and estimates. Significant estimates included, but were not limited to, future expected cash flows, including projected revenues and expenses, and discount rates. These estimates were based on assumptions that management believes to be reasonable as well as a third party-prepared valuation analysis; however, actual results may differ from these estimates.

 million, are amortized straight-line over a finite life of based on the Company s determination of the time to change a trade name. The Company determined the licenses and approvals, with a total acquisition date fair value of million, have indefinite useful lives and are periodically evaluated for impairment given there are no legal, regulatory, contractual, competitive or economic factors that would limit their useful lives. 
 The total goodwill of million was calculated as the excess of the total consideration transferred over the net assets acquired and primarily includes the existence of an assembled workforce, synergies and benefits expected to result from combining operations with RoundPoint and adding in-house servicing. The full amount of goodwill for tax purposes of million is expected to be deductible. The Company will assess the goodwill annually during the fourth quarter and in interim periods whenever events or circumstances make it more likely than not that an impairment may have occurred. 
 Acquisition-related costs are expensed in the period incurred and included within the other operating expenses line item in the Company s condensed consolidated statements of comprehensive income (loss). During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, the Company recognized million and million, respectively, of acquisition-related costs. The Company did not recognize any further acquisition-related costs in 2024. 
 As discussed above, the acquisition of RoundPoint closed effective September 30, 2023. Accordingly, RoundPoint s consolidated balance sheet is included within the Company s consolidated balance sheet as of September 30, 2024. Beginning October 1, 2023, RoundPoint s results of operations have been consolidated with the Company s in accordance with U.S. GAAP; inter-company accounts and transactions have been eliminated.)

 (1) The Company s revenue is defined as the sum of the interest income, servicing income and total other income line items on the condensed consolidated statements of comprehensive income (loss). 
 
 The above unaudited supplemental pro forma financial information has not been adjusted for transactions that are now considered inter-company as a result of the acquisition, the conforming of accounting policies, nor the divestiture of RoundPoint s retail origination business and RPX servicing exchange platform, as required by the stock purchase agreement. The unaudited supplemental pro forma financial information also does not include any anticipated synergies or other anticipated benefits of the RoundPoint acquisition and, accordingly, the unaudited supplemental pro forma financial information is not necessarily indicative of either future results of operations or results that might have been achieved had the acquisition been consummated on January 1, 2023. 
 Additionally, in the third quarter of 2022, TH MSR Holdings agreed to engage RoundPoint as a subservicer prior to the closing date and began transferring loans to RoundPoint in the fourth quarter of 2022. As such, prior to the acquisition on September 30, 2023, the Company incurred servicing expenses related to RoundPoint s subservicing of the Company s MSR of million and million, respectively, during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023. These subservicing expenses are included within the servicing costs line item on the Company s condensed consolidated statements of comprehensive income (loss).

 repurchase facility that is secured by the VFN, which is collateralized by the Company s MSR. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, all outstanding term notes previously issued by MSR Issuer Trust matured and were repaid. 
 Another of the Company s subsidiary trust entities, Servicing Advance Receivables Issuer Trust, was formed for the purpose of financing servicing advances through a revolving credit facility, pursuant to which Servicing Advance Receivables Issuer Trust issued a VFN backed by servicing advances pledged to the financing counterparty. 
 Both MSR Issuer Trust and Servicing Advance Receivables Issuer Trust are considered VIEs for financial reporting purposes and were reviewed for consolidation under the applicable consolidation guidance. As the Company has both the power to direct the activities of the trusts that most significantly impact the entities performance, and the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits of the entities that could be significant, the Company is the primary beneficiary and, thus, consolidates the trusts. Additionally, in accordance with arrangements entered into in connection with the securitization transaction and the servicing advance revolving credit facility, the Company has direct financial obligations payable to both MSR Issuer Trust and Servicing Advance Receivables Issuer Trust, which, in turn, support MSR Issuer Trust s obligations to noteholders under the securitization transaction and Servicing Advance Receivables Issuer Trust s obligations to the financing counterparty.

 (1) Receivables due from a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company to the trusts are eliminated in consolidation in accordance with U.S. GAAP. 
 
 Additionally, the Company entered into a definitive stock purchase agreement on August 2, 2022 to acquire RoundPoint whereby the preliminary purchase price was subject to a post-closing adjustment based on RoundPoint s aggregate earnings (as defined in the stock purchase agreement) from October 1, 2022 through the closing date, or the Interim Period, in addition to other post-closing adjustments. During the Interim Period, the manner in which the purchase price is calculated represented an implicit guarantee of the value of RoundPoint s net book value, in which the Company held the variable interests. These terms also indicated that RoundPoint met the criteria to be considered a VIE that the Company must review for consolidation. As the Company had the obligation to absorb losses and the right to receive benefits of RoundPoint during the Interim Period that could be significant, but not the power to direct the activities of RoundPoint that most significantly impacted its performance, the Company was not the primary beneficiary and, thus, did not consolidate RoundPoint during the Interim Period. Effective September 30, 2023, the parties had satisfied customary closing conditions and received the required regulatory and GSE approvals to close the transaction. Upon closing, RoundPoint became a consolidated wholly owned subsidiary of the Company and was no longer considered a VIE.

 At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company did not have any securities purchased from and financed with the same counterparty that did not meet the conditions of ASC 860, Transfers and Servicing , to be considered linked transactions and, therefore, classified as derivatives. 
 The Company is not required to consolidate VIEs for which it has concluded it does not have both the power to direct the activities of the VIEs that most significantly impact the entities performance, and the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits of the entities that could be significant. The Company s investments in these unconsolidated VIEs include all non-Agency securities, which are classified within available-for-sale securities, at fair value on the condensed consolidated balance sheets. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the carrying value, which also represents the maximum exposure to loss, of all non-Agency securities in unconsolidated VIEs was million and million, respectively.

 These assumptions and sensitivities are hypothetical and should be considered with caution. Changes in fair value based on 10 and 20 variations in assumptions generally cannot be extrapolated because the relationship of the change in assumptions to the change in fair value may not be linear. Also, the effect of a variation in a particular assumption on the fair value of MSR is calculated without changing any other assumptions. In reality, changes in one factor may result in changes in another e.g. , increased market interest rates may result in lower prepayments and increased credit losses) that could magnify or counteract the sensitivities. Further, these sensitivities show only the change in the asset balances and do not show any expected change in the fair value of the instruments used to manage the interest rates and prepayment risks associated with these assets. 
 Risk Mitigation Activities 
 The primary risks associated with the Company s MSR are changes in interest rates, mortgage spreads and prepayments. The Company economically hedges interest rate and mortgage spread risk primarily with its Agency RMBS portfolio. Prepayment risk is carefully monitored and partially mitigated through the Company s ability to retain the MSR, in certain circumstances, through recapture if the underlying loan is refinanced.

 Prior to the acquisition of RoundPoint, the Company did not directly service mortgage loans; instead, it contracted with appropriately licensed third-party subservicers to handle substantially all servicing functions in the name of the subservicer for the mortgage loans underlying the Company s MSR. These third-party subservicing costs and other servicing expenses directly related to the Company s MSR portfolio are included within the servicing costs line item on the Company s condensed consolidated statements of comprehensive income (loss). Post-acquisition, all servicing-related expenses incurred by RoundPoint as an operating company are included within the compensation and benefits and other operating expenses line items on the Company s condensed consolidated statements of comprehensive income (loss).

 The Company is subject to credit risk associated with its originated mortgage loans during the period of time prior to the sale of these loans. The Company considers credit risk associated with these loans to be minimal as it holds the loans for a short period of time and the market for these loans continues to be highly liquid. 
 The Company has one warehouse facility to finance its mortgage loans held-for-sale. At September 30, 2024, the Company had pledged mortgage loans held-for-sale with a carrying value of million as collateral for this warehouse facility. See Note 15 - Warehouse Facilities .

 The Company monitors its borrowings under repurchase agreements and revolving credit facilities, which are generally floating-rate debt, in relation to the rate profile of its portfolio. In connection with its risk management activities, the Company enters into a variety of derivative and non-derivative instruments to economically hedge interest rate risk or duration mismatch (or gap) by adjusting the duration of its floating-rate borrowings into fixed-rate borrowings to more closely match the duration of its assets. This particularly applies to borrowing agreements with maturities or interest rate resets of less than six months. Typically, the interest receivable terms e.g. , OIS or SOFR) of certain derivatives match the terms of the underlying debt, resulting in an effective conversion of the rate of the related borrowing agreement from floating to fixed. The objective is to manage the cash flows associated with current and anticipated interest payments on borrowings, as well as the ability to roll or refinance borrowings at the desired amount by adjusting the duration. To help manage the adverse impact of interest rate changes on the value of the Company s portfolio, its cash flows and its loan origination pipeline (consisting of IRLCs and mortgage loans held-for-sale), the Company may, at times, enter into various forward contracts, including short securities, TBAs, options, futures, swaps, caps, credit default swaps, total return swaps and forward mortgage loan sale commitments. In executing on the Company s current interest rate risk management strategy, the Company has entered into TBAs, interest rate swap and swaption agreements, futures, options on futures and forward mortgage loan sale commitments. 
 TBAs. The Company may use TBAs as a means of deploying capital until targeted investments are available or to take advantage of temporary displacements, funding advantages or valuation differentials in the marketplace. Additionally, the Company may use TBAs independently, or in conjunction with other derivative and non-derivative instruments, in order to mitigate risks. TBAs are forward contracts for the purchase (long notional positions) or sale (short notional positions) of Agency RMBS. The issuer, coupon and stated maturity of the Agency RMBS are predetermined as well as the trade price, face amount and future settle date (published each month by the Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association). However, the specific Agency RMBS to be delivered upon settlement is not known at the time of the TBA transaction. As a result, and because physical delivery of the Agency RMBS upon settlement cannot be assured, the Company accounts for TBAs as derivative instruments. 
 The Company may hold both long and short notional TBA positions, which are disclosed on a gross basis according to the unrealized gain or loss position of each TBA contract regardless of long or short notional position.

 Interest Rate Swaptions . The Company may use interest rate swaptions (which provide the option to enter into interest rate swap agreements for a predetermined notional amount, stated term and pay and receive interest rates in the future) independently, or in conjunction with other derivative and non-derivative instruments, in order to mitigate risks. The Company did not hold any interest rate swaptions as of September 30, 2024.

 Interest Rate Lock Commitments . The Company enters into IRLCs to originate residential mortgage loans at specified interest rates and terms within a specified period of time with customers who have applied for a loan and may meet certain credit and underwriting criteria. IRLCs are subject to changes in mortgage interest rates from the date of the commitment through the date of funding the loan or the cancellation or expiration of the lock commitment, generally ranging between and days. IRLCs are considered freestanding derivatives and are recorded at fair value at inception inclusive of the inherent value of servicing the loan. The Company did hold any IRLCs as of December 31, 2023. As of September 30, 2024, the Company had outstanding IRLCs of million in principal with a net fair value of million.

 days of origination. Forward mortgage loan sale commitments are recorded at fair value based on pricing of similar instruments in the secondary market based upon the investor, coupon, and estimated sale or delivery month. The Company s expectation of the amount of IRLCs that will ultimately close is a key factor in determining the notional amount of derivatives used in economically hedging the position. The Company did hold any forward mortgage loan sale commitments as of December 31, 2023. As of September 30, 2024, the Company had outstanding forward mortgage loan sale commitments of million in principal with a net fair value of thousand. 
 Credit Risk 
 The Company s exposure to credit losses on its Agency RMBS portfolio is limited due to implicit or explicit backing from either a GSE or a U.S. government agency. The payment of principal and interest on the Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae mortgage-backed securities are guaranteed by those respective agencies, and the payment of principal and interest on the Ginnie Mae mortgage-backed securities are backed by the full faith and credit of the U.S. government. 
 In future periods, the Company could enhance its credit risk protection, enter into further paired derivative positions, including both long and short credit default swaps, and/or seek opportunistic trades in the event of a market disruption. The Company also has processes and controls in place to monitor, analyze, manage and mitigate its credit risk with respect to non-Agency securities and mortgage loans held-for-sale. 
 Derivative financial instruments contain an element of credit risk if counterparties are unable to meet the terms of the agreements. Credit risk associated with derivative financial instruments is measured as the net replacement cost should the counterparties that owe the Company under such contracts completely fail to perform under the terms of these contracts, assuming there are no recoveries of underlying collateral, as measured by the market value of the derivative financial instruments. As of September 30, 2024, the fair value of derivative financial instruments as an asset and liability position was million and million, respectively.

 and of its AFS securities as Level 2 and Level 3 fair value assets, respectively, at September 30, 2024. 
 Mortgage servicing rights . The Company holds a portfolio of MSR that are carried at fair value on the condensed consolidated balance sheets. The Company determines fair value of its MSR based on prices obtained from third-party pricing vendors. Although MSR transactions may be observable in the marketplace, the details of those transactions are not necessarily reflective of the value of the Company s MSR portfolio. Third-party vendors use both observable market data and unobservable market data (including forecasted prepayment speeds, OAS and cost to service) as inputs into models, which help to inform their best estimates of fair value market price. As a result, the Company classified of its MSR as Level 3 fair value assets at September 30, 2024. 
 Mortgage loans held-for-sale . The Company s recognizes on its condensed consolidated balance sheets originated mortgage loans held-for-sale that are carried at fair value as a result of a fair value option election. The Company estimates fair value of mortgage loans held-for-sale using a market approach by utilizing either: (i) the fair value of securities backed by similar mortgage loans, adjusted for certain factors to approximate the fair value of a whole mortgage loan, including the value attributable to mortgage servicing and credit risk; (ii) current commitments to purchase loans; or (iii) recent observable market trades for similar loans, adjusted for credit risk and other individual loan characteristics. As these fair values are derived from market observable inputs, the Company classified of its mortgage loans held-for-sale as Level 2 fair value assets at September 30, 2024. 
 Derivative instruments . The Company may enter into a variety of derivative financial instruments as part of its hedging strategies, including over-the-counter, or OTC, derivative contracts, such as interest rate swaps and swaptions. The Company utilizes third-party brokers to value its OTC derivative instruments. The Company classified of its interest rate swaps reported at fair value as Level 2 at September 30, 2024. The Company did not hold any interest rate swaptions at September 30, 2024. 
 The Company may also enter into certain other derivative financial instruments, such as inverse interest-only securities, TBAs, futures and options on futures. The Company utilizes third-party pricing vendors to value inverse interest-only securities, as these instruments are similar in form to the Company s AFS securities. The Company classified of its inverse interest-only securities at fair value as Level 2 at September 30, 2024. TBAs, futures and options on futures are considered to be active markets such that participants transact with sufficient frequency and volume to provide transparent pricing information for identical instruments. The Company utilizes third-party pricing vendors to value TBAs, futures and options on futures. The Company reported of its TBAs and futures as Level 1 as of September 30, 2024. The Company did not hold any options on futures at September 30, 2024. 
 The Company also enters into IRLCs and forward mortgage loan sale commitments in connection with its origination activities. The Company determines fair value of its IRLCs based on valuation models that use the market price for similar loans sold in the secondary market, net of costs to close the loans, subject to the estimated loan funding probability or pull-through rate. Given the significant and unobservable nature of the pull-through rate assumption, the Company classified of its IRLCs as Level 3 at September 30, 2024. The valuation model for forward mortgage loan sale commitments utilizes the fair value of related mortgage loans determined using observable market data, and therefore, the Company reported of its forward mortgage loan sale commitments as Level 2 as of September 30, 2024. 
 The Company s policy is to minimize credit exposure related to financial derivatives used for hedging by limiting the hedge counterparties to major banks, financial institutions, exchanges, and private investors who meet established capital and credit guidelines as well as by limiting the amount of exposure to any individual counterparty.

 The Company may be required to measure certain assets or liabilities at fair value from time to time. These periodic fair value measures typically result from application of certain impairment measures under U.S. GAAP. These items would constitute nonrecurring fair value measures under ASC 820. As of September 30, 2024, the Company did not have any assets or liabilities measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis in the periods presented. 
 The valuation of Level 3 instruments requires significant judgment by the third-party pricing vendors and/or management. The third-party pricing vendors and/or management rely on inputs such as market price quotations from market makers (either market or indicative levels), original transaction price, recent transactions in the same or similar instruments, and changes in financial ratios or cash flows to determine fair value. Level 3 instruments may also be discounted to reflect illiquidity and/or non-transferability, with the amount of such discount estimated by the third-party pricing vendors in the absence of market information. Assumptions used by the third-party pricing vendors due to lack of observable inputs may significantly impact the resulting fair value and therefore the Company s condensed consolidated financial statements.

 Certain assets are measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis; that is, they are not measured at fair value on an ongoing basis but are subject to fair value adjustments only in certain circumstances, such as when there is evidence of impairment. Upon the occurrence of certain events, the Company re-measures the fair value of long-lived assets, including property, plant and equipment, operating lease right of use assets, intangible assets and goodwill if an impairment or observable price adjustment is recognized in the current period. No instances requiring re-measurement of assets measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis occurred during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. 
 Fair Value of Financial Instruments 
 In accordance with ASC 820, the Company is required to disclose the fair value of financial instruments, both assets and liabilities recognized and not recognized in the condensed consolidated balance sheets, for which fair value can be estimated. 
 The following describes the Company s methods for estimating the fair value for financial instruments. 
 AFS securities, MSR, mortgage loans held-for-sale and derivative assets and liabilities are recurring fair value measurements; carrying value equals fair value. See discussion of valuation methods and assumptions within the Fair Value Measurements section of this Note 12. 
 Cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash have a carrying value which approximates fair value because of the short maturities of these instruments. The Company categorizes the fair value measurement of these assets as Level 1. 
 Reverse repurchase agreements have a carrying value which approximates fair value due to their short-term nature. The Company categorizes the fair value measurement of these assets as Level 2.

 million under repurchase agreements and billion under revolving credit facilities that are considered long-term. The Company s long-term repurchase agreements and revolving credit facilities have floating rates based on an index plus a spread and the credit spread is typically consistent with those demanded in the market. Accordingly, the interest rates on these borrowings are at market and thus carrying value approximates fair value. The Company categorizes the fair value measurement of these liabilities as Level 2. 
 Term notes payable are recorded at outstanding principal balance, net of any unamortized deferred debt issuance costs. In determining the fair value of term notes payable, management judgment may be used to arrive at fair value that considers prices obtained from third-party pricing vendors, broker quotes received and other applicable market data. If observable market prices are not available or insufficient to determine fair value due principally to illiquidity in the marketplace, then fair value is based upon internally developed models that are primarily based on observable market-based inputs but also include unobservable market data inputs (including prepayment speeds, delinquency levels, and credit losses). The Company categorizes the fair value measurement of these liabilities as Level 2. 
 Convertible senior notes are carried at their unpaid principal balance, net of any unamortized deferred issuance costs. The Company estimates the fair value of its convertible senior notes using the market transaction price nearest to September 30, 2024. The Company categorizes the fair value measurement of these assets as Level 2.

Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 
 The following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q as well as our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. 

General 
 We are a Maryland corporation that invests in, finances and manages MSR and Agency RMBS, and, through our operational platform, RoundPoint Mortgage Servicing LLC, or RoundPoint, we are one of the largest servicers of conventional loans in the country. We are structured as an internally-managed REIT and our common stock is listed on the NYSE under the symbol TWO . We seek to leverage our core competencies of understanding and managing interest rate and prepayment risk to invest in our portfolio of MSR and Agency RMBS. Our objective is to deliver more stable performance, relative to RMBS portfolios without MSR, across changing market environments, and we are acutely focused on creating sustainable stockholder value over the long term. 
 Effective September 30, 2023, one of our wholly owned subsidiaries, TH MSR Holdings LLC (formerly Matrix Financial Services Corporation), acquired RoundPoint from Freedom Mortgage Corporation after the completion of customary closing conditions and receiving the required regulatory and GSE approvals. Upon closing, all servicing and origination licenses and operational capabilities remained with RoundPoint, and RoundPoint became a wholly owned subsidiary of TH MSR Holdings. Management believes this acquisition will add value for stakeholders of Two Harbors through cost savings achieved by bringing the servicing of our MSR portfolio in-house, greater control over our MSR portfolio and the associated cash flows, and the ability to participate more fully in the mortgage finance space as opportunities arise. 
 TH MSR Holdings holds the requisite approvals from Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to own and manage MSR, which represent a contractual right to control the servicing of a mortgage loan, the obligation to service the loan in accordance with applicable laws and requirements and the right to collect a fee for the performance of servicing activities, such as collecting principal and interest from a borrower and distributing those payments to the owner of the loan. TH MSR Holdings acquires MSR from third-party originators through flow and bulk purchases, as well as through the recapture of MSR on loans in its MSR portfolio that refinance. TH MSR Holdings does not directly service mortgage loans; instead, it engages its wholly owned subsidiary, RoundPoint, to handle substantially all servicing functions for the mortgage loans underlying our MSR. Our MSR business leverages our core competencies in prepayment and interest rate risk analytics, and the MSR assets may provide offsetting risks to our Agency RMBS, hedging both interest rate and mortgage spread risk. 
 RoundPoint has approvals from Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to service residential mortgage loans, and services mortgage loans underlying TH MSR Holdings MSR as well as MSR owned by third parties. Late in the second quarter, RoundPoint began operating its in-house, direct-to-consumer originations platform, which was established primarily as a MSR portfolio defense strategy to retain or recapture existing borrowers by providing them with competitive refinance and purchase mortgage options. The originations platform also originates loans for new borrowers that do not currently have a mortgage loan serviced by RoundPoint and also brokers second lien loans to our borrowers. For our own MSR portfolio, adding new or recaptured MSR through our origination platform is intended to hedge faster than expected MSR prepayment speeds in a refinance environment, and requires less capital relative to acquiring MSR through flow and bulk purchases from third-party originators. In addition, origination activities are generally counter-cyclical to MSR, which provides supplementary sources of profitability to our stockholders while also hedging our MSR. RoundPoint also intends to offer a suite of ancillary and home equity products to our customers, including second lien mortgage loans. 
 Our Agency RMBS portfolio is comprised primarily of fixed rate mortgage-backed securities backed by single-family and multi-family mortgage loans. All of our principal and interest Agency RMBS are Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac mortgage pass-through certificates or collateralized mortgage obligations, or Ginnie Mae mortgage pass-through certificates, which are backed by the guarantee of the U.S. government. The majority of our Agency RMBS portfolio is comprised of whole pool certificates. 
 We seek to deploy moderate leverage as part of our investment strategy. We generally finance our Agency RMBS through short- and long-term borrowings structured as repurchase agreements. We also finance our MSR through revolving credit facilities, repurchase agreements and convertible senior notes. Additionally, we finance our origination of mortgage loans through warehouse facilities. 
 We have elected to be treated as a REIT for U.S. federal income tax purposes. To qualify as a REIT we are required to meet certain investment and operating tests and annual distribution requirements. We generally will not be subject to U.S. federal income taxes on our taxable income to the extent that we annually distribute all of our net taxable income to stockholders, do not participate in prohibited transactions and maintain our intended qualification as a REIT. However, certain activities that we may perform may cause us to earn income which will not be qualifying income for REIT purposes. We have designated certain of our subsidiaries as taxable REIT subsidiaries, or TRSs, as defined in the Code, to engage in such activities. We also operate our business in a manner that will permit us to maintain our exemption from registration under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended, or the 1940 Act. Certain of our subsidiaries have obtained the requisite licenses and approvals to own and manage MSR and to originate and directly service residential mortgage loans.

Factors Affecting our Operating Results 
 Our net interest income includes income from our securities portfolio, including the amortization of purchase premiums and accretion of purchase discounts, and mortgage loans held-for-sale. Net interest income, as well as our servicing income, net of servicing costs, will fluctuate primarily as a result of changes in market interest rates, our financing costs and prepayment speeds on our assets. Interest rates, financing costs and prepayment rates vary according to the type of investment, conditions in the financial markets, competition and other factors, none of which can be predicted with any certainty. 

Fair Value Measurement 
 A significant portion of our assets and liabilities are reported at fair value and, therefore, our condensed consolidated balance sheets and statements of comprehensive income (loss) are significantly affected by fluctuations in market prices. At September 30, 2024, approximately 88.5 of our total assets, or 11.4 billion, consisted of financial instruments recorded at fair value. See Note 12 - Fair Value to the condensed consolidated financial statements, included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, for descriptions of valuation methodologies used to measure material assets and liabilities at fair value and details of the valuation models, key inputs to those models and significant assumptions utilized. Although we execute various hedging strategies to mitigate our exposure to changes in fair value, we cannot fully eliminate our exposure to volatility caused by fluctuations in market prices. 
 Any temporary change in the fair value of our AFS securities, excluding certain AFS securities for which we have elected the fair value option, is recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss and does not impact our reported income (loss) for U.S. GAAP purposes, or GAAP net income (loss). However, changes in the provision for credit losses on AFS securities are recognized immediately in GAAP net income (loss). Our GAAP net income (loss) is also affected by fluctuations in market prices on the remainder of our financial assets and liabilities recorded at fair value, including interest rate swap and swaption agreements and certain other derivative instruments i.e. , Agency to-be-announced securities, or TBAs, options on TBAs, futures, options on futures, inverse interest-only securities, interest rate lock commitments and forward loan sale commitments), which are accounted for as derivative trading instruments under U.S. GAAP, fair value option elected AFS securities, MSR and mortgage loans held-for-sale. 
 We have numerous internal controls in place to help ensure the appropriateness of fair value measurements. Significant fair value measures are subject to detailed analytics and management review and approval. Our entire MSR and Agency RMBS investment portfolio reported at fair value is priced by third-party brokers and/or by independent pricing vendors. We generally receive three or more broker and vendor quotes on pass-through Agency P I RMBS, and generally receive multiple broker or vendor quotes on all other securities, including interest-only and inverse interest-only Agency RMBS. We also receive multiple vendor quotes for the MSR in our investment portfolio. For Agency RMBS, the third-party pricing vendors and brokers use pricing models that commonly incorporate such factors as coupons, primary and secondary mortgage rates, rate reset periods, issuer, prepayment speeds, credit enhancements and expected life of the security. For MSR, vendors use pricing models that generally incorporate observable inputs such as principal balance, note rate, geographical location, loan-to-value (LTV) ratios, FICO, appraised value and other loan characteristics, along with observed market yields and trading levels. Pricing vendors will customarily incorporate servicing fee, ancillary income, and earnings rate on escrow as observable inputs. Unobservable or model-driven inputs include forecast per loan annual cost to service, forecast cumulative defaults, default curve, forecast loss severity and forecast voluntary prepayment. 
 We evaluate the prices we receive from both third-party brokers and pricing vendors by comparing those prices to actual purchase and sale transactions, our internally modeled prices calculated based on market observable rates and credit spreads, and to each other both in current and prior periods. We review and may challenge valuations from third-party brokers and pricing vendors to ensure that such quotes and valuations are indicative of fair value as a result of this analysis. We then estimate the fair value of each security based upon the median of the final broker quotes received, and we estimate the fair value of MSR based upon the average of prices received from third-party vendors, subject to internally-established hierarchy and override procedures. 
 We utilize bid side pricing for our Agency RMBS and, as a result, certain assets, especially the most recent purchases, may realize a markdown due to the bid-offer spread. To the extent that this occurs on available-for-sale securities not accounted for under the fair value option, any economic effect of this would be reflected in accumulated other comprehensive loss. 
 Considerable judgment is used in forming conclusions and estimating inputs to our Level 3 fair value measurements. Level 3 inputs such as interest rate movements, prepayments speeds, credit losses and discount rates are inherently difficult to estimate. Changes to these inputs can have a significant effect on fair value measurements. Accordingly, there is no assurance that our estimates of fair value are indicative of the amounts that would be realized on the ultimate sale or exchange of these assets. At September 30, 2024, 22.4 of our total assets were classified as Level 3 fair value assets.

Critical Accounting Estimates 
 The preparation of financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP requires us to make certain judgments and assumptions, based on information available at the time of our preparation of the financial statements, in determining accounting estimates used in preparation of the statements. Accounting estimates are considered critical if the estimate requires us to make assumptions about matters that were highly uncertain at the time the accounting estimate was made and if different estimates reasonably could have been used in the reporting period or changes in the accounting estimate are reasonably likely to occur from period to period that would have a material impact on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. Our significant accounting policies are described in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, included under Item 8 of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. Our most critical accounting policies involve our fair valuation of AFS securities, MSR and derivative instruments. 
 The methods used by us to estimate fair value for AFS securities, MSR and derivative instruments may produce a fair value calculation that may not be indicative of net realizable value or reflective of future fair value. Furthermore, while we believe that our valuation methods are appropriate and consistent with other market participants, the use of different methodologies, or assumptions, to determine the fair value of certain financial instruments could result in a different estimate of fair value at the reporting date. We use prices obtained from third-party pricing vendors or broker quotes deemed indicative of market activity and current as of the measurement date, which in periods of market dislocation, may have reduced transparency. For more information on our fair value measurements, see Note 12 - Fair Value to the condensed consolidated financial statements, included under Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Additionally, the key economic assumptions and sensitivity of the fair value of MSR to immediate adverse changes in these assumptions are presented in Note 6 - Servicing Activities to the condensed consolidated financial statements, included under Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. 

Market Conditions and Outlook 
 Interest rates fell and the yield curve steepened in the third quarter of 2024 with the Federal Reserve, or the Fed, cutting rates by 50 basis points at their September 2024 meeting. Reports on inflation showed further progress towards the Fed s two percent target and signs of gradual cooling of the labor market gave the Fed enough evidence to cut rates for the first time in this cycle. Prior to the September meeting, Fed Chairman Jerome Powell had characterized rates as being clearly restrictive, and a 50 basis point cut, in Powell s words, was a good strong start in getting rates back to neutral in order to avoid a rapid deterioration in the labor market. Updated Fed projections showed another 50 basis points in cuts for 2024 (for a total of 100 basis points), followed by another 100 basis points in 2025. At the start of the third quarter, market expectations were for 50 basis points in cuts for all of 2024, marking another quarter of rapidly changing forecasts for the short-end of the yield curve. Ultimately, the 10-year Treasury yield finished the quarter 62 basis points lower at 3.75 while the 2-year Treasury yield fell by 111 basis points to 3.64 , resulting in the first positively sloped curve between 2-year and 10-year Treasury notes since 2022. 
 Against a backdrop of the Fed guiding the economy towards a soft landing scenario together with lower interest rates, risk assets performed well over the quarter. The S P 500 was higher by about 5.5 , and with interest rates falling and the yield curve steepening, demand remained high for fixed-income assets. Our preferred implied volatility gauge, 2-year options on 10-year rates, decreased from 104 to 94 basis points on an annualized basis, close to its lowest level for 2024. The nominal spread on current coupon RMBS finished 20 basis points tighter at +107 to the Treasury curve, while the option-adjusted spread finished 6 basis points tighter at +18. Current coupon nominal spreads remained wide compared to the longer-term non-QE average of 83 basis points, while option-adjusted spreads finished tighter to the longer-term average of 29 basis points. Hedged mortgage performance varied across coupons, with longer duration lower coupons outperforming while higher coupons were negatively impacted by the rapid decline in rates and increased concerns over prepayments. With regard to supply, projected 2024 net supply of Agency RMBS is running at approximately a 200 billion pace, similar to 2023. 
 Primary mortgage rates dropped about 75 basis points in the third quarter to just above 6 , which garnered attention from the media and spurred an uptick in prepayments for high coupon originations from the last two years. Overall constant prepayment rates, or CPRs, for 30-year Agency RMBS increased 8 quarter-on-quarter to 6.5 CPR in the October 2024 report (reflecting September 2024 activity). Prepayments have begun to display a bifurcated pattern: they are speeding up for those newer high coupon mortgages but they continue to be very slow for the locked-in, low coupon COVID-era borrowers. Because of this, our MSR portfolio has not noticeably responded to the decrease in mortgage rates as the quarterly prepayment rate was unchanged at 5.3 . 
 The housing market remains in a state of gridlock. Exiting home sales have slowed, running behind the pace of 2023 and projected to be the weakest year in almost two decades. Inventory has begun to climb off of very low levels and homes are sitting on the market longer. Many sellers withdraw listings that don't sell and are content to keep their low rate mortgages rather than sell for a price below market. Home prices appear to be headed toward a small gain for 2024 compared to 2023.

RMBS funding markets remained stable and liquid throughout the quarter with ample financing being readily available. Spreads for repurchase agreements widened with financing for RMBS between SOFR plus 24 to 28 basis points. The widening was primarily due to the uncertainty of the Fed s actions in September. At quarter-end, bank balance sheets were temporarily tight owing to a number of factors that included settlements of auctioned Treasury securities as well as banks managing quarter-end reporting metrics. Post quarter-end, liquidity and balance sheet room quickly returned easing financing conditions. Similar effects may occur at year-end and we will seek to minimize our exposure to year-end funding pressures. 
 The volume of MSR sales continued to normalize from the record volumes of the past few years. This quarter brought approximately 40 billion UPB of supply, bringing the year-to-date total to about 305 billion, about 70 of the pace of 2023. Traded prices have held steady with the supply being easily absorbed by a deep pool of buyers including both banks and non-banks. The number of banks offering MSR financing has broadened and the increased competition has led to a compression in financing spreads. Additionally, we saw the first MSR financing securitizations of the past two years as spreads for the securities returned to sub-300 basis point spreads to SOFR. 
 Looking ahead, we continue to see attractive levered returns on our portfolio composed of Agency MSR and RMBS. Despite the recent tightening of RMBS spreads, nominal spreads are still wider than long-term history, reflecting continued higher than average implied volatility. On an option-adjusted spread basis, RMBS look less compelling, which indicates that spread tightening will need to be driven by increased demand (most likely by depository institutions) and/or further declines in volatility. Both of these factors will be most influenced by the quantity and timing of more cuts in rates by the Fed, which themselves remain data dependent. We expect that the MSR market will continue to be stable and well supported given the overall demand for the asset class. Despite mortgage rates declining, our MSR portfolio, with an average mortgage rate of 3.43 remains far out of the money with only 1 of the underlying mortgage loans 50 basis points or more below current mortgage rates. Barring a significant decline in mortgage rates, housing turnover will remain the key driver for prepayments of our MSR. Turnover typically slows in the fall and winter months, hence we expect prepayment speeds to decline modestly over the fourth quarter, providing a tailwind for our MSR performance. For the small population of loans that can be refinanced, RoundPoint is now offering refinance opportunities to mortgagors on our platform which should mitigate the impact of rising prepayment rates and protect the MSR s asset value. 
 The following table provides the carrying value of our investment portfolio by asset type:

 Prepayment speeds and volatility due to interest rates 
 Our portfolio is subject to market risks, primarily interest rate risk and prepayment risk. We seek to offset a portion of our Agency pool market value exposure through our MSR and interest-only Agency RMBS portfolios. During periods of decreasing interest rates with rising prepayment speeds, the market value of our Agency pools generally increases and the market value of our interest-only securities and MSR generally decreases. The inverse relationship occurs when interest rates rise and prepayments fall. Average prepayment speeds for our overall portfolio remained relatively consistent with the prior quarter due primarily to the bifurcated pattern discussed above. In addition to changes in interest rates, changes in home price performance, key employment metrics and government programs, among other macroeconomic factors, can affect prepayment speeds. We believe our active portfolio management approach, including our asset selection process, positions us to respond to a variety of market scenarios. Although we are unable to predict future interest rate movements, our strategy of pairing MSR with Agency RMBS, with a focus on managing various associated risks, including interest rate, prepayment, credit, mortgage spread and financing risk, is intended to generate stable performance, relative to RMBS portfolios without MSR, with a low level of sensitivity to changes in the yield curve, prepayments and interest rate cycles.

Our Agency RMBS are primarily collateralized by pools of fixed-rate mortgage loans. Our Agency portfolio also includes securities with implicit prepayment protection, including lower loan balances (securities collateralized by loans of less than 300,000 in initial principal balance), higher LTVs (securities collateralized by loans with LTVs greater than or equal to 80 ), certain geographic concentrations, loans secured by investor-owned properties and lower FICO scores. Our overall allocation of Agency RMBS and holdings of pools with specific characteristics are viewed in the context of our aggregate portfolio strategy, including MSR and related derivative hedging instruments. Additionally, the selection of securities with certain attributes is driven by the perceived relative value of the securities, which factors in the opportunities in the marketplace, the cost of financing and the cost of hedging interest rate, prepayment, credit and other portfolio risks. Accordingly, our Agency RMBS capital allocation reflects management s flexible approach to investing in the marketplace.

 Counterparty exposure and leverage ratio 
 We monitor counterparty exposure amongst our broker, banking and lending counterparties on a daily basis. We believe our broker and banking counterparties are well-capitalized organizations, and we attempt to manage our cash balances across these organizations to reduce our exposure to any single counterparty.

As of September 30, 2024, we had entered into repurchase agreements with 36 counterparties, 19 of which had outstanding balances. In addition, we held short- and long-term borrowings under revolving credit facilities, warehouse facilities and unsecured convertible senior notes. As of September 30, 2024, the debt-to-equity ratio funding our Agency and non-Agency investment securities, MSR and related servicing advances and mortgage loans held-for-sale, which includes unsecured borrowings under convertible senior notes, was 4.6:1.0. 
 As of September 30, 2024, we held 522.6 million in cash and cash equivalents, approximately 4.8 million of unpledged Agency RMBS and 3.5 million of unpledged non-Agency securities. As a result, we had an overall estimated unused borrowing capacity on our unpledged securities of approximately 6.1 million. As of September 30, 2024, we held approximately 19.6 million of unpledged MSR and 5.4 million of unpledged servicing advances. Overall, on September 30, 2024, we had 60.1 million unused committed and 550.0 million unused uncommitted borrowing capacity on MSR financing facilities, and 90.7 million in unused committed borrowing capacity on servicing advance financing facilities. As of September 30, 2024, all of our mortgage loans were pledged for financing and we had 4.0 million unused committed borrowing capacity on our warehouse facilities. Generally, unused borrowing capacity may be the result of our election not to utilize certain financing, as well as delays in the timing in which funding is provided, insufficient collateral or the inability to meet lenders eligibility requirements for specific types of asset classes. 
 We also monitor exposure to our MSR counterparties. We may be required to make representations and warranties to investors in the loans underlying the MSR we own; however, some of our MSR were purchased on a bifurcated basis, meaning the representation and warranty obligations remain with the seller. If the representations and warranties we make prove to be inaccurate, we may be obligated to repurchase certain mortgage loans, which may impact the profitability of our portfolio. Although we obtain similar representations and warranties from the counterparty from which we acquired the relevant asset, if those representations and warranties do not directly mirror those we make to the investor, or if we are unable to enforce the representations and warranties against the counterparty for a variety of reasons, including the financial condition or insolvency of the counterparty, we may not be able to seek indemnification from our counterparties for any losses attributable to the breach. 

Summary of Results of Operations and Financial Condition 
 Our book value per common share for U.S. GAAP purposes was 14.93 at September 30, 2024, a decrease from 15.19 per common share at June 30, 2024, and a decrease from 15.21 per common share at December 31, 2023. The decline in book value for both the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily driven by losses recognized on MSR and derivatives and dividends declared, offset by net servicing income and unrealized gains recognized on AFS securities. Our comprehensive income attributable to common stockholders was 19.4 million and comprehensive loss attributable to common stockholders was 34.7 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, as compared to comprehensive loss attributable to common stockholders of 56.8 million and 34.1 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively.

Results of Operations 
 Interest Income 
 Interest income decreased from 123.6 million and 358.0 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively, to 112.6 million and 346.4 million for the same periods in 2024 due to a decrease in Agency RMBS portfolio size, offset by lower amortization recognized on Agency RMBS due to lower unamortized premium and higher interest on reverse repurchase agreements and cash balances as a result of the higher interest rate environment. 
 Interest Expense 
 Interest expense decreased from 173.1 million and 475.1 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 to 154.9 million and 469.1 million for the same periods in 2024 due to lower borrowing balances on both AFS securities and MSR, offset by increases in interest rates throughout the first half of 2024.

 The increase in yields on AFS securities for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the same periods in 2023 was driven by net purchases of AFS securities with lower unamortized premiums. The decrease in cost of funds associated with the financing of AFS securities for the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the same period in 2023, was due to declining interest rates. The increase in cost of funds associated with the financing of AFS securities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the same period in 2023, was due to rising interest rates throughout the first half of 2024. 
 Yields on reverse repurchase agreements remained consistent for the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the same period in 2023. The increase in yields on reverse repurchase agreements for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the same period in 2023, was the result of rising interest rates throughout the first half of 2024. However, for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, these yields were offset by the cost of financing the associated repurchase agreements collateralized by U.S. Treasury securities. We did not hold any repurchase agreements collateralized by U.S. Treasury securities during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 or the three months ended September 30, 2023. 
 The slight decrease in cost of funds associated with the financing of MSR assets and related servicing advance obligations for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the same periods in 2023, was primarily the result of a greater portion of MSR financing from repurchase agreements versus revolving credit facilities. Our repurchase agreements, on average, carry lower floating rate spreads than our revolving credit facilities. We have one revolving credit facility in place to finance our servicing advance obligations, which are included in other assets on our condensed consolidated balance sheets. 
 Late in the second quarter of 2024, RoundPoint began operating its in-house, direct-to-consumer originations platform. Prior to the launch of originations, our mortgage loans held-for-sale consisted of a handful of loans purchased from the collateral underlying our MSR, which were not pledged for any form of financing. 
 The cost of funds associated with our convertible senior notes for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the same periods in 2023, was consistent.

 Net Servicing Income 
 The following table presents the components of net servicing income for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023: 
 Three Months Ended Nine Months Ended September 30, September 30, (in thousands) 2024 2023 2024 2023 Servicing fee income 126,597 141,816 400,278 415,423 Ancillary and other fee income 3,928 476 12,220 2,236 Float income 41,207 36,333 101,582 89,509 Total servicing income 171,732 178,625 514,080 507,168 Total servicing costs 3,900 29,903 15,494 83,459 Net servicing income 167,832 148,722 498,586 423,709 
 
 The decrease in total servicing income for the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the same period in 2023, was primarily due to lower servicing fee income on a smaller MSR portfolio as a result of sales and runoff, offset by higher float income as a result of the higher interest rate environment and higher ancillary and other fee income as a result of the acquisition of RoundPoint. The increase in total servicing income for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the same period in 2023, was primarily due to higher float income as a result of the higher interest rate environment and higher ancillary and other fee income as a result of the acquisition of RoundPoint, offset by lower servicing fee income on a smaller MSR portfolio as a result of sales and runoff. 
 Prior to the acquisition of RoundPoint, we did not directly service mortgage loans; instead, we contracted with appropriately licensed subservicers to handle substantially all servicing functions in the name of the subservicer for the mortgage loans underlying our MSR. These third-party subservicing costs and other servicing expenses directly related to our MSR portfolio are included within the servicing costs line item on our condensed consolidated statements of comprehensive income (loss). Post-acquisition, all servicing-related expenses incurred by RoundPoint as an operating company are included within the other operating expenses line item on our condensed consolidated statements of comprehensive income (loss). The decrease in servicing costs during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the same periods in 2023, was the result of lower third-party subservicing fees due to the acquisition of RoundPoint. 
 Gain (Loss) On Investment Securities

In the ordinary course of our business, we make investment decisions and allocate capital in accordance with our views on the changing risk/reward dynamics in the market and in our portfolio. We do not expect to sell assets on a frequent basis, but may sell assets to reallocate capital into new assets that we believe have higher risk-adjusted returns. 
 We use a discounted cash flow method to estimate and recognize an allowance for credit losses on AFS securities. Subsequent adverse or favorable changes in expected cash flows are recognized immediately in earnings as a provision for or reversal of provision for credit losses (within gain (loss) on investment securities). 
 The majority of the other component of gain (loss) on investment securities is related to changes in unrealized gains (losses) on certain AFS securities for which we have elected the fair value option. Fluctuations in this line item are primarily driven by the reclassification of unrealized gains and losses to realized gains and losses upon sale, as well as changes in fair value assumptions. 
 (Loss) Gain On Servicing Asset 
 The following table presents the components of (loss) gain on servicing asset for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023:

 (133,349) 67,369 (145,194) 60,969 
 
 The increase in loss (decrease in gain) on servicing asset for the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the same period in 2023, was driven by unfavorable change in valuation assumptions used in the fair valuation of MSR, particularly faster prepayment speeds, offset by slightly lower portfolio run-off and higher realized gains on sales of MSR. The increase in loss (decrease in gain) on servicing asset for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the same period in 2023, was driven by lower favorable change in valuation assumptions used in the fair valuation of MSR and slightly higher portfolio run-off, offset by higher realized gains on sales of MSR. 
 (Loss) Gain On Interest Rate Swap And Swaption Agreements 
 The following table summarizes the net interest spread and gains and losses associated with our interest rate swap and swaption positions recognized during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023:

Net interest spread recognized for the accrual and/or settlement of the net interest expense associated with our interest rate swaps results from receiving either a floating interest rate (OIS or SOFR) or a fixed interest rate and paying either a fixed interest rate or a floating interest rate (OIS or SOFR) on positions held to economically hedge/mitigate portfolio interest rate exposure (or duration) risk. We may elect to terminate certain swaps and swaptions to align with our investment portfolio, agreements may mature or options may expire resulting in full settlement of our net interest spread asset/liability and the recognition of realized gains and losses, including early termination penalties. The change in fair value of interest rate swaps and swaptions during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was a result of changes to floating interest rates (OIS or SOFR), the swap curve and corresponding counterparty borrowing rates. Swaps and swaptions are used for purposes of hedging our interest rate exposure, and therefore, their unrealized valuation gains and losses (excluding the reversal of unrealized gains and losses to realized gains and losses upon termination, maturation or option expiration) generally offset a portion of the unrealized losses and gains recognized on our Agency RMBS AFS portfolio, which are recorded either directly to stockholders equity through other comprehensive income (loss) or to gain (loss) on investment securities, in the case of certain AFS securities for which we have elected the fair value option. 
 (Loss) Gain On Other Derivative Instruments 
 The following table provides a summary of the total net gains (losses) recognized on other derivative instruments we hold for purposes of both hedging and non-hedging activities, principally TBAs, futures, options on futures, and inverse interest-only securities during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023:

 ____________________ 
 (1) Certain operating expenses predominantly consists of expenses incurred in connection with the Company s ongoing litigation with PRCM Advisers, as discussed within Note 18 to the condensed consolidated financial statements, included under Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. It also includes certain transaction expenses incurred in connection with the Company s acquisition of RoundPoint. 
 
 The increase in total operating expenses during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the same periods in 2023, was driven by the addition of RoundPoint s compensation, benefits, operating and loan level expenses, offset by lower expenses incurred in connection with the Company s ongoing litigation with PRCM Advisers. 
 Income Taxes 
 During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, we recognized a benefit from income taxes of 10.5 million and a provision for income taxes of 15.7 million, respectively. The benefit recognized for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily due to net losses recognized on MSR and operating expenses, offset by net income from MSR servicing and mortgage loan origination activities incurred in our TRSs. The provision recognized during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily due to net income from MSR servicing and mortgage loan origination activities, offset by net losses recognized on MSR and operating expenses incurred in our TRSs. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, we recognized a provision for income taxes of 36.4 million and 52.2 million, respectively, which was primarily due to net income from MSR servicing activities and net gains recognized on MSR, offset by net losses recognized on derivative instruments and operating expenses incurred in our TRSs. 
 Other Comprehensive Income (Loss)

With our accounting treatment for AFS securities, unrealized fluctuations in the market values of AFS securities, excluding certain AFS securities for which we have elected the fair value option and securities with an allowance for credit losses, are recorded directly to stockholders equity through other comprehensive income (loss). Additionally, we reclassify unrealized gains and losses on AFS securities in accumulated other comprehensive loss to net (loss) income upon the recognition of any realized gains and losses on sales as individual securities are sold. Fluctuations in other comprehensive income (loss) are driven by changes in fair value assumptions and the reclassification of unrealized gains and losses to realized gains and losses upon sale. 

Financial Condition 
 Available-for-Sale Securities, at Fair Value 
 The majority of our AFS investment securities portfolio is comprised of fixed rate Agency mortgage-backed securities backed by single-family and multi-family mortgage loans. We also hold 3.9 million in tranches of mortgage-backed and asset-backed P I and interest-only non-Agency securities. All of our P I Agency RMBS AFS are Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac mortgage pass-through certificates or collateralized mortgage obligations, or Ginnie Mae mortgage pass-through certificates, which are backed by the guarantee of the U.S. government. The majority of our Agency RMBS portfolio is comprised of whole pool certificates.

 Mortgage Servicing Rights, at Fair Value 
 One of our wholly owned subsidiaries, TH MSR Holdings, has approvals from Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to own and manage MSR, which represent the right to control the servicing of residential mortgage loans. TH MSR Holdings acquires MSR from third-party originators through flow and bulk purchases, as well as through the recapture of MSR on loans in its MSR portfolio that refinance. As of September 30, 2024, our MSR had a fair market value of 2.9 billion.

 Financing 
 Our borrowings consist primarily of repurchase agreements, revolving credit facilities, warehouse facilities and convertible senior notes. Repurchase agreements and revolving credit facilities are collateralized by our pledge of AFS securities, derivative instruments, MSR, servicing advances and certain cash balances. Substantially all of our Agency RMBS are currently pledged as collateral for repurchase agreements. Additionally, a substantial portion of our MSR is currently pledged as collateral for repurchase agreements and revolving credit facilities, and a portion of our servicing advances have been pledged as collateral for revolving credit facilities. Warehouse facilities are collateralized by our pledge of mortgage loans for a period of up to 90 days or until they are sold to the GSEs or other third-party investors in the secondary market, typically within 30 days of origination. Substantially all of our funded mortgage loans held-for-sale are currently pledged as collateral for warehouse facilities. In connection with our securitization of MSR, a variable funding note, or VFN, was issued to one of our subsidiaries. We have one repurchase facility that is secured by the VFN, which is collateralized by our MSR. Finally, our convertible senior notes due 2026 are unsecured and pay interest semiannually at a rate of 6.25 per annum.

 As of September 30, 2024, the debt-to-equity ratio funding our Agency and non-Agency investment securities, MSR and related servicing advances and mortgage loans held-for-sale, which includes unsecured borrowings under convertible senior notes, was 4.6:1.0. Our Agency RMBS, given their liquidity and high credit quality, are eligible for higher levels of leverage, while MSR, with less liquidity and/or more exposure to prepayment risk, utilize lower levels of leverage. Generally, our debt-to-equity ratio is directly correlated to the composition of our portfolio; typically, the higher the percentage of Agency RMBS we hold, the higher our debt-to-equity ratio will be. However, in addition to portfolio mix, our debt-to-equity ratio is a function of many other factors, including the liquidity of our portfolio, the availability and price of our financing, the diversification of our counterparties and their available capacity to finance our assets, and anticipated regulatory developments. We may alter the percentage allocation of our portfolio among our target assets depending on the relative value of the assets that are available to purchase from time to time, including at times when we are deploying proceeds from offerings we conduct. We believe the current degree of leverage within our portfolio helps ensure that we have access to unused borrowing capacity, thus supporting our liquidity and the strength of our balance sheet.

Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 Our liquidity and capital resources are managed and forecasted on a daily basis. We believe this ensures that we have sufficient liquidity to absorb market events that could negatively impact collateral valuations and result in margin calls. We also believe that it gives us the flexibility to manage our portfolio to take advantage of market opportunities. 
 Our principal sources of cash consist of borrowings under repurchase agreements, revolving credit facilities, warehouse facilities, payments of principal and interest we receive on our target assets, cash generated from our operating results, and proceeds from capital market transactions. We typically use cash to repay principal and interest on our borrowings, to purchase our target assets, to make dividend payments on our capital stock, and to fund our operations. To the extent that we raise additional equity capital through capital market transactions, we anticipate using cash proceeds from such transactions to purchase our target assets and for other general corporate purposes. Such general corporate purposes may include the refinancing or repayment of debt, the repurchase or redemption of common and preferred equity securities, and other capital expenditures.

As of September 30, 2024, we held 522.6 million in cash and cash equivalents available to support our operations; 11.4 billion of AFS securities, MSR, mortgage loans held-for-sale and derivative assets held at fair value; and 10.0 billion of outstanding debt in the form of repurchase agreements, borrowings under revolving credit facilities and warehouse facilities and convertible senior notes. During the three months ended September 30, 2024, the debt-to-equity ratio funding our Agency and non-Agency investment securities, MSR and related servicing advances and mortgage loans held-for-sale, which includes unsecured borrowings under convertible senior notes, increased from 4.5:1.0 to 4.6:1.0, which was predominantly driven by an increase in financing on Agency RMBS as a result of purchases, offset by a decrease in MSR financing as a result of MSR sales and portfolio runoff. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the debt-to-equity ratio funding our Agency and non-Agency investment securities, MSR and related servicing advances and mortgage loans held-for-sale, which includes unsecured borrowings under convertible senior notes, also increased from 4.5:1.0 to 4.6:1.0, which was primarily due to a decrease in equity as a result of our financial results. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, our economic debt-to-equity ratio funding our Agency and non-Agency investment securities, MSR and related servicing advances and mortgage loans held-for-sale, which includes unsecured borrowings under convertible senior notes, implied debt on net TBA cost basis and net payable (receivable) for unsettled RMBS, increased from 6.8:1.0 to 7.0:1.0 and 6.0:1.0 to 7.0:1.0, respectively. 
 As of September 30, 2024, we held approximately 4.8 million of unpledged Agency RMBS and 3.5 million of unpledged non-Agency securities. As a result, we had an overall estimated unused borrowing capacity on unpledged securities of approximately 6.1 million. As of September 30, 2024, we held approximately 19.6 million of unpledged MSR and 5.4 million of unpledged servicing advances. Overall, on September 30, 2024, we had 60.1 million unused committed and 550.0 million unused uncommitted borrowing capacity on MSR financing facilities, and 90.7 million in unused committed borrowing capacity on servicing advance financing facilities. As of September 30, 2024, all of our mortgage loans were pledged for financing and we had 4.0 million unused committed borrowing capacity on our warehouse facilities. Generally, unused borrowing capacity may be the result of our election not to utilize certain financing, as well as delays in the timing in which funding is provided, insufficient collateral or the inability to meet lenders eligibility requirements for specific types of asset classes. On a daily basis, we monitor and forecast our available, or excess, liquidity. Additionally, we frequently perform shock analyses against various market events to monitor the adequacy of our excess liquidity. 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we did not experience any material issues accessing our funding sources. We expect ongoing sources of financing to be primarily repurchase agreements, revolving credit facilities, warehouse facilities, convertible notes and similar financing arrangements. We plan to finance our assets with a moderate amount of leverage, the level of which may vary based upon the particular characteristics of our portfolio and market conditions. 
 As of September 30, 2024, we had master repurchase agreements in place with 36 counterparties (lenders), the majority of which are U.S. domiciled financial institutions, and we continue to evaluate additional counterparties to manage and optimize counterparty risk. Under our repurchase agreements, we are required to pledge additional assets as collateral to our lenders when the estimated fair value of the existing pledged collateral under such agreements declines and such lenders, through a margin call, demand additional collateral. Lenders generally make margin calls because of a perceived decline in the value of our assets collateralizing the repurchase agreements. This may occur following the monthly principal reduction of assets due to scheduled amortization and prepayments on the underlying mortgages, or may be caused by changes in market interest rates, a perceived decline in the market value of the investments and other market factors. To cover a margin call, we may pledge additional assets or cash. At maturity, any cash on deposit as collateral is generally applied against the repurchase agreement balance, thereby reducing the amount borrowed. Should the value of our assets suddenly decrease, significant margin calls on our repurchase agreements could result, causing an adverse change in our liquidity position.

In addition to our master repurchase agreements that fund our Agency and non-Agency securities, we have one repurchase facility and two revolving credit facilities that provide short- and long-term financing for our MSR portfolio. We also have one revolving credit facility that provides long-term financing for our servicing advances and one warehouse facility that provides short-term financing for our mortgage loans held-for-sale. A summary of our MSR, servicing advance and warehouse facilities is provided in the table below:

During the three months ended September 30, 2024, this repurchase facility was amended to prescribe a reduction in the total capacity to 550.0 million starting December 30, 2024. 
 
 We are subject to a variety of financial covenants under our lending agreements. The following represent the most restrictive financial covenants across our lending agreements as of September 30, 2024: 
 Total indebtedness to tangible net worth must be less than 8.0:1.0. As of September 30, 2024, our total indebtedness to tangible net worth, as defined, was 4.9:1.0. 
 Cash liquidity must be greater than 200.0 million. As of September 30, 2024, our liquidity, as defined, was 522.6 million. 
 Net worth must be greater than the higher of 1.5 billion or 50 of the highest net worth during the 24 calendar months prior. As of September 30, 2024, 50 of the highest net worth during the 24 calendar months prior, as defined, was 1.2 billion and our net worth, as defined, was 2.2 billion. 
 We are also subject to additional financial covenants in connection with various other agreements we enter into in the normal course of our business. We intend to continue to operate in a manner which complies with all of our financial covenants.

Although we generally intend to hold our target assets as long-term investments, we may sell certain of our assets in order to manage our interest rate risk and liquidity needs, to meet other operating objectives and to adapt to market conditions. Our Agency RMBS are generally actively traded and thus, in most circumstances, readily liquid. However, certain of our assets, including MSR and mortgage loans held-for-sale, are subject to longer trade timelines, and, as a result, market conditions could significantly and adversely affect the liquidity of our assets. Any illiquidity of our assets may make it difficult for us to sell such assets if the need or desire arises. Our ability to quickly sell certain assets, such as MSR and mortgage loans, may be limited by delays encountered while obtaining certain Agency approvals required for such dispositions and may be further limited by delays due to the time period needed for negotiating transaction documents, conducting diligence, and complying with Agency requirements regarding the transfer of such assets before settlement may occur. Consequently, even if we identify a buyer for our MSR and mortgage loans, there is no assurance that we would be able to quickly sell such assets if the need or desire arises. 
 In addition, if we are required to liquidate all or a portion of our portfolio quickly, we may realize significantly less than the value at which we previously recorded our assets. Assets that are illiquid are more difficult to finance, and to the extent that we use leverage to finance assets that become illiquid, we may lose that leverage or have it reduced. Assets tend to become less liquid during times of financial stress, which is often the time that liquidity is most needed. As a result, our ability to sell assets or vary our portfolio in response to changes in economic and other conditions may be limited by liquidity constraints, which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. 
 We cannot predict the timing and impact of future sales of our assets, if any. Because many of our assets are financed with repurchase agreements, revolving credit facilities and warehouse facilities, a significant portion of the proceeds from sales of our assets (if any), prepayments and scheduled amortization are used to repay balances under these financing sources. 
 The following table provides the maturities of our repurchase agreements, revolving credit facilities, warehouse facilities, term notes payable and convertible senior notes as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023: 
 (in thousands) September 30, 2024 December 31, 2023 Within 30 days 2,403,179 2,833,162 30 to 59 days 2,180,469 1,918,818 60 to 89 days 3,017 2,059,438 90 to 119 days 1,173,329 994,789 120 to 364 days 2,356,423 833,571 One to three years 1,908,986 1,273,453 Total 10,025,403 9,913,231 
 
 For the three months ended September 30, 2024, our restricted and unrestricted cash balance decreased approximately 175.1 million to 611.7 million at September 30, 2024. The cash movements can be summarized by the following: 
 Cash flows from operating activities. For the three months ended September 30, 2024, operating activities increased our cash balances by approximately 87.1 million, primarily driven by our financial results for the quarter. 
 Cash flows from investing activities . For the three months ended September 30, 2024, investing activities decreased our cash balances by approximately 254.9 million, driven by net purchases of AFS securities and net short sales of derivative instruments, offset by net sales of MSR. 
 Cash flows from financing activities. For the three months ended September 30, 2024, financing activities decreased our cash balance by approximately 7.3 million, primarily driven by paydowns on our revolving credit facilities and the payment of third quarter dividends, offset by an increase in both AFS securities and MSR repurchase agreement financing. 

Inflation 
 Our assets and liabilities are financial in nature. As a result, changes in interest rates and other factors impact our performance far more than does inflation, although inflation rates can often have a meaningful influence over the direction of interest rates. Our financial statements are prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP and dividends are based upon net ordinary income and capital gains as calculated for tax purposes; in each case, our results of operations and reported assets, liabilities and equity are measured with reference to historical cost or fair value without considering inflation.

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk 
 We seek to manage our risks related to the credit quality of our assets, interest rates, liquidity, prepayment speeds and market value while providing an opportunity to stockholders to realize attractive risk-adjusted total return through ownership of our capital stock. Although we do not seek to avoid risk completely, we believe that risk can be quantified from historical experience, and we seek to manage our risk levels in order to earn sufficient compensation to justify the risks we undertake and to maintain capital levels consistent with taking such risks. 
 To manage the risks to our portfolio, we employ portfolio-wide and asset-specific risk measurement and management processes in our daily operations. Risk management tools include software and services licensed or purchased from third parties as well as proprietary and third-party analytical tools and models. There can be no guarantee that these tools and methods will protect us from market risks. 
 Interest Rate Risk 
 Interest rates are highly sensitive to many factors, including fiscal and monetary policies and domestic and international economic and political considerations, as well as other factors beyond our control. We are subject to interest rate risk in connection with our assets and related financing obligations. Additionally, rising interest rates are likely to have an adverse impact on the operational efficiency and, thus profitability, of our loan originations platform. 
 Subject to maintaining our qualification as a REIT, we engage in a variety of interest rate risk management techniques that seek to mitigate the influence of interest rate changes on the values of our assets. We may enter into a variety of derivative and non-derivative instruments to economically hedge interest rate risk or duration mismatch (or gap) by adjusting the duration of our floating-rate borrowings into fixed-rate borrowings to more closely match the duration of our assets. This particularly applies to borrowing agreements with maturities or interest rate resets of less than six months. Typically, the interest receivable terms i.e. , OIS or SOFR) of certain derivatives match the terms of the underlying debt, resulting in an effective conversion of the rate of the related borrowing agreement from floating to fixed. The objective is to manage the cash flows associated with current and anticipated interest payments on borrowings, as well as the ability to roll or refinance borrowings at the desired amount by adjusting the duration. 
 To help manage the adverse impact of interest rate changes on the value of our portfolio, our cash flows, and our loan origination pipeline (consisting of IRLCs and mortgage loans held-for-sale), we may, at times, enter into various forward contracts, including short securities, TBAs, options, futures, swaps, caps, credit default swaps, total return swaps and forward mortgage loan sale commitments. In executing on our current interest rate risk management strategy, we have entered into TBAs, interest rate swap and swaption agreements, futures, options on futures, and forward mortgage loan sale commitments. In addition, because MSR are negative duration assets, they may provide a hedge to interest rate exposure on our Agency RMBS portfolio. In hedging interest rate risk, we seek to mitigate the impact of changing interest rates on the value of our investments, improve risk-adjusted returns and, where possible, obtain a favorable spread between the yield on our assets and the cost of our financing. Our hedging methods are based on many factors, including, but not limited to, our estimates with regard to future interest rates. 
 REIT income arising from clearly identified hedging transactions that are entered into to manage the risk of interest rate or price changes with respect to borrowings, including gain from the disposition of such hedging transactions, to the extent the hedging transactions hedge indebtedness incurred, or to be incurred, by the REIT to acquire or carry real estate assets, will not be treated as gross income for purposes of either the 75 or the 95 gross income tests. In general, for a hedging transaction to be clearly identified, (i) it must be identified as a hedging transaction before the end of the day on which it is acquired, originated, or entered into, and (ii) the items of risks being hedged must be identified substantially contemporaneously with entering into the hedging transaction (generally not more than 35 days after entering into the hedging transaction). We intend to structure any hedging transactions in a manner that does not jeopardize our qualification as a REIT, although this determination depends on an analysis of the facts and circumstances concerning each hedging transaction. We also implement part of our hedging strategy through our TRSs, which are subject to U.S. federal, state and, if applicable, local income tax. 
 We treat our TBAs as qualifying assets for purposes of the 75 asset test, to the extent set forth in an opinion from Sidley Austin LLP substantially to the effect that, for purposes of the 75 asset test, our ownership of a TBA should be treated as ownership of the underlying Agency RMBS. We also treat income and gains from our TBAs as qualifying income for purposes of the 75 gross income test, to the extent set forth in an opinion from Sidley Austin LLP substantially to the effect that, for purposes of the 75 gross income test, any gain recognized by us in connection with the settlement of our TBAs should be treated as gain from the sale or disposition of the underlying Agency RMBS.

Interest Rate Effect on Net Interest Income 
 Our operating results depend in large part on differences between the income earned on our assets and our cost of borrowing and hedging activities. The costs associated with our borrowings are generally based on prevailing market interest rates. During a period of rising interest rates, our borrowing costs generally will increase while the coupon interest earned on our existing portfolio of leveraged fixed-rate Agency RMBS and mortgage loans held-for-sale will remain static. Both of these factors could result in a decline in our net interest spread and net interest margin. The inverse result may occur during a period of falling interest rates. The severity of any such decline or increase in our net interest spread and net interest margin would depend on our asset/liability composition at the time, as well as the magnitude and duration of the interest rate increase or decrease. 
 Our hedging techniques are partly based on assumed levels of prepayments of our target assets. If prepayments are slower or faster than assumed, the life of the investment will be longer or shorter, which could reduce the effectiveness of any hedging strategies we may use and may cause losses on such transactions. Hedging strategies involving the use of derivative securities are highly complex and may produce volatile returns. 
 The following analyses of risks are based on our experience, estimates, models and assumptions. The analysis is based on models which utilize estimates of fair value and interest rate sensitivity. Actual economic conditions or implementation of decisions may produce results that differ significantly from the estimates and assumptions used in our models. 
 We perform interest rate sensitivity analyses on various measures of our financial results and condition by examining how our assets, financing and hedges will perform in various interest rate shock scenarios. Two of these measures are presented below in more detail. The first measure is change in annualized net interest income over the next 12 months, including interest spread from our interest rate swaps and float income from custodial accounts associated with our MSR. The second measure is change in value of financial position, including the value of our derivative assets and liabilities. All changes in value are measured as the change from the September 30, 2024 financial position. All projected changes in annualized net interest income are measured as the change from the projected annualized net interest income based off current performance returns. 
 Computation of the cash flows for the rate-sensitive assets underpinning change in annualized net interest income are based on assumptions related to, among other things, prepayment speeds, yield on future acquisitions, slope of the yield curve, and size of the portfolio (for example, the assumption for prepayment speeds for Agency RMBS and MSR is that they do not change in response to changes in interest rates). Assumptions for the interest rate sensitive liabilities relate to, among other things, collateral requirements as a percentage of borrowings and amount/term of borrowing. These assumptions may not hold in practice; realized net interest income results may therefore be significantly different from the net interest income produced in scenario analyses. We also note that the uncertainty associated with the estimate of a change in net interest income is directly related to the size of interest rate move considered. 
 Computation of results for portfolio value involves a two-step process. The first is the use of models to project how the value of interest rate sensitive instruments will change in the scenarios considered. The second, and equally important, step is the improvement of the model projections based on application of our experience in assessing how current market and macroeconomic conditions will affect the prices of various interest rate sensitive instruments. Judgment is best applied to localized (less than 25 basis points, or bps) interest rate moves. The more an instantaneous interest rate move exceeds 25 bps, the greater the likelihood that accompanying market events are significant enough to warrant reconsideration of interest rate sensitivities. As with net interest income, the uncertainty associated with the estimate of change in portfolio value is therefore directly related to the size of interest rate move considered.

The following interest rate sensitivity table displays the potential impact of instantaneous, parallel changes in interest rates of +/- 25 and +/- 50 bps on annualized net interest income and portfolio value, based on our interest sensitive financial instruments at September 30, 2024. The preceding discussion shows that the results for the 25 bps move scenarios are the best representation of our interest rate exposure, followed by those for the 50 bps move scenarios. This hierarchy reflects our localized approach to managing interest rate risk: monitoring rates and rebalancing our hedges on a day-to-day basis, where rate moves only rarely exceed 25 bps in either direction.

 Certain assumptions have been made in connection with the calculation of the information set forth in the foregoing interest rate sensitivity table and, as such, there can be no assurance that assumed events will occur or that other events will not occur that would affect the outcomes. The base interest rate scenario assumes interest rates at September 30, 2024. As discussed, the analysis utilizes assumptions and estimates based on our experience and judgment. Furthermore, future purchases and sales of assets could materially change our interest rate risk profile. 
 The information set forth in the interest rate sensitivity table above and all related disclosures constitutes forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act and Section 21E of the Exchange Act. While this table reflects the estimated impact of interest rate changes on the static portfolio, we actively manage our portfolio and continuously make adjustments to the size and composition of our asset and hedge portfolio. Actual results could differ significantly from those estimated in the foregoing interest rate sensitivity table.

Prepayment Risk 
 Prepayment risk is the risk that the principal amount of a mortgage loan will be repaid at a different rate than anticipated. As we receive prepayments of principal on our Agency RMBS, premiums paid on such assets will be amortized against interest income. In general, an increase in prepayment rates will accelerate the amortization of purchase premiums, thereby reducing the interest income earned on the assets. 
 We believe that we will be able to reinvest proceeds from scheduled principal payments and prepayments at acceptable yields; however, no assurances can be given that, should significant prepayments occur, market conditions would be such that acceptable investments could be identified and the proceeds timely reinvested. 
 MSR are also subject to prepayment risk in that, generally, an increase in prepayment rates on the mortgage loans underlying the MSR would result in a decline in value of the MSR as the prepayment acts to cut short the anticipated life of the servicing income stream. 
 Market Risk 
 Market Value Risk. Our AFS securities are reflected at their estimated fair value, with the difference between amortized cost net of allowance for credit losses and estimated fair value for all AFS securities except certain AFS securities for which we have elected the fair value option reflected in accumulated other comprehensive loss. The estimated fair value of these securities fluctuates primarily due to changes in interest rates, market valuation of credit risks, and other factors. Generally, in a rising interest rate environment, we would expect the fair value of these securities to decrease; conversely, in a decreasing interest rate environment, we would expect the fair value of these securities to increase. As market volatility increases or liquidity decreases, the fair value of our assets may be adversely impacted. 
 Our MSR are reflected at their estimated fair value. The estimated fair value fluctuates primarily due to changes in interest rates and other factors. Generally, in a rising interest rate environment, we would expect prepayments to decrease and the fair value of our MSR to increase. Conversely, in a decreasing interest rate environment, we would expect prepayments to increase and the fair value of our MSR to decrease. 
 Our mortgage loans held-for-sale are reflected at their estimated fair value. The estimated fair value fluctuates primarily due to changes in interest rates, market valuation of credit risks and other factors. Generally in a rising rate environment, we would expect the fair value of these loans to decrease; conversely, in a decreasing rate environment, we would expect the fair value of these loans to increase. 
 Real Estate Risk . Residential property values are subject to volatility and may be affected adversely by a number of factors, including national, regional and local economic conditions; local real estate conditions (such as the supply of housing); changes or continued weakness in specific industry segments; construction quality, age and design; demographic factors; retroactive changes to building or similar codes; and impacts of climate change, natural disasters and other catastrophes. Decreases in property values reduce the value of the collateral for residential mortgage loans and the potential proceeds available to borrowers to repay the loans, which may impact the value of our Agency RMBS due to changes in voluntary and involuntary prepayment speeds, and/or may increase costs to service the residential mortgage loans underlying our MSR. 
 Liquidity Risk 
 Our liquidity risk is principally associated with our financing of long-maturity assets with shorter-term borrowings in the form of repurchase agreements and borrowings under revolving credit facilities and warehouse facilities. Although the interest rate adjustments of these assets and liabilities fall within the guidelines established by our operating policies, maturities are not required to be, nor are they, matched. 
 Should the value of our assets pledged as collateral suddenly decrease, lender margin calls could increase, causing an adverse change in our liquidity position. Moreover, the portfolio construction of MSR, which generally have negative duration, combined with levered RMBS, which generally have positive duration, may in certain market scenarios lead to variation margin calls, which could negatively impact our excess cash position. Additionally, if one or more of our repurchase agreement, revolving credit facility or warehouse facility counterparties chose not to provide ongoing funding, our ability to finance would decline or exist at possibly less favorable terms. As such, we cannot provide assurance that we will always be able to roll over our repurchase agreements, revolving credit facilities and warehouse facilities. See Item 2, Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Liquidity and Capital Resources in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for further information about our liquidity and capital resource management. 
 Credit Risk 
 We believe that our investment strategy will generally keep our risk of credit losses low to moderate. However, we retain the risk of potential credit losses on our mortgage loans held-for-sale and all of the loans underlying our non-Agency securities.

Item 4. Controls and Procedures 
 A review and evaluation was performed by our management, including our Chief Executive Officer, or CEO, and Interim Chief Financial Officer, or CFO, of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as such term is defined in Rule 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Based on that review and evaluation, the CEO and Interim CFO have concluded that our current disclosure controls and procedures, as designed and implemented, were effective as of September 30, 2024. Although our CEO and Interim CFO have determined our disclosure controls and procedures were effective at the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, a control system, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that it will detect or uncover failures within the company to disclose material information otherwise required to be set forth in the reports we submit under the Exchange Act. 
 There was no change in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the quarter ended September 30, 2024 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

PART II. OTHER INFORMATION 

Item 1. Legal Proceedings 
 From time to time, we may be involved in various legal and regulatory matters that arise in the ordinary course of business. As previously disclosed, on July 15, 2020, we provided PRCM Advisers with a notice of termination of the Management Agreement for cause in accordance with Section 15(a) of the Management Agreement. We terminated the Management Agreement for cause on the basis of certain material breaches and certain events of gross negligence on the part of PRCM Advisers in the performance of its duties under the Management Agreement. On July 21, 2020, PRCM Advisers filed a complaint against us in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, or the Court. Subsequently, Pine River Domestic Management L.P. and Pine River Capital Management L.P. were added as plaintiffs to the matter. As amended, the complaint, or the Federal Complaint, alleges, among other things, the misappropriation of trade secrets in violation of both the Defend Trade Secrets Act and New York common law, breach of contract, breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing, unfair competition and business practices, unjust enrichment, conversion, and tortious interference with contract. The Federal Complaint seeks, among other things, an order enjoining us from making any use of or disclosing PRCM Advisers trade secret, proprietary, or confidential information; damages in an amount to be determined at a hearing and/or trial; disgorgement of our wrongfully obtained profits; and fees and costs incurred by the plaintiffs in pursuing the action. We have filed our answer to the Federal Complaint and made counterclaims against PRCM Advisers and Pine River Capital Management L.P. On May 5, 2022, the plaintiffs filed a motion for judgment on the pleadings, seeking judgment in their favor on all but one of our counterclaims and on one of our affirmative defenses. We opposed the motion for judgment on the pleadings. On August 10, 2023, the motion for judgment on the pleadings was granted in part and denied in part. The discovery period has ended. On November 8, 2023, the Company and the plaintiffs filed motions for summary judgment, seeking judgment in their favor on the pending claims and counterclaims. Each party opposed the other party s motion for summary judgment. The motions for summary judgment are fully briefed. Our board of directors believes the Federal Complaint is without merit and that we fully complied with the terms of the Management Agreement. 

Item 1A. Risk Factors 
 Except as set forth below, there have been no material changes to the risk factors set forth under the heading Item 1A. Risk Factors of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. The materialization of any risks and uncertainties identified in our Forward-Looking Statements contained in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, together with those previously disclosed in the Annual Report on Form 10-K or those that are presently unforeseen could result in significant adverse effects on our financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows. See Item 2, Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Forward-Looking Statements in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. 
 We may not be able to grow or realize the benefits of our direct-to-consumer loan origination platform, which could adversely impact our business, results of operations and financial condition. 
 Late in the second quarter of 2024, through our wholly owned subsidiary, RoundPoint, we began operating an in-house, direct-to-consumer residential mortgage loan originations platform, which was established primarily as a MSR portfolio defense strategy to retain or recapture our existing borrowers. The originations platform also originates loans for borrowers that do not currently have a mortgage loan serviced by RoundPoint and also brokers second lien loans to our borrowers. For our own MSR portfolio, adding new or recaptured MSR through our origination platform is intended to hedge faster than expected MSR prepayment speeds in a refinance environment, and requires less capital relative to acquiring MSR through flow and bulk purchases from third-party originators. In addition, origination activities are generally counter-cyclical to MSR, which provides supplementary sources of profitability to our stockholders while also hedging our MSR. It is possible that the full benefits of the originations platform may not be realized as expected, or at all. Our ability to grow our mortgage loan originations business may be adversely affected by a variety of factors, including without limitation competition from new and existing market participants, rising interest rates, reductions in the overall level of refinancing activity or a decline in our brand and reputation. Any failure to achieve the anticipated benefits of our originations platform could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.

Table of Contents 

We depend on the accuracy and completeness of information about mortgage loan borrowers and any misrepresented information could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. 
 In deciding whether to approve loans through our originations platform, we may rely on information furnished to us by or on behalf of borrowers, including financial statements and other information. We also may rely on representations of borrowers as to the accuracy and completeness of financial and other information provided. If any of this information is intentionally or negligently misrepresented and such misrepresentation is not detected prior to loan funding, the fair value of the loan may be significantly lower than expected. Whether a misrepresentation is made by the loan applicant, another party or one of our employees, we generally bear the risk of loss associated with the misrepresentation and the loan may be unsalable or subject to repurchase. Our controls and processes may not have detected or may not detect all misrepresented information in our loan originations. Any such misrepresented information could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. 
 If our warehouse facilities are terminated or reduced, we may be unable to find replacement financing on favorable terms, or at all, which could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. 
 To finance our origination activities, we have entered into warehouse facilities collateralized by the value of the mortgage loans pledged until they are sold to the GSEs or other third-party investors in the secondary market. Our borrowings are generally repaid with the proceeds we receive from mortgage loan sales. We depend upon multiple lenders to provide warehouse lines of credit for our loans. In the event that any of our warehouse facilities are terminated or not renewed, or if the principal amount that may be drawn under our funding agreements were to decrease significantly, we may be unable to find replacement financing on commercially favorable terms, or at all, which could limit our ability to maintain or grow our originations business. 
 If our ability to sell loans in the secondary market is impaired, it could affect our volume and margins and we may not be able to continue to originate mortgage loans. 
 We originate residential mortgage loans and sell them to the GSEs or other third-party investors in the secondary market. There can be no assurance that we will be able to continue to sell our loans into the secondary market at attractive prices, or at all. If we are unable to sell our mortgage loans to the GSEs or other third-party investors, or the prices for such loans decline, our liquidity may be negatively impacted, we may be unable to continue to fund such loans, our revenues and margins on new loan originations could be reduced and our ability to repay our warehouse facilities could be impaired.

Preferred shares may be repurchased from time to time through privately negotiated transactions or open market transactions, pursuant to trading plans in accordance with Rule 10b5-1 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the Exchange Act, or by any combination of such methods. The manner, price, number and timing of preferred share repurchases are subject to a variety of factors, including market conditions and applicable SEC rules. The preferred share repurchase program does not require the purchase of any minimum number of shares, and, subject to SEC rules, purchases may be commenced or suspended at any time without prior notice. The preferred share repurchase program does not have an expiration date. As of September 30, 2024, we had repurchased an aggregate of 4,179,183 preferred shares under the program for a total cost of 77.3 million. We did not repurchase preferred shares during the three months ended September 30, 2024.
