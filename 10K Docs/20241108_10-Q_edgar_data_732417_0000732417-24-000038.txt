The Company has not incurred or capitalized any contract acquisition costs as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. 
 
 multi-family rental properties, assisted living rental properties, a multi-tenant rental property for persons with disabilities, and a multi-family senior living rental property, all of which are affordable housing projects as of September 30, 2024. In addition, in July 2024, the Company made a tax equity investment in an entity to provide for the historic preservation of a mixed use property in Cedar Rapids, Iowa. The Company has a or greater limited interest in each limited partnership or company. The investment in each was completed after the projects had been developed by the general partner or managing member. On a regular basis, the Company evaluates recoverability of the carrying value of the tax credit real estate investments to determine if an allowance for credit losses is necessary. The allowance for credit losses is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of the investments to the future undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the investment properties, including the low-income housing tax credits and any estimated proceeds from eventual disposition. If there is an indication of impairment, the allowance for credit losses would be established with a charge to credit loss expense. There were no indications of impairment based on management's evaluation and therefore no allowance for credit losses was determined necessary as of September 30, 2024. Depreciation expense is provided on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life of the assets. Expenditures for normal repairs and maintenance are charged to expense as incurred. 
 
 The investments in tax credit real estate are recorded for all years presented using the equity method of accounting, with the exception of the investments in the affordable housing project and historic preservation project described below. The operations of the properties are not expected to contribute significantly to the Company s income before income taxes. However, the properties do contribute in the form of income tax credits, which lowers the Company s effective tax rate. Once established, the credits on each property last for , five years for the historic preservation property, and are passed through from the limited partnerships or entity to the Company and reduces the consolidated federal tax liability of the Company. 
 
 In February 2021, the Company provided construction financing and contributed capital of million to Del Ray Ridge LP, as limited partner, which owns and operates an affordable housing property in Iowa City, Iowa. The Company accounts for the investment in this tax credit real estate using the proportional amortization method as provided for under Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 323-740. The investment qualifies for the proportional amortization method as it meets all of the criteria under ASC 323-740-25-1. Substantially all of the projected benefits are from tax credits and other tax benefits due to the minimum buyout clause included in the partnership agreement. 
 
 In July 2024, the Company provided construction financing and contributed capital of million to SLE Iowa Building, LC, as investor member, which owns and operates a historically preserved mixed use property in Cedar Rapids, Iowa. An additional million of contributions to capital will be due upon certain conditions being met. The Company accounts for the investment in this tax credit real estate using the proportional amortization method as provided for under Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 323-740. The investment qualifies for the proportional amortization method as it meets all of the criteria under ASC 323-740-25-1. Substantially all of the projected benefits are from tax credits and other tax benefits due to the minimum buyout clause included in the operating agreement.

 million and million at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively, and is excluded from the estimate of credit losses. Interest income is accrued on the unpaid principal balance. Nonrefundable loan fees and origination costs are deferred and recognized as a yield adjustment over the life of the related loan. 
 
 The accrual of interest income on loans is discontinued when, in the opinion of management, there is reasonable doubt as to the 
 borrower's ability to meet payments of interest or principal when they become due, which is generally when a loan is 90 days or 
 more past due unless the loan is well secured and in the process of collection. When a loan is placed on nonaccrual status, all previously accrued and unpaid interest is reversed against interest income. Loans are returned to an accrual status when all of the principal and interest amounts contractually due are brought current and repayment of the remaining contractual principal and interest is expected. A loan may also return to accrual status if additional collateral is received from the borrower and, in the opinion of management, the financial position of the borrower indicates that there is no longer any reasonable doubt as to

 Investment securities have been classified in the consolidated balance sheets according to management s intent. Available-for-sale securities consist of debt securities not classified as trading or held to maturity. Available-for-sale securities are stated at fair value, and unrealized holding gains and losses, net of the related deferred tax effect, are reported as a separate component of stockholders' equity. Municipal bonds are comprised of general obligation bonds and revenue bonds issued by various municipal corporations. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, all securities held were rated investment grade based upon external ratings where available and, where not available, based upon management knowledge of the local issuers and their financial situations. There were no trading or held to maturity securities as of September 30, 2024 or December 31, 2023.

 The Company considered the following information in reaching the conclusion that the unrealized losses disclosed in the table above are not attributable to credit losses. None of the unrealized losses in the above table was due to the deterioration in the credit quality of any of the issues that might result in the non-collection of contractual principal and interest. The unrealized losses are due to changes in interest rates. The Company has not recognized any unrealized loss in income because management does not have the intent to sell the securities included in the previous table. Management has concluded that it is more likely than not that the Company will not be required to sell these securities prior to recovery of the amortized cost basis. The securities are of high credit quality (investment grade credit ratings) and principal and interest payments are made timely with no payments past due as of September 30, 2024. The fair value is expected to recover as the securities approach maturity. The U.S. Treasury and other securities are issued and guaranteed by U.S. government-sponsored entities and agencies. The MBS and CMOs have implied U.S. government guarantees of the agency securities. The Company evaluates if a credit loss exists by monitoring to ensure it has adequate credit support considering the nature of the investment, number and significance of investments in an unrealized loss position, collectability or delinquency issues, the underlying financial statements of the issuers, credit ratings and subsequent changes thereto, and other available relevant information. Considering the above factors, management has determined that no allowance for credit losses is necessary for the securities portfolio as of September 30, 2024.

 Management regularly reviews loans in the portfolio to assess credit quality indicators and to determine appropriate loan classification and grading in accordance with applicable bank regulations. The Company's risk rating methodology assigns risk ratings ranging from 1 to 6, where a higher rating represents higher risk. The Company differentiates its lending portfolios into loans sharing common risk characteristics for which expected credit loss is measured on a pool basis and loans not sharing common risk characteristics for which credit loss is measured individually.

Loans 90 days or more past due that are still accruing interest increased million from December 31, 2023 to September 30, 2024. As of September 30, 2024, there were accruing loans past due 90 days or more with an average loan balance of million. There were accruing loans past due 90 days or more as of December 31, 2023 with an average loan balance of million. The accruing loans past due 90 days or more balances are believed to be adequately collateralized and the Company expects to collect all principal and interest as contractually due under these loans. There was no interest income recognized on nonaccrual loans for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and year ended December 31, 2023. 
 
 The allowance for credit losses incorporates an estimate of lifetime expected credit losses and is recorded on each asset upon asset origination or acquisition. The starting point for the estimate of the allowance for credit losses is historical loss information, which includes losses from modifications of receivables to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty. An assessment of whether a borrower is experiencing financial difficulty is made on the date of a modification. 
 
 Because the effect of most modifications made to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty is already included in the allowance for credit losses because of the measurement methodologies used to estimate the allowance, a change to the allowance for credit losses is generally not recorded upon modification. 
 
 In some cases, the Company will modify a certain loan by providing multiple types of concessions. Typically, one type of concession, such as a term extension, is granted initially. If the borrower continues to experience financial difficulty, another concession, such as principal forgiveness, may be granted.

Upon the Company's determination that a modified loan (or portion of a loan) has subsequently been deemed uncollectible, the loan (or a portion of the loan) is written off. Therefore, the amortized cost basis of the loan is reduced by the uncollectible amount and the allowance for credit losses is adjusted by the same amount.

 million; decrease in loan volume which resulted in a decrease of million; decreases in prepayment and curtailment rates, primarily for 1-4 family first liens, resulting in an increase of million; decrease in the individually analyzed loans reserve of million; decreases in qualitative factors determined necessary by management which resulted in a decrease of million and an increase in other changes of million, primarily increased charge-offs leading to higher loss rates. 
 
 The extent to which collateral secures collateral-dependent loans is provided in the previous individually analyzed loans table and changes in the extent to which collateral secures its collateral-dependent loans are described below. Collateral-dependent loans decreased million from December 31, 2023 to September 30, 2024. Collateral-dependent loans include any loan that has been placed on nonaccrual status, accruing loans past due 90 days or more, and loans made to borrowers with financial difficulties. Collateral-dependent loans also include loans that, based on management s evaluation of current information and events, the Company expects to be unable to collect in full according to the contractual terms of the original loan agreement. Collateral-dependent loans were of loans held for investment as of September 30, 2024 and as of December 31, 2023. The decrease in collateral-dependent loans is due to an increase in loans facing financial difficulties of million, a decrease in loans with a specific reserve of million, a decrease in nonaccrual loans of million, and an increase in 90 days or more accruing loans of million from December 31, 2023 to September 30, 2024. There were no significant changes noted in the extent to which collateral secures collateral-dependent loans. 
 
 The Company regularly reviews a substantial portion of the loans in the portfolio and assesses whether the loans share common risk characteristics for which expected credit loss is measured on a pool basis or if the loans do not share common risk characteristics and therefore expected credit loss is measured on an individual loan basis. If the loans are assessed for credit losses on an individual basis, the Company determines if a specific allowance is appropriate. In addition, the Company's management also reviews and, where determined necessary, provides allowances for particular loans based upon (1) reviews of specific borrowers and (2) management s assessment of areas that management considers are of higher credit risk, including loans that have been restructured or modified to a borrower experiencing financial difficulties. Loans that are determined not to be collateral-dependent and for which there are no specific allowances are classified into one or more risk categories and expected credit loss is measured on a pool basis. See Note 1 for further discussion of the allowance for credit losses for loans held for investment. 
 
 Specific allowances for credit losses on loans assessed individually are established if the loan balances exceed the net present value of the relevant future cash flows or the fair value of the relevant collateral based on updated appraisals and/or updated collateral analysis for the properties if the loan is collateral dependent. The Company may recognize a charge off or record a specific allowance related to an individually analyzed loan if there is a collateral shortfall or it is unlikely the borrower can make all principal and interest payments as contractually due. 
 
 For loans that are collateral-dependent, losses are evaluated based on the portion of a loan that exceeds the fair market value of the collateral. In general, this is the amount that the carrying value of the loan exceeds the related appraised value less estimated costs to sell the collateral. Generally, it is the Company s policy not to rely on appraisals that are older than prior to the date the credit loss is being measured. The most recent appraisal values may be adjusted if, in the Company s judgment, experience and other market data indicate that the property s value, use, condition, exit market or other variables affecting its value may have changed since the appraisal was performed. The charge off or loss adjustment supported by an appraisal is considered the minimum charge off. Any adjustments made to the appraised value are to provide an additional charge off or specific reserve based on the applicable facts and circumstances. In instances where there is an estimated decline in value, a specific reserve may be provided or a charge off taken pending confirmation of the amount of the loss from an updated appraisal. Upon receipt of the new appraisals, an additional specific reserve may be provided or charge off taken based on the appraised value of the collateral. On average, appraisals are obtained within of order.

 Contingencies : In the normal course of business, the Company and its subsidiaries are subject to pending and threatened legal actions, some of which seek substantial relief or damages. While the ultimate outcome of such legal proceedings cannot be predicted with certainty, after reviewing pending and threatened litigation with counsel, management believes at this time that the outcome of such litigation will not have a material adverse effect on the Company s business, financial conditions, or results of operations. 
 
 Financial instruments with off-balance sheet risk : The Company is a party to financial instruments with off-balance sheet risk in the normal course of business to meet the financing needs of its customers. These financial instruments include commitments to extend credit, credit card participations and standby letters of credit. These instruments involve, to varying degrees, elements of credit risk in excess of the amount recognized in the consolidated balance sheets. 
 
 The Company s exposure to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by the other party to the financial instrument for commitments to extend credit, credit card participations and standby letters of credit is represented by the contractual amount of those instruments.

For accounting purposes, this swap transaction was designated as a cash flow hedge of the changes in cash flows attributable to changes in the effective federal funds rate, the benchmark interest rate being hedged, associated with the interest payments made on an amount of the Bank s debt principal equal to the then-outstanding swap notional amount. The underlying principal balance will be matched to future planned advances related to a large customer construction project, however, the FHLB advances will remain equal to the notional amount of the swap making it probable that sufficient effective federal funds rate based interest payments would exist through the maturity date of the swap.

 The strength of the United States economy in general and the strength of the local economies in which the Company conducts its operations which may be less favorable than expected and may result in, among other things, a deterioration in the credit quality and value of the Company s assets. This includes current concerns related to higher inflation, rising energy prices, the Russia-Ukraine war, Israeli-Palestinian conflict, and supply chain imbalances. 
 
 The effects of recent financial market disruptions and/or an economic recession, and monetary and other governmental actions designed to address such disruptions, recession, or pandemics. 
 
 The financial strength of the counterparties with which the Company or the Company s customers do business and as to which the Company has investment or financial exposure. 
 
 The credit quality and credit agency ratings of the securities in the Company s investment securities portfolio, a deterioration or downgrade of which could lead to recognition of an allowance for credit losses on the affected securities and the recognition of a credit loss. 
 
 The effects of, and changes in, laws, regulations and policies affecting banking, securities, insurance and monetary and financial matters as well as any laws otherwise affecting the Company, including, but not limited to, potential changes in U.S. tax laws and regulations. 
 
 The effects of changes in interest rates (including the effects of changes in the rate of prepayments of the Company s assets) and the policies of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System.

 The ability of the Company to develop and maintain secure and reliable technology systems, including to detect and prevent the occurrence of fraudulent activity, breaches, or failures of our information security controls or cyber-security related incidents, including as a result of sophisticated attacks using artificial intelligence and similar tools.

 Consumer spending and saving habits which may change in a manner that affects the Company s business adversely. 
 
 The economic impact of natural disasters, diseases and/or pandemics, and terrorist attacks and military actions. 
 
 Business combinations and the integration of acquired businesses and assets which may be more difficult or expensive than expected. 
 
 The costs, effects and outcomes of existing or future litigation. 
 
 Changes in accounting policies and practices that may be adopted by state and federal regulatory agencies and the Financial Accounting Standards Board. 
 
 The ability of the Company to manage the risks associated with the foregoing as well as anticipated. 
 
 These risks and uncertainties should be considered in evaluating forward-looking statements, and undue reliance should not be placed on such statements. Additional information concerning the Company and its business, including other factors that could materially affect the Company s financial results, is included in the Company s filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. 
 
 Economic Environment 
 
 For the year to date 2024, incoming economic data per the Beige Book for the Company's region continue to show slight growth in the labor market and consumer spending while construction and real estate activity was flat. Also, prices were up modestly and wages rose moderately. Headline GDP growth has increased more than expected year to date and underlying demand from households and businesses remained remarkably strong, with the national unemployment rate continuing to remain low. Inflation, however, has been slower to come down than expected after the rapid decline observed in 2023, and the cumulative effect of elevated prices compared with the pre-pandemic era may be weighing on consumer sentiment. While many economists continue to expect U.S. economic conditions consistent with a soft-landing as the economy decelerates over the remainder of 2024, persistent inflation may yet force additional Fed rate hikes, further raising the odds of a mild recession. 
 
 Higher borrowing costs continue to present a risk to the economy, with consumer and business budgets accounting for higher interest costs. Interest rate levels and energy prices, in combination with global economic conditions, fiscal and monetary policy and the level of regulatory and government scrutiny of financial institutions will likely continue to impact our results in 2024. 
 
 Our credit administration continues to closely monitor and analyze the higher risk segments within the loan portfolio, tracking loan payment deferrals, customer liquidity and providing timely reports to senior management and the board of directors. Based on the Company s capital levels, prudent underwriting policies, loan concentration diversification and our geographic footprint, senior management is cautiously optimistic that the Company is positioned to continue managing the impact of the varied set of risks and uncertainties currently impacting the economy and remain adequately capitalized. However, the Company may be required to make additional credit loss provisions as warranted by the extremely fluid economic conditions and continued migration in the loan portfolio towards the special mention risk rating category.

 Critical Accounting Policies 
 
 The Company's consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The financial information contained within these financial statements is, to a significant extent, financial information that is based on approximate measures of the financial effects of transactions and events that have already occurred. Based on its consideration of accounting policies that involve the most complex and subjective decisions and assessments, management has identified its most critical accounting policies to be those which are related to the allowance for credit losses. Information about our critical accounting policies is included under Item 7, Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, filed with the SEC on March 5, 2024, and there have been no material changes in these critical accounting policies since December 31, 2023.

Financial Condition 
 
 Loan demand has slowed in 2024. The lingering inflationary pressures have created significant uncertainty regarding projecting loan demand throughout the remainder of 2024. 
 
 The following table sets forth the composition of the loan portfolio as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023:

 The Bank has an established formal loan origination policy. In general, the loan origination policy attempts to reduce the risk of credit loss to the Company by requiring, among other things, maintenance of minimum loan to value ratios, evidence of appropriate levels of insurance carried by borrowers and documentation of appropriate types and amounts of collateral and sources of expected payment. The collateral relied upon in the loan origination policy is generally the property being financed by the Company. The source of expected payment is generally the income produced from the property being financed. Personal guarantees are required of individuals owning or controlling at least 20 of the ownership of an entity. Limited or proportional guarantees may be accepted in circumstances if approved by the Company s Board of Directors. Financial information provided by the borrower is verified as considered necessary by reference to tax returns, or audited, reviewed or compiled financial statements. The Company does not originate subprime loans. In order to modify, restructure or otherwise change the terms of a loan, the Company s policy is to evaluate each borrower situation individually. Modifications, restructures, extensions and other changes are done to improve the Company s position and to protect the Company s capital. If a borrower is not current with its payments, any additional loans to such borrowers are evaluated on an individual borrower basis. 
 
 The Company has not experienced any significant time lapses in recognizing the required provisions for collateral dependent loans, nor has the Company delayed appropriate charge offs. When an updated appraisal value has been obtained, the Company has used the appraisal amount in determining the appropriate charge off or required reserve. The Company also evaluates any changes in the financial condition of the borrower and guarantors (if applicable), economic conditions, and the Company s loss experience with the type of property in question. Any information utilized in addition to the appraisal is intended to identify additional charge offs or provisions, not to override the appraised value. 
 
 In accordance with Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 102, Selected Loan Loss Allowance Methodology and Documentation Issues, and Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 119, which aligns the staff's guidance with FASB ASC Topic 326, or CECL, the Company

 determines and assigns ratings to loans using factors that include the following: an assessment of the financial condition of the borrower; a realistic determination of the value and adequacy of underlying collateral; the condition of the local economy and the condition of the specific industry of the borrower; an analysis of the levels and trends of loan categories; and a review of delinquent and classified loans. 
 
 Through the credit risk rating process, loans are reviewed to determine if they are performing in accordance with the original contractual terms. If the borrower has failed to comply with the original contractual terms, further action may be required by the Company, including a downgrade in the credit risk rating, movement to non-accrual status, a charge-off or the establishment of a specific reserve. In the event a collateral shortfall is identified during the credit review process, the Company will work with the borrower for a principal reduction and/or a pledge of additional collateral and/or additional guarantees. In the event that these options are not available, the loan may be subject to a downgrade of the credit risk rating. If the Company determines a loan amount or portion thereof, is uncollectible, the loan s credit risk rating may be downgraded and the uncollectible amount charged-off or recorded as a specific allowance for losses. The Company s credit and legal departments undertake a thorough and ongoing analysis to determine if additional specific reserves and/or charge-offs are appropriate and to begin a workout plan for the loan to minimize actual losses. 
 
 The following table presents the allowance for credit losses as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 by loan category, the percentage of the allowance for each category to the total allowance, and the percentage of all loans in each category to total loans: 
 
 September 30, 2024 December 31, 2023 Amount of Total Allowance of Loans to Total Loans Amount of Total Allowance of Loans to Total Loans (In Thousands) (In Thousands) Agricultural 2,322 4.62 3.27 2,516 5.09 3.37 Commercial and financial 9,781 19.48 8.99 8,750 17.71 8.93 Real estate: Construction, 1 to 4 family residential 1,328 2.64 2.19 1,113 2.25 2.33 Construction, land development and commercial 4,126 8.22 7.78 5,369 10.87 9.13 Mortgage, farmland 2,867 5.71 8.06 3,429 6.94 8.18 Mortgage, 1 to 4 family first liens 14,277 28.43 34.55 14,664 29.68 35.52 Mortgage, 1 to 4 family junior liens 3,617 7.20 4.17 3,888 7.87 4.20 Mortgage, multi-family 4,172 8.31 14.24 4,255 8.61 13.70 Mortgage, commercial 5,320 10.59 14.34 3,901 7.90 12.12 Loans to individuals 2,184 4.35 1.09 1,247 2.52 1.17 Obligations of state and political subdivisions 226 0.45 1.32 278 0.56 1.35 50,220 100.00 100.00 49,410 100.00 100.00 
 
 The allowance for credit losses (ACL) totaled 50.22 million at September 30, 2024 compared to the allowance of 49.41 million at December 31, 2023. The percentage of the allowance to outstanding loans was 1.47 and 1.44 at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. The allowance was based on management s consideration of a number of factors, including composition of the loan portfolio, loans with higher credit risks and the overall amount of loans outstanding. The changes in the ACL in 2024 compared to December 31, 2023 is the result of the following factors: changes in the economic factors used resulted in a decrease of 0.99 million; decrease in loan volume which resulted in a decrease of 0.26 million; decreases in prepayment and curtailment rates, primarily for 1-4 family first liens, resulting in an increase of 3.78 million; decrease in the individually analyzed loans reserve of 0.51 million; decreases in qualitative factors determined necessary by

 management which resulted in a decrease of 2.34 million and an increase in other changes of 1.13 million, primarily increased charge-offs leading to higher loss rates. 
 
 The adequacy of the allowance is reviewed quarterly and adjusted as appropriate after consideration has been given to the impact of economic conditions on the borrowers ability to repay, loan collateral values, past collection experience, the risk characteristics of the loan portfolio and such other factors that deserve current recognition. The growth of the loan portfolio and the trends in nonperforming loans are significant elements in the determination of the allowance for credit losses. Quantitative factors include the Company s historical loss experience, which is then adjusted for levels and trends in past due, levels and trends in charged-off and recovered loans, trends in volume growth, trends in nonperforming loans, trends in modified loans, local economic trends and conditions, and industry and other conditions. 
 
 Management has determined that the allowance for credit losses was adequate at September 30, 2024, and that the loan portfolio is diversified and secured, without undue concentration in any specific risk area. This process involves a high degree of management judgment; however, the allowance for credit losses is based on a comprehensive, well documented, and consistently applied analysis of the Company s loan portfolio. This analysis takes into consideration all available information existing as of the financial statement date, including environmental factors such as economic, industry, geographical and political factors. The relative level of allowance for credit losses is reviewed and compared to industry data. This review encompasses levels of total collateral-dependent loans, portfolio mix, portfolio concentrations, current geographic risks and overall levels of net charge-offs. 
 
 Investment securities available for sale held by the Company increased by 110.11 million from December 31, 2023 to September 30, 2024. The fair value of securities available for sale was 23.35 million less than the amortized cost of such securities as of September 30, 2024. At December 31, 2023, the fair value of the securities available for sale was 35.42 million less than the amortized cost of such securities. 
 
 Deposits increased 94.33 million in the first nine months of 2024. In the opinion of the Company s management, the Company continues to have sufficient liquidity resources available to fund expected additional loan growth. 
 
 Brokered deposits are included in total deposits and totaled 54.70 million as of September 30, 2024 with an average rate of 5.11 . Brokered deposits were 24.22 million as of December 31, 2023 with an average interest rate of 5.35 . As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, brokered deposits were 1.62 and 0.74 of total deposits, respectively. 
 
 There were 155.40 million and 296.65 million of Federal Home Loan Bank (FHLB) borrowings as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. There were 103.67 million of Federal Funds purchased as of September 30, 2024 and none as of December 31, 2023. Total funds purchased from the Bank Term Funding program was 219.00 million as of September 30, 2024, and December 31, 2023. It is expected that the FHLB and Federal Funds funding sources will be considered in the future if loan growth exceeds core deposit increases and the interest rates on funds borrowed from the FHLB and Federal Funds are favorable compared to other funding alternatives. 
 
 Dividends and Equity 
 
 In January 2024, Hills Bancorporation paid a dividend of 10.05 million or 1.10 per share. The dividend paid in January 2023 was 1.05 per share. After payment of the dividend and the adjustment for accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), stockholders equity as of September 30, 2024 totaled 494.16 million. 
 
 The Company elected to use the Community Bank Leverage Ratio (CBLR) framework as provided for in the Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief and Consumer Protection Act. Under the CBLR framework, the Company is required to maintain a CBLR of greater than 9 , as measured by dividing the Bank's Tier 1 capital by its average total consolidated assets. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company had regulatory capital in excess of the Federal Reserve s minimum and well-capitalized definition requirements.

 Discussion of operations for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 
 
 Net Income Overview 
 Total net income was 36.58 million in 2024 and 31.27 million in the comparable period in 2023, an increase of 5.31 million or 16.98 . The change in net income in 2024 from the first nine months of 2023 was primarily the result of the following: 
 
 Net interest income before credit loss expense decreased by 1.22 million or 1.41 . 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, credit loss expense was 2.62 million. This represents a decrease in expense of 7.35 million from the credit loss expense of 9.97 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 Noninterest income increased by 1.85 million, or 8.78 . 
 Noninterest expenses increased by 1.39 million, or 2.40 . 
 Income tax expense increased by 1.29 million, or 15.34 . 
 
 For the nine month period ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023 basic earnings per share was 4.03 and 3.40, respectively. Diluted earnings per share was 4.03 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 3.40 for the same period in 2023. 
 
 The Company s net income for the period was driven primarily by three primary factors. The first factor affecting the Company s net income is the interaction between changes in net interest margin and changes in average volumes of the Company's earnings assets. Net interest income of 85.10 million for the first nine months of 2024 was derived from the Company s 4.257 billion of average earning assets during that period and its tax-equivalent net interest margin of 2.74 . Average earning assets in the nine months ended September 30, 2023 were 4.022 billion and the tax-equivalent net interest margin was 2.92 . Net interest income for the Company decreased primarily as a result of increased interest expense from increased interest rates on investment checking and money market accounts as well as certificates of deposits. Interest expense also increased due to the increased volume of certificates of deposits and borrowings the Company has utilized. This is partially offset by increased interest income from increased interest rates and volume on real estate and commercial loans. Interest income also increased on higher interest rates and volume for investments. The Company expects net interest margin compression to impact earnings for the foreseeable future due to competition for loans and deposits. The Company believes growth in net interest income will be contingent on the growth of the Company s earning assets, increasing yield on loans and the ongoing interest rate stance of the Federal Reserve Board. 
 
 The second factor is credit loss expense. The majority of the Company s interest-earning assets are in loans outstanding, which amounted to more than 3.379 billion at September 30, 2024. Credit loss expense was 2.62 million in 2024 compared to 9.97 million in 2023. The decrease in expense when compared to the same period in 2023 is primarily attributable to the following: significant loan volume in 2023 requiring an additional allowance compared to 2024, increased charge-offs and specific reserves in 2023 compared to 2024, decreases in qualitative factors determined necessary by management in 2024, primarily in commercial and financial, commercial real estate, and 1 to 4 family owner occupied mortgages as well as slight improvements to economic factors applied for the allowance in 2024. This is partially offset by lower prepayment rates for 1 to 4 family owner occupied mortgages in 2024 which required an additional allowance. The Company believes that credit loss expense is expected to be dependent on the Company s loan growth, local economic conditions and asset quality. 
 
 The third factor affecting the Company s net income is noninterest income, primarily the increase in trust fees and net gain on sale of loans. Trust fees were 11.23 million and 9.99 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, an increase of 12.43 . This is primarily driven by the increase in assets under management of 0.531 billion from 2.424 billion as of September 30, 2023 to 2.955 billion as of September 30, 2024. Net gain on sale of loans were 1.77 million and 1.14 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, an increase of 56.30 . This is primarily driven by increased activity compared to the same period in 2023.

Net Interest Income 
 
 Net interest income is the excess of the interest and fees earned on interest-earning assets over the interest expense of the interest-bearing liabilities. Net interest income on a tax equivalent basis decreased 0.48 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the comparable period in 2023. The decrease was primarily as a result of increased interest expense from increased interest rates on interest-bearing demand, savings, and time deposits. Interest expense also increased due to the increased volume of time deposits and borrowings the Company has utilized. This is partially offset by increased interest income from increased interest rates and volume on real estate and commercial loans and investments. The Company has continued to experience the migration of funds into time deposits with higher yields as well as increased borrowings leading to the increased interest expense. The net interest margin for the first nine months of 2024 was 2.74 compared to 2.92 in 2023 for the same period. The measure is shown on a tax-equivalent basis using a tax rate of 21 to make the interest earned on taxable and non-taxable assets more comparable. The change in average balances and average rates between periods and the effect on the net interest income on a tax equivalent basis for the nine months ended in 2024 compared to the comparable period in 2023 are shown in the following table: 
 Increase (Decrease) in Net Interest Income Change in Average Balance Change in Average Rate Volume Changes Rate Changes Net Change (Amounts in Thousands) Interest income: Loans, net 189,740 0.54 7,481 13,416 20,897 Taxable securities (26,145) 0.54 (144) 2,279 2,135 Nontaxable securities 57,405 0.78 1,125 1,466 2,591 Interest-bearing bank balances 14,044 0.84 529 182 711 235,044 8,991 17,343 26,334 Interest expense: Interest-bearing demand deposits (62,692) 0.52 438 (3,585) (3,147) Savings deposits (119,481) 0.32 166 (1,644) (1,478) Time deposits 204,401 1.27 (4,381) (8,656) (13,037) Other short-term borrowings 87,140 (0.23) (913) (225) (1,138) FHLB Borrowings 154,055 (0.07) (8,128) 111 (8,017) 263,423 (12,818) (13,999) (26,817) Change in net interest income (3,827) 3,344 (483)

 In pricing loans and deposits, the Company considers the U.S. Treasury indexes as benchmarks in determining interest rates. The Federal Open Market Committee met six times during the first nine months of 2024. The federal funds target rate decreased to 5.00 as of September 30, 2024 from 5.50 as of the same period in 2023. Interest rates on loans are generally affected by the federal funds target rate since interest rates for the U.S. Treasury market normally increase or decrease when the Federal Reserve Board raises or lowers the federal funds rate. As of September 30, 2024, the rate indexes for the one, three and five year indexes were 3.98 , 3.58 and 3.58 , respectively. The one year index decreased 27.11 from 5.46 at September 30, 2023, the three year index decreased 25.42 and the five year index decreased 22.17 . The three year index was 4.80 and the five year index was 4.60 at September 30, 2023. 
 
 Credit Loss Expense 
 
 Credit loss expense was 2.62 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 9.97 million in 2023, a decrease of expense of 7.35 million. Credit loss expense is the amount necessary to adjust the allowance for credit losses to the level considered by management to appropriately account for the estimated current expected credit losses within the Company's loan portfolio. 
 
 A significant component of the Company's approach to estimating expected credit losses are economic forecasts such as Iowa unemployment, all-transactions house price index for Iowa, Iowa real gross domestic product, and National real gross domestic product (National GDP). For the allowance for credit losses as of September 30, 2024, the key loss drivers were Iowa unemployment and National GDP. The change from prior periods is due to the annual reevaluation of key loss drivers for expected credit losses within the Company's loan portfolio. The change to the National GDP was due to forecast information being more readily available compared to Iowa GDP. The decrease in expense when compared to the same period in 2023 is primarily attributable to the following: significant loan volume in 2023 requiring an additional allowance compared to 2024, increased charge-offs and specific reserves in 2023 compared to 2024, decreases in qualitative factors determined necessary by management in 2024, primarily in commercial and financial, commercial real estate, and 1 to 4 family owner occupied mortgages as well as slight improvements to economic factors applied for the allowance in 2024. This is partially offset by lower prepayment rates for 1 to 4 family owner occupied mortgages in 2024 which required an additional allowance. 
 
 The allowance for credit losses balance is impacted by charge-offs, net of recoveries, for the periods presented. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, recoveries were 2.63 million and 1.22 million, respectively; and charge-offs were 5.20 million in 2024 and 4.23 million in 2023. The allowance for credit losses totaled 50.22 million at September 30, 2024 compared to 49.41 million as of December 31, 2023. The allowance represented 1.47 and 1.44 of loans held for investment at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. 
 
 Noninterest Income 
 
 The following table sets forth the various categories of noninterest income for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. 
 Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 Change Change (Amounts in thousands) Net gain on sale of loans 1,774 1,135 639 56.30 Trust fees 11,228 9,987 1,241 12.43 Service charges and fees 9,590 9,735 (145) (1.49) Other noninterest income 356 238 118 49.58 22,948 21,095 1,853 8.78 
 Trust fees were 11.23 million and 9.99 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, an increase of 12.43 . This is primarily driven by the increase in assets under management of 0.531 billion from 2.424 billion as of September 30, 2023 to 2.955 billion as of September 30, 2024. 
 
 Net gain on sale of loans were 1.77 million and 1.14 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, an increase of 56.30 . This is primarily driven by increased activity compared to the same period in 2023.

 Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 Change Change (Amounts in thousands) Salaries and employee benefits 33,295 33,370 (75) (0.22) Occupancy 3,226 3,418 (192) (5.62) Furniture and equipment 5,046 5,190 (144) (2.77) Office supplies and postage 1,517 1,355 162 11.96 Advertising and business development 2,080 2,095 (15) (0.72) Outside services 10,278 9,587 691 7.21 FDIC insurance assessment 1,440 1,340 100 7.46 Other noninterest expense 2,279 1,419 860 60.61 59,161 57,774 1,387 2.40 
 
 In the nine months ended September 30, 2024, outside services expense increased 0.69 million due to an increase in other professional fees of 0.28 million from increased outsourcing services and debit card processing of 0.34 million from increased sales and transaction volume compared to the same period in 2023. 
 
 Other noninterest expense increased 0.86 million or 60.61 , primarily due to increased deferred compensation expense of 0.40 million from the increased stock price valuation and operating losses from fraudulent ATM and debit card activities of 0.40 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 
 
 Other noninterest expense categories experienced marginal period-to-periods fluctuations for the nine months ended September 30, 2024.

Discussion of operations for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 
 
 Net Income Overview 
 
 Net income increased 4.93 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023. Total net income was 12.17 million in 2024 and 7.24 million in the comparable period in 2023, an increase of 68.00 . For the three month periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 basic earnings per share was 1.35 and 0.79, respectively. Diluted earnings per share was 1.35 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 0.79 for the same period in 2023. 
 
 Net Interest Income 
 
 Net interest income is the excess of the interest and fees earned on interest-earning bearing assets over the interest expense of the interest-bearing liabilities. Net interest income on a tax equivalent basis increased 1.50 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the comparable period in 2023. The increase was a result of higher loan volume and interest rates partially offset by higher interest expense attributable to higher rates on interest-bearing demand, savings, and time deposits as well as borrowings. The Company has continued to experience the migration of funds into time deposits with higher yields as well as increased borrowings leading to the increased interest expense. The net interest margin for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was 2.82 compared to 2.81 in 2023 for the same period. The measure is shown on a tax-equivalent basis using a tax rate of 21 to make the interest earned on taxable and non-taxable assets more comparable. The change in average balances and average rates between periods and the effect on the net interest income on a tax equivalent basis for the three months ended in 2024 compared to the comparable period in 2023 are shown in the following table: 
 
 Increase (Decrease) in Net Interest Income Change in Average Balance Change in Average Rate Volume Changes Rate Changes Net Change (Amounts in Thousands) Interest income: Loans, net 97,418 0.50 1,362 4,074 5,436 Taxable securities (17,341) 0.72 (31) 977 946 Nontaxable securities 98,818 0.96 645 730 1,375 Interest-bearing bank balances 16,674 0.55 219 37 256 195,569 2,195 5,818 8,013 Interest expense: Interest-bearing demand deposits 6,070 0.55 (17) (1,278) (1,295) Savings deposits (79,097) 0.23 (44) (294) (338) Time deposits 138,674 0.93 (1,126) (2,153) (3,279) Other short-term borrowings 65,156 (0.43) (508) 1,589 1,081 FHLB Borrowings 92,678 (0.58) (1,361) (1,325) (2,686) 223,481 (3,056) (3,461) (6,517) Change in net interest income (861) 2,357 1,496 
 
 Rate/volume variances are allocated on a consistent basis using the absolute values of changes in volume compared to the absolute values of the changes in rates. Interest on nontaxable securities and loans is shown on a tax-equivalent basis.

A summary of the net interest spread and margin is as follows: 
 (Tax Equivalent Basis) 2024 2023 Yield on average interest-earning assets 4.90 4.35 Rate on average interest-bearing liabilities 2.73 2.08 Net interest spread 2.17 2.27 Effect of noninterest-bearing funds 0.65 0.54 Net interest margin (tax equivalent net interest income divided by average interest-earning assets) 2.82 2.81 
 
 Credit Loss Expense 
 
 Credit loss expense was 2.31 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to a credit loss expense of 6.93 million in 2023, a decrease of expense of 4.62 million. The decrease in credit loss expense compared to the prior year is primarily due to the increase in individually analyzed loans, including loans with specific reserves, in the third quarter 2023 when compared to 2024. Credit loss expense is the amount necessary to adjust the allowance for credit losses to the level considered by management to appropriately account for the estimated current expected credit losses within the Bank's loan portfolio. 
 
 The allowance for credit losses balance is impacted by charge-offs, net of recoveries, for the periods presented. For the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, recoveries were 0.89 million and 0.60 million, respectively; and charge-offs were 2.61 million in 2024 and 2.80 million in 2023. 
 
 Noninterest Income 
 
 The following table sets forth the various categories of noninterest income for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. 
 Three Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 Change Change (Amounts in thousands) Net gain on sale of loans 732 547 185 33.82 Trust fees 3,842 3,310 532 16.07 Service charges and fees 3,242 3,354 (112) (3.34) Other noninterest income 64 159 (95) (59.75) 7,880 7,370 510 6.92 
 
 Net gain on sale of loans were 0.73 million and 0.55 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, an increase of 33.82 . This is primarily driven by increased activity compared to the same period in 2023. 
 
 Trust fees were 3.84 million and 3.31 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, an increase of 16.07 . This is primarily driven by the increase in assets under management of 0.531 billion from 2.424 billion as of September 30, 2023 to 2.955 billion as of September 30, 2024. 
 
 Other noninterest income categories experienced marginal period-to-period fluctuations for the three months ended September 30, 2024.

Income Taxes 
 
 Federal and state income tax expenses were 9.68 million and 8.39 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Income taxes as a percentage of income before taxes were 20.92 in 2024 and 21.16 in 2023. 

Liquidity 
 
 The Company actively monitors and manages its liquidity position with the objective of maintaining sufficient cash flows to fund operations, meet commitments, take advantage of market opportunities and provide a margin against unforeseeable liquidity needs. Federal funds sold and investment securities available for sale are readily marketable assets. Maturities of all investment securities are managed to meet the Company s normal liquidity needs, to respond to market changes or to adjust the Company s interest rate risk position. Investment securities available for sale comprised 20.05 of the Company s total assets at September 30, 2024 compared to 17.95 at December 31, 2023. As of September 30, 2024, investment securities with a carrying value of 339.46 million were pledged to collateralize public and trust deposits and other borrowings. As of December 31, 2023, investment securities with a carrying value of 427.68 million were pledged. 
 
 The Company has historically maintained a stable deposit base and a relatively low level of large deposits, which has mitigated the volatility in the Company s liquidity position. Deposit inflows and outflows can vary widely based on prevailing market interest rates, competition, economic conditions, our business customers' liquidity needs and by recent developments in the financial services industry. Uninsured deposits as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 were approximately 787.54 million and 693.83 million, respectively, which comprised 23.32 and 21.14 of total deposits. 
 
 As of September 30, 2024, the Company had 155.40 million of outstanding borrowings from the Federal Home Loan Bank FHLB of Des Moines compared to 296.65 million as of December 31, 2023. The Company had 103.67 million of Fed Funds purchased as of September 30, 2024 compared to no Fed Funds purchased as of December 31, 2023. The Company had 219 million outstanding in Bank Term Funding Program borrowings as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. These borrowings are used as a means of providing both long and short-term funding for certain assets and for managing interest rate risk. 
 
 The Company had additional borrowing capacity available from the FHLB of approximately 786.85 million at September 30, 2024. As additional sources of liquidity, the Company has the ability to borrow up to 100.00 million from the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago, and has lines of credit with three banks totaling 175.00 million. The borrowings under these credit lines would be secured by the Company s investment securities. In addition, the Company has the option of issuing short-, medium-, and long-term debt, should the Company decide to do so. The Bank Term Funding Program was established by the Federal Reserve in March 2023 to provide an additional source of liquidity against high-quality securities. The combination of high levels of potentially liquid assets, low dependence on volatile liabilities, positive cash flows from operations, and both additional borrowing and brokered deposits capacity provided sources of liquidity for the Company which management considered sufficient at September 30, 2024.

 Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk 
 
 The Company's primary market risk exposure is to changes in interest rates. Interest rate risk is the risk to current or anticipated earnings or capital arising from movements in interest rates. Interest rate risk arises from repricing risk, basis risk, yield curve risk and options risk. Repricing risk is the difference between the timing of rate changes and the timing of cash flows. Basis risk is the difference from changing rate relationships among different yield curves affecting Bank activities. Yield curve risk is the difference from changing rate relationships across the spectrum of maturities. Option risk is the difference resulting from interest-related options embedded in Company products. The Company s primary source of interest rate risk exposure arises from repricing risk. To measure this risk the Company uses a static gap measurement system that identifies the repricing gaps across the full maturity spectrum of the Company s assets and liabilities and an earnings simulation approach. The gap schedule is known as the interest rate sensitivity report. The report reflects the repricing characteristics of the Company s assets and liabilities. The report details the calculation of the gap ratio. This ratio indicates the amount of interest-earning assets repricing within a given period in comparison to the amount of interest-bearing liabilities repricing within the same period of time. A gap ratio of 1.0 indicates a matched position, in which case the effect on net interest income due to interest rate movements will be minimal. A gap ratio of less than 1.0 indicates that more liabilities than assets reprice within the time period, and a ratio greater than 1.0 indicates that more assets reprice than liabilities. 
 
 The Company's asset/liability management, or its management of interest rate risk, is focused primarily on evaluating and managing net interest income given various risk criteria. Factors beyond the Company's control, such as market interest rates and competition, may also have an impact on the Company's interest income and interest expense. In the absence of other factors, the Company's overall yield on interest-earning assets will increase as will its cost of funds on its interest-bearing liabilities when market interest rates increase over an extended period of time. Inversely, the Company's yields and cost of funds will decrease when market rates decline. The Company is able to manage these swings to some extent by attempting to control the maturity or rate adjustments of its interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities over given periods of time. 
 
 The Company maintains an Asset/Liability Committee, which meets at least quarterly to review the interest rate sensitivity position and to review and develop various strategies for managing interest rate risk within the context of the following factors: 1) capital adequacy, 2) asset/liability mix, 3) economic outlook, 4) market characteristics and 5) the interest rate forecast. In addition, the Company uses a simulation model to review various assumptions relating to interest rate movement. The Company engages a third party that utilizes a modeling program to measure the Company s exposure to potential interest rate changes. For various assumed hypothetical changes in market interest rates, this analysis measures the estimated change in net interest income. The simulations allow for ongoing assessment of interest rate sensitivity and can include the impact of potential new business strategies. The modeled scenarios begin with a base case in which rates are unchanged and include parallel and nonparallel rate shocks. The results of these shocks are measured in two forms: first, the impact on the net interest margin and earnings over one and two year time frames; and second, the impact on the market value of equity. The results of the simulation are compared against approved policy limits. The model attempts to limit rate risk even if it appears the Company s asset and liability maturities are perfectly matched and a favorable interest margin is present. The Company s policy is to generally maintain a balance between profitability and interest rate risk. 
 
 In order to minimize the potential effects of adverse material and prolonged increases or decreases in market interest rates on the Company's operations, management has implemented an asset/liability program designed to mitigate the Company's interest rate sensitivity. The program emphasizes the origination of adjustable rate loans, which are held in the portfolio, the investment of excess cash in short or intermediate term interest-earning assets, and the solicitation of transaction deposit accounts, which are less sensitive to changes in interest rates and can be re-priced rapidly. 
 
 The Company's interest rate risk, as monitored by management, has not significantly increased since year-end. Our earnings and cash flows are largely dependent upon our net interest income. Interest rates are highly sensitive to many factors that are beyond our control, including domestic and local economic conditions and the policies of various governmental and regulatory agencies and, in particular, the Federal Reserve. Further increases to prevailing interest rates could influence the interest we receive on loans and investments and the amount of interest we pay on deposits and borrowings. For instance, if our liabilities are positioned to reprice faster than our assets in a rising-rate environment, our net interest income could be detrimentally impacted as a result. Moreover, additional increases to the target range for the federal funds rate, combined with recent bank failures and ongoing geopolitical instability, raise the risk of economic recession. Any such downturn, especially in the regions in which we operate, may adversely affect our asset quality, deposit levels, loan demand and results of operations.

 (1) On July 26, 2005, the Company s Board of Directors authorized a program to repurchase up to 1,500,000 shares of the Company s common stock (the 2005 Stock Repurchase Program ). On August 9, 2022, the Company s Board of Directors authorized the expansion of the 2005 Stock Repurchase Program to allow an additional 750,000 shares for repurchase and the continuation through December 31, 2027. The Company expects the purchases pursuant to the 2005 Stock Repurchase Program to be made from time to time in private transactions at a price equal to the most recent quarterly independent appraisal of the shares of the Company s common stock and with the Board reviewing the overall results of the 2005 Stock Repurchase Program on a quarterly basis. All purchases made pursuant to the 2005 Stock Repurchase Program since its inception have been made on that basis. The amount and timing of stock repurchases will be based on various factors, such as the Board s assessment of the Company s capital structure and liquidity, the amount of interest shown by shareholders in selling shares of stock to the Company at their appraised value, and applicable regulatory, legal and accounting factors.
