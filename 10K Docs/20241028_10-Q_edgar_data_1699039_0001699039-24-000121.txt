 Warrant from PerfX Acquisition 
 The PerfX acquisition purchase price included a warrant to acquire a ownership in the XConnect Business XConnect ), which expires on July 8, 2031. XConnect is the manufacturer of a perforating gun system developed by the PerfX sellers alongside the PerfX wireline service business. The warrant requires the Company to maintain a specific minimum level of purchases of XConnect s manufactured products. As of June 30, 2024, the Company failed to maintain the specified minimum level of purchases, resulting in a forfeiture event. The Company elected not to cure the forfeiture event leading to a reduction in the ownership percentage to . During the third quarter of 2024, the Company continued to fall below the minimum level of purchases required, which may result in the cancellation of the warrant.. The value of the warrant by the Company remains negligible as of September 30, 2024. The Company finalized the purchase price allocation in the fourth quarter of 2021.

 and , respectively. The Company is subject to the Texas Margin Tax, which requires tax payments at a maximum statutory effective rate of on the taxable margin of each taxable entity that does business in Texas. 
 Tax Attributes 
 Historically, utilization of a portion of the Company's net operating loss carryforwards has been subject to limitations of utilization under Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 Section 382 ), as amended. The Company incurred an ownership change, triggering another Section 382 loss limitation, during the three months ended June 30, 2023. 
 As the Company continues to experience increasing profits and no longer has a trailing 3-year cumulative taxable loss, we currently believe that it is more likely than not to fully utilize all deferred tax assets including those associated with the net operating loss carry-forward. Accordingly, the Company released all valuation allowances previously recorded resulting in a discrete tax benefit for the period ended September 30, 2023. 
 Other Tax Matters 
 Total income tax expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 differed from amounts computed by applying the U.S. federal statutory tax rates to pre-tax income or loss primarily due to the impact of state income taxes as well as certain non-deductible expenses offset by the benefit from the release of a previously recorded valuation allowance against deferred tax assets.

Financial Statements of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q (the Quarterly Report ). This discussion contains forward-looking statements reflecting our current expectations, estimates and assumptions concerning events and financial trends that may affect our future operating results or financial position. Actual results and the timing of events may differ materially from those contained in these forward-looking statements due to a number of factors. Factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include, but are not limited to, market prices and demand for oil and natural gas, capital expenditures, economic and competitive conditions, regulatory changes and other uncertainties, as well as those factors discussed below and elsewhere in this report. Please read the Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements. Also, please read the risk factors and other cautionary statements described under Risk Factors in this Quarterly Report and in our Annual Report. We assume no obligation to update any of these forward-looking statements except as required by law.

 How We Evaluate Our Operations 
 Our service offerings consist of well completion support, workover, well maintenance, wireline, other complementary services, as well as well installation, commissioning and operating of modular equipment, which are conducted in three reportable segments, as follows: 
 High Specification Rigs . Provides high specification well service rigs to facilitate operations throughout the lifecycle of a well. 
 Wireline Services . Provides services necessary to bring and maintain a well on production and consists of our completion, production and pump down service lines. 
 Processing Solutions and Ancillary Services . Provides complimentary services often utilized in conjunction with our High Specification Rigs and Wireline Services segments. These services primarily include equipment rentals, coil tubing, plug and abandonment, snubbing, and processing solutions. 
 Other. Other represents costs not allocable to the reporting segments and includes corporate general and administrative expense and depreciation of corporate furniture and fixtures, amortization, impairments, debt retirements and other items similar in nature. 
 For additional financial information about our segments, please see Item 1. Financial Information Note 15 Segment Reporting. 
 Business Outlook 
 The outlook for the majority of the Company s service lines remains stable. Despite drilling and completion activity declines during 2023 continuing throughout the first three quarters of 2024, the Company was able to maintain consistent performance through most quarters with declines in some service lines occurring at the start of 2024 due to increased competition, reduced activity levels and typical seasonality. Activity levels have since recovered in most service lines and, going forward, we anticipate the global economy and commodity prices to provide a constructive demand backdrop for our services. OPEC+ production cuts have continued and are expected to keep commodity prices at a stable level through the remainder of 2024. Furthermore, both EIA and OPEC+ are projecting for global oil inventories to decline due to flat production and increasing oil consumption in 2024. OPEC+ is projecting oil demand to rise by 2.11 million barrels per day in 2024 and by 1.78 million barrels per day in 2025, driving continued investment and growth in the sector. Consolidation occurring at the E P operator level within the energy industry is expected to impact U.S. onshore activity levels although the full extent of this impact is not yet known. The Company has, thus far, benefited from this consolidation and, over the long-term, the Company expects favorable preference from these larger organizations where the well-established processes and systems of Ranger are more valued. 
 The Company believes current geopolitical events will continue to have an impact on our industry, potentially including the results of the U.S. election cycle in the fourth quarter. Considering the rapidly evolving events and the interplay of supply and demand within oil and gas commodities sector, numerous unknown factors could materially impact our operations. These events have already, and are likely to continue, influencing commodity prices, causing volatility that could have a material effect on our earnings, cash flows, and financial condition.

Financial Metrics 
 How We Generate Revenue 
 Rig hours and stage counts, as it relates to our High Specification Rigs and parts of our Wireline Services segments, respectively, are important indicators of our activity levels and profitability. Rig hours represent the aggregate number of hours that our well service rigs actively worked. Stage counts represent the number of completed stages during the periods presented for the completion service line within our Wireline Services segment. Generally, during the period our services are being provided, our customers are billed on an hourly basis for our high specification rig services or, as it relates to our wireline services, customers are billed upon the completion of the well, on a monthly basis, or on a per job basis. The rates for which the customer is billed is generally predetermined based upon a contractual agreement. 
 Costs of Conducting Our Business 
 The principal costs associated with conducting our business are personnel, repairs and maintenance, general and administrative, and depreciation expense. 
 Cost of Services. The primary costs associated with our cost of services are related to personnel expenses, lease costs, repairs and maintenance of our fixed assets and, additionally, as it relates to our Wireline Services segment, perforating and gun costs. A significant portion of these expenses are variable, and therefore typically managed based on industry conditions and demand for our services. Further, there is generally a correlation between our revenue generated and personnel and repairs and maintenance costs, which are dependent upon the operational activity. 
 Personnel costs associated with our operational employees represent the most significant cost of our business. A substantial portion of our labor costs is attributable to our field crews and is partly variable based on the requirements of specific customers. A key component of personnel costs relates to the ongoing training of our employees, which improves safety rates and reduces attrition. 
 General Administrative. General and administrative expenses are corporate in nature and are included within Other. These costs include the majority of centrally-located company management and administrative personnel and are not attributable to any of our lines of businesses nor reporting segments. 
 Operating Income or Loss 
 We analyze our operating income or loss by segment, which we have defined as revenue less cost of services and depreciation expense. We believe this is a key financial metric as it provides insight on profitability and operational performance based on the historical cost basis of our assets. 
 Adjusted EBITDA 
 We view Adjusted EBITDA, which is a non GAAP financial measure, as an important indicator of performance. We define Adjusted EBITDA as net income or loss before net interest expense, income tax expense, depreciation and amortization, equity based compensation, acquisition related costs, severance and reorganization costs, gain or loss on disposal of property and equipment, and certain other non cash and certain other items that we do not view as indicative of our ongoing performance. See Results of Operations and Note Regarding Non GAAP Financial Measure for more information and reconciliations of net income (loss) to Adjusted EBITDA, the most directly comparable financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP.

 Revenue. Revenue for the three months ended September 30, 2024 decreased 11.4 million, or 7 , to 153.0 million from 164.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The change in revenue by segment was as follows: 
 High Specification Rigs. High Specification Rigs revenue for the three months ended September 30, 2024 increased 7.5 million, or 9 , to 86.7 million from 79.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The revenue increase is attributable to improved pricing and the average revenue per rig hour increasing 6 to 741 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 from 700 for the three months ended September 30, 2023, coupled by a corresponding increase in total rig hours to 116,900 hours for the three months ended September 30, 2024 from 112,400 hours reported for three months ended September 30, 2023. 
 Wireline Services. Wireline Services revenue for the three months ended September 30, 2024 decreased 22.9 million, or 43 , to 30.3 million from 53.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The decreased revenue was primarily attributable to a decrease in completion services revenue of 26.0 million where there was a 63 decrease in completed stage counts to 2,500 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 from 6,800 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. This decrease in completion services revenue and stage count is indicative of lower operational activity reflecting the Company s decision to pursue only work with appropriate margins. Wireline production services and pump down revenue increased year over year by a net of 3.2 million reflecting increased operational activity offset by market pricing pressure. 
 Processing Solutions and Ancillary Services. Processing Solutions and Ancillary Services revenue for the three months ended September 30, 2024 increased 4.0 million, or 13 , to 36.0 million from 32.0 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in revenue is primarily attributable to increases in revenue within rentals, plugging and abandonment, logistics, and coil tubing by 1.7 million, 1.4 million, 0.6 million, and 0.4 million, respectively. 
 22 

Cost of services (exclusive of depreciation and amortization). Cost of services for the three months ended September 30, 2024 decreased 12.8 million, or 9 , to 122.0 million from 134.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. As a percentage of revenue, cost of services was 80 and 82 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The change in cost of services by segment was as follows: 
 High Specification Rigs. High Specification Rigs cost of services for the three months ended September 30, 2024 increased 3.7 million, to 67.2 million from 63.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase was primarily attributable to an increase in variable expenses, notably employee-related labor costs, repair and maintenance costs, and travel costs of 2.5 million, 0.9 million and 0.6 million, respectively. As a percentage of High Specification Rigs revenue, cost of services improved from 80 for the three months ended September 30, 2023 to 78 for the three months ended September 30, 2024. 
 Wireline Services. Wireline Services cost of services for the three months ended September 30, 2024 decreased 18.2 million, or 40 , to 27.6 million from 45.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease in wireline services cost of sales was primarily attributable to reductions in completion services costs of 22.5 million as the Company reorganized this service line during the year to align with lower operating levels. As a percentage of Wireline Services revenue, cost of services increased from 86 for the three months ended September 30, 2023 to 91 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 primarily due to declining operating leverage due to lower activity levels. 
 Processing Solutions and Ancillary Services. Processing Solutions and Ancillary Services cost of services for the three months ended September 30, 2024 increased 1.7 million, or 7 , to 27.2 million from 25.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase was primarily attributable to increased direct material costs and equipment rentals which accounted for 1.1 million and 0.7 million, respectively. As a percentage of Processing Solutions and Ancillary Services revenue, cost of services improved from 80 for the three months ended September 30, 2023 to 76 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 due to increased operational efficiencies and cost reductions. 
 General Administrative. General and administrative expenses remained relatively flat; the three months ended September 30, 2024 increased 0.1 million, or 1 , to 7.1 million from 7.0 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. 
 Depreciation and Amortization. Depreciation and amortization for the three months ended September 30, 2024 increased 0.5 million, or 5 , to 11.1 million from 10.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase was attributable to increased capital expenditures with shorter useful lives added during the latter half of 2023 into 2024. 
 Interest Expense, net. Interest expense, net remained flat at 0.7 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. The changes in interest expense were attributable to reduced borrowings on the Wells Fargo Revolving Credit Facility, offset by increased borrowing costs on finance leases. 
 Income Tax Expense. Income tax expense for the three months ended September 30, 2024 increased 1.9 million, or 119 , to 3.5 million from 1.6 million for three months ended September 30, 2023. The lower tax rate for the period ended September 30, 2023 resulted from discreet tax benefits recognized during the three months ended September 30, 2023. 
 Net Income. Net income for the three months ended September 30, 2024 decreased 0.7 million, or 7 , to 8.7 million from 9.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease in net income was driven by reduced operating income from activity declines in the Wireline segment, offset by continued increases in other business lines and reduced tax deductions.

 Revenue. Revenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 decreased 57.1 million, or 12 , to 428.0 million from 485.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The change in revenue by segment was as follows: 
 High Specification Rigs. High Specification Rig revenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 increased 14.8 million, or 6 , to 249.1 million from 234.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in revenue included an increase in the average revenue per rig hour by 5 to 730 from 693 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, coupled by a corresponding 1 increase in total rig hours to 341,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from 338,100 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 Wireline Services. Wireline Services revenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 decreased 70.0 million, or 44 , to 87.6 million from 157.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease in wireline services revenue was attributable to reductions in the completions service line totaling 72.6 million illustrated by a 63 decrease in completed stage counts to 7,600 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from 20,600 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. This decrease in completion services and stage count is indicative of lower operational activity reflecting the Company s decision to pursue only work with appropriate margins. Wireline pump down experienced decreases in revenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023 that were driven by pricing reductions as a consequence of increased competition from frac providers. These declines were offset by wireline production service revenue, which increased year over year by 3.4 million reflecting increased operational activity and an intentional management decision to pivot to production related work. 

24 

Processing Solutions and Ancillary Services. Processing Solutions and Ancillary Services revenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 decreased 1.9 million, or 2 , to 91.3 million from 93.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease in processing solutions and ancillary services revenue is attributable to decreases in coil tubing and snubbing of 5.0 million and 1.2 million, respectively. The Company has seen a recovery in both coil tubing and snubbing activity in the third quarter. For coil tubing, third quarter 2024 revenues of 11.2 million represented a high mark for every quarterly reporting period in the last two fiscal years. Increasing activity in other Ancillary Services lines is reflected in increases in revenue in our rentals, plugging and abandonment, and logistics service lines of 1.9 million, 1.5 million and 1.0 million, respectively. Our Torrent gas processing business has continued to grow resulting in revenues of 5.1 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 3.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, an increase of 1.2 million. 
 Cost of services (exclusive of depreciation and amortization). Cost of services for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 decreased 46.0 million, or 11 , to 356.0 million from 402.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. As a percentage of revenue, cost of services was 83 for both nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The change in cost of services by segment was as follows: 
 High Specification Rigs. High Specification Rig cost of services for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 increased 13.2 million, or 7 , to 198.8 million from 185.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase was primarily attributable to an increase in variable expenses, most significant of which is employee-related labor costs, repair and maintenance, and travel accounting for of 9.1 million, 2.2 million and 1.9 million, respectively. As a percentage of High Specification Rigs Services revenue, cost of services increased from 79 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 to 80 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 driven largely by standby labor costs incurred during the first quarter of 2024. 
 Wireline Services. Wireline Services cost of services for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 decreased 55.9 million, or 40 , to 84.4 million from 140.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease is primarily attributable to a decrease in costs from the completion services lines by approximately 64.4 million as the Company reorganized this service line to accommodate lower operation activity and focus on more profitable service lines. As a percentage of Wireline Services revenue, cost of services increased from 89 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 to 96 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 primarily due to declining operating leverage due to lower activity levels. The decrease in completion service line costs were offset by an increase in costs from the production and pump down service lines to drive expanding activity levels. 
 Processing Solutions and Ancillary Services. Processing Solutions and Ancillary Services cost of services for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 decreased 3.3 million, or 4 , to 72.8 million from 76.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease was primarily attributable to decreased employee labor, travel, repair and maintenance, and fuel costs associated which amounted to 2.6 million, 1.1 million, 0.9 million and 0.7 million in cost reductions, respectively. As a percentage of Processing Solutions and Ancillary Services revenue, cost of services improved from 82 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 to 80 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 due to increased operational efficiencies and cost reductions. 
 General Administrative. General and administrative expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 decreased 2.0 million, or 9 , to 20.7 million from 22.7 million. The decrease in general and administrative expenses is primarily due to lower personnel costs relative to the prior year, coupled with legal fees and transactional costs incurred during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 Depreciation and Amortization. Depreciation and amortization for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 increased 4.0 million, or 14 , to 33.3 million from 29.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase was attributable to capital expenditures added during the latter half of 2023 into 2024. 
 Interest Expense, net. Interest expense, net for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 decreased 0.7 million, or 25 , to 2.1 million from 2.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease to net interest expense was attributable to the decreased levels of borrowings year over year in conjunction with refinancings completed during the second quarter of 2023 resulting in lower borrowing costs. 
 Income Tax Expense. Income tax expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 decreased 0.4 million, or 7 , to 5.0 million from 5.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease in tax expense resulted from a decrease in profit before tax when compared to the prior period. 
 Net Income. Net income for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 decreased 9.1 million, or 42 , to 12.6 million from 21.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease in net income was primarily driven by reduced activity in Wireline Services segment.

Note Regarding Non-GAAP Financial Measure 
 Adjusted EBITDA is not a financial measure determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP. We define Adjusted EBITDA as net income or loss before net interest expense, income tax expense, depreciation and amortization, equity-based compensation, gain or loss on disposal of property and equipment, acquisition related costs, severance and reorganization costs, and certain other non-cash and certain other items that we do not view as indicative of our ongoing performance. 
 We believe Adjusted EBITDA is a useful performance measure because it allows for an effective evaluation of our operating performance when compared to our peers, without regard to our financing methods or capital structure. We exclude the items listed above from net income (loss) in arriving at Adjusted EBITDA because these amounts can vary substantially within our industry depending upon accounting methods and book values of assets, capital structures and the method by which the assets were acquired. Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered as an alternative to, or more meaningful than, net income (loss) determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Certain items excluded from Adjusted EBITDA are significant components in understanding and assessing a company s financial performance, such as a company s cost of capital and tax structure, as well as the historic costs of depreciable assets, none of which are reflected in Adjusted EBITDA. Our presentation of Adjusted EBITDA should not be construed as an indication that our results will be unaffected by the items excluded from Adjusted EBITDA.

 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 Overview 
 We require capital to fund ongoing operations, including maintenance expenditures on our existing fleet and equipment, organic growth initiatives, investments and acquisitions. Our primary sources of liquidity have historically been cash generated from operations and borrowings under our credit facilities. As of September 30, 2024, we had total liquidity of 86.1 million, consisting of 14.8 million of cash on hand and availability under our Wells Fargo Revolving Credit Facility of 71.3 million. Under the Wells Fargo Revolving Credit Facility, the total loan capacity was 75.0 million, net of 3.7 million of Letters of Credit open under the facility. This compares to the Company s available borrowings under the Wells Fargo Revolving Credit Facility of 61.7 million as of September 30, 2023 and 69.4 million as of December 31, 2023. We strive to maintain financial flexibility and proactively monitor potential capital sources to meet our investment and target liquidity requirements that permit us to manage the cyclicality associated with our business. We currently expect to have sufficient funds to meet the Company s short and long term liquidity requirements and comply with our covenants of our debt agreements. For further details, see Debt Agreements.

Cash Flows 
 The following table presents our cash flows for the periods indicated: 
 Nine Months Ended September 30, Change 2024 2023 (in millions) Net cash provided by operating activities 51.8 53.1 (1.3) (2) Net cash used in investing activities (27.2) (23.0) (4.2) (18) Net cash used in financing activities (25.5) (25.6) 0.1 Net change in cash (0.9) 4.5 (5.4) (120) 
 Operating Activities 
 Net cash from operating activities decreased 1.3 million to 51.8 million for nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 53.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The change in cash flows from operating activities is primarily attributable to a decrease in operating income for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Cash created from working capital decreased 5.0 million to 4.4 million utilized for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 9.4 million utilized for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 due to improvements in collections activities in the most recent quarters. 
 Investing Activities 
 Net cash used in investing activities increased 4.2 million to 27.2 million for nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 23.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The change in cash flows from investing activities is largely attributable to slight increases in fixed asset additions that took place during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and less proceeds from asset disposals relative to those that occurred during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 Financing Activities 
 Net cash used in financing activities increased 0.1 million to 25.5 million for nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 25.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Cash used in financing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 primarily was allocated to the repurchase of Class A Common Stock (see Item 1. Financial Information Note 10 Equity). 
 Supplemental Disclosures 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company added fixed assets of 4.4 million and 4.4 million primarily related to finance leased assets and asset trades, respectively, across all operating segments. 
 Working Capital 
 Our working capital, which we define as total current assets less total current liabilities, remained relatively flat at 66.2 million as of September 30, 2024, compared to 66.4 million as of December 31, 2023. 
 Debt Agreements 
 Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. Credit Agreement 
 On May 31, 2023, the Company entered into a Credit Agreement with Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., providing the Company with a secured credit facility Wells Fargo Revolving Credit Facility in an aggregate principal amount of 75 million. Debt under the Credit Agreement is secured by a lien on substantially all of the Company s assets. The Company was in compliance with the Credit Agreement covenant of maintaining a Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio FCCR of greater than 1.0 as of September 30, 2024, which is applicable only under certain borrowing levels. 
 The Company has up to 5 million available under the Wells Fargo Revolving Credit Facility for letters of credit, subject to assignment. At loan origination, the Company had a Letter of Credit in the amount of 1.6 million, to be utilized for working capital and general corporate purposes, as needed. On September 25, 2023, the Company entered into an agreement with Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. which designated an additional Letter of Credit in the amount of 1.6 million as part of incremental collateral requirements for the Company s 2024 insurance renewal. The initial maturity date was September 25, 2024, with provisions for automatic annual renewal related to the same insurance policy. On September 25, 2024, the amount of the Letter of Credit was increased to 2.1 million as part of incremental collateral requirements for the Company s 2025 insurance renewal, with a new maturity date of September 25, 2025. The interest rate for this Letter of Credit was approximately 1.8 for the month ended September 30, 2024. 
 31 

The Wells Fargo Revolving Credit Facility was drawn in part on May 31, 2023, to repay the Revolving Credit Facility, M E Term Loan Facility, and the Secured Promissory Note. The undrawn portion of the Wells Fargo Revolving Credit Facility is available to fund working capital and other general corporate expenses and for other-permitted uses, including the financing of permitted investments and restricted payments, such as dividends and share repurchases. The Wells Fargo Revolving Credit Facility is subject to a borrowing base that is calculated based upon a percentage of the Company s eligible accounts receivable and unbilled revenue less certain reserves. The Company s eligible accounts receivable serve as collateral for the borrowings under the Wells Fargo Revolving Credit Facility, which is scheduled to mature on May 31, 2028. The Wells Fargo Revolving Credit Facility includes an acceleration clause and cash dominion provisions under certain circumstances that permits the administrative agent to sweep cash daily from certain bank accounts into an account of the administrative agent to repay the Company s obligations under the Revolving Credit Facility. The borrowings of the Wells Fargo Revolving Credit Facility, therefore, will be classified as Long-term debt, current portion on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet. 
 Under the Wells Fargo Revolving Credit Facility, the total loan capacity was 75.0 million, which was based on a borrowing base certificate in effect as of September 30, 2024. On June 17, 2024, the Company entered into the First Amendment to the Wells Fargo Revolving Credit Facility, which allows for a percentage of unbilled revenue to be included in the calculation of the borrowing base. The Company did not have any borrowings under the Wells Fargo Revolving Credit Facility as of September 30, 2024. The Company does have 3.7 million in Letters of Credit open under the facility, leaving a residual 71.3 million available for borrowings as of September 30, 2024. Borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility bear interest at a rate per annum ranging from 1.75 to 2.25 in excess of SOFR and 0.75 to 1.25 in excess of the Base Rate, dependent on the average excess availability. The weighted average interest rate for the loan was approximately 7.2 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 
 Eclipse Loan and Security Agreement 
 On September 27, 2021, the Company entered into a Loan and Security Agreement with Eclipse Business Capital LLC EBC and Eclipse Business Capital SPV, LLC, as administrative agent, providing the Company with a senior secured credit facility in an aggregate principal amount of 77.5 million (the EBC Credit Facility ), consisting of (i) a revolving credit facility in an aggregate principal amount of up to 50.0 million (the Revolving Credit Facility ), (ii) a machinery and equipment term loan facility in an aggregate principal amount of up to 12.5 million (the M E Term Loan Facility and (iii) a term loan B facility in an aggregate principal amount of up to 15.0 million (the Term Loan B Facility ). On August 16, 2022, the Company fully repaid the Eclipse Term Loan B Facility and Eclipse M E Term Loan Facility, making principal payments totaling 12.4 million and 1.5 million, respectively. On May 31, 2023, the Company extinguished the Eclipse Revolving Credit Facility and Eclipse M E Term Loan Facility, paying the remaining principal amount of 8.4 million to extinguish the debt, using funds from the Wells Fargo Revolving Credit Facility. The Company recognized a loss on the retirement of debt of 2.4 million in connection with the initiation of the Wells Fargo Revolving Credit Facility. 
 Secured Promissory Note 
 On July 8, 2021, the Company acquired the assets of PerfX Wireline Services PerfX ), a provider of wireline services that operated in Williston, North Dakota and Midland, Texas. In connection with the PerfX acquisition, Bravo Wireline, LLC, a wholly owned subsidiary of Ranger, entered into a security agreement with Chief Investments, LLC, as administrative agent, for the financing of certain assets acquired.

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 
 Our significant accounting policies are discussed in our Annual Report and have not materially changed since December 31, 2023. 
 Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 
 We currently have no material off-balance sheet arrangements. 
 
 Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risks 
 Recent Events 
 We continue to expect business opportunities and financial results to remain stable assuming the global economy remains stable. OPEC+ production cuts have continued and are expected to keep commodity prices at a stable level through the remainder of 2024. OPEC+ also expects oil demand to rise by approximately 2.11 million barrels per day in 2024 and by 1.78 million barrels per day in 2025. 
 We believe that geopolitical events will continue to have an impact on the macroeconomic backdrop of our industry, most notably, China s growth expectations and uncertainty regarding Russia s oil supply while under sanctions. The 2022 invasion of Ukraine by neighboring Russia has caused turmoil in global markets, generally driving oil prices higher while also injecting further uncertainty into a worldwide economy recovering from the effects of COVID-19. Additionally, recent events in the Middle East have contributed to further uncertainty and created additional risk to global stability that could ultimately affect our business. 
 Given the continuing conflict globally, there are many unknown factors and events that could materially impact our operations. These events have and continue to impact commodity prices, which could have a material effect on our earnings, cash flows, and financial condition. In the short-term, commodity price fluctuations are highly uncertain. Actual price outcomes will be dependent on the degree to which existing sanctions imposed on Russia, any potential future sanctions, and independent corporate actions affect Russia s oil production or the sale of Russia s oil in the global market. In addition, the degree to which other oil producers respond to current oil prices, as well as the effects macroeconomic developments might have on global oil demand, will be important for oil price formation in the coming months. 
 Interest Rate Risk 
 We are exposed to interest rate risk as a result of borrowings associated with our Wells Fargo Revolving Credit Facility and Financing Agreement to fund operations. As of September 30, 2024, the Company did not have any borrowings under the Wells Fargo Revolving Credit Facility and therefore a hypothetical 1.0 increase or decrease in the weighted average interest rate would increase or decrease interest expense by less than 0.1 million per year. We do not currently hedge out interest rate exposure. We do not engage in derivative transactions for speculative or trading purposes. For a complete discussion of our interest rate risk, see our Annual Report. 
 Credit Risk 
 The majority of our trade receivables have payment terms of 30 days or less. As of September 30, 2024, the top three trade receivable balances represented approximately 21 , 11 , and 11 , respectively, of consolidated net accounts receivable. Within our High Specification Rig segment, the top three trade receivable balances represented 28 , 15 and 12 , respectively, of total High Specification Rig net accounts receivable. Within our Wireline Services segment, the top three trade receivable balances represented 18 , 10 , and 9 , respectively, of total Wireline Services net accounts receivable. Within our Processing Solutions and Ancillary Services segment, the top three trade receivable balances represented 17 , 16 , and 11 , respectively, of total Processing Solutions and Ancillary Services net accounts receivable. We mitigate the associated credit risk by performing credit evaluations and monitoring the payment patterns of our customers. 
 Commodity Price Risk 
 The market for our services is indirectly exposed to fluctuations in the prices of oil and natural gas to the extent such fluctuations impact the activity levels of our E P customers. See Recent Events above for further details. Any prolonged substantial reduction in oil and natural gas prices would likely affect oil and natural gas production levels and therefore affect demand for our services. We do not currently intend to hedge our indirect exposure to commodity price risk.

PART II OTHER INFORMATION 
 
 Item 1. Legal Proceedings 
 Our operations are subject to a variety of risks and disputes normally incident to our business. As a result, we may, at any given time, be a defendant in various legal proceedings and litigation arising in the ordinary course of business.

This Restricted Stock Unit Agreement Agreement is made and entered into as of the Grant Date by and 
 between Ranger Energy Services, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the Company ), and you. 
 
 WHEREAS , the Company adopted the Ranger Energy Services, Inc., 2017 Long Term Incentive Plan (as amended from time to time, the Plan ), under which the Company is authorized to grant equity-based awards to certain employees and service providers of the Company 
 
 WHEREAS , the Company, in order to induce you to enter into and to continue and dedicate service to the Company and to materially contribute to the success of the Company, agrees to grant you this award of RSUs 
 
 WHEREAS , you acknowledge that a copy of the Plan has been furnished to you and shall be deemed a part of this Agreement as if fully set forth herein and the terms capitalized but not defined herein shall have the meanings set forth in the Plan and 
 
 WHEREAS , you desire to accept the award of RSUs granted pursuant to this Agreement. 
 
 NOW, THEREFORE , in consideration of the mutual covenants set forth herein and for other valuable consideration hereinafter set forth, the parties agree as follows 
 
 1. The Grant . Subject to the conditions set forth below, the Company hereby grants you, effective as of the Grant Date, as a matter of separate inducement and not in lieu of any salary or other compensation for your services for the Company, an award (the Award ), consisting of the number of RSUs set forth above in accordance with the terms and conditions set forth herein and in the Plan. Each RSU represents the right to receive, as described herein, one share of Stock or a cash amount equal to the Fair Market Value of one share of Stock, as applicable. 
 
 2. Rights as a Stockholder Dividend Equivalents . 
 
 (a) You shall have no rights as a stockholder of the Company with respect to any shares of Stock that may become deliverable hereunder unless and until you have become the holder of record of such shares of Stock, and no adjustments shall be made for dividends in cash or other property, distributions or other rights in respect of any such shares of Stock, except as otherwise specifically provided for in the Plan or this Agreement (including Section 2(b) ). 
 
 (b) Each RSU subject to this Award is hereby granted in tandem with a corresponding dividend equivalent right DER ), which DER shall remain outstanding from the Date of Grant until the earlier of the settlement or forfeiture of the RSU to which the DER corresponds. Each vested DER entitles 

you to receive payments, subject to and in accordance with this Agreement, in an amount equal to any dividends paid by the Company in respect of the share of Stock underlying the RSU to which such DER relates. The Company shall establish, with respect to each RSU, a separate DER bookkeeping account for such RSU (a DER Account ), which shall be credited (without interest) on the applicable dividend payment dates with an amount equal to any dividends paid during the period that such RSU remains outstanding with respect to the share of Stock underlying the RSU to which such DER relates. Upon the vesting of an RSU, the DER (and the DER Account) with respect to such vested RSU shall also become vested. Similarly, upon the forfeiture of a RSU, the DER (and the DER Account) with respect to such forfeited RSU shall also be forfeited. DERs shall not entitle you to any payments relating to dividends paid after the earlier to occur of the date that the applicable RSU is settled in accordance with Section 6 or the forfeiture of the RSU underlying such DER. Payments with respect to vested DERs shall be made as soon as practicable, and within 60 days, after the date that such DER vests. You shall not be entitled to receive any interest with respect to the payment of DERs. 
 
 3. Vesting of RSUs . The RSUs shall vest in accordance with the following schedule 
 
 Vesting Schedule 
 
 Unless and until the RSUs have vested in accordance with such vesting schedule, you will have no right to receive any Stock or cash in respect of the RSUs. Prior to settlement of this Award, the RSUs and this Award represent an unsecured obligation of the Company, payable only from the general assets of the Company. 
 
 4. Termination of Services . 
 
 (a) Termination Generally . If your service relationship with the Company or its Affiliates is terminated for any reason, then those RSUs that have not vested as of the date of termination shall become null and void and those RSUs shall be forfeited to the Company. Any RSUs that have vested as of the date of such termination shall not be forfeited to the Company. 
 
 (b) Effect of Other Agreements . Notwithstanding any provision herein to the contrary, in the event of any inconsistency between this Section 4 and any services, consulting, severance or change in control agreement between you and the Company or a similar plan or arrangement sponsored or maintained by the Company in which you participate, the terms of such services, consulting, severance or change in control agreement or similar plan or arrangement shall control. 
 
 5. Leave of Absence . With respect to the Award, the Company may, in its sole discretion, determine that if you are on leave of absence for any reason you will be considered to still be providing services to the Company, provided that rights to the RSUs during a leave of absence will be limited to the extent to which those rights were earned or vested when the leave of absence began. 
 
 6. Settlement of RSUs . Promptly following the vesting of the RSUs pursuant to Section 3 of this Agreement but in no event later than 60 days after such vesting date, the Company shall deliver to you in settlement of such vested RSUs (a) a number of shares of Stock equal to 100 of the number of RSUs that vested, or (b)(i) a number of shares of Stock equal to 70 of the number of RSUs that vested, and (ii) a cash amount equal to the product of the Fair Market Value of a share of Stock on the applicable vesting date and 30 of the number of RSUs that vested. Within 30 calendar days following the Grant Date, you shall have the ability to make a one-time election by delivering notice to the Company in accordance with Section 16 to receive settlement under this Section 3 in the form described in Section 6(a) or Section 6(b), in your sole discretion. To 

the extent that you make a compliant election, the Company shall settle such vested RSUs in accordance with such election. If you fail to provide such notice to the Company, any vested RSUs shall be settled in the form described in Section 6(b). All shares of Stock issued hereunder, if any, shall be delivered either by delivering one or more certificates for such shares to you or by entering such shares in book-entry form, as determined by the Committee in its sole discretion. The value of shares of Stock shall not bear any interest owing to the passage of time. Neither this Section 6 nor any action taken pursuant to or in accordance with this Agreement shall be construed to create a trust or a funded or secured obligation of any kind. 
 
 7. Payment of Taxes . In connection with the vesting or settlement of the RSUs or the DERs granted hereunder, you (or any person permitted to receive settlement of the Award in the event of your death) shall be responsible for satisfying withholding taxes and other tax obligations relating to the Award. You acknowledge that there may be adverse tax consequences upon the transfer, vesting or settlement of the RSUs or DERs and that you have been advised, and hereby are advised, to consult a tax advisor prior to such transfer, vesting or settlement. You represent that you are in no manner relying on the Board, the Committee, the Company or any of its Affiliates or any of their respective managers, directors, officers, employees or authorized representatives (including, without limitation, attorneys, accountants, consultants, bankers, lenders, prospective lenders and financial representatives) for tax advice or an assessment of such tax consequences. 
 
 8. Compliance with Applicable Law . Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary, the issuance of Stock will be subject to compliance with all applicable requirements of federal, state, or foreign law with respect to such securities and with the requirements of any stock exchange or market system upon which the Stock may then be listed. No Stock will be issued hereunder if such issuance would constitute a violation of any applicable federal, state, or foreign securities laws or other law or regulations or the requirements of any stock exchange or market system upon which the Stock may then be listed. In addition, Stock will not be issued hereunder unless (a) a registration statement under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the Act ), is at the time of issuance in effect with respect to the shares issued or (b) in the opinion of legal counsel to the Company, the shares issued may be issued in accordance with the terms of an applicable exemption from the registration requirements of the Act. The inability of the Company to obtain from any regulatory body having jurisdiction the authority, if any, deemed by the Company s legal counsel to be necessary to the lawful issuance and sale of any shares subject to the Award will relieve the Company of any liability in respect of the failure to issue such shares as to which such requisite authority has not been obtained. As a condition to any issuance hereunder, the Company may require you to satisfy any qualifications that may be necessary or appropriate to evidence compliance with any applicable law or regulation and to make any representation or warranty with respect to such compliance as may be requested by the Company. From time to time, the Board and appropriate officers of the Company are authorized to take the actions necessary and appropriate to file required documents with governmental authorities, stock exchanges, and other appropriate Persons to make shares of Stock available for issuance. 
 
 9. Legends . If a stock certificate is issued with respect to shares of Stock delivered hereunder, such certificate shall bear such legend or legends as the Committee deems appropriate in order to reflect the restrictions set forth in this Agreement and to ensure compliance with the terms and provisions of this Agreement, the rules, regulations and other requirements of the Securities and Exchange Commission, any applicable laws or the requirements of any stock exchange on which the Stock is then listed. If the shares of Stock issued hereunder are held in book-entry form, then such entry will reflect that the shares are subject to the restrictions set forth in this Agreement. 
 
 10. Right of the Company and Affiliates to Terminate Services . Nothing in this Agreement confers upon you the right to continue performing services for the Company or any of its Affiliates, or interfere 

in any way with the rights of the Company or any of its Affiliates to terminate your service relationship at any time. 
 
 11. Furnish Information . You agree to furnish to the Company all information requested by the Company to enable it to comply with any reporting or other requirements imposed upon the Company by or under any applicable statute or regulation.

Any payment of cash or any issuance or transfer of shares of Stock or other property to you, or to your legal representative, heir, legatee or distributee, in accordance with the provisions hereof, shall, to the extent thereof, be in full satisfaction of all claims of such Persons hereunder. The Company may require you or your legal representative, heir, legatee or distributee, as a condition precedent to such payment or issuance, to execute a release and receipt therefor in such form as it shall determine. 
 
 15. No Guarantee of Interests . The Board and the Company do not guarantee the Stock of the 
 Company from loss or depreciation.

In the event any breach of this promise comes to the attention of the Company, it shall take into consideration that breach in determining whether to recommend the grant of any future similar award to you, as a factor weighing against the advisability of granting any such future award to you. 
 
 19. Successors . This Agreement shall be binding upon you, your legal representatives, heirs, legatees and distributees, and upon the Company, its successors and assigns. 
 
 20. Severability . If any provision of this Agreement is held to be illegal or invalid for any reason, the illegality or invalidity shall not affect the remaining provisions hereof, but such provision shall be fully severable and this Agreement shall be construed and enforced as if the illegal or invalid provision had never been included herein.

Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary, the Company reserves the right, without your consent, to adopt any such clawback policies and procedures, including such policies and procedures applicable to this Agreement with retroactive effect.
