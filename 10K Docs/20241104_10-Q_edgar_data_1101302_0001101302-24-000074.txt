 Divestiture - Pipeline and Industrial Materials 
 
 During the first quarter of 2024, the Company completed the sale of its Pipeline and Industrial Materials PIM business, which became part of the Company with the acquisition of CMC Materials, to SCF Partners, Inc. The PIM business specializes in the manufacture and sale of drag reducing agents and a range of valve maintenance products and services for the oil and gas industry, and reported into the MS segment of the Company. 
 The Company received gross cash proceeds of million, or net proceeds of million, and up to million in cash earn-out payments contingent upon the performance of the PIM business in 2025 and 2026. 
 
 The Company s policy is to account for the contingent consideration arrangement in accordance with ASC 450, Contingencies (Subtopic 450-30). Under this approach, the Company recognizes the contingent consideration receivable in earnings after the contingency is resolved. Accordingly, to determine the initial gain on the sale of the PIM business, the Company did not include an amount related to the contingent consideration arrangement as part of the consideration received. 
 
 Final working capital adjustment Cash transferred to the buyer on the closing balance sheet ) Direct costs to sell ) Fair value of sale consideration 
 
 The disposition of the PIM business did not meet the criteria to be classified as a discontinued operation in the Company s financial statements since the disposition did not represent a strategic shift that had, or will have, a major effect on the Company s operations and financial results.

 Overview 
 
 The Company is a leading supplier of mission-critical advanced materials and process solutions for the semiconductor and other high-technology industries. We leverage our unique breadth of capabilities to help our customers improve their productivity, performance and technology in the most advanced manufacturing environments. 
 
 Our business is organized and operated in three operating segments. 
 
 Materials Solutions: MS provides materials-based solutions, such as chemical mechanical planarization CMP slurries and pads, deposition materials, process chemistries and gases, formulated cleans, etchants and other specialty materials that enable our customers to achieve better device performance and faster time to yield, while providing for lower total cost of ownership. 
 Microcontamination Control: MC offers advanced solutions that improve customers yield, device reliability and cost by filtering and purifying critical liquid chemistries and gases used in semiconductor manufacturing processes and other high-technology industries. 
 Advanced Materials Handling: AMH develops solutions that improve customers yields by protecting critical materials during manufacturing, transportation, and storage, including products that monitor, protect, transport and deliver critical liquid chemistries, wafers, and other substrates for a broad set of applications in the semiconductor, life sciences and other high-technology industries. 
 
 These segments share common business systems and processes, technology centers and technology roadmaps. With the complementary capabilities within and across these segments, we believe we are uniquely positioned to create new, co-optimized and increasingly integrated solutions for our customers. For example, we offer complementary solutions for our customers consisting of advanced deposition materials products, CMP slurries, pads and post-CMP cleaning chemistries from our MS segment, CMP slurry filters from our MC segment, and CMP slurry high-purity packaging and fluid monitoring systems from our AMH segment.

 Impact of Conflict Between Israel and Hamas 
 The military conflict between Israel and militant groups led by Hamas and other tensions and conflicts in the Middle East have caused uncertainty in the global markets, including, but not limited to, disruptions to shipping routes and risks of further escalations. Revenue relating to products manufactured from raw materials or components sourced from or through this region does not constitute a material portion of our business and historically we have not had significant revenue in this region. There continues to be uncertainty regarding the ultimate impact these conflicts may have on the global economy, supply chains, logistics, fuel prices, raw material pricing and our business.

 lower sales of our liquid filtration products. MC reported a segment profit of 96.7 million in the third quarter of 2024, down 4 from 101.1 million in the year-ago period. The segment profit decrease was primarily due to higher ER D costs and increased costs associated with the ramp up of our new facility in Taiwan. 
 For the nine months ended September 28, 2024, MC net sales increased to 848.6 million, up 1 compared to 839.1 million in the comparable period last year. The sales increase was mainly due to increased sales primarily from gas purification products, partially offset by lower sales of our liquid filtration and gas filtration products. MC reported a segment profit of 277.0 million in the nine months ended September 28, 2024, down 7 from 297.8 million in the year-ago period. The segment profit decrease was primarily due to higher ER D costs and increased costs associated with the ramp up of our new facility in Taiwan. 
 Advanced Materials Handling (AMH) 
 For the third quarter of 2024, AMH net sales increased to 182.2 million, up 1 compared to 180.2 million in the comparable period last year. The sales increase was due to higher sales of our microenvironment solution products, partially offset by lower sales of our fluid handling products. AMH reported a segment profit of 30.6 million in the third quarter of 2024, down 3 from 31.6 million in the year-ago period. The segment profit decrease was primarily due to higher employee costs. 
 For the nine months ended September 28, 2024, AMH net sales decreased to 533.3 million, down 10 compared to 589.5 million in the comparable period last year. The sales decrease was due to lower sales across most product lines related to lower semiconductor market demand. AMH reported a segment profit of 84.2 million in the nine months ended September 28, 2024, down 27 from 115.6 million in the year-ago period. The segment profit decrease was primarily due to lower sales volume and increased costs associated with the ramp up of our new facility in Taiwan. 
 Unallocated general and administrative expenses 
 Unallocated general and administrative expenses totaled 16.6 million in the third quarter of 2024, compared to 21.4 million in the comparable period last year. The 4.9 million decrease is primarily due to a 9.9 million decrease in integration, deal and transaction costs related to the acquisition of CMC Materials, partially offset by a 2.6 million increase in employee costs, primarily due to the timing of the annual equity award grant and 3.0 million increase in non-income tax expense. 
 Unallocated general and administrative expenses totaled 42.4 million in the nine months ended September 28, 2024, compared to 95.0 million in the comparable period last year. The 52.5 million decrease is primarily due to a 45.3 million decrease in integration, deal and transaction costs related to the acquisition of CMC Materials and a decrease of 6.7 million in employee costs, primarily due to the timing of the annual equity award grant. 
 
 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 We consider the following when assessing our liquidity and capital resources: In thousands September 28, 2024 December 31, 2023 Cash and cash equivalents 432,072 456,929 Working capital 1,128,398 1,463,332 Total debt, net of unamortized discount and debt issuance costs 4,125,690 4,577,141 
 
 The Company has historically financed its operations and capital requirements through cash flow from its operating activities, long-term debt, lease financing, revolving credit facility and borrowings under domestic and international short-term lines of credit. 
 Based on our analysis, we believe our existing balances of domestic cash and cash equivalents and our currently anticipated operating cash flows will be sufficient to meet our cash needs arising in the ordinary course of business for the next twelve months and for the longer term. 
 We may seek to take advantage of opportunities to raise additional capital through debt financing or through public or private sales of securities. If in the future our available liquidity is not sufficient to meet the Company s operating and debt service obligations as they come due, management would need to pursue alternative arrangements through additional equity or debt financing in order to meet the Company s cash requirements. There can be no assurance that any such financing would be available on commercially acceptable terms, or at all. To date, in fiscal year 2024, we have not experienced difficulty accessing capital and credit markets, but future volatility in the capital and credit markets may increase costs associated with issuing debt instruments or affect our ability to access those markets. In addition, it is possible that our ability to access the capital and credit markets could be limited at a time when we would like, or need, to do so, which could have an adverse impact on our ability to refinance maturing debt and/or react to changing economic and business conditions.

 In summary, our cash flows for each period were as follows: Nine months ended (in thousands) September 28, 2024 September 30, 2023 Net cash provided by operating activities 455,625 486,371 Net cash provided by (used in) investing activities 40,832 (22,726) Net cash used in financing activities (523,596) (417,467) (Decrease) increase in cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash (24,857) 30,581 
 
 Operating activities Cash provided by operating activities is net income adjusted for certain non-cash items and changes in assets and liabilities. Cash provided by operating activities totaled 455.6 million in the nine months ended September 28, 2024, compared to 486.4 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2023. This decrease was driven by a 123.5 million change in operating assets and liabilities, partially offset by a 92.8 million increase of net income adjusted for non-cash reconciling items. 
 Changes in operating assets and liabilities for the nine months ended September 28, 2024 were driven by changes in trade accounts receivable, inventories, and accounts payable and accrued liabilities. The change in trade accounts receivables was mainly due to increased sales at the end of the period. The change in inventories was mainly due to an increase in business activity. The change in accounts payable and accrued liabilities was primarily driven by timing of payments to vendors. 
 Investing activities Cash flows provided by investing activities totaled 40.8 million in the nine months ended September 28, 2024, compared to cash flows used in investing activities of 22.7 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase resulted primarily from an increase in proceeds from divestitures of 116.5 million and a reduction of cash paid for acquisition of property, plant and equipment of 120.1 million, partially offset by the absence of net proceeds from termination of the alliance agreement with MacDermid Enthone of 169.3 million. 
 Financing activities Cash used in financing activities totaled 523.6 million during the nine months ended September 28, 2024, compared to cash used in financing activities of 417.5 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase was primarily due to the net debt activity, which was a use of cash of 473.8 million during the nine months ended September 28, 2024 compared to 390.0 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2023 and lower proceeds from the issuance of common stock of 16.6 million compared to the previous period. 
 Our total dividend payments were 45.5 million in the nine months ended September 28, 2024 compared to 45.2 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2023. We have paid a cash dividend in each quarter since the fourth quarter of 2017. On October 16, 2024, the Company s board of directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of 0.10 per share to be paid on November 20, 2024 to shareholders of record on the close of business on October 30, 2024.

 On March 28, 2024, the Company amended its Existing Credit Agreement. The Third Amendment provides for, among other things, the refinancing of the Company s outstanding term loans B under the Term Loan Facility in an aggregate principal amount of 955.0 million with a new tranche of term loans B in an aggregate principal amount of 955.0 million. The amended loans bear interest at a rate per annum equal to, at the Company s option, either (i) the SOFR plus an applicable margin of 1.75 , which is a reduction from the applicable margin of 2.50 prior to the amendment, or (ii) a base rate plus an applicable margin of 0.75 , which is a reduction from the applicable margin of 1.50 prior to the amendment. In connection with the Third Amendment, the Company made a payment of 354.5 million on the term loans B. See Note 7 to our condensed consolidated financial statements for further discussion.

During the nine months ended September 28, 2024, there were no borrowings under this line of credit and no balance was outstanding at September 28, 2024. 
 Cash and cash equivalents and cash requirements 
 (In thousands) September 28, 2024 December 31, 2023 U.S. 163,422 154,015 Non-U.S. 268,650 302,914 Cash and cash equivalents 432,072 456,929 
 Our cash and cash equivalents include cash on hand and highly liquid debt securities with original maturities of three months or less, which are valued at cost and approximate fair value. We utilize a variety of funding strategies in an effort to ensure that our worldwide cash is available in the locations in which it is needed. We have accrued taxes on any earnings that are not indefinitely reinvested. 
 
 Cash requirements 
 We have cash requirements to support working capital needs, capital expenditures, business acquisitions, contractual obligations, commitments, principal and interest payments on debt and other liquidity requirements associated with our operations. We generally intend to use available cash and funds generated from our operations to meet these cash requirements, but in the event that additional liquidity is required we may also borrow under our Revolving Facility. 
 There were no material changes to the cash requirements from our Annual Report that were outside the ordinary course of business, except for the principal repayments of 473.8 million made on the Term Loan Facility as discussed above.

 Recently issued accounting pronouncements Refer to Note 1 to the Company s condensed consolidated financial statements for a discussion of recently issued but not yet adopted accounting pronouncements. 
 Non-GAAP Information The Company s condensed consolidated financial statements are prepared in conformity with GAAP. 
 The Company also utilizes certain non-GAAP financial measures as a complement to financial measures provided in accordance with GAAP in order to better assess and reflect trends affecting the Company s business and results of operations. These non-GAAP financial measures include Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted Operating Income, together with related measures thereof, and Non-GAAP EPS, as well as certain other supplemental non-GAAP financial measures included in the discussion of the Company s financial results. 
 Adjusted EBITDA is defined by the Company as net income before, as applicable, (1) equity in net loss of affiliate, (2) income tax expense, (3) interest expense, (4) interest income, (5) other (income) expense, net, (6) goodwill impairment, (7) deal and transaction costs, (8) integration costs, (9) restructuring costs, (10) acquired tax equalization asset reduction, (11) (gain) loss on sale of certain businesses and held-for-sale, net, (12) gain on termination of alliance agreement, (13) impairment of long-lived assets, (14) amortization of intangible assets and (15) depreciation. Adjusted Operating Income is defined by the Company as Adjusted EBITDA exclusive of the depreciation addback noted above. The Company also utilizes non-GAAP financial measures whereby Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted Operating Income are each divided by the Company s net sales to derive Adjusted EBITDA Margin and Adjusted Operating Margin, respectively. 
 Non-GAAP Net Income is defined by the Company as net income before, as applicable, (1) goodwill impairment, (2) deal and transaction costs, (3) integration costs, (4) restructuring costs, (5) acquired tax equalization asset reduction, (6) loss on extinguishment of debt and modification, (7) (gain) loss on sale of certain businesses and held-for-sale, net, (8) gain on termination of alliance agreement, (9) Infineum termination fee, net, (10) impairment of long-lived assets, (11) amortization of

 intangible assets, and (12) the tax effect of the foregoing adjustments to net income. Non-GAAP EPS is defined as our Non-GAAP Net Income divided by our diluted weighted-average shares outstanding. 
 The Company provides supplemental non-GAAP financial measures to help management and investors to better understand our business and believes these measures provide investors and analysts additional meaningful information for the assessment of the Company s ongoing results. Management also uses these non-GAAP measures to assist in the evaluation of the performance of the Company s business segments and to make operating decisions. 
 Management believes the Company s non-GAAP measures help indicate the Company s baseline performance before certain gains, losses or other charges that may not be indicative of the Company s business or future outlook and offer a useful view of business performance in that the measures provide a more consistent means of comparing performance. The Company believes the non-GAAP measures aid investors overall understanding of the Company s results by providing a higher degree of transparency for such items and providing a level of disclosure that will help investors understand how management plans, measures and evaluates the Company s business performance. Management believes that the inclusion of non-GAAP measures provides greater consistency in its financial reporting and facilitates investors understanding of the Company s historical operating trends by providing an additional basis for comparisons to prior periods. 
 Management uses Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted Operating Income to assist it in evaluations of the Company s operating performance by excluding items that management does not consider as relevant in the results of its ongoing operations. Internally, these non-GAAP measures are used by management for planning and forecasting purposes, including the preparation of internal budgets; for allocating resources to enhance financial performance; for evaluating the effectiveness of operational strategies; and for evaluating the Company s capacity to fund capital expenditures, secure financing and expand our business. 
 In addition, and as a consequence of the importance of these non-GAAP financial measures in managing our business, the Company s board of directors uses non-GAAP financial measures in the evaluation process to determine management compensation. 
 The Company believes that certain analysts and investors use Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Operating Income and Non-GAAP EPS as supplemental measures to evaluate the overall operating performance of firms in the Company s industry. Additionally, lenders or potential lenders use Adjusted EBITDA measures to evaluate the Company s creditworthiness. 
 The presentation of non-GAAP financial measures is not meant to be considered in isolation, as a substitute for, or superior to, financial measures or information provided in accordance with GAAP. Management strongly encourages investors to review the Company s condensed consolidated financial statements in their entirety and to not rely on any single financial measure. 
 Management notes that the use of non-GAAP measures has limitations, including but not limited to: 
 First, non-GAAP financial measures are not standardized. Accordingly, the methodology used to produce the Company s non-GAAP financial measures may differ notably from the methodology used by other companies and may not be directly comparable to non-GAAP measures reported by other companies. 
 Second, the Company s non-GAAP financial measures exclude items such as amortization and depreciation that are recurring. Amortization of intangibles and depreciation have been, and will continue to be for the foreseeable future, a significant recurring expense with an impact upon the Company s results of operations, notwithstanding the lack of immediate impact upon cash flows. 
 Third, there is no assurance that the Company will not have future charges for goodwill impairment, restructuring activities, deal costs, integration costs, or similar items and, therefore, may need to record additional charges (or credits) associated with such items, including the tax effects thereon. The exclusion of these items in the Company s non-GAAP measures should not be construed as an implication that these costs are unusual, infrequent or non-recurring. 
 Management considers these limitations by providing specific information regarding the GAAP amounts excluded from these non-GAAP financial measures and evaluating these non-GAAP financial measures together with their most directly comparable financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. The calculations of Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Operating Income, Non-GAAP Net Income and Non-GAAP EPS, and reconciliations between these financial measures and their most directly comparable GAAP equivalents, are presented below in the accompanying tables.

 Item 4. Controls and Procedures 
 (a) Evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures. 
 The Company s management, including the Chief Executive Officer, or CEO, and Chief Financial Officer, or CFO, has conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of the Company s disclosure controls and procedures (as defined under Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, or the Exchange Act) as of September 28, 2024. The term disclosure controls and procedures means controls and other procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to the Company s management, including its principal executive and principal financial officers, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives, and management necessarily applies its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures. Based on management s evaluation (with the participation of the Company s CEO and CFO), as of September 28, 2024, the Company s CEO and CFO have concluded that the disclosure controls and procedures used by the Company were effective to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by the Company in reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in SEC rules and forms, and is accumulated and communicated to management, including its principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.
