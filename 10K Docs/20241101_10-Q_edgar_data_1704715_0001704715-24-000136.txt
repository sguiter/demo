December 31, 2023 Total Fair Value Quoted Prices in Active Markets (Level 1) Significant Other Observable Inputs (Level 2) Significant Unobservable Inputs (Level 3) Trading securities 
 
 The following methods and assumptions were used to estimate the fair values of the assets and liabilities in the tables above: 
 
 Level 2 Fair Value Measurements 
 
 Trading Securities - Typically includes U.S. government securities. The fair values are obtained from a third-party pricing service provider. The fair values provided by the pricing service provider are based on observable market inputs including credit spreads and broker-dealer quotes, among other inputs. The Company classifies the prices obtained from the pricing services within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy because the underlying inputs are directly observable from active markets. However, the pricing models used entail a certain amount of subjectivity and therefore differing judgments in how the underlying inputs are modeled could result in different estimates of fair value.

 with the offset to accumulated other comprehensive loss and a slight increase in net periodic benefit cost to be recognized subsequent to the revaluation date.

 and for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Coal royalty expense was and for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. 
 
 Other Commitments 
 
 Under the terms of its partnership related agreements with respect to its investment in Dominion Terminal Associates DTA ), the Company is required to fund its proportionate share of DTA s ongoing operating and capital costs. In November 2023, the Company, together with DTA management announced that DTA needs additional capital investment to maximize functionality and minimize downtime due to mechanical issues. Beyond the Company s share of routine operating costs, it expects to invest an average of approximately per year for infrastructure and equipment upgrades at DTA over the next 5 years. In addition, to mitigate the risk of shipment delays during the upgrade period, in April 2024, the Company entered into a agreement which allows for the loading of to tons of coal annually at a third party terminal in Newport News, VA. The uses of the Company s 2024 funding of DTA include routine operating and capital costs and infrastructure and equipment upgrades. 
 
 Contingencies 
 
 Extensive regulation of the impacts of mining on the environment and of maintaining workplace safety has had, and is expected to continue to have, a significant effect on the Company s costs of production and results of operations. Further regulations, legislation or litigation in these areas may also cause the Company s sales or profitability to decline by increasing costs or by hindering the Company s ability to continue mining at existing operations or to permit new operations. 
 During the normal course of business, contract-related matters arise between the Company and its customers. When a loss related to such matters is considered probable and can reasonably be estimated, the Company records a liability. 
 (c) Guarantees and Financial Instruments with Off-Balance Sheet Risk 
 In the normal course of business, the Company is a party to certain guarantees and financial instruments with off-balance sheet risk, such as bank LCs, performance or surety bonds, and other guarantees and indemnities related to the obligations of affiliated entities which are not reflected in the Company s Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. However, the underlying liabilities that they secure, such as asset retirement obligations, workers compensation liabilities, and royalty obligations, are reflected in the Company s Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. 
 The Company is required to provide financial assurance in order to perform the post-mining reclamation required by its mining permits, pay workers compensation claims under workers compensation laws in various states, pay federal black lung benefits, and perform certain other obligations. In order to provide the required financial assurance, the Company generally uses surety bonds for post-mining reclamation and workers compensation obligations. The Company can also use bank LCs to collateralize certain obligations and commitments. 
 
 As of September 30, 2024, the Company had LCs outstanding under the ABL Facility.

 DCMWC Reauthorization Process 
 
 In July 2019, the U.S. Department of Labor (Division of Coal Mine Workers Compensation or DCMWC began implementing a new authorization process for all self-insured coal mine operators. As requested by the DCMWC, the Company filed an application and supporting documentation for reauthorization to self-insure certain of its black lung obligations in October 2019. As a result of this application, the DCMWC notified the Company in a letter dated February 21, 2020 that the Company was reauthorized to self-insure certain of its black lung obligations for a period of one-year from February 21, 2020. The DCMWC reauthorization was contingent, however, upon the Company s providing collateral of to secure certain of its black lung obligations. This proposed collateral requirement would have been an increase from the approximate in collateral that the Company currently provides to secure these self-insured black lung obligations. The reauthorization process provided the Company with the right to appeal the security determination in writing within 30 days of the date of the notification, which appeal period the DCMWC agreed to extend to May 22, 2020. The Company exercised this right of appeal in connection with the substantial increase in the amount of required collateral. In February 2021, the U.S. Department of Labor DOL withdrew its Federal Register notice seeking comments on its bulletin describing its new method of calculating collateral requirements. The DOL removed the bulletin from its website in May 2021. On February 10, 2022, a telephone conference was held with DCMWC and DOL decision makers wherein the Company presented facts and arguments in support of its appeal. No ruling has been made on the appeal, but during the call the Company indicated that it would be willing to allocate an additional in collateral. If the Company s appeal is unsuccessful, the Company may be required to provide additional LCs to receive the self-insurance reauthorization from the DCMWC or alternatively insure these black lung obligations through a third-party provider that would likely also require the Company to provide additional collateral.

 to of collateral to secure certain of its black lung obligations. In May 2024, the DOL submitted its final draft of the 2023 Proposed Regulations to the Office of Management and Budget for review. It is unclear when this regulation will become effective; however, the Company will continue to monitor developments. A significant increase in these collateral obligations could have a materially adverse effect on the Company s liquidity. 
 
 Supreme Court s Decision on the Chevron Deference Standard 
 
 The United States Supreme Court's decision in Loper Bright Enterprises v. Raimondo, issued on June 28, 2024, eliminated a 40-year old precedent of judicial deference to regulatory agencies' interpretation of federal laws. Federal agencies such as the DOL and EPA have relied on this now-overturned principle, known as Chevron deference in defense of various regulations. Although the Court's decision does not explicitly affect any prior agency decisions, regulations made final in the future, such as the DOL's 2023 Proposed Regulations, which have not yet been adopted, may be subject to more intense scrutiny by the courts if they are challenged by any affected party. 
 
 For example, on July 18, 2024, the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals directed the lower District Court to reconsider its dismissal of a lawsuit challenging a DOL rule that permits retirement plan fiduciaries to consider environmental, social and governance factors when selecting investments. In the case of State of Utah v. Su, et al., the Court of Appeals stated that in order to determine whether the DOL exceeded its statutory authority, given the upended legal landscape, the District Court needed to reassess the merits of the plaintiffs' challenge to the DOL rule. In view of this new upended legal landscape, it is uncertain whether the 2023 Proposed Regulations will be challenged after it is finalized and enacted and if so, the extent, if any, the Supreme Court's decision in Loper may impact such a challenge. 
 
 (d) Legal Proceedings 
 
 Certain of our subsidiaries are involved in litigation in which the plaintiffs assert violations of the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938, as amended, due to alleged failure to compensate for time required for donning and doffing equipment and claim consequent effects upon the calculation of overtime rates and pay. The plaintiffs seek collective action certification. We continue to evaluate the potential effects of this litigation upon the Company. Although we cannot reasonably estimate a range of potential exposure at this time, it is possible that the effects of this litigation upon our liquidity and results of operations could be materially adverse. 
 
 In addition, the Company is party to other legal proceedings from time to time. These proceedings, as well as governmental examinations, could involve various business units and a variety of claims including, but not limited to, contract disputes, personal injury claims, property damage claims (including those resulting from blasting, trucking and flooding), environmental and safety issues, securities-related matters and employment matters. While some legal matters may specify the damages claimed by the plaintiffs, many seek an unquantified amount of damages. Even when the amount of damages claimed against the Company or its subsidiaries is stated, (i) the claimed amount may be exaggerated or unsupported; (ii) the claim may be based on a novel legal theory or involve a large number of parties; (iii) there may be uncertainty as to the likelihood of a class being certified or the ultimate size of the class; (iv) there may be uncertainty as to the outcome of pending appeals or motions; and/or (v) there may be significant factual issues to be resolved. As a result, if such legal matters arise in the future, the Company may be unable to estimate a range of possible loss for matters that have not yet progressed sufficiently through discovery and the development of important factual information and legal issues. The Company records accruals based on an estimate of the ultimate outcome of these matters, but these estimates can be difficult to determine and involve significant judgment.

 Market Overview 
 
 Lower coal prices continued throughout the third quarter of 2024 as a result of sustained weakness in global steel demand. The World Steel Association s WSA most recent Short-Range Outlook, published in mid-October, included significant downward revisions for steel demand in 2024, especially in China and other developed economies facing manufacturing weakness, economic headwinds, and geopolitical uncertainties. As evidenced by the Manufacturing Purchasing Managers Index PMI data from the last year, India is a notable exception, with robust steel demand expected to continue throughout 2024 and 2025; the WSA noted India as the strongest driver of steel demand growth since 2021. For the rest of the world, the WSA projected a moderate rebound in steel demand in 2025 and the potential for broad-based moderate growth in 2025 and 2026. Important factors that could fuel such growth were identified as the stabilization of China s real estate sector, monetary policy such as interest rate adjustments to spur economic activity, and the trajectory of infrastructure spending in major global economies. 
 
 While overall manufacturing data in recent months reflect depressed business conditions and lackluster demand, longer-range business confidence ratings are more positive in anticipation of interest rate adjustments and the conclusion of political elections that have created geopolitical uncertainty across the globe. Unrest and political violence continue to pose geopolitical threats which may influence steel demand moving forward, as well as the health and resiliency of national and regional economies. 
 
 Metallurgical coal prices have continued to decline during the third quarter of 2024. All four indices that Alpha closely monitors fell 10 or more throughout the quarter, with the Australian Premium Low Volatile index representing the most significant drop of 16.5 . The Australian Premium Low Volatile index decreased from 245.20 per metric ton on July 1, 2024, to 204.75 per metric ton on September 30, 2024. The U.S. East Coast Low Volatile index fell from 218.00 per metric ton at the beginning of the quarter to 189.00 per metric ton at quarter close. The U.S. East Coast High Volatile A index decreased from 212.00 per metric ton in July to 184.00 per metric ton at the end of September, and the U.S. East Coast High Volatile B index moved from 190.00 per metric ton to 171.00 per metric ton at quarter end. Following the quarter close, all four indices have remained relatively stable, with modest upward movements. As of October 21, 2024, the U.S. East Coast Low Volatile, High Volatile A, and High Volatile B indices measured 190.00, 185.00, and 172.00 per ton, respectively. The Australian Premium Low Volatile decreased slightly from quarter-close levels to 202.00 per metric ton as of the same date. 
 
 PMI data for September 2024 showed deteriorating conditions across much of the world, including several regional economies where Alpha customer companies reside. The world manufacturing PMI declined for the third month in a row, with September s PMI of 48.8 marking a drop from August s level of 49.6. The United States September PMI also decreased further into contractionary territory to 47.3 from 47.9 in August. Europe s manufacturing sector continues to face weak conditions, with its overall September PMI of 45.0 marking a nine-month low, down from August s PMI of 45.8. China s PMI of 49.3 in September moved down into contraction from its August level of 50.4. Data for two of Alpha s key markets signal healthier manufacturing activity, with Brazil s manufacturing sector PMI of 53.2 in September marking a solid move upward from 50.4 in August and India s September PMI of 56.5 in September representing a drop from 57.5 in August but still firmly in expansionary territory. 
 
 The September 2024 global crude steel production of 143.6 million metric tons from 71 countries, as reported by the World Steel Association, represented a decrease of 4.7 compared to September 2023. China, the largest steel-producing country, produced 77.1 million metric tons in September, a 6.1 drop from its year-ago production level. India s September 2024 steel

production was 11.7 million metric tons, a decrease of 0.2 , or roughly flat year-over-year. Japan s 6.6 million metric tons of steel produced in September 2024 was down 5.8 compared to September 2023, and the United States produced 6.7 million metric tons of crude steel in September, up 1.2 from the year-ago period. Among the top ten steel-producing countries, Brazil recorded the largest year-over-year percentage increase in September production, with its 2.8 million metric tons being 9.9 higher than its September 2023 output levels, while Iran posted the most significant percentage drop of the group, as its 1.5 million metric tons of September production represented a 41.2 decrease from its year-ago figure. Regionally, the Asia and Oceania region, which contains both India and China, produced 105.3 million metric tons of crude steel in September 2024, a decrease of 5.0 compared to its September 2023 mark. The European Union s September 2024 crude steel production of 10.5 million metric tons represented a slight increase of 0.3 from its year-ago period. North America produced 8.6 million metric tons in September, 3.4 less than its September 2023 level. 
 
 The American Iron and Steel Institute s capacity utilization rate for U.S. steel mills was 73.4 for the week ending October 19, 2024. This is up from the year-ago period when the capacity utilization rate was 72.4 . 
 
 In the seaborne thermal market, the API2 index was 105.85 per metric ton on July 1, 2024, and increased to 119.40 per metric ton on September 30, 2024. 
 
 Business Overview 
 
 We are a Tennessee-based mining company with operations in Virginia and West Virginia. With customers across the globe, high-quality reserves and significant port capacity, we are a leading supplier of metallurgical coal products to the steel industry. We operate high-quality, cost-competitive coal mines across the CAPP coal basin. As of September 30, 2024, our operations consisted of twenty-one active mines and nine coal preparation and load-out facilities, with approximately 4,110 employees. We produce, process, and sell met coal and thermal coal as a byproduct. We also sell coal produced by others, some of which is processed and/or blended with coal produced from our mines prior to resale, with the remainder purchased for resale. As of December 31, 2023, we had 316.0 million tons of reserves, which included 303.0 million tons of proven and probable metallurgical reserves and 12.9 million tons of proven and probable thermal reserves. 
 
 For the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, sales of met coal were 3.9 million tons and 3.8 million tons, respectively, and accounted for approximately 94 and 89 , respectively, of our coal sales volume in each period. Sales of thermal coal were 0.2 million tons and 0.4 million tons, respectively, and accounted for approximately 6 and 11 , respectively, of our coal sales volume. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, sales of met coal were 12.1 million tons and 11.2 million tons, respectively, and accounted for approximately 93 and 90 , respectively, of our coal sales volume. Sales of thermal coal were 0.9 million tons and 1.2 million tons, respectively, and accounted for approximately 7 and 10 , respectively, of our coal sales volume. 
 
 Our sales of met coal were made primarily in several countries in Asia, Europe, and the Americas and to steel companies in the northeastern and midwestern regions of the United States. Our sales of thermal coal were made primarily to large utilities and industrial customers both in the United States and across the world. For the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 approximately 77 and 70 , respectively, of our coal revenues were derived from coal sales made to customers outside the United States. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 approximately 80 and 72 , respectively, of our coal revenues were derived from coal sales made to customers outside the United States. 
 
 In addition, we generate other revenues from equipment sales, rentals, terminal and processing fees, coal and environmental analysis fees, royalties and the sale of natural gas. We also record freight and handling fulfillment revenue within coal revenues for freight and handling services provided in delivering coal to certain customers, which are a component of the contractual selling price. 
 
 As of September 30, 2024, we have one reportable segment: Met. Our Met segment operations consist of high-quality met coal mines, including Deep Mine 41, Road Fork 52, Black Eagle, and Lynn Branch. The coal produced by our Met segment operations is predominantly met coal with small amounts of thermal coal being produced as a byproduct of mining. The All Other category included our former CAPP Thermal operating segment which was comprised of our mining complexes which produced, as a primary product, thermal quality coal. Refer to Note 15 to our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for additional disclosures on reportable segments, geographic areas, and export coal revenue information. 
 
 As discussed in the Market Overview presented above, metallurgical coal prices remain at lower levels than in recent years due to weak global steel demand which has been influenced by a slowdown in manufacturing activity, economic pressures, and geopolitical uncertainty. Our results of operations for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 were impacted by these factors. On October 7, 2024, our subsidiary Elk Run Coal Company, LLC issued a 60-day notice to 
 28 

Table of Contents 

employees, under the Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification WARN Act, of plans to idle the Checkmate Powellton mine as of December 6, 2024, or within the 14-day period starting on that date. This decision was driven by the recent decreases in coal prices, discussed above, and the current economic characteristics of the mine. From its idled state the mine could promptly be returned to production if circumstances warrant. We will continue to evaluate market conditions and expect to adjust our operations accordingly. 
 
 Factors Affecting Our Results of Operations 
 
 Sales Agreements. We manage our commodity price risk for coal sales through the use of coal supply agreements. As of October 23, 2024, we had sales commitments for 2024 as follows: 
 Tons Priced Average Realized Price per Ton Met - Domestic 160.73 Met - Export 149.28 Met Total 16.0 million 86 152.42 Thermal 1.1 million 100 75.97 Met Segment 17.1 million 88 145.90 
 
 Realized Pricing. Our realized price per ton of coal is influenced by many factors that vary by region, including (i) coal quality, which includes energy (heat content), sulfur, ash, volatile matter and moisture content; (ii) differences in market conventions concerning transportation costs and volume measurement; and (iii) regional supply and demand. 
 Costs. Our results of operations are dependent upon our ability to maximize productivity and control costs. Our primary expenses are for operating supply costs, repair and maintenance expenditures, costs of purchased coal, royalties, wages and benefits, freight and handling costs and taxes incurred in selling our coal. The principal goods and services we use in our operations include maintenance and repair parts and services, electricity, fuel, roof control and support items, explosives, tires, conveyance structures, ventilation supplies and lubricants. Our management strives to aggressively control costs and improve operating performance to mitigate external cost pressures. We experience volatility in operating costs related to fuel, explosives, steel, tires, contract services and healthcare, among others, and take measures to mitigate the increases in these costs at all operations. We have a centralized sourcing group for major supplier contract negotiation and administration, for the negotiation and purchase of major capital goods, and to support the business units. We promote competition between suppliers and seek to develop relationships with suppliers that focus on lowering our costs. We seek suppliers who identify and concentrate on implementing continuous improvement opportunities within their area of expertise. To the extent upward pressure on costs exceeds our ability to realize sales increases, or if we experience unanticipated operating or transportation difficulties, our operating margins would be negatively impacted. We may also experience difficult geologic conditions, delays in obtaining permits, labor shortages, unforeseen equipment problems, and unexpected shortages of critical materials such as tires, fuel and explosives that may result in adverse cost increases and limit our ability to produce at forecasted levels. 

Results of Operations 
 
 Our results of operations for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 are discussed below. For comparability purposes, certain immaterial segment information for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 has been recast to conform to the current year presentation.

Three Months Ended September 30, Increase (Decrease) (In thousands, except for per ton data) 2024 2023 or Tons Coal revenues 669,783 738,998 (69,215) (9.4) Other revenues 2,114 2,822 (708) (25.1) Total revenues 671,897 741,820 (69,923) (9.4) Tons sold 4,148 4,225 (77) (1.8) 
 
 Coal revenues. Coal revenues decreased 69.2 million, or 9.4 , for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the prior year period. The decrease was due to a 61.7 million, or 8.4 , reduction in coal revenues within our Met segment coupled with a 7.5 million reduction in All Other coal revenues due to the cessation of mining at our last thermal coal mine in August of 2023. The reduction in Met segment coal revenues was primarily attributable to a 9.2 decrease in coal sales realization per ton as pricing decreased from the prior year period. Refer to the Non-GAAP Coal revenues section below for further detail on coal revenues for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the prior year period. 
 
 Cost and Expenses 
 
 The following table summarizes information about our costs and expenses during the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023:

 Cost of coal sales. Cost of coal sales increased 34.1 million, or 6.0 , for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the prior year period, primarily related to an increase in the average cost of coal sales per ton of 8.0 , partially offset by a 1.8 reduction in coal sales volumes. The increase in average cost of coal sales per ton was primarily related to an increase in freight and handling costs due to a relatively higher percentage of export sales resulting in higher rail, transloading, and ocean vessel freight, coupled with inflationary pressure and start-up related costs associated with our new Checkmate Powellton mine, partially offset by reductions in royalties and taxes as a result of a lower coal pricing environment. 
 Depreciation, depletion and amortization. Depreciation, depletion and amortization increased 9.8 million, or 30.2 , for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the prior year period. The increase was primarily due to an increase in assets placed in service during 2023 and 2024. 
 
 Selling, general and administrative . Selling, general and administrative expenses decreased 2.1 million, or 11.4 , for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the prior year period. This decrease was primarily related to a 1.7 million decrease in incentive pay.

 Income tax benefit of 4.1 million was recorded for the three months ended September 30, 2024 on a loss before income taxes of 0.3 million. The effective tax rate of 1,444.2 differs from the federal statutory rate of 21 primarily due to the permanent impact of percentage depletion deductions, partially offset by a decrease in foreign-derived intangible income deductions. The current quarter s effective tax rate is also explained by a decrease in projected full year pre-tax book income resulting in a lower estimated annual effective tax rate than estimated in the prior quarter. 
 
 Income tax expense of 19.0 million was recorded for the three months ended September 30, 2023 on income before income taxes of 112.8 million. The effective tax rate of 16.8 differs from the federal statutory rate of 21 primarily due to the permanent impact of percentage depletion and foreign-derived intangible income deductions, partially offset by the impact of state income taxes, net of federal impact. Refer to Note 11 for additional information. 
 
 Non-GAAP Financial Measures 
 
 The discussion below contains non-GAAP financial measures. These are financial measures that either exclude or include amounts that are not excluded or included in the most directly comparable measures calculated and presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States U.S. GAAP or GAAP ). Specifically, we make use of the non-GAAP financial measures Adjusted EBITDA, non-GAAP coal revenues, non-GAAP cost of coal sales, and non-GAAP coal margin. We use Adjusted EBITDA to measure the operating performance of our segments and allocate resources to the segments. Adjusted EBITDA does not purport to be an alternative to net income as a measure of operating performance or any other measure of operating results, financial performance, or liquidity presented in accordance with GAAP. Moreover, this measure is not calculated identically by all companies and therefore may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies. Adjusted EBITDA is presented because management believes it is a useful indicator of the financial performance of our coal operations. We use non-GAAP coal revenues to present coal revenues generated, excluding freight and handling fulfillment revenues. Non-GAAP coal sales realization per ton for our operations is calculated as non-GAAP coal revenues divided by tons sold. We use non-GAAP cost of coal sales to adjust cost of coal sales to remove freight and handling costs, depreciation, depletion and amortization - production (excluding the depreciation, depletion and amortization related to selling, general and administrative functions), accretion on asset retirement obligations, amortization of acquired intangibles, net, and idled and closed mine costs. Non-GAAP cost of coal sales per ton for our operations is calculated as non-GAAP cost of coal sales divided by tons sold. Non-GAAP coal margin per ton for our coal operations is calculated as non-GAAP coal sales realization per ton for our coal operations less non-GAAP cost of coal sales per ton for our coal operations. The presentation of these measures should not be considered in isolation, or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under GAAP. 
 
 Management uses non-GAAP financial measures to supplement GAAP results to provide a more complete understanding of the factors and trends affecting the business than GAAP results alone. The definition of these non-GAAP measures may be changed periodically by management to adjust for significant items important to an understanding of operating trends and to adjust for items that may not reflect the trend of future results by excluding transactions that are not indicative of our core operating performance. Furthermore, analogous measures are used by industry analysts to evaluate the Company s operating performance. Because not all companies use identical calculations, the presentations of these measures may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies and can differ significantly from company to company depending on long-term strategic decisions regarding capital structure, the tax jurisdictions in which companies operate, capital investments and other factors. 
 
 Included below are reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures to GAAP financial measures. 
 
 The following tables summarizes certain financial information relating to our coal operations for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023:

 Non-GAAP Coal revenues. Non-GAAP coal revenues decreased 86.0 million, or 13.5 , for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the prior year period. The decrease was primarily due to a 21.97 per ton, or 14.2 , reduction in non-GAAP coal sales realization per ton as pricing decreased from the prior year period. 
 
 Non-GAAP Cost of coal sales. Non-GAAP cost of coal sales increased 21.5 million, or 4.8 , for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the prior year period, primarily related to a 3.9 increase in average cost of coal sales per ton. The increase in average cost of coal sales per ton was primarily related to inflationary pressure, including increased labor costs as a result of a competitive labor market, coupled with start-up related costs associated with our new Checkmate Powellton mine, partially offset by reductions in royalties and taxes as a result of a lower coal pricing environment.

 Revenues 
 
 The following table summarizes information about our revenues during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023: 
 Nine Months Ended September 30, Increase (Decrease) (In thousands, except for per ton data) 2024 2023 or Tons Coal revenues 2,331,196 2,499,503 (168,307) (6.7) Other revenues 8,742 11,923 (3,181) (26.7) Total revenues 2,339,938 2,511,426 (171,488) (6.8) Tons sold 13,065 12,488 577 4.6 
 
 Coal revenues. Coal revenues decreased 168.3 million, or 6.7 , for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the prior year period. The decrease was due to a 121.3 million, or 4.9 , reduction in coal revenues within our Met segment coupled with a 47.0 million reduction in All Other coal revenues due to the cessation of mining at our last thermal coal mine in August of 2023. The reduction in Met segment coal revenues was attributable to a 12.7 decrease in coal sales realization per ton as pricing decreased from the prior year period, partially offset by an 8.9 increase in coal sales volumes. Refer to the Non-GAAP Coal revenues section below for further detail on coal revenues for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the prior year period. 
 
 Cost and Expenses

 Cost of coal sales. Cost of coal sales increased 223.6 million, or 13.3 , for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the prior year period due to a 4.6 increase in coal sales volumes and an increase in the average cost of coal sales per ton of 8.2 . The increase in average cost of coal sales per ton was primarily related to an increase in freight and handling costs due to a relatively higher percentage of export sales resulting in higher rail, transloading, and ocean vessel freight costs, coupled with inflationary pressure, start-up related costs associated with our new Checkmate Powellton mine, and an increased level of coal purchases, partially offset by reductions in royalties and taxes as a result of a lower coal pricing environment. 
 Depreciation, depletion and amortization. Depreciation, depletion and amortization increased 32.3 million, or 34.2 , for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the prior year period. The increase was primarily due to an increase in assets placed in service during 2023 and 2024. 
 
 Other operating loss (income). Other operating loss increased 5.5 million, or 329.0 , for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the prior year period, primarily due to a decrease in income on sale of assets in the current period. 
 
 Total Other Expense, Net

 Adjusted EBITDA decreased 412.2 million, or 53.8 , for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the prior year period, primarily driven by decreased coal margin and lower non-GAAP coal sales realization per ton in the current period. 

Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 Overview 
 Our primary sources of liquidity are derived from existing unrestricted cash balances, proceeds from future coal sales, and amounts available under our revolving credit agreement. Our primary capital resource requirements stem from the cost of our coal production and purchases, selling and administrative expenses, taxes, capital expenditures, debt service obligations, reclamation obligations, and collateral requirements. As of September 30, 2024, we had 3.6 million of long-term indebtedness outstanding, net of current portion, and no indebtedness and 57.5 million letters of credit LCs outstanding under our ABL Facility (as defined below). 
 We believe that cash on hand and cash generated from our operations will be sufficient to meet our working capital, anticipated capital expenditure, income tax, debt service, collateral and reclamation obligations requirements for the next 12 months and the reasonably foreseeable future. We may also use cash in accordance with our share repurchase program. We rely on a number of assumptions in budgeting for our future activities. These include the costs for mine development to sustain capacity of our operating mines, our cash flows from operations, effects of regulation and taxes by governmental agencies, mining technology improvements and reclamation costs. These assumptions are inherently subject to significant business, political, economic, regulatory, environmental and competitive uncertainties, pending and existing climate-related initiatives, contingencies and risks, all of which are difficult to predict and many of which are beyond our control. For example, if the new authorization process for all self-insured coal mine operators is adopted, it would substantially increase the collateral required to

secure our self-insured federal black lung obligations. Refer to the DCMWC Reauthorization Process section below for more information. Increased scrutiny of ESG matters specific to the coal sector could negatively influence our ability to raise capital in the future and result in a reduced number of surety and insurance providers. We may need to raise additional funds if market conditions deteriorate, if one or more of our assumptions prove to be incorrect or if we choose to expand our acquisition or development efforts or any other activity more rapidly than we presently anticipate and we may not be able to do so in a timely fashion, on terms acceptable to us, or at all. Additionally, we may elect to raise additional funds before we need them if the conditions for raising capital are favorable. We may seek to sell equity or debt securities or obtain additional bank credit facilities. The sale of equity securities could result in dilution to our stockholders. The incurrence of additional indebtedness could result in increased fixed obligations and additional covenants that could restrict our operations. 
 
 Liquidity 
 
 The following table summarizes our total liquidity as of September 30, 2024: 
 
 (in thousands) September 30, 2024 Cash and cash equivalents 484,560 Credit facility availability (1)

 Cash Collateral 
 
 We are required to provide cash collateral to secure our obligations under certain workers compensation, black lung, reclamation-related obligations, financial payments and other performance obligations, and other operating agreements. Future regulatory changes relating to these obligations could result in increased obligations, additional costs, or additional collateral requirements which could require greater use of alternative sources of funding for this purpose, which would reduce our liquidity. Refer to the DCMWC Reauthorization Process section below for information related to the new authorization process for self-insured coal mine operators being implemented by the U.S. Department of Labor (Division of Coal Mine Workers Compensation). As of September 30, 2024, we had the following cash collateral on our Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets: 
 
 (in thousands) September 30, 2024 Long-term restricted cash 121,077 Long-term restricted investments 42,512 Long-term deposits 4,955 Total cash collateral 168,544 
 
 Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 
 
 We are required to provide financial assurance in order to perform the post-mining reclamation required by our mining permits, pay workers compensation claims under workers compensation laws in various states, pay federal black lung benefits, and perform certain other obligations. In order to provide the required financial assurance, we generally use surety bonds for post-mining reclamation and workers compensation obligations. We also use bank LCs to collateralize certain obligations. As of September 30, 2024, we had the following outstanding surety bonds and LCs: 
 
 (in thousands) September 30, 2024 Surety bonds 180,944 Letters of credit (1)

Debt Financing 
 
 The ABL Agreement includes an asset-based revolving credit facility (the ABL Facility ). Under the ABL Facility, we may borrow cash or obtain LCs, on a revolving basis, in an aggregate amount of up to 155.0 million. We may request an increase to the capacity of the facility of up to 75.0 million provided that 25.0 million may be solely for the purpose of providing additional availability to obtain cash collateralized LCs. Availability under the ABL Facility is calculated monthly and fluctuates based on qualifying amounts of coal inventory and trade accounts receivable (the Borrowing Base ). Generally, under the terms of the ABL Facility, to the extent outstanding borrowings and LC s exceed the Borrowing Base, the specified amount of cash would be restricted and used to collateralize any excess outstanding amounts. The ABL Facility matures on October 27, 2027. 
 
 Refer to Note 8 for additional disclosures on long-term debt. 
 
 Capital Requirements 
 
 Our capital expenditures for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 were 156.2 million. We expect to spend between 210.0 million and 240.0 million on capital expenditures during 2024. At the midpoint of guidance, this total includes approximately 171.0 million in sustaining maintenance capital, approximately 33.0 million in planned projects to invest in mine development, and approximately 21.0 million in carryover from 2023 due to timing and availability of supplies and contract labor. 
 
 Contractual Obligations 
 
 Our contractual obligations are discussed in the Liquidity and Capital Resources Contractual Obligations section contained in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. There have been no material changes to our contractual obligations during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 
 
 Refer to Note 8 and Note 14 for additional disclosures on long-term debt and other commitments, respectively. 
 
 Business Updates 
 
 We own a 65.0 interest in DTA, a coal export terminal in Newport News, Virginia. DTA provides us with the ability to fulfill a broad range of customer coal quality requirements through coal blending, while also providing storage capacity and transportation flexibility. DTA needs capital investment to maximize functionality and minimize downtime due to mechanical issues. Under the terms of our partnership related agreements with respect to our investment in DTA, we are required to fund our proportionate share of DTA s ongoing operating and capital costs. Beyond our share of routine operating costs, we expect we will invest an average of approximately 28.0 million per year for infrastructure and equipment upgrades at DTA over the next 5 years. In addition, to mitigate the risk of shipment delays during the upgrade period, in April 2024, we entered into a 3-year agreement which would allow for the loading of 1.2 to 2.0 million tons of coal annually at a third party terminal in Newport News, VA. 
 
 We continually strive to enhance our capital structure and financial flexibility. We may refinance or repay outstanding debt, seek to amend our credit facility, undertake additional borrowings, sell assets or businesses or take other measures as we believe circumstances warrant. We may decide to pursue or not pursue these opportunities at any time. Access to additional funds from liquidity-generating transactions or other sources of external financing is subject to market conditions and certain limitations, including our credit rating and covenant restrictions in our credit facilities. 
 
 As a regular part of our business, we review opportunities for, and engage in discussions and negotiations concerning, the acquisition or disposition of coal mining and related infrastructure assets and interests in coal mining companies, and acquisitions or dispositions of, or combinations or other strategic transactions involving companies with coal mining or other energy assets. When we believe that these opportunities are consistent with our strategic plans and our acquisition or disposition criteria, we may make bids or proposals and/or enter into letters of intent and other similar agreements. These bids or proposals, which may be binding or non-binding, are customarily subject to a variety of conditions and usually permit us to terminate the discussions and any related agreement if, among other things, we are not satisfied with the results of due diligence. Any acquisition opportunities we pursue could materially affect our liquidity and capital resources and may require us to incur indebtedness, seek equity capital or both. There can be no assurance that additional financing will be available on terms acceptable to us, or at all.

 As of September 30, 2024, the Company has recorded federal income taxes receivable of 6.5 million. Refer to Note 11 for further disclosures related to income taxes. 
 
 Pension Plan 
 
 We paid 12.3 million in minimum required contributions to the pension plan in 2024. Refer to Note 12 for further disclosures related to this obligation. 
 
 DCMWC Reauthorization Process 
 
 In July 2019, the U.S. Department of Labor (Division of Coal Mine Workers Compensation or DCMWC began implementing a new authorization process for all self-insured coal mine operators. As requested by DCMWC, we filed an application and supporting documentation for reauthorization to self-insure certain of our black lung obligations in October 2019. As a result of this application, the DCMWC notified us in a letter dated February 21, 2020 that we were reauthorized to self-insure certain of our black lung obligations for a period of one-year from February 21, 2020. The DCMWC reauthorization was contingent, however, upon us providing collateral of 65.7 million to secure certain of our black lung obligations. This collateral requirement, which the DCMWC advises represents 70 of our estimated future liability according to the DCMWC s estimation methodology, would have been an increase of approximately 2,400 from the approximately 2.6 million in collateral which we (previously by Alpha Natural Resources Inc. prior to the Merger) have provided since 2016 to secure these self-insured black lung obligations. Future liability has not previously been estimated by the DCMWC in connection with the reauthorization process but is now being considered as part of its new collateral-setting methodology. 
 
 The reauthorization process provided us with the right to appeal the security determination in writing within 30 days of the date of the notification, which appeal period the DCMWC agreed to extend to May 22, 2020, and we exercised this right of appeal. We strongly disagree with the DCMWC s substantially higher collateral determination and the methodology through which the calculation was derived. In February 2021, the U.S. Department of Labor DOL withdrew its Federal Register notice seeking comments on its bulletin describing its new method of calculating collateral requirements. The DOL removed the bulletin from its website in May 2021. On February 10, 2022, a telephone conference was held with DCMWC and DOL decision makers wherein we presented facts and arguments in support of our appeal. No ruling has been made on the appeal, but during the call we indicated that we would be willing to allocate an additional 10.0 million in collateral. If our appeal is unsuccessful, we may be required to provide additional LCs in order to receive self-insurance reauthorization from the DCMWC or insure these black lung obligations through a third-party provider, which would likely also require us to provide additional collateral. In January 2023, the DOL proposed for public comment new regulations which, if adopted, would substantially increase the collateral required to secure self-insured federal black lung obligations (the 2023 Proposed Regulations ). Under the proposed 120 minimum collateral requirement, we estimate we could be required to provide approximately 80.0 million to 100.0 million of collateral to secure certain of our black lung obligations. In May 2024, the DOL submitted its final draft of the 2023 Proposed Regulations to the Office of Management and Budget for review. It is unclear when this regulation will become effective; however, we will continue to monitor developments. A significant increase in these collateral obligations could have a materially adverse effect on our liquidity. 
 
 Supreme Court's Decision on the Chevron Deference Standard 
 
 The United States Supreme Court's decision in Loper Bright Enterprises v. Raimondo, issued on June 28, 2024, eliminated a 40-year old precedent of judicial deference to regulatory agencies' interpretation of federal laws. Federal agencies such as the DOL and EPA have relied on this now-overturned principle, known as Chevron deference in defense of various regulations. Although the Court's decision does not explicitly affect any prior agency decisions, regulations made final in the future, such as the DOL's 2023 Proposed Regulations, which have not yet been adopted, may be subject to more intense scrutiny by the courts if they are challenged by any affected party. 
 
 For example, on July 18, 2024, the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals directed the lower District Court to reconsider its dismissal of a lawsuit challenging a DOL rule that permits retirement plan fiduciaries to consider environmental, social and governance factors when selecting investments. In the case of State of Utah v. Su, et al., the Court of Appeals stated that in order to determine whether the DOL exceeded its statutory authority, given the upended legal landscape, the District Court needed to reassess the merits of the plaintiffs' challenge to the DOL rule. In view of this new upended legal landscape, it is uncertain whether the 2023 Proposed Regulations will be challenged after it is finalized and enacted and if so, the extent, if any, the Supreme Court's decision in Loper may impact such a challenge.

Respirable Crystalline Silica Final Rule 
 
 In April 2024, MSHA issued its final rule, Lowering Miners Exposure to Respirable Crystalline Silica and Improving Respiratory Protection, to reduce miner exposures to respirable crystalline silica and improve respiratory protection for all airborne hazards. The final rule lowers the permissible exposure limit of respirable crystalline silica at 50 micrograms per cubic meter of air g/m3) for a full shift exposure, calculated as an 8-hour time weighted average, for all miners. The final rule also includes other requirements to protect miner health and update existing respiratory protection requirements. For coal mine operators, the deadline for compliance with the new rule is April 14, 2025. Our compliance with these or any other new health and safety regulations could increase our mining costs substantially. Further, if we were ever found to be in violation of these regulations, we could face penalties or restrictions that may materially and adversely affect our operations, financial results and liquidity. 
 
 Climate Effect Disclosures 
 
 In March 2024, the Securities and Exchange Commission SEC adopted new rules requiring issuers to disclose certain climate-related information beginning in 2025. Shortly following their release, the rules were stayed by a federal court. The SEC subsequently stayed the rules pending resolution of ongoing litigation. We cannot be certain whether or when these rules will take effect or what form they may ultimately take. It is therefore not presently possible to estimate the cost to the company of complying with the rules. 
 
 Share Repurchase Program 
 
 Refer to Note 6 and Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds for information on the share repurchase program and the shares repurchased during the current period. 
 
 Cash Flows 
 
 Cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash increased by 221.5 million and 23.7 million over the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The net change in cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash was attributable to the following: 
 Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 Cash flows (in thousands): Net cash provided by operating activities 523,661 651,806 Net cash used in investing activities (178,731) (126,637) Net cash used in financing activities (123,418) (501,500) Net increase in cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash 221,512 23,669 
 
 Operating Activities. Net cash provided by operating activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 decreased compared to the prior year due to a reduction in Met segment non-GAAP coal margin as discussed above in Results of Operations, partially offset by changes in operating assets and liabilities as the prior year period was negatively impacted by significant increases in accounts receivable and inventory and the final payment of our contingent revenue obligation, partially offset by a reduction in amounts held on deposit for the payment of dividends. 
 
 Investing Activities. Net cash used in investing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 increased compared to the prior year period despite a decrease in capital expenditures as the prior year period benefited from a higher level of net proceeds from investment security activity. The increased level of net proceeds from investment security activity in the prior period was primarily due to the liquidation of certain marketable securities to facilitate the transfer of funds to another financial institution. 
 
 Financing Activities. The decrease in net cash used in financing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the prior year period was driven by decreases in common stock repurchases and dividends paid due to the payment of a one-time special dividend in the prior year period as well as the cessation of our fixed dividend program in the fourth quarter of 2023.

Analysis of Material Debt Covenants 
 
 We were in compliance with all covenants under the ABL Agreement as of September 30, 2024, including the requirement that we maintain minimum liquidity, as defined in the ABL Agreement, of 75.0 million. A breach of the covenants in the ABL Agreement could result in a default under the terms of the agreement, and the respective lenders could then elect to declare any amounts borrowed due and payable and require outstanding LCs to be cash collateralized. In addition, a default under the terms of the agreement would inhibit our ability to make certain restricted payments, as defined in the ABL Agreement, including the Company s ability to repurchase shares of the Company s common stock. 

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 
 The preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other factors and assumptions, including the current economic environment, that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. We evaluate our estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis and adjust such estimates and assumptions as facts and circumstances require. Foreign currency and energy markets, and fluctuations in demand for steel products, have combined to increase the uncertainty inherent in such estimates and assumptions. As future events and their effects cannot be determined with precision, actual results may differ significantly from these estimates. Changes in these estimates resulting from continuing changes in the economic environment will be reflected in the financial statements in future periods. 
 Our critical accounting policies are discussed in the Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates section contained in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. Our critical accounting policies remain unchanged at September 30, 2024. Refer to the Recent Accounting Guidance section in Note 1 for further information. 

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk 
 
 Commodity Price Risk 
 
 We manage our commodity price risk for coal sales through the use of coal supply agreements. Refer to Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Factors Affecting Our Results of Operations for information on our sales commitments for 2024. 
 
 We have exposure to commodity price risk for supplies that are used directly or indirectly in the normal course of production such as diesel fuel, steel and other items such as explosives. We manage our risk for these items through strategic sourcing contracts in normal quantities with our suppliers. 
 
 The market price of diesel fuel fluctuates due to changes in production, seasonality, and other market factors generally outside of our control. Increased fuel costs may have a negative impact on our results of operations and financial condition. As of September 30, 2024, our forecasted diesel fuel usage and fixed price diesel fuel purchase commitments for 2024 are as follows: 
 
 Budgeted Usage in Gallons Priced Average Realized Price per Gallon Diesel fuel 23.2 million 94.9 3.23 
 
 Interest Rate Risk 
 
 As of September 30, 2024, we maintain a senior secured asset-based revolving credit facility, under which we may borrow up to 155.0 million (less amounts outstanding for LCs). Any cash borrowings under the facility would bear a floating rate of interest. No cash borrowings were outstanding under the facility as of September 30, 2024 or December 31, 2023. Refer to Note 8 for additional information. Also refer to the Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Note 13 section contained in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 for discussion on the terms of our long-term debt. 
 
 As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we had investments in trading securities of 42.5 million and 40.6 million, respectively, primarily consisting of U.S. government securities. While the fair value of these investments is exposed to risk with respect to changes in market rates of interest, we do not believe exposure to changes in interest rates is material to our 
 41 

Table of Contents 

Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. We manage risk by investing in shorter term highly rated debt obligations (primarily U.S. government securities). As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the remaining maturities of our acquired debt securities was less than 12 months. 
 
 Foreign Currency Risk 
 
 Our transactions are denominated in U.S. dollars, and, as a result, we do not have material exposure to currency exchange-rate risks. However, our coal is sold internationally in U.S. dollars and, as a result, general economic conditions in foreign markets and changes in foreign currency exchange rates may provide our foreign competitors with a competitive advantage. If our competitors currencies decline against the U.S. dollar or against our foreign customers local currencies, those competitors may be able to offer lower prices for coal to customers. Furthermore, if the currencies of our overseas customers were to significantly decline in value in comparison to the U.S. dollar, those customers may seek decreased prices for the coal we sell to them. Consequently, currency fluctuations could adversely affect the competitiveness of our coal in international markets, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows. 

Item 4. Controls and Procedures 
 
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 
 We maintain disclosure controls and procedures as that term is defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act ), that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the Company in reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act, is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer CEO and our Chief Financial Officer CFO ), as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures. Any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives. In accordance with Rule 13a-15(b) of the Exchange Act, we have evaluated, under the supervision of our CEO and our CFO, the effectiveness of disclosure controls and procedures as of September 30, 2024. Based on this evaluation, our CEO and our CFO concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of September 30, 2024. 
 
 Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
 
 There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act) that occurred during the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 
 
 Inherent Limitations on Effectiveness of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 
 Our CEO, our CFO and other members of management do not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures or our internal control over financial reporting will prevent all errors and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

 MINE SAFETY DISCLOSURE

Document 

Mine Safety and Health Administration Data 
 
 Our subsidiaries mining operations have consistently been recognized with numerous local, state and national awards over the years for outstanding safety performance. 
 
 Our behavior-based safety process involves all employees in accident prevention and continuous improvement. Safety leadership and training programs are based upon the concepts of situational awareness and observation, changing behaviors and, most importantly, employee involvement. The core elements of our safety training include identification of critical behaviors, frequency of those behaviors, employee feedback and removal of barriers for continuous improvement. 
 
 All employees are empowered to champion the safety process. Every person is challenged to identify hazards and initiate corrective actions, ensuring that hazards are addressed in a timely manner. 
 
 All levels of the organization are expected to be proactive and commit to perpetual improvement, implementing new safety processes that promote a safe and healthy work environment. 
 
 Our subsidiaries operate multiple mining complexes in two states and are regulated by both the U.S. Mine Safety and Health Administration MSHA and state regulatory agencies. As described in more detail in the Environmental and Other Regulatory Matters section of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, the Federal Mine Safety and Health Act of 1977, as amended (the Mine Act ), among other federal and state laws and regulations, imposes stringent safety and health standards on all aspects of mining operations. Regulatory inspections are mandated by these agencies with thousands of inspection shifts at our properties each year. Citations and compliance metrics at each of our mines and coal preparation facilities vary due to the size and type of the operation. We endeavor to conduct our mining and other operations in compliance with all applicable federal, state and local laws and regulations. However, violations occur from time to time. None of the violations identified or the monetary penalties assessed upon us set forth in the tables below have been material. 

For purposes of reporting regulatory matters under Section 1503(a) of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the Dodd-Frank Act ), we include the following table that sets forth the total number of specific citations and orders and the total dollar value of the proposed civil penalty assessments that were issued by MSHA during the current reporting period for each of our subsidiaries that is a coal mine operator, by individual mine. During the current reporting period, none of the mines operated by our subsidiaries received written notice from MSHA of a pattern of violations under Section 104(e) of the Mine Act.
