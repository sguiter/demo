The Company is also required to repay the term loans and reduce revolving commitments with (i) of proceeds of any incurrence of additional debt not permitted by the Senior Secured Credit Facility, (ii) of proceeds of asset sales and of amounts recovered under insurance policies, subject to certain exceptions and a reinvestment right and (iii) of Excess Cash Flow (or ECF as defined in the Senior Secured Credit Facility, at the end of the applicable fiscal year if RE/MAX, LLC s Total Leverage Ratio (or TLR as defined in the Senior Secured Credit Facility, is in excess of :1. If the Company s TLR as of the last day of such fiscal year is equal to or less than :1 but above :1, the repayment percentage is of ECF and if the Company s TLR as of the last day of such fiscal year is less than :1, repayment from ECF is required. The Company evaluated if an ECF payment was required as of December 31, 2023, pursuant to the terms of the Senior Secured Credit Facility and determined ECF payment was required. In addition, if any amounts are drawn under the revolving line of credit under the Senior Secured Credit Facility, the terms of the Company s Senior Secured Credit Facility require the Company s TLR to not exceed :1 at the last day of any period of four consecutive fiscal quarters. If the Company s TLR exceeds :1, access to borrowings under the revolving line of credit will be restricted. A commitment fee of per annum (subject to reductions) accrues on the amount of unutilized revolving line of credit regardless of the Company s TLR. As of the date of this report, amounts were drawn on the revolving line of credit. The Company is also limited in the amount of restricted payments it can make, as defined in the Senior Secured Credit Facility, as it provides for customary restrictions on, among other things, additional indebtedness, restricted payments, liens, dispositions of property, dividends, transactions with affiliates and fundamental changes such as mergers, consolidations, and liquidations. The restricted payments include declaration or payment of dividends, repurchase of shares, or other distributions. In general, the Company can make unlimited restricted payments, if the Company s TLR is below :1 (both before and after giving effect to such payments). So long as the Company s TLR exceeds :1, the Company will be limited in the amount of restricted payments primarily dividends and share repurchases it can make up to the greater of million or of consolidated EBITDA on a trailing twelve-month basis (unless the Company can rely on other restricted payment baskets available under the Senior Secured Credit Facility). The Company s TLR is calculated based on RE/MAX, LLC s consolidated indebtedness and consolidated EBITDA, both defined in the Senior Secured Credit Facility. As of September 30, 2024, RE/MAX, LLC s consolidated EBITDA, as defined in the Senior Secured Credit Facility, was million on a trailing twelve-month basis and the Company s TLR was :1. As long as the Company s TLR remains above :1, the Company will be limited in the amount of restricted payments it can make. In addition, access to borrowings under the revolving line of credit will not be restricted based on TLR so long as the Company s TLR remains below 4:50:1. With certain exceptions, any default under any of the Company s other agreements evidencing indebtedness in the amount of million or more would constitute an event of default under the Senior Secured Credit Facility.

 The Company is required to pay additional purchase consideration totaling of gross receipts collected by Motto each year (the Revenue Share Year through September 30, 2026, with no limitation as to the maximum payout. The annual payment is required to be made within of the end of each Revenue Share Year. The fair value of the contingent purchase consideration represents the forecasted discounted cash payments that the Company expects to pay. Increases or decreases in the fair value of the contingent purchase consideration can result from changes in discount rates as well as the timing and amount of forecasted revenues. The forecasted revenue growth assumption that is most sensitive is the assumed franchise sales count for which the forecast assumes between - franchises sold annually. This assumption is based on historical sales and an assumption of growth over time. A reduction in the number of franchise sales and a change to the discount rate applied to the forecast would not change the liability materially. As of September 30, 2024, the Company does not anticipate making any further cash payments for contingent consideration associated with the acquisition of Gadberry Group.

On March 15, 2024, NAR and plaintiffs reached a settlement agreement. As part of that settlement, NAR agreed to pay million and make certain changes to its business practices, including prohibiting offers of compensation to buyer brokers on the MLS and requiring buyer agreements for MLS participants working with a buyer. The court granted preliminary approval of the NAR settlement on April 23, 2024. On April 25, 2024, HSA entered into a settlement agreement with the plaintiffs in which they agreed to certain changes to its business practices and to pay million. In one of the other Moehrl-related antitrust litigations, filed by Jennifer Nosalek and others in the District of Massachusetts (the Nosalek Action ), on June 30, 2023, plaintiffs filed a motion requesting preliminary approval of a settlement with MLS Property Information Network, Inc. MLS PIN ). The parties subsequently amended the settlement agreement on September 5, 2023, and January 5, 2024. If approved by the court, the settlement agreement requires MLS PIN to pay million, to eliminate the requirement that a seller must offer compensation to a buyer-broker and to amend various rules pertaining to seller notices and negotiation of buyer-broker compensation. On February 15, 2024, the U.S. Department of Justice filed a statement of interest requesting that the court deny preliminary approval of the second amended settlement agreement and recommending that the settling parties propose an injunction that prohibits offers of buyer-broker compensation by MLS PIN participants. On June 24, 2024, the court stayed the case pending a ruling by the Burnett court on the proposed NAR settlement and ordered plaintiffs to file a supplemental preliminary approval of settlement within 30 days of the Burnett court ruling. No other defendants are part of the MLS PIN settlement. The terms of the Company s Settlement Agreement extended to plaintiffs in the Nosalek Action. On October 24, 2023, plaintiffs filed a joint notice of pending settlement and a motion to stay the Nosalek case as to RE/MAX, LLC and RE/MAX Integrated Regions, LLC for 30 days, which was granted on October 30, 2023. Plaintiffs subsequently filed a joint motion to continue the stay. On April 9, 2021, a putative class action claim (the Sunderland Action was filed in the Federal Court of Canada against the Toronto Regional Real Estate Board TRREB ), The Canadian Real Estate Association CREA ), RE/MAX Ontario-Atlantic Canada Inc. RE/MAX OA ), which was acquired by the Company in July 2021, Century 21 Canada Limited Partnership, Royal Lepage Real Estate Services Ltd., and many other real estate companies (collectively, the Defendants ), by the putative representative plaintiff, Mark Sunderland (the Plaintiff ). The Plaintiff alleges that the Defendants conspired, agreed or arranged with each other and acted in furtherance of their conspiracy to fix, maintain, increase, control, raise, or stabilize the rate of real estate buyers brokerages and salespersons commissions in respect of the purchase and sale of properties listed on TRREB s multiple listing service system (the Toronto MLS in violation of the Canadian Competition Act. On February 24, 2022, Plaintiff filed a Fresh as Amended Statement of Claim. With respect to RE/MAX OA, the amended claim alleges franchisor defendants aided and abetted their respective franchisee brokerages and their salespeople in violation of Section 45(1) of the Canadian Competition Act. Among other requested relief, the Plaintiff seeks damages against the defendants and injunctive relief. On September 25, 2023, the Court dismissed the claims against RE/MAX OA, and on October 25, 2023, the Plaintiff appealed the decision and RE/MAX OA has cross appealed. A copycat lawsuit to the Sunderland Action was filed by plaintiff Kevin McFall (the McFall Action on January 18, 2024. The complaint makes substantially similar allegations and seeks substantially similar relief as the Sunderland Action, but alleges a national class. The McFall Action names over defendants, including RE/MAX, LLC. Certain defendants in the McFall Action obtained the court s permission to file materials to join the Sunderland appeal. The McFall Action and the Sunderland Action are collectively referred to as the Canadian antitrust litigations.

The results of operations discussed in this Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations are those of RE/MAX Holdings, Inc. Holdings and its consolidated subsidiaries, including RMCO, LLC and its consolidated subsidiaries RMCO ), collectively, the Company, we, our or us. Business Overview We are one of the world s leading franchisors in the real estate industry. We franchise real estate brokerages globally under the RE/MAX brand RE/MAX and mortgage brokerages in the U.S. under the Motto Mortgage brand Motto ). We also sell ancillary products and services to our franchise networks, including loan processing services, primarily to our Motto network through our wemlo brand. RE/MAX and Motto are 100 franchised we do not own any of the brokerages that operate under these brands. We focus on enabling our networks success by providing powerful technology, quality education, and valuable marketing to build the strength of the RE/MAX and Motto brands. We support our franchisees in growing their brokerages, although they fund the associated cost of development. As a result, we maintain a relatively low fixed-cost structure which, combined with our primarily recurring fee-based models, enables us to capitalize on the economic benefits of the franchising model, yielding high margins and significant cash flow. Financial and Operational Highlights Three Months Ended September 30, 2024 (Compared to the three months and the period ended September 30, 2023, unless otherwise noted) 
 Total revenue of 78.5 million, a decrease of 3.4 from the prior year. Revenue excluding the Marketing Funds (a) decreased 3.3 to 58.4 million, driven by negative organic revenue growth (b) of 3.0 and adverse foreign currency movements of 0.3 . Net income (loss) attributable to RE/MAX Holdings, Inc. of 1.0 million, compared to 59.5) million in the prior year.

Table of Contents 
 Adjusted EBITDA (c) increased 2.0 to 27.3 million and Adjusted EBITDA margin (c) increased nearly 200 basis points to 34.8 from the prior year. Total agent count increased 0.1 to 145,483 agents. U.S. and Canada combined agent count decreased 4.4 to 78,201 agents. Total open Motto Mortgage offices decreased 3.3 to 234 offices. 

(a)
 Revenue excluding the Marketing Funds is a non-GAAP measure of financial performance that differs from the U.S. generally accepted accounting principles U.S. GAAP ). Revenue excluding the Marketing Funds is calculated directly from our condensed consolidated financial statements as Total revenue less Marketing Funds fees. 

(b)
 We define organic revenue growth as revenue growth from continuing operations excluding Marketing Funds, revenue attributable to acquisitions, and foreign currency movements. We define revenue from acquisitions as the incremental revenue generated from the date of an acquisition to its first anniversary (excluding Marketing Funds revenue related to acquisitions where applicable). 

(c)
 Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin are non-GAAP measures of financial performance that differ from U.S. GAAP. See Non-GAAP Financial Measures for further discussion of Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin and a reconciliation of the differences between Adjusted EBITDA and net income (loss), which is the most comparable U.S. GAAP measure for operating performance. Adjusted EBITDA margin represents Adjusted EBITDA as a percentage of total revenue. 

We continue to drive operational efficiency across the Company, which helped generate better-than-anticipated third-quarter financial results. Effective cost management and improved collections from across the RE/MAX network were the primary drivers of the 16.6 year over year decrease in selling, administrative, and operating expenses that contributed to our improved results. Agent count in both Canada and outside the U.S. and Canada achieved quarter-end record highs as of September 30, 2024. The RE/MAX conversions-mergers-acquisitions program continued to add agents to the network, including a 200-agent office in Canada. During the quarter, RE/MAX also significantly enhanced the value of the technology offered to North American affiliates through an expanded strategic partnership. Lastly, we continue to build capabilities to improve the agent-consumer experience by cultivating leads from our flagship www.remax.com website and to monetize our digital assets. However, current market conditions caused in large part by higher interest rates and accompanying affordability challenges have depressed existing U.S. and Canadian homes sales, resulting in declines in U.S. agent count, Motto open offices, and Total Revenue through September 30, 2024. The real estate industry also faces continued uncertainty as a result of ongoing industry litigation and regulatory attention, including the National Association of Realtors NAR recent settlement, which remains subject to final court approval, of class action cases that include changes in business practices. Several of our affiliates across both of our brands in several states were impacted by Hurricanes Helene and Milton. While the extent of the hurricanes full impact on our networks is not entirely known at this time, we currently estimate that our fourth quarter revenue will be lower than previously expected by approximately 1.0 million to 1.5 million, of which approximately 40 relates to the Marketing Funds, as financial support is provided to affected affiliates for a limited time. Revenue in the third quarter was not materially impacted by the aforementioned storms.

Results of Operations Comparison of the Three Months Ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 Revenue A summary of the components of our revenue is as follows (in thousands except percentages):

Three Months Ended Change September 30, Favorable/(Unfavorable) 2024 2023 Revenue excluding the Marketing Funds: Total revenue 78,478 81,223 (2,745) (3.4) Less: Marketing Funds fees 20,098 20,853 (755) (3.6) Revenue excluding the Marketing Funds 58,380 60,370 (1,990) (3.3) The decrease in Total revenue was attributable to negative organic revenue growth of 3.0 and adverse foreign currency movements of 0.3 . Negative organic revenue growth was driven by a decrease in U.S. agent count and a reduction in revenue from previous acquisitions, partially offset by an increase in Broker fees. Continuing Franchise Fees Revenue from Continuing franchise fees decreased primarily due to a reduction in U.S. agent count. Broker Fees Revenue from Broker fees increased primarily due to an increase in average home sales price and average transactions per agent in the U.S., partially offset by a reduction in U.S. agent count. Marketing Funds Fees and Marketing Funds Expenses Revenue from Marketing Funds fees decreased primarily due to a reduction in U.S. agent count. We recognize an equal and offsetting amount of expenses to revenue such that there is no impact to our overall profitability. Franchise Sales and Other Revenue Franchise sales and other revenue decreased primarily due to a reduction of revenue from previous acquisitions and lower revenue from our preferred marketing arrangements.

 Personnel costs decreased primarily due to severance charges from a reduction of force and reorganization in the prior year, see Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies for additional information. Also contributing to the decrease was a reduced headcount in the current year, and lower equity-based compensation expense. This decrease was partially offset by an increase in employee retention related expenses and higher employee benefit related costs. Professional fees decreased primarily due to lower legal expenses. See section titled Legal Proceedings, set forth in Part II, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Other selling, operating and administrative expenses decreased primarily due to a decrease in bad debt and other technology expenses. 
 Depreciation and Amortization Depreciation and amortization expense decreased primarily due to lower Franchise agreements amortization expense from prior years independent region acquisitions becoming fully amortized, partially offset by higher Mortgage segment amortization expense . Settlement and Impairment Charges See the discussion of the Results of operations for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 for a discussion of the settlement and impairment charges.

Foreign currency transaction gains (losses) are primarily the result of transactions denominated in the Canadian Dollar. Provision for Income Taxes The comparison of the effective income tax rates EITR for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 is not meaningful. For the three months ended September 30, 2024, the EITR was mainly impacted by foreign tax expense on foreign sourced income and a valuation allowance against the associated US foreign tax credit. For the three months ended September 30, 2023 the EITR was mainly impacted by the establishment of a valuation allowance on our U.S. net deferred tax assets of 59.2 million, the 55.0 million settlement of the Nationwide Claims, as defined in Note 11, Commitments and Contingencies , and the net impact of the reorganization charges incurred during the third quarter of 2023. In addition, our EITR depends on many factors, including a rate benefit attributable to the fact that the portion of RMCO s earnings allocated to the non-controlling interests are not subject to corporate-level taxes because RMCO is classified as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes and therefore is treated as a flow-through entity, as well as annual changes in state tax rates and foreign income tax expense. See Note 3, Non-controlling Interest to the accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements for further details on the allocation of income taxes between Holdings and the non-controlling interest and see Note 9, Income Taxes for additional information. Adjusted EBITDA See Non-GAAP Financial Measures for our definition of Adjusted EBITDA and for further discussion of our presentation of Adjusted EBITDA as well as a reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to net income (loss), which is the most comparable GAAP measure for operating performance. Adjusted EBITDA was 27.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, an increase of 0.5 million from the comparable prior year period. Adjusted EBITDA increased due to a decrease in bad debt expense, lower legal fees, lower compensation expense due to a reduction in headcount, primarily from the reduction in force and reorganization in the prior year, and a reduction of other technology expenses, partially offset by a decline in U.S. agent count.

Negative organic revenue growth was driven by a reduction in revenue from our annual RE/MAX agent convention, due to the 50 th anniversary celebration in the prior year, a decrease in U.S. agent count, and a reduction in revenue from previous acquisitions. Continuing Franchise Fees Revenue from Continuing franchise fees decreased primarily due to a reduction in U.S. agent count. Broker Fees Revenue from Broker fees increased primarily due to an increase in average home sales prices and average transactions per agent in the U.S. and Canada, mostly offset by a reduction in U.S. agent count. Marketing Funds Fees and Marketing Funds Expenses Revenue from Marketing Funds fees decreased primarily due to a reduction in U.S. agent count. We recognize an equal and offsetting amount of expenses to revenue such that there is no impact to our overall profitability. Franchise Sales and Other Revenue Franchise sales and other revenue decreased primarily due to a reduction in revenue of approximately 3.4 million from our annual RE/MAX agent convention as a result of lower attendance due to the 50 th anniversary celebration in the prior year, a reduction in revenue from previous acquisitions and lower revenue from preferred marketing arrangements.

 Depreciation and Amortization Depreciation and amortization expense decreased primarily due to lower Franchise agreements amortization expense from prior years independent region acquisitions becoming fully amortized and the acceleration of amortization of technology in the prior year, partially offset by higher Mortgage segment amortization expense.

Table of Contents 
 Settlement Fund in installments. As a result, in the third quarter of 2023, we recorded the total settlement amount of 55.0 million to Settlement and impairment charges within the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income (Loss) with a corresponding liability recorded to Accrued liabilities within the Consolidated Condensed Balance Sheets. In addition, all installments we have paid into the Settlement Fund are included in Restricted cash within the Consolidated Condensed Balance Sheets. See Note 11, Commitments and Contingencies for additional information. Gain on Reduction in Tax Receivable Agreement Liability During the three months ended September 30, 2023, the Company recorded a 59.2 million valuation allowance on its U.S. net deferred tax assets. In relation to this valuation allowance, the Company also remeasured the liability under the TRAs as of September 30, 2023 and recorded a 24.9 million gain on reduction in TRA liability. See Note 9, Income Taxes for additional information. Other Expenses, Net A summary of the components of our Other expenses, net is as follows (in thousands, except percentages): 

Nine Months Ended Change September 30, Favorable/(Unfavorable) 2024 2023 Other expenses, net: Interest expense (27,696) (26,377) (1,319) (5.0) Interest income 2,835 3,318 (483) (14.6) Foreign currency transaction gains (losses) (568) 383 (951) n/m Total other expenses, net (25,429) (22,676) (2,753) (12.1) Percent of revenue 10.8 9.1 n/m - not meaningful Other expenses, net increased primarily due to an increase in interest expense because of rising interest rates and a decrease in interest income due to lower interest rate yields and declines in investable balances. See Note 7, Debt for more information. Foreign currency transaction gains (losses) are primarily the result of transactions denominated in the Canadian Dollar and the Canadian dollar has weakened in comparison to the U.S dollar between the nine months ended September 30, 2023 and the nine months ended September 30, 2024. Provision for Income Taxes The comparison of the effective income tax rates EITR for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 is not meaningful. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the EITR was mainly impacted by foreign tax expense on foreign sourced income and a valuation allowance against the associated U.S. foreign tax credit. For the nine months ended September 30, 2023, the EITR was mainly impacted by the establishment of a valuation allowance on our U.S. net deferred tax assets of 59.2 million, the 55.0 million settlement of the Nationwide Claims, as defined in Note 11, Commitments and Contingencies , and the net impact of the reorganization charges incurred during the third quarter of 2023. In addition, our EITR depends on many factors, including a rate benefit attributable to the fact that the portion of RMCO s earnings allocated to the non-controlling interests are not subject to corporate-level taxes because RMCO is classified as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes and therefore is treated as a flow-through entity, as well as annual changes in state tax rates and foreign income tax expense. See Note 3, Non-controlling Interest to the accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements for further details on the allocation of income taxes between Holdings and the non-controlling interest and see Note 9, Income Taxes for additional information. Adjusted EBITDA See Non-GAAP Financial Measures for our definition of Adjusted EBITDA and for further discussion of our presentation of Adjusted EBITDA as well as a reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to net income (loss), which is the most comparable GAAP measure for operating performance. Adjusted EBITDA was 74.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, an increase of 1.1 million from the comparable prior year period. Adjusted EBITDA increased due to a decrease in bad debt expense, lower legal expenses, 

 35 

Table of Contents 
 lower compensation expense due to a reduction in headcount, primarily from the reduction in force and reorganization in the prior year, a reduction in other technology expenses, and decreased property tax expense, partially offset by a decrease in U.S. agent count and a reduction in revenue from previous acquisitions. Non-GAAP Financial Measures The Securities and Exchange Commission SEC has adopted rules to regulate the use in filings with the SEC and in public disclosures of financial measures that are not in accordance with U.S. GAAP, such as Revenue excluding the Marketing Funds and Adjusted EBITDA and the ratios related thereto. These measures are derived on the basis of methodologies other than in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Revenue excluding the Marketing Funds is a non-GAAP measure of financial performance that differs from U.S. GAAP, and we believe that exclusion of the Marketing Funds is a useful supplemental measure as we recognize an equal and offsetting amount of expenses to revenue such that there is no impact to our overall profitability. Revenue excluding the Marketing Funds is calculated directly from our condensed consolidated financial statements as Total revenue less Marketing Funds fees. We define Adjusted EBITDA as EBITDA (consolidated net income (loss) before depreciation and amortization, interest expense, interest income and the provision for income taxes, each of which is presented in our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q), adjusted for the impact of the following items that are either non-cash or that we do not consider representative of our ongoing operating performance: gain or loss on sale or disposition of assets and sublease, settlement and impairment charges, equity-based compensation expense, acquisition-related expense, gains or losses from changes in the tax receivable agreement liability, expense or income related to changes in the fair value measurement of contingent consideration, restructuring charges and other non-recurring items. As Adjusted EBITDA omits certain non-cash items and other non-recurring cash charges or other items, we believe that it is less susceptible to variances that affect our operating performance resulting from depreciation, amortization and other non-cash and non-recurring cash charges or other items. We present Adjusted EBITDA, and the related Adjusted EBITDA margin, because we believe they are useful as supplemental measures in evaluating the performance of our operating businesses and provide greater transparency into our results of operations. Our management uses Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin as factors in evaluating the performance of our business. Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin have limitations as analytical tools, and you should not consider these measures either in isolation or as a substitute for analyzing our results as reported under U.S. GAAP. Some of these limitations are: 
 these measures do not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, our working capital needs; these measures do not reflect our interest expense, or the cash requirements necessary to service interest or principal payments on our debt; these measures do not reflect our income tax expense or the cash requirements to pay our taxes; these measures do not reflect the cash requirements to pay dividends to stockholders of our Class A common stock and tax and other cash distributions to our non-controlling unitholders; these measures do not reflect the cash requirements pursuant to the Tax Receivable Agreements TRAs ; these measures do not reflect the cash requirements for share repurchases; these measures do not reflect the cash requirements for the settlement of industry class-action lawsuits and other legal settlements; although depreciation and amortization are non-cash charges, the assets being depreciated and amortized will often require replacement in the future, and these measures do not reflect any cash requirements for such replacements; although equity-based compensation is a non-cash charge, the issuance of equity-based awards may have a dilutive impact on earnings per share; and other companies may calculate these measures differently, so similarly named measures may not be comparable.

See Note 8, Fair Value Measurements for additional information. (4) During the third quarter of 2023, we announced a reduction in force and reorganization intended to streamline our operations and yield cost savings over the long term.

(5) Gain on reduction in tax receivable agreement liability is a result of a valuation allowance on deferred tax assets recorded during the third quarter of 2023. (6) Other is primarily made up of employee retention related expenses from our CEO transition. Liquidity and Capital Resources Overview of Factors Affecting Our Liquidity Our liquidity position is primarily affected by the change in our agent and franchise base and conditions in the real estate market. In this regard, our short-term liquidity position from time to time has been, and will continue to be, affected by several factors including agents in the RE/MAX network, particularly in Company-Owned Regions. Our cash flows are primarily related to the timing of: 
 (i) cash receipt of revenues; (ii) payment of selling, operating and administrative expenses; (iii) net investments in our Mortgage segment; (iv) cash consideration for acquisitions and acquisition-related expenses; (v) principal payments, including any early principal payments, and related interest payments on our Senior Secured Credit Facility; (vi) dividend payments to stockholders of our Class A common stock; (vii) distributions and other payments to non-controlling unitholders pursuant to the terms of RMCO s limited liability company operating agreement the RMCO, LLC Agreement (viii) corporate tax payments paid by the Company; (ix) payments to the TRA parties pursuant to the TRAs; (x) the settlement of industry class-action lawsuits and other legal settlements; and (xi) share repurchases.

 We have satisfied these needs primarily through our existing cash balances, cash generated by our operations and funds available under our Senior Secured Credit Facility. We may pursue other sources of capital that may include other forms of external financing, such as additional financing in the public capital markets, in order to increase our cash position and preserve financial flexibility as needs arise. Financing Resources RMCO and RE/MAX, LLC, a wholly owned subsidiary of RMCO, have a credit agreement with JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as administrative agent, and various lenders party thereto (the Senior Secured Credit Facility ). On July 21, 2021, we amended and restated our Senior Secured Credit Facility to fund the acquisition of RE/MAX INTEGRA INTEGRA and refinance our existing facility. The revised facility provides for a seven-year 460.0 million term loan facility and a five-year 50.0 million revolving loan facility. The Senior Secured Credit Facility also provides for incremental facilities under which RE/MAX, LLC may request to add one or more tranches of term facilities or increase any then existing credit facility in the aggregate principal amount of up to 100 million (or a higher amount subject to the terms and conditions of the Senior Secured Credit Facility), subject to lender participation. The Senior Secured Credit Facility is guaranteed by RMCO and is secured by a lien on substantially all of the assets of RE/MAX, LLC and other operating companies. The Senior Secured Credit Facility requires us to repay term loans at approximately 1.2 million per quarter. We are also required to repay the term loans and reduce revolving commitments with (i) 100 of proceeds of any incurrence of additional debt not permitted by the Senior Secured Credit Facility, (ii) 100 of proceeds of asset sales and 100 of amounts recovered under insurance policies, subject to certain exceptions and a reinvestment right and (iii) 50 of Excess Cash Flow (or ECF as defined in the Senior Secured Credit Facility, at the end of the applicable fiscal year if RE/MAX, LLC s Total Leverage Ratio (or TLR as defined in the Senior Secured Credit Facility, is in excess of 4.25:1. If the TLR as of the last day of such fiscal year is equal to or less than 4.25:1 but above 3.75:1, the repayment percentage is 25 of ECF and if our TLR as of the last day of such fiscal year is less than 3.75:1, no repayment from ECF is required. We evaluated if an ECF payment was required as of December 31, 2023, pursuant to the terms of the Senior Secured Credit Facility and determined no ECF payment was required. In addition, if any amounts are drawn under the revolving line of credit under the Senior Secured Credit Facility the terms of the Senior Secured Credit Facility require the TLR to not exceed 4.50:1 at the last day of any period of four consecutive fiscal quarters. If the TLR exceeds 4.50:1, access to borrowings under the revolving line of credit will be restricted. A commitment fee of 0.5 per annum (subject to reductions) accrues on the amount of unutilized revolving line of credit regardless of our TLR. As of the date of this report, no amounts were drawn on the revolving line of credit. We are also limited in the amount of restricted payments we can make, as defined in the Senior Secured Credit Facility, as it provides for customary restrictions on, among other things, additional indebtedness, restricted payments, liens, dispositions of property, dividends, transactions with affiliates and fundamental changes such as mergers, consolidations, and liquidations. The restricted payments include declaration or payment of dividends, repurchase of shares, or other distributions. In general, we can make unlimited restricted payments, if the TLR is below 3.50:1 (both before and after giving effect to such payments). So long as the TLR exceeds 3.50:1, we will be limited in the amount of restricted payments primarily dividends and share repurchases we can make up to the greater of 50 million or 50 of consolidated EBITDA on a trailing twelve-month basis (unless we can rely on other restricted payment baskets available under the Senior Secured Credit Facility). The TLR is calculated based on RE/MAX, LLC s consolidated indebtedness and consolidated EBITDA, both defined in the Senior Secured Credit Facility. As of September 30, 2024, RE/MAX, LLC s consolidated EBITDA, as defined in the Senior Secured Credit Facility, was 102.7 million on a trailing twelve-month basis and the TLR was 3.52:1. As long as the TLR remains above 3.50:1, we will be limited in the amount of restricted payments we can make. In addition, access to borrowings under the revolving line of credit will not be restricted based on TLR so long as the Company s TLR remains below 4:50:1 With certain exceptions, any default under any of our other agreements evidencing indebtedness in the amount of 15.0 million or more would constitute an event of default under the Senior Secured Credit Facility.

 Prior to July 2023, borrowings under the term loans and revolving loans accrued interest, at our option on (a) LIBOR, provided LIBOR shall be no less than 0.50 plus an applicable margin of 2.50 and, provided further that such rate shall be adjusted for reserve requirements for eurocurrency liabilities, if any (the LIBOR Rate or (b) the greatest of (i) the prime rate as quoted by the Wall Street Journal, (ii) the NYFRB Rate (as defined in the Senior Secured Credit Facility) plus 0.50 and (iii) the one-month Eurodollar Rate plus 1.00 , (such greatest rate, the ABR plus, in each case, an applicable margin of 1.50 . The Senior Secured Credit Facility includes a provision for transition from LIBOR to the alternative reference rate of Term Secured Overnight Financing Rate SOFR on or before June 2023 (the LIBOR Rate cessation date) and we transitioned from LIBOR to Adjusted Term SOFR on July 31, 2023. Borrowings under the term loans and revolving loans accrue interest based on Adjusted Term SOFR, subject to the same floor of 0.50 , plus the same applicable margin of 2.50 . As of September 30, 2024, the interest rate on the term loan facility was 7.5 . As of September 30, 2024, we had 445.1 million of term loans outstanding, excluding any unamortized discount and issuance costs, and no revolving loans outstanding under our Senior Secured Credit Facility. Sources and Uses of Cash As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we had 83.8 million and 82.6 million, respectively, of cash and cash equivalents, of which approximately 17.0 million and 32.5 million, respectively, were denominated in foreign currencies. The following table summarizes our cash flows from operating, investing, and financing activities (in thousands): 

Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 Cash provided by (used in): Operating activities 42,867 19,625 Investing activities (5,123) (3,570) Financing activities (6,610) (33,391) Effect of exchange rate changes on cash (519) 21 Net change in cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash 30,615 (17,315) Operating Activities Cash provided by operating activities increased primarily as a result of: 
 lower spend in the Marketing Funds in the current year, which resulted in a 2.0 million increase in restricted cash and cash flow provided by operating activities. Compared to higher spend in the Marketing Funds in the prior year, which resulted in an 12.2 million decrease in restricted cash and cash flow provided by operating activities. This contributed to a net year over year increase in cash flow provided by operating activities of 14.2 million; an increase due to lower payments of certain employee related liabilities; lower cash paid for severance of 1.2 million; an increase in Adjusted EBITDA of 1.1 million; offset by, higher interest payments in the current year of 1.5 million, due to higher interest rates in the current year; and timing differences on various operating assets and liabilities. Investing Activities During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the change in cash used in investing activities was primarily the result of higher spend on our leased buildings other than our corporate headquarters and capitalizable technology investments compared to the prior year. Financing Activities During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the change in cash used in financing activities was primarily due to the suspension of our quarterly dividend during the fourth quarter of 2023 and not allocating capital to our share repurchase program in the current year.

 Capital Allocation Priorities Liquidity Our objective is to maintain a strong liquidity position. We have existing cash balances, cash flows from operating activities, and incremental facilities under our Senior Secured Credit Facility available to support the needs of our business. As needs arise, we may seek additional financing in the public capital markets. Acquisitions As part of our growth strategy, we may pursue acquisitions of RE/MAX Independent Regions in the U.S. and Canada as well as additional acquisitions or investments in complementary businesses, services and technologies that would provide access to new markets, revenue streams, or otherwise complement our existing operations. We may fund any such growth with various sources of capital including existing cash balances and cash flow from operations, as well as proceeds from debt financings including under existing credit facilities or new arrangements raised in the public capital markets. Capital Expenditures The total aggregate amount for purchases of property and equipment and capitalization of developed software was 5.8 million and 4.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. T hese amounts primarily relate to higher spend on leased buildings other than our corporate headquarters and spend on investments in technology . We plan to continue to re-invest in our business in order to improve operational efficiencies and enhance the tools and services provided to the affiliates in our networks. Total capital expenditures for 2024 are expected to be between 6.5 million and 7.5 million. See Financial and Operational Highlights above for additional information. Return of Capital In the fourth quarter of 2023, our Board of Directors suspended our quarterly dividend. In light of the litigation settlement and ongoing challenging housing and mortgage market conditions (as further discussed in Note 11, Commitments and Contingencies ), we continue to believe this action to preserve our capital is prudent. Our Board of Directors approved quarterly cash dividends of 0.23 per share on all outstanding shares of Class A common stock during the first three quarters in 2023, as disclosed in Note 4, Earnings Per Share and Dividends . During the first quarter of 2022, our Board of Directors authorized a common stock repurchase program of up to 100 million. The share repurchase program does not obligate the Company to purchase any amount of common stock and does not have an expiration date. During the nine months ended September 30, 2023, 160,405 shares of our Class A common stock were repurchased and retired for 3.4 million, excluding commissions, at an average cost of 21.24 per share. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we did not repurchase any shares of our Class A common stock. As of September 30, 2024, 62.5 million remained available under the share repurchase authorization. Future capital allocation decisions with respect to return of capital either in the form of additional future dividends, and if declared, the amount, payment and timing of any such future dividend, or in the form of share buybacks, will be at the sole discretion of our Board of Directors who will take into account general economic, housing and mortgage market conditions, the Company s financial condition, available cash, current and anticipated cash needs, any applicable restrictions pursuant to the terms of our Senior Secured Credit Facility and any other factors that the Board of Directors considers relevant.

Off Balance Sheet Arrangements We have no material off balance sheet arrangements as of September 30, 2024. Critical Accounting Judgments and Estimates The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Our Critical Accounting Judgments and Estimates disclosed in Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Critical Accounting Judgments and Estimates in our 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K for which there were no material changes, included: 
 Purchase Accounting for Acquisitions Deferred Tax Assets and TRA Liability New Accounting Pronouncements See Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies to the accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements for additional information. Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risks We have operations within the U.S., Canada, and globally, and we are exposed to market risks in the ordinary course of our business. These risks primarily include interest rate, foreign exchange and credit risks, as well as risks relating to changes in the general economic conditions in the countries where we conduct business. We use derivative instruments to mitigate the impact of certain of our market risk exposures. We do not use derivatives for trading or speculative purposes. Credit Risk We are exposed to credit risk related to receivables from franchisees. We perform quarterly reviews of credit exposure above an established threshold for each franchisee and are in regular communication with those franchisees about their balance. For significant delinquencies, we will terminate the franchise. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 bad debt expense was 0.4 and 2.0 of revenue, respectively.

 Interest Rate Risk We are subject to interest rate risk in connection with borrowings under our Senior Secured Credit Facility which bear interest at variable rates. On September 30, 2024, 445.1 million in term loans were outstanding under our Senior Secured Credit Facility. We currently do not engage in any interest rate hedging activity, but given our variable rate borrowings, we monitor interest rates and if appropriate, may engage in hedging activity prospectively. Up until and prior to September 30, 2023, the interest rate on our Senior Secured Credit Facility was based on LIBOR, subject to a floor of 0.50 , plus an applicable margin of 2.50 . We transitioned from LIBOR to Adjusted Term SOFR during the third quarter of 2023 and borrowings under the term loans and revolving loans accrue interest based on Adjusted Term SOFR, beginning on July 31, 2023, subject to the same floor of 0.50 , plus the same applicable margin of 2.50 . As of September 30, 2024, the interest rate was 7.5 . If our rate is above the floor, then each hypothetical 0.25 increase would result in additional annual interest expense of 1.1 million. To mitigate a portion of this risk, we invest our cash balances in short-term investments that earn interest at variable rates. Currency Risk We have a network of global franchisees in over 110 countries and territories. Fluctuations in exchange rates of the U.S. dollar against foreign currencies can result, and have resulted, in fluctuations in (a) revenue and operating income (loss) due to a portion of our revenue being denominated in foreign currencies and (b) foreign exchange transaction gains and losses due primarily to cash, accounts receivable and liability balances denominated in foreign currencies, with the Canadian dollar representing the most significant exposure. To mitigate a portion of this risk related to (b), we enter into short-term foreign currency forwards, to minimize exposures related to foreign currency. See Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, for more information. In addition, we actively convert cash balances into U.S. dollars to mitigate currency risk on cash positions. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, a hypothetical 5 strengthening/weakening in the value of the U.S. dollar compared to the Canadian dollar would have resulted in a decrease/increase to operating income (loss) of approximately 0.4 million and 1.2 million, respectively, related to currency risk (a) above. Item 4. Controls and Procedures Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures We maintain disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act, that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Principal Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Our management, under the supervision and with the participation of our Principal Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer, evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Exchange Act) as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Based on that evaluation, our Principal Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer have concluded that as of September 30, 2024 our disclosure controls and procedures were effective. Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting There have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting identified in connection with the evaluation required by Rules 13a-15(d) and 15d-15(d) of the Exchange Act that occurred during the quarter ended September 30, 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. PART II. OTHER INFORMATION Item 1. Legal Proceedings From time to time, we are involved in litigation, claims and other proceedings relating to the conduct of our business, and the disclosures set forth in Note 11, Commitments and Contingencies relating to certain legal matters is incorporated

 herein by reference. Such litigation and other proceedings may include, but are not limited to, actions relating to intellectual property, commercial arrangements, franchising arrangements, brokerage disputes, vicarious liability based upon conduct of individuals or entities outside of our control including franchisees and independent agents, and employment law claims. Litigation and other disputes are inherently unpredictable and subject to substantial uncertainties and unfavorable resolutions could occur. Often these cases raise complex factual and legal issues, which are subject to risks and uncertainties and which could require significant time and resources from management. Although we do not believe any currently pending litigation will have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or operations, there are inherent uncertainties in litigation and other claims and regulatory proceedings and such pending matters could result in unexpected expenses and liabilities and might materially adversely affect our business, financial condition or operations, including our reputation. Item 1A. Risk Factors For a discussion of our potential risks and uncertainties, please see Risk Factors in our 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K. There have been no material changes to the risk factors as disclosed in our 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K. Item 2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds The following table sets forth stock repurchases of our Class A common stock for the three months ended September 30, 2024:
