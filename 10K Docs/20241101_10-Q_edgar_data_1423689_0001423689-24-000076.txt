 EXECUTIVE OVERVIEW 
 We are a leading provider of private capital to the U.S. housing market, enhancing liquidity in the residential real estate mortgage markets and, in turn, facilitating home ownership in the U.S. We invest primarily in Agency residential mortgage-backed securities ("Agency RMBS") on a leveraged basis. These investments consist of residential mortgage pass-through securities and collateralized mortgage obligations for which the principal and interest payments are guaranteed by a U.S. Government-sponsored enterprise, such as Federal National Mortgage Association ("Fannie Mae") and Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation ("Freddie Mac," and together with Fannie Mae, the "GSEs"), or by a U.S. Government agency, such as Government National Mortgage Association ("Ginnie Mae"). We may also invest in other assets related to the housing, mortgage or real estate markets that are not guaranteed by a GSE or U.S. Government agency. 
 We are internally managed with the principal objective of generating favorable long-term stockholder returns with a substantial yield component. We generate income from the interest earned on our investments, net of associated borrowing and hedging costs, and net realized gains and losses on our investment and hedging activities. We fund our investments primarily through collateralized borrowings structured as repurchase agreements. We operate in a manner to qualify to be taxed as a REIT under the Internal Revenue Code. 
 We employ an active management strategy that is dynamic and responsive to evolving market conditions. The composition of our portfolio and our investment, funding, and hedging strategies are tailored to reflect our analysis of market conditions and the relative values of available options. Market conditions are influenced by a variety of factors, including interest rates, prepayment expectations, liquidity, housing prices, unemployment rates, general economic conditions, government participation in the mortgage market, regulations and relative returns on other assets. 
 
 Trends and Recent Market Impacts 
 The favorable investment environment, characterized by Agency mortgage spreads to benchmark interest rates that remained materially wider than historical norms and within a relatively narrow trading range, declining interest rate volatility, and the emerging accommodative monetary policy stance by the Federal Reserve (the "Fed"), continued to strengthen in the third quarter of 2024. The shift in monetary policy was further supported by the Fed's initial rate cut in September, which was larger than many expected. More importantly, the September rate cut marked the end of an extended period of monetary policy restraint, with the Fed communicating its intention to lower short-term rates to a neutral level over time. As a result, Treasury rates declined across the yield curve, and the yield curve ended the quarter with a positive slope for the first time in two years. 
 Against this favorable backdrop, AGNC generated an economic return on tangible common equity per share of 9.3 for the third quarter, comprised of 0.36 of dividends per common share and a 0.42, or 5 , increase in tangible net book value per common share, bringing our year-to-date economic return through September 30, 2024 to 13.8 per common share. Consistent with Agency RMBS spreads trading in a relatively narrow range, our year-to-date economic return consisted of a modest increase in our tangible net book value per common share of 1.4 and a 1.08 of dividends per common share. 
 Looking ahead, the outlook for Agency RMBS is decidedly better today than it was in 2022 and 2023 given the current economic outlook, the stance of the Fed, and our expectation that long-term interest rates and Agency RMBS spreads will remain relatively stable. While the path of financial markets is never perfectly smooth and periods of volatility are inevitable, our view is based, in part, on our belief that the supply and demand dynamics for Agency RMBS will remain in reasonable balance. Given the recent modest decline in mortgage rates during the third quarter, it is possible that the supply of Agency 
 26 

RMBS will increase somewhat over the intermediate term. On the demand side, however, accommodative monetary policy, a steeper yield curve, historically large money market mutual fund balances, and the potential for less onerous bank capital reforms than originally proposed suggest that demand for high-quality fixed income assets is likely to increase as the Fed reduces short-term interest rates. 
 Agency RMBS performance during the third quarter varied considerably by coupon and hedge composition, with lower coupon RMBS outperforming higher coupons, driven by favorable technical factors and strong demand from fixed income bond funds. Our performance benefited from having a diversified mix of assets as well as a meaningful share of longer-term US Treasury-based hedges. During the quarter, we reduced our swap-based hedges and increased our allocation to Treasury-based hedges. Additionally, we expanded our use of longer-term hedges in response to the shift in monetary policy and our expectations for further yield curve steepening. Consistent with our transition toward longer-term hedges, our overall interest rate hedge position declined to 72 of the outstanding balance of our Investment Securities Repo, TBA position, and other debt by the end of the quarter, down from 98 as of the second quarter. 
 The weighted average coupon on our fixed-rate Agency RMBS and TBA securities decreased to 4.90 as of the end of the third quarter, from 4.95 at the end of the second quarter. Consistent with the decline in interest rates during the third quarter, the average projected life CPR for our portfolio increased 4.0 to 13.2 . Actual CPRs for the third quarter averaged 7.3 , up slightly from 7.1 in the second quarter. 
 Our "at risk" leverage decreased modestly to 7.2x tangible stockholders equity at the end of the quarter, from 7.4x as of June 30, 2024. Additionally, we concluded the quarter with 6.2 billion in cash and unencumbered Agency RMBS, or 68 of our tangible equity, up from 5.3 billion, or 65 of our tangible equity, at the end of the second quarter. 
 Net spread and dollar roll income per diluted common share (a non-GAAP measure) declined by 0.10 to 0.43 per share in the third quarter, driven by a reduction in our net interest rate spread, which narrowed by 48 basis points to 221 basis points. Approximately half of the decline in our net interest spread was due to the maturity of 6.5 billion of low-cost pay-fixed interest rate swaps during the quarter. No additional swaps are scheduled to mature until the second quarter of 2025. The remaining decline was largely due to our decision to further reduce our swap-based hedges in favor of Treasury-based hedges, which are not reflected in our reported net interest spread. 
 During the third quarter, we issued 781 million of common equity through our At-the-Market ("ATM") offering program, bringing our year-to-date issuances to 1.46 billion. The significant increase in ATM issuances during the third quarter was aligned with the substantial price-to-book premium of our common stock and contributed to meaningful book value accretion for our common stockholders. Additionally, the positive investment environment provided a favorable backdrop for deploying this new capital.

 RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 
 Non-GAAP Financial Measures 
 In addition to the results presented in accordance with GAAP, our results of operations discussed below include certain non-GAAP financial information, including "economic interest income," "economic interest expense," and "net spread and dollar roll income available to common stockholders" 1 and the related per common share measures and certain financial metrics derived from such non-GAAP information. 
 "Economic interest income" is measured as interest income (GAAP measure), adjusted to (i) exclude retrospective "catch-up" adjustments to premium amortization cost associated with changes in projected CPR estimates and (ii) include TBA dollar roll implied interest income. "Economic interest expense" is measured as interest expense (GAAP measure) adjusted to include TBA dollar roll implied interest expense/benefit and interest rate swap periodic cost/income. "Net spread and dollar roll income available to common stockholders" is measured as comprehensive income (loss) available (attributable) to common stockholders (GAAP measure) adjusted to: (i) exclude gains/losses on investment securities recognized through net income and other comprehensive income and gains/losses on derivative instruments and other securities (GAAP measures); (ii) exclude retrospective "catch-up" adjustments to premium amortization cost associated with changes in projected CPR estimates; and (iii) include interest rate swap periodic income/cost, TBA dollar roll income and other interest income/expense. As defined "Net 
 32 

spread and dollar roll income available to common stockholders" includes (i) the components of "economic interest income" and "economic interest expense", plus (ii) other interest income/expense, and less (iii) total operating expenses and dividends on preferred stock (GAAP measures). 
 By providing such measures, in addition to the related GAAP measures, we believe we give greater transparency into the information used by our management in its financial and operational decision-making. We also believe it is important for users of our financial information to consider information related to our current financial performance without the effects of certain measures and one-time events that are not necessarily indicative of our current investment portfolio performance and operations. 
 Specifically, in the case "net spread and dollar roll income available to common stockholders" and components of such measure, "economic interest income" and "economic interest expense," we believe the inclusion of TBA dollar roll income is meaningful as TBAs, which are accounted for under GAAP as derivative instruments with gains and losses recognized in other gain (loss) in our consolidated statement of comprehensive income, are economically equivalent to holding and financing generic Agency RMBS using short-term repurchase agreements. Similarly, we believe that the inclusion of periodic interest rate swap settlements is meaningful as interest rate swaps are the primary instrument we use to economically hedge against fluctuations in our borrowing costs and it is more indicative of our total cost of funds than interest expense alone. Additionally, we believe the exclusion of "catch-up" premium amortization adjustments is meaningful as it excludes the cumulative effect from prior reporting periods due to current changes in future prepayment expectations and, therefore, exclusion of such adjustments is more indicative of the current earnings potential of our investment portfolio. 
 However, because such measures are incomplete measures of our financial performance and involve differences from results computed in accordance with GAAP, they should be considered as supplementary to, and not as a substitute for, results computed in accordance with GAAP. In addition, because not all companies use identical calculations, our presentation of such non-GAAP measures may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies.

 1. Prior to December 31, 2023, "Net spread and dollar roll income available to common stockholders" was referred to as "net spread and dollar roll income, excluding 'catch-up' premium amortization, available to common stockholders". "Net spread and dollar roll income available to common stockholders" continues to exclude "catch-up" premium amortization.

 Except as noted below, average numbers for each period are weighted based on days on our books and records. 
 1. Net book value per common share is calculated as total stockholders' equity, less preferred stock liquidation preference, divided by number of common shares outstanding as of period end. 
 2. Tangible net book value per common share excludes goodwill. 
 3. Amount represents the daily weighted average repurchase agreements outstanding for the period used to fund our investment securities and other debt. Amount excludes U.S. Treasury repurchase agreements and TBA contracts. Other debt includes debt of consolidated VIEs. 
 4. Average stockholders' equity calculated as average month-ended stockholders' equity during the period. 
 5. Average tangible net book value "at risk" leverage is calculated by dividing the sum of daily weighted average repurchase agreements used to fund our investment securities, other debt, and TBA and forward settling securities (at cost) (collectively "mortgage borrowings") outstanding for the period by the sum of average stockholders' equity adjusted to exclude goodwill for the period. Leverage excludes U.S. Treasury repurchase agreements. 
 6. Tangible net book value "at risk" leverage as of period end is calculated by dividing the sum of mortgage borrowings outstanding and receivable/payable for unsettled investment securities as of period end by the sum of total stockholders' equity adjusted to exclude goodwill as of period end. Leverage excludes U.S. Treasury repurchase agreements.

 1. Reported in gain (loss) on derivatives instruments and other securities, net in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations. 
 2. Implied interest income from TBA dollar roll transactions is computed as the sum of (i) TBA dollar roll income and (ii) estimated TBA implied funding cost (see Economic Interest Expense and Aggregate Cost of Funds below). TBA dollar roll income represents the price differential, or "price drop," between the TBA price for current month settlement versus the TBA price for forward month settlement and is the economic equivalent to interest income on the underlying Agency securities, less an implied funding cost, over the forward settlement period. Amount is net of TBAs used for hedging purposes. Amount excludes TBA mark-to-market adjustments. 
 3. The combined asset yield is calculated on a weighted average basis based on our average investment and TBA balances outstanding during the period and their respective yields. 
 4. 30-year fixed rate mortgage rates are sourced from Optimal Blue. 10-year U.S. Treasury rates are sourced from Bloomberg. 
 The principal elements impacting our economic interest income are the average size of our investment portfolio and the average yield on our securities. The following table includes a summary of the estimated impact of each of these elements on our economic interest income for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the prior year period (in millions): 
 35 

Impact of Changes in the Principal Elements Impacting Economic Interest Income Periods ended September 30, 2024 vs. September 30, 2023 Due to Change in Average Three months ended: 
 Total Increase / (Decrease) Portfolio Size Asset Yield Interest Income (GAAP measure) 163 117 46 Estimated "catch-up" premium amortization due to change in CPR forecast 55 55 Interest income, excluding "catch-up" premium amortization 218 117 101 TBA dollar roll income - implied interest income (60) (63) 3 Economic interest income, excluding "catch-up" amortization (non-GAAP measure) 158 54 104 Due to Change in Average Nine months ended:

 Our average investment portfolio (at cost), inclusive of TBAs, increased 10 and 5 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, primarily due to an increase in our capital base. The average yield on our investment portfolio, including TBA implied asset yields and excluding "catch-up" premium amortization, increased 53 and 66 basis points for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, largely as a result of shifting our asset portfolio from TBA and lower coupon holdings toward a greater share of higher coupon, specified pools. 
 
 Leverage 
 Our primary measure of leverage is our tangible net book value "at risk" leverage ratio, which is measured as the sum of our repurchase agreements and other debt used to fund our investment securities and net TBA and forward settling securities position (at cost) (together referred to as "mortgage borrowings") and our net receivable/payable for unsettled investment securities, divided by our total stockholders' equity adjusted to exclude goodwill. 
 We include our net TBA position in our measure of leverage because a forward contract to acquire Agency RMBS in the TBA market carries similar risks to Agency RMBS purchased in the cash market and funded with on-balance sheet liabilities. Similarly, a TBA contract for the forward sale of Agency securities has substantially the same effect as selling the underlying Agency RMBS and reducing our on-balance sheet funding commitments. (Refer to Liquidity and Capital Resources in this Form 10-Q for further discussion of TBA securities and dollar roll transactions). Repurchase agreements used to fund short-term investments in U.S. Treasury securities ("U.S. Treasury Repo") are excluded from our measure of leverage due to the temporary and highly liquid nature of these investments.

 2. Reported in gain (loss) on derivative instruments and other securities, net in our consolidated statements of comprehensive income. 
 3. The implied funding cost (benefit) of TBA dollar roll transactions is determined using the price differential, or "price drop," between the TBA price for current month settlement versus the TBA price for forward month settlement and market based assumptions regarding the "cheapest-to-deliver" collateral that can be delivered to satisfy the TBA contract, such as the anticipated collateral s weighted average coupon, weighted average maturity and projected 1-month CPR. The average implied funding cost (benefit) for all TBA transactions is weighted based on our daily average TBA balance outstanding for the period. 
 4. The combined cost of funds for total mortgage borrowings outstanding, before interest rate swap periodic income, is calculated on a weighted average basis based on average investment securities repurchase agreements, other debt and TBA securities outstanding during the period and their respective cost of funds. 
 5. Interest rate swap periodic income is measured as a percent of average mortgage borrowings outstanding for the period. 
 
 The principal elements impacting our economic interest expense are (i) the size of our average mortgage borrowings and interest rate swap portfolio outstanding during the period, (ii) the average interest rate on our mortgage borrowings and (iii) the average net interest rate paid/received on our interest rate swaps. The following table includes a summary of the estimated impact of these elements on our economic interest expense for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the prior year period (in millions): 
 Impact of Changes in the Principal Elements of Economic Interest Expense Periods ended September 30, 2024 vs. September 30, 2023 Due to Change in Average Three months ended: 
 Total Increase / (Decrease) Borrowing / Swap Balance Borrowing / Swap Rate Investment securities repurchase agreement and other debt interest expense 174 168 6 TBA dollar roll income - implied interest expense (64) (63) (1) Interest rate swap periodic income/cost 127 25 102 Total change in economic interest expense 237 130 107 Due to Change in Average Nine months ended:

 Our average mortgage borrowings, inclusive of TBAs, increased 14 and 7 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, consistent with the increase in our investment portfolio. The average interest rate on our 
 37 

mortgage borrowings, excluding the impact interest rate swap periodic income, increased 4 and 46 basis points for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, due to higher short-term interest rates. 
 Interest rate swap periodic income declined for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 primarily due to higher pay rates on our pay-fixed swaps largely driven by the maturity of low cost interest swaps. The following is a summary of our average interest rate swaps outstanding and their average pay and receive rates for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 (dollars in millions). Amounts exclude forward starting swaps not yet in effect.

For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, we had an average forward starting net pay and (receive) fixed rate swap balance of (928) million and (294) million, respectively. Forward starting interest rate swaps do not impact our economic interest expense and aggregate cost of funds until they commence accruing net interest settlements on their forward start dates.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES 
 Our business is dependent on our ability to maintain adequate levels of liquidity and capital resources to fund day-to-day operations, fulfill collateral requirements under our funding and derivative agreements, and to satisfy our dividend distribution requirement of at least 90 of our taxable income to maintain our qualification as a REIT. Our primary sources of liquidity are unencumbered cash and securities, borrowings available under repurchase agreements, TBA dollar roll financing and monthly receipts of principal and interest payments. We may also conduct asset sales, change our asset or funding mix, issue equity or undertake other capital enhancing actions to maintain adequate levels of liquidity and capital resources. There are various risks and uncertainties that can impact our liquidity, such as those described in Item 1A. Risk Factors of our most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K and Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures of Market Risks in this Form 10-Q. In assessing our liquidity, we consider a number of factors, including our current leverage, collateral levels, access to capital markets, overall market conditions, and the sensitivity of our tangible net book value over a range of scenarios. We believe that we have sufficient liquidity and capital resources available to meet our obligations and execute our business strategy. 
 Leverage and Financing Sources 
 Our leverage will vary depending on market conditions and our assessment of relative risks and returns, but we generally expect our leverage to be between six and twelve times the amount of our tangible stockholders' equity, measured as the sum of our total mortgage borrowings and net payable / (receivable) for unsettled investment securities, divided by the sum of our total stockholders' equity adjusted to exclude goodwill. Our tangible net book value "at risk" leverage ratio was 7.2x and 7.0x as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. The following table includes a summary of our mortgage borrowings outstanding as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 (dollars in millions). For additional details of our mortgage borrowings refer to Notes 2, 4 and 5 to our Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-Q.

 1. Includes Agency RMBS, CRT and non-Agency MBS repurchase agreements. E xcludes U.S. Treasury repurchase agreements totaling 2.6 billion and 1.5 billion as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. 
 2. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, 47 and 43 , respectively, of our total repurchase agreements, including 49 and 45 or our investment securities repurchase agreements, respectively, were funded through the Fixed Income Clearing Corporation's GCF Repo service. 
 Our primary financing sources are collateralized borrowings structured as repurchase agreements. We enter into repurchase agreements, or "repo," through bi-lateral arrangements with financial institutions and independent dealers. We also enter into third-party repurchase agreements through our wholly-owned registered broker-dealer subsidiary, Bethesda Securities, LLC, such as tri-party repo offered through the FICC's GCF Repo service. We manage our repurchase agreement funding position through a variety of methods, including diversification of counterparties, maintaining a suitable maturity profile and utilization of interest rate hedging strategies. We also use TBA dollar roll transactions as a means of synthetically financing Agency RMBS. 
 The terms and conditions of our repurchase agreements are determined on a transaction-by-transaction basis when each such borrowing is initiated or renewed and, in the case of GCF Repo, by the prevailing margin requirements calculated by the FICC, which acts as the central counterparty. The amount borrowed is generally equal to the fair value of the securities pledged, as determined by the lending counterparty, less an assessed discount, referred to as a "haircut," that reflects the underlying risk of the specific collateral and protects the counterparty against a change in its value. Interest rates are generally fixed based on prevailing rates corresponding to the term of the borrowing. None of our repo counterparties are obligated to renew or otherwise enter into new borrowings at the conclusion of our existing borrowings. 
 The use of TBA dollar roll transactions increases our funding diversification, expands our available pool of assets, and increases our overall liquidity position, as TBA contracts typically have lower implied haircuts relative to Agency RMBS pools funded with repo financing. TBA dollar roll transactions may also have a lower implied cost of funds than comparable repo funded transactions (referred to as "dollar roll specialness") offering incremental return potential. However, if it were to become uneconomical to roll our TBA contracts into future months it may be necessary to take physical delivery of the underlying securities and fund those assets with cash or other financing sources, which could reduce our liquidity position. 
 41 

Collateral Requirements and Unencumbered Assets 
 Amounts available to be borrowed under our repurchase agreements are dependent upon prevailing interest rates, the lender s "haircut" requirements and collateral value. Each of these elements may fluctuate with changes in interest rates, credit quality and liquidity conditions within the financial markets. To help manage the adverse impact of interest rate changes on our borrowings, we utilize an interest rate risk management strategy involving the use of derivative financial instruments. In particular, we attempt to mitigate the risk of the cost of our short-term funding liabilities increasing at a faster rate than the earnings of our long-term fixed rate assets during a period of rising interest rates. 
 The collateral requirements, or haircut levels, under our repo agreements are typically determined on an individual transaction basis or by the prevailing requirements established by the FICC for GCF tri-party repo. Consequently, haircut levels and minimum margin requirements can change over time and may increase during periods of elevated market volatility. If the fair value of our collateral declines, our counterparties will typically require that we post additional collateral to re-establish the agreed-upon collateral levels, referred to as "margin calls." Similarly, if the estimated fair value of our investment securities increases, we may request that counterparties release collateral back to us. Our counterparties typically have the sole discretion to determine the value of pledged collateral but are required to act in good faith in making determinations of value. Our agreements generally provide that in the event of a margin call, collateral must be posted on the same business day, subject to notice requirements. As of September 30, 2024, we had met all our margin requirements. 
 The value of Agency RMBS collateral is impacted by market factors and is reduced by monthly principal pay-downs on the underlying mortgage pools. Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac publish monthly security pay-down factors for their mortgage pools on the fifth day after month-end, but do not remit payment to security holders until generally the 25th day after month-end. Bi-lateral repo counterparties assess margin to account for the reduction in value of Agency collateral when factors are released. The FICC assesses margin on the last day of each month, prior to the factor release date, based on its internally projected pay-down rates (referred to as the "blackout period exposure adjustment" or "blackout margin"). On the factor release date, the blackout margin is released and collateralization requirements are adjusted to actual factor data. Due to the timing difference between associated margin calls and our receipt of principal pay-downs, our liquidity is temporarily reduced each month for principal repayments. We attempt to manage the liquidity risk associated with principal pay-downs by monitoring conditions impacting prepayment rates and through asset selection. As of September 30, 2024, approximately 6 of our investment portfolio consisted of TBA securities, which are not subject to monthly principal pay-downs. The remainder of our portfolio primarily consisted of Agency RMBS, which had an average one-year CPR forecast of 14 as of September 30, 2024. 
 Collateral requirements under our derivative agreements are subject to our counterparties' assessment of their maximum risk of loss associated with the derivative instrument, referred to as the initial or minimum margin requirement, and may be adjusted based on changes in market volatility and other factors. We are also subject to daily variation margin requirements based on changes in the value of the derivative instrument and/or collateral pledged. Daily variation margin requirements also entitle us to receive collateral if the value of amounts owed to us under the derivative agreement exceeds the minimum margin requirement. The collateral requirements under our TBA contracts are governed by the Mortgage-Backed Securities Division ("MBSD") of the FICC. Collateral levels for interest rate derivative agreements are typically governed by the central clearing exchange and the associated futures commission merchants ("FCMs"), which may establish margin levels in excess of the clearing exchange. Collateral levels for interest rate derivative agreements not subject to central clearing are established by the counterparty financial institution. 
 Haircut levels and minimum margin requirements imposed by our counterparties reduce the amount of our unencumbered assets and limit the amount we can borrow against our investment securities. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, haircuts on our repo funding arrangements remained stable. As of September 30, 2024, the weighted average haircut on our repurchase agreements was approximately 2.9 of the value of our collateral, compared to 3.1 as of December 31, 2023. 
 To mitigate the risk of margins calls, we seek to maintain excess liquidity by holding unencumbered liquid assets that can be used to satisfy collateral requirements, collateralize additional borrowings or sold for cash. As of September 30, 2024, our unencumbered assets totaled approximately 6.3 billion, or 69 of tangible equity, consisting of 6.2 billion of cash and unencumbered Agency RMBS and 0.1 billion of unencumbered credit assets. This compares to 5.2 billion of unencumbered assets, or 67 of tangible equity, as of December 31, 2023, consisting of 5.1 billion of cash and unencumbered Agency RMBS and 0.1 billion of unencumbered credit assets. 
 Counterparty Risk 
 Collateral requirements imposed by counterparties subject us to the risk that the counterparty does not return pledged assets to us as and when required. We attempt to manage this risk by monitoring our collateral positions and limiting our counterparties to registered clearinghouses and major financial institutions with acceptable credit ratings. We also diversify our funding across multiple counterparties and by region. 
 42 

As of September 30, 2024, our maximum amount at risk (or the excess/shortfall of the value of collateral pledged/received over our repurchase agreement liabilities/reverse repurchase agreement receivables) with any of our repurchase agreement counterparties, excluding the FICC, was less than 2 of our tangible stockholders' equity, with our top five repo counterparties, excluding the FICC, representing 5 of our tangible stockholders' equity. As of September 30, 2024, 7 of our tangible stockholder's equity was at risk with the FICC. Excluding central clearing exchanges, as of September 30, 2024, our amount at risk with any counterparty to our derivative agreements was less than 1 of our stockholders' equity. 
 Asset Sales 
 Agency RMBS securities are among the most liquid fixed income securities, and the TBA market is the second most liquid market (after the U.S. Treasury market). Although market conditions fluctuate, the vitality of these markets enables us to sell assets under most conditions to generate liquidity through direct sales or delivery into TBA contracts, subject to "good delivery" provisions promulgated by the Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association ("SIFMA"). Under certain market conditions, however, we may be unable to realize the full carrying value of our securities. We attempt to manage this risk by maintaining at least a minimum level of securities that trade at or near TBA values that in our estimation enhances our portfolio liquidity across a wide range of market conditions. Please refer to Trends and Recent Market Impacts of this Management Discussion and Analysis for further information regarding Agency RMBS and TBA market conditions. 
 Capital Markets 
 The equity capital markets serve as a source of capital to grow our business and to meet potential liquidity needs of our business. The availability of equity capital is dependent on market conditions and investor demand for our common and preferred stock. We will typically not issue common stock at times when we believe the capital raised will not be accretive to our tangible net book value or earnings, and we will typically not issue preferred equity when its cost exceeds acceptable hurdle rates of return on our equity. We may also be unable to raise additional equity capital at suitable times or on favorable terms. Furthermore, when the trading price of our common stock is less than our then-current estimate of our tangible net book value per common share, among other conditions, we may repurchase shares of our common stock pursuant to the stock repurchase plan authorized by our Board of Directors, which as of the end of the third quarter had 1 billion in remaining capacity and was set to expire on December 31, 2024. Please refer to Notes 9 and 10 of our Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-Q for further details regarding our recent equity capital transactions and additional information about amendments to our At-the-Market Offering Program and the reauthorization of our stock repurchase plan through December 31, 2026. 
 OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS 
 As of September 30, 2024, we did not maintain relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships, such as entities often referred to as structured finance, or special purpose or variable interest entities, established to facilitate off-balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes. Additionally, as of September 30, 2024, we had not guaranteed obligations of unconsolidated entities or entered into a commitment or intent to provide funding to such entities.

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk 
 Market risk is the exposure to loss resulting from changes in market factors such as interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates, commodity prices and equity prices. The primary market risks that we are exposed to are interest rate, prepayment, spread, liquidity, extension and credit risks. 
 Interest Rate Risk 
 We are subject to interest rate risk in connection with the fixed income nature of our assets and the short-term, variable rate nature of our financing obligations. Our operating results depend in large part on differences between the income earned on our assets and our cost of borrowing and hedging activities. The costs associated with our borrowings are generally based on prevailing market interest rates. During a period of rising interest rates, our borrowing costs generally will increase while the yields earned on our existing portfolio of leveraged fixed-rate assets will largely remain static. This can result in a decline in our net interest spread. Changes in the level of interest rates can also affect the rate of mortgage prepayments and the value of our assets. 
 Interest rates are highly sensitive to many factors, including fiscal and monetary policies and domestic and international economic and political considerations, as well as other factors beyond our control. Subject to maintaining our qualification as a REIT, we engage in a variety of interest rate management techniques to mitigate the influence of interest rate changes on our net interest income and fluctuations of our tangible net book value. The principal instruments that we use to hedge our interest rate risk are interest rate swaps, swaptions, U.S. Treasury securities and U.S. Treasury futures contracts. Our hedging techniques are highly complex and are partly based on assumed levels of prepayments of our assets. If prepayments are slower or faster than assumed, the maturity of our investments will also differ from our expectations, which could reduce the effectiveness of our hedging strategies and may cause losses on such transactions and adversely affect our cash flow. 
 The severity of potential declines in our tangible net book value due to fluctuations in interest rates would depend on our asset, liability, and hedge composition at the time, as well as the magnitude and duration of the interest rate change. Primary measures of an instrument's price sensitivity to interest rate fluctuations are its duration and convexity. Duration measures the 
 44 

estimated percentage change in market value of an instrument that would be caused by a parallel change in short and long-term interest rates. The duration of our assets will vary with changes in interest rates and tends to increase when interest rates rise and decrease when interest rates fall. This "negative convexity" generally increases the interest rate exposure of our investment portfolio in excess of what is measured by duration alone. 
 We estimate the duration and convexity of our assets using a third-party risk management system and market data. We review the estimates for reasonableness, giving consideration to any unique characteristics of our securities, market conditions and other factors likely to impact these estimates, and based on our judgement we may make adjustments to the third-party estimates. Our estimated duration gap, which is a measure of the difference between the interest rate sensitivity of our assets and our liabilities, inclusive of interest rate hedges, was 0.2 years as of September 30, 2024, compared to -0.5 years as of December 31, 2023. 
 The table below quantifies the estimated changes in the fair value of our investment portfolio (including derivatives and other securities used for hedging purposes) and in our tangible net book value per common share as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 should interest rates go up or down by 25, 50 and 75 basis points, assuming instantaneous parallel shifts in the yield curve and including the impact of both duration and convexity. All values in the table below are measured as percentage changes from the base interest rate scenario. The base interest rate scenario assumes interest rates and prepayment projections as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. 
 To the extent that these estimates or other assumptions do not hold true, which may be more likely during periods of elevated market volatility, actual results could differ materially from our projections. Moreover, if different models were employed in the analysis, materially different projections could result. Lastly, while the table below reflects the estimated impact of interest rate changes on a static portfolio, we actively manage our portfolio, and we continuously adjust the size and composition of our asset and hedge portfolio.

 1. Derived from models that are dependent on inputs and assumptions, assumes there are no changes in mortgage spreads and assumes a static portfolio. Actual results could differ materially from these estimates. 
 2. Includes the effect of derivatives and other securities used for hedging purposes. Interest rates are assumed to be floored at 0 in down rate scenarios. 
 Prepayment Risk and Extension Risk 
 Prepayment risk is the risk that our assets will be repaid at a faster rate than anticipated. Interest rates and numerous other factors affect the rate of prepayments, such as housing prices, general economic conditions, loan age, size and loan-to-value ratios, and GSE buyouts of delinquent loans underlying our securities. Generally, declining mortgage rates increase the rate of prepayments, while rising rates have the opposite effect. 
 If our assets prepay at a faster rate than anticipated, we may be unable to reinvest the repayments at acceptable yields. If the proceeds are reinvested at lower yields than our existing assets, our net interest income would be negatively impacted. We also amortize or accrete premiums and discounts we pay or receive at purchase relative to the stated principal of our assets into interest income over their projected lives using the effective interest method. If the actual and estimated future prepayment experience differs from our prior estimates, we are required to record an adjustment to interest income for the impact of the cumulative difference in the effective yield. 
 Extension risk is the risk that our assets will be repaid at a slower rate than anticipated and generally increases when interest rates rise. In a rising or higher interest rate environment, we may be required to finance our investments at potentially higher costs without the ability to reinvest principal into higher yielding securities as a result of borrowers prepaying their 
 45 

mortgages at a slower pace than originally anticipated, adversely impacting our net interest spread, and thus our net interest income. 
 As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, our investment securities (excluding TBAs) had a weighted average projected CPR of 13.2 and 11.4 , respectively, and a weighted average yield of 4.68 and 4.41 , respectively. The table below presents estimated weighted average projected CPRs and yields for our investment securities should interest rates go up or down instantaneously by 25, 50 and 75 basis points. Estimated yields exclude the impact of retroactive "catch-up" premium amortization adjustments for prior periods due to changes in the projected CPR assumption.

 2. Asset yield based on historical cost basis and does not include the impact of retroactive "catch-up" premium amortization adjustments due to changes in projected CPR. 
 Spread Risk 
 Spread risk is the risk that the market spread between the yield on our assets and the yield on benchmark interest rates linked to our interest rate hedges, such as U.S. Treasury rates and interest rate swap rates, may vary. As a levered investor in mortgage-backed securities, spread risk is an inherent component of our investment strategy. Therefore, although we use hedging instruments to attempt to protect against moves in interest rates, our hedges are generally not designed to protect against spread risk, and our tangible net book value could decline if spreads widen. 
 Fluctuations in mortgage spreads can occur due to a variety of factors, including changes in interest rates, prepayment expectations, actual or anticipated monetary policy actions by the U.S. and foreign central banks, liquidity conditions, required rates of returns on different assets and other market supply and demand factors. The table below quantifies the estimated changes in the fair value of our assets, net of hedges, and our tangible net book value per common share as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 should spreads widen or tighten by 10, 25 and 50 basis points. The estimated impact of changes in spreads is in addition to our interest rate shock sensitivity included in the interest rate shock table above. The table below assumes a spread duration of 4.6 and 4.7 years as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively, based on interest rates and prices as of such dates; however, our portfolio's sensitivity to mortgage spread changes will vary with changes in interest rates and in the size and composition of our portfolio. Therefore, actual results could differ materially from our estimates.

________________________________ 
 1. Spread sensitivity is derived from models that are dependent on inputs and assumptions, assumes there are no changes in interest rates and assumes a static portfolio. Actual results could differ materially from these estimates. 
 2. Includes the effect of derivatives and other securities used for hedging purposes. 
 Liquidity Risk 
 Our liquidity risk principally arises from financing long-term fixed rate assets with shorter-term variable rate borrowings. Future borrowings are dependent upon the willingness of lenders to finance our investments, lender collateral requirements and the lenders determination of the fair value of the securities pledged as collateral, which fluctuates with changes in interest rates and liquidity conditions within the commercial banking and mortgage finance industries. 
 As of September 30, 2024, we believe that we have sufficient liquidity and capital resources available to execute our business strategy (see Liquidity and Capital Resources in this Form 10-Q for additional details). However, should the value of our collateral or the value of our derivative instruments suddenly decrease, or margin requirements increase, we may be required to post additional collateral for these arrangements, causing an adverse change in our liquidity position. Furthermore, there is no assurance that we will always be able to renew (or roll) our short-term funding liabilities. In addition, our counterparties have the option to increase our haircuts (margin requirements) on the assets we pledge against our funding liabilities, thereby reducing the amount that can be borrowed against an asset even if they agree to renew or roll our funding liabilities. Significantly higher haircuts can reduce our ability to leverage our portfolio or may even force us to sell assets, especially if correlated with asset price declines or faster prepayment rates on our assets. 
 Credit Risk 
 Our credit sensitive investments, such as CRT and non-Agency securities, expose us to the risk of nonpayment of principal, interest or other remuneration we are contractually entitled to. We are also exposed to credit risk in the event our repurchase agreement counterparties default on their obligations to resell the underlying collateral back to us at the end of the repo term or in the event our derivative counterparties do not perform under the terms of our derivative agreements. 
 We accept credit exposure related to our credit sensitive assets at levels we deem prudent within the context of our overall investment strategy. We attempt to manage this risk through careful asset selection, pre-acquisition due diligence, post-acquisition performance monitoring, and the sale of assets where we identify negative credit trends. We may also manage credit risk with credit default swaps or other financial derivatives that we believe are appropriate. Additionally, we may vary the mix of our interest rate and credit sensitive assets or our duration gap to adjust our credit exposure and/or improve the return profile of our assets, such as when we believe credit performance is inversely correlated with changes in interest rates. Our credit risk related to derivative and repurchase agreement transactions is largely mitigated by limiting our counterparties to major financial institutions with acceptable credit ratings or to registered central clearinghouses and monitoring concentration levels with any one counterparty. We also continuously monitor and adjust the amount of collateral pledged based on changes in market value. However, our efforts to manage credit risk may be unsuccessful and we could suffer losses as a result. Excluding central clearing exchanges, as of September 30, 2024, our maximum amount at risk with any counterparty related to our repurchase agreements and derivative agreements was less than 2 and less than 1 , respectively, of tangible stockholders' equity. 

Item 4. Controls and Procedures 
 We maintain disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our Exchange Act reports is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC's rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure based on the definition of "disclosure controls and procedures" as promulgated under the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations thereunder. In designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, management recognized that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives, and management necessarily was required to apply its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures. 
 We, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of September 30, 2024. Based on the foregoing, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective. 
 Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 There have been no changes in our "internal control over financial reporting" (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) of the Exchange Act) that occurred during the last fiscal quarter that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
