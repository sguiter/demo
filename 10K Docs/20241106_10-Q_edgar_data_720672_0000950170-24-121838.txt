Financial Instruments Sold, But Not Yet Purchased Financial instruments sold, but not purchased, recorded at fair value based on quoted prices in active markets and other observable market data include highly liquid instruments with quoted prices, such as U.S. government securities and corporate equity securities listed in active markets, which are reported as Level 1. If quoted prices are not available, fair values are obtained from pricing services, broker quotes, or other model-based valuation techniques with observable inputs, such as the present value of estimated cash flows, and reported as Level 2. The nature of these financial instruments include instruments for which quoted prices are available but traded less frequently, instruments whose fair value has been derived using a model where inputs to the model are directly observable in the market, or can be derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data, and instruments that are fair valued using other financial instruments, the parameters of which can be directly observed. Level 2 financial instruments include agency mortgage-backed securities not actively traded, fixed income securities, and U.S. government agency securities, sovereign debt, state and municipal securities, and asset-backed securities, included in other in the table below. We have identified Level 3 financial instruments to include syndicated loans, included in other in the table below. Level 3 financial instruments have little to no pricing observability as of the report date. These financial instruments do not have active two-way markets and are measured using management s best estimate of fair value, where the inputs into the determination of fair value require significant management judgment or estimation. Derivatives Derivatives are valued using quoted market prices for identical instruments when available or observable inputs from forward and futures yield curves. The valuation models used require market observable inputs, including contractual terms, market prices, yield curves, credit curves, and measures of volatility. We have classified our derivatives as Level 2. The counterparties to most of our company s derivative transactions represent regulated banks, bank holding companies, and derivative clearing houses. Management has determined that the counterparty credit risk associated with its derivative transactions is not significant. Accordingly, the recorded fair values for these transactions have not been adjusted to reflect counterparty credit risk.

The results included in the tables above are only a component of the overall investment strategies of our company. The tables above do not present Level 1 or Level 2 valued assets or liabilities. The changes in unrealized gains/(losses) recorded in earnings for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, relating to Level 3 assets still held at September 30, 2024, were immaterial. The fair value of certain Level 3 assets was determined using various methodologies, as appropriate, including third-party pricing vendors and broker quotes. These inputs are evaluated for reasonableness through various procedures, including due diligence reviews of third-party pricing vendors, variance analyses, consideration of current market environment, and other analytical procedures. The fair value for our auction rate securities was determined using an income approach based on an internally developed discounted cash flow model. The discounted cash flow model utilizes two significant unobservable inputs: discount rate and workout period. Significant increases in any of these inputs in isolation would result in a significantly lower fair value. On an ongoing basis, management verifies the fair value by reviewing the appropriateness of the discounted cash flow model and its significant inputs.

The following, as supplemented by the discussion above, describes the valuation techniques used in estimating the fair value of our financial instruments as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. Financial Assets Securities Purchased Under Agreements to Resell Securities purchased under agreements to resell are collateralized financing transactions that are recorded at their contractual amounts plus accrued interest. The carrying values at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 approximate fair value due to their short-term nature. Held-to-Maturity Securities Securities held to maturity are recorded at amortized cost based on our company s positive intent and ability to hold these securities to maturity. Securities held to maturity include asset-backed securities, consisting of collateralized loan obligation securities and student loan ARS. The estimated fair value, included in the above table, is determined using several factors; however, primary weight is given to discounted cash flow modeling techniques that incorporated an estimated discount rate based upon recent observable debt security issuances with similar characteristics. Bank Loans The fair values of mortgage loans and commercial loans were estimated using a discounted cash flow method, a form of the income approach. Discount rates were determined considering rates at which similar portfolios of loans, with similar remaining maturities, would be made and considering liquidity spreads applicable to each loan portfolio based on the secondary market. Loans Held for Sale Loans held for sale consist of fixed-rate and adjustable-rate residential real estate mortgage loans intended for sale. Loans held for sale are stated at lower of cost or market value. Market value is determined based on prevailing market prices for loans with similar characteristics or on sale contract prices. Financial Liabilities Securities Sold Under Agreements to Repurchase Securities sold under agreements to repurchase are collateralized financing transactions that are recorded at their contractual amounts plus accrued interest. The carrying values at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 approximate fair value due to the short-term nature. Bank Deposits The fair value of interest-bearing deposits, including certificates of deposits, demand deposits, savings, and checking accounts, was calculated by discounting the future cash flows using discount rates based on the replacement cost of funding of similar structures and terms. Senior Notes The fair value of our senior notes is estimated based upon quoted market prices.

 At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, financial instruments owned in the amount of million and million, respectively, were pledged as collateral for our repurchase agreements and short-term borrowings. Our financial instruments owned are presented on a trade-date basis in the consolidated statements of financial condition. Financial instruments sold, but not yet purchased, represent obligations of our company to deliver the specified security at the contracted price, thereby creating a liability to purchase the security in the market at prevailing prices in future periods. We are obligated to acquire the securities sold short at prevailing market prices in future periods, which may exceed the amount reflected in the consolidated statements of financial condition.

Credit quality indicators As of September 30, 2024, bank loans were primarily extended to non-investment grade borrowers. Substantially all of these loans align with the U.S. Federal bank regulatory agencies definition of Pass. Loans meet the definition of Pass when they are performing and do not demonstrate adverse characteristics that are likely to result in a credit loss. A loan is determined to be impaired when principal or interest becomes 90 days past due or when collection becomes uncertain. At the time a loan is determined to be impaired, the accrual of interest and amortization of deferred loan origination fees is discontinued nonaccrual status ), and any accrued and unpaid interest income is reversed. We closely monitor economic conditions and loan performance trends to manage and evaluate our exposure to credit risk. Trends in delinquency ratios are an indicator, among other considerations, of credit risk within our loan portfolio. The level of nonperforming assets represents another indicator of the potential for future credit losses. Accordingly, key metrics we track and use in evaluating the credit quality of our loan portfolio include delinquency and nonperforming asset rates, as well as charge-off rates and our internal risk ratings of the loan portfolio. In general, we are a secured lender. At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, and of our loan portfolio was collateralized, respectively. Collateral is required in accordance with the normal credit evaluation process based upon the creditworthiness of the customer and the credit risk associated with the particular transaction. The Company uses the following definitions for risk ratings: Pass. A credit exposure rated pass has a continued expectation of timely repayment, all obligations of the borrower are current, and the obligor complies with material terms and conditions of the lending agreement. Special Mention. Extensions of credit that have potential weakness that deserve management s close attention, and if left uncorrected may, at some future date, result in the deterioration of the repayment prospects or collateral position. Substandard. Obligor has a well-defined weakness that jeopardizes the repayment of the debt and has a high probability of payment default with the distinct possibility that the Company will sustain some loss if noted deficiencies are not corrected. Doubtful. Inherent weakness in the exposure makes the collection or repayment in full, based on existing facts, conditions and circumstances, highly improbable, and the amount of loss is uncertain. Substandard loans are regularly reviewed for impairment. Doubtful loans are considered impaired. When a loan is impaired the impairment is measured based on the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan s effective interest rate, or as a practical expedient, the observable market price of the loan or the fair value of the collateral if the loan is collateral dependent.

The adjustments to goodwill and intangible assets during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 are primarily attributable to the acquisition of Finance 500, Inc. Finance 500 and CB Resource, Inc. CBR ). On August 1, 2024, the Company acquired Finance 500 and CBR (collectively, the acquired business ), which operate as strategic partners under common ownership. Finance 500 is a brokerage and investment services provider focused on underwriting FDIC-insured Certificates of Deposits and fixed income securities trading. CBR integrates ERM, strategic and capital plan solutions, and industry analytics through its fully integrated tech-enabled platform. Consideration for this acquisition consisted of cash from operations. The acquisition was accounted for under the acquisition method of accounting in accordance with ASC 805, Business Combinations. Accordingly, goodwill was measured as the excess of the acquisition-date fair value of the consideration transferred over the amount of acquisition-date identifiable assets acquired net of assumed liabilities. We recorded million of goodwill and intangible assets in the consolidated statement of financial condition, which has been allocated to our company s Institutional Group segment. The allocation of the purchase price of the acquired business is preliminary and will be finalized upon completion of the analysis of the fair values of the net assets of the acquired business as of the acquisition date and the identified intangible assets. The final goodwill recorded on the consolidated statement of financial condition may differ from that reflected herein as a result of future measurement period adjustments and the recording of identified intangible assets. The goodwill represents the value expected from the synergies created through the operational enhancement benefits that will result from the integration of the acquired business, its employees, and customer base. Amortizable intangible assets consist of acquired customer relationships, trade names, acquired technology, non-compete agreements, investment banking backlog, and core deposits that are amortized over their contractual or determined useful lives.

The availability of our uncommitted lines is subject to approval by the individual banks each time an advance is requested and may be denied. Our peak daily borrowing on our uncommitted secured lines was million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. There are compensating balance requirements under these arrangements. Any borrowings on secured lines of credit are generally utilized to finance certain fixed income securities. At September 30, 2024, we had outstanding balances on our uncommitted secured lines of credit. The Federal Home Loan advances are floating-rate advances. The weighted average interest rates on these advances during nine months ended September 30, 2024 was . The advances are secured by Stifel Bancorp s residential mortgage loan portfolio and investment portfolio. The interest rates reset on a daily basis. Stifel Bancorp has the option to prepay these advances without penalty on the interest reset date. At September 30, 2024, there were Federal Home Loan advances. On September 27, 2023, the Company and Stifel (the Borrowers entered into an unsecured credit agreement with a syndicate of lenders led by Bank of America, N.A., as administrative agent (the Credit Agreement ). Concurrently with, and conditional upon, the effectiveness of the Credit Agreement, all of the commitments under the Borrowers existing million unsecured revolving credit facility agreement were terminated. The Credit Agreement has a maturity date of , and provides for a committed unsecured borrowing facility for maximum aggregate borrowings of up to million, depending on the amount of outstanding borrowings of the Borrowers from time to time during the duration of the Credit Agreement. The interest rates on borrowings under the Credit Agreement are variable and based on the Secured Overnight Financing Rate. The Borrowers can draw upon this line as long as certain restrictive covenants are maintained. Under the Credit Agreement, the Borrowers are required to maintain compliance with a minimum consolidated tangible net worth covenant, as defined, and a maximum consolidated total capitalization ratio covenant, as defined. In addition, Stifel is required to maintain compliance with a minimum regulatory excess net capital percentage covenant, as defined, and our bank subsidiaries are required to maintain their status as well-capitalized, as defined. Upon the occurrence and during the continuation of an event of default, the Company s obligations under the Credit Agreement may be accelerated and the lending commitments thereunder terminated. The Credit Agreement contains customary events of default, including, without limitation, payment defaults, breaches of representations and warranties, covenant defaults, cross-defaults to similar obligations, certain events of bankruptcy and insolvency, change of control, and judgment defaults. At September 30, 2024, we had advances on the Credit Facility and were in compliance with all covenants and currently do not expect any covenant violations.

Total revenues 

Revenue from contracts with customers is recognized when, or as, we satisfy our performance obligations by transferring the promised services to the customers. A service is transferred to a customer when, or as, the customer obtains control of that service. A performance obligation may be satisfied over time or at a point in time. Revenue from a performance obligation satisfied over time is recognized by measuring our progress in satisfying the performance obligation in a manner that depicts the transfer of the services to the customer. Revenue from a performance obligation satisfied at a point in time is recognized at the point in time that we determine the customer obtains control over the promised service. The amount of revenue recognized reflects the consideration we expect to be entitled to in exchange for those promised services (i.e., the transaction price ). In determining the transaction price, we consider multiple factors, including the effects of variable consideration. Variable consideration is included in the transaction price only to the extent it is probable that a significant reversal in the amount of cumulative revenue recognized will not occur when the uncertainties with respect to the amount are resolved. In determining when to include variable consideration in the transaction price, we consider the range of possible outcomes, the predictive value of our past experiences, the time period of when uncertainties expect to be resolved and the amount of consideration that is susceptible to factors outside of our influence, such as market volatility or the judgment and actions of third parties.

Contract Balances The timing of our revenue recognition may differ from the timing of payment by our customers. We record a receivable when revenue is recognized prior to payment and we have an unconditional right to payment. Alternatively, when payment precedes the provision of the related services, we record deferred revenue until the performance obligations are satisfied. We had receivables related to revenues from contracts with customers of million and million at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively, in other assets in the consolidated statements of financial condition. We had significant impairments related to these receivables during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. Our deferred revenue primarily relates to retainer fees received in investment banking advisory engagements where the performance obligation has not yet been satisfied. Deferred revenue at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 was million and million, respectively, and is included in accounts payable and accrued expenses in the consolidated statements of financial condition.

vesting period. Our stock-based compensation plans are administered by the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors Compensation Committee ), which has the authority to interpret the plans, determine to whom awards may be granted under the plans, and determine the terms of each award. According to the incentive stock plan, we are authorized to grant an additional million shares at September 30, 2024. Expense associated with our stock-based compensation, included in compensation and benefits expense in the consolidated statements of operations for our company s incentive stock award plan was million and million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and million and million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Expense associated with our debentures, included in compensation and benefits expense in the consolidated statements of operations was million and million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and million and million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Deferred Awards A restricted stock unit represents the right to receive a share of the Company s common stock at a designated time in the future without cash payment by the associate and is issued in lieu of cash incentive, principally for deferred compensation and employee retention plans. The restricted stock units vest on an annual basis over the next one to and are distributable, if vested, at future specified dates. Restricted stock awards are restricted as to sale or disposition. These restrictions lapse over the next one to . The Company grants Performance-based Restricted Stock Units PRSUs to certain of its executive officers. Under the terms of the grants, the number of PRSUs that will vest and convert to shares will be based on the Company s achievement of the pre-determined performance objectives during the performance period. The PRSUs will be measured over a performance period and vested over a period. Any resulting delivery of shares for PRSUs granted as part of compensation will occur after four years for of the earned award, and in the fifth year for the remaining of the earned award. The number of shares converted has the potential to range from to based on how the Company performs during the performance period. Compensation expense is amortized over the service period based on the fair value of the deferred award on the grant date. The Company s pre-determined performance objectives must be met for the awards to vest. Associates forfeit unvested deferred awards upon termination of employment with a corresponding reversal of compensation expense. Certain deferred awards may continue to vest under certain circumstances as described in the Plan. At September 30, 2024, the total number of restricted stock units, PRSUs, and restricted stock awards outstanding was million, of which million were unvested. At September 30, 2024, there was unrecognized compensation cost for deferred awards of approximately million, which is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of years. Deferred Compensation Plans The Plan is provided to certain revenue producers, officers, and key administrative associates, whereby a certain percentage of their incentive compensation is deferred as defined by the Plan into company stock units, restricted stock, and debentures. Participants may elect to defer a portion of their incentive compensation. Deferred awards generally vest over a one - to period and are distributable upon vesting or at future specified dates. Deferred compensation costs are amortized on a straight-line basis over the vesting period. Elective deferrals are vested. Additionally, the Plan allows Stifel financial advisors who achieve certain levels of production the ability to earn deferred awards. These financial advisors can earn 5-6 of their gross commissions that is contributed to their mandatory deferral. The mandatory deferral is split between company restricted stock units and debentures. They have the option to defer an additional of gross commissions into company stock units. In addition, certain revenue producers, upon joining the Company, may receive company stock units in lieu of transition cash payments. Deferred compensation related to these awards generally vests over a one - to period. Deferred compensation costs are amortized on a straight-line basis over the deferral period. Profit Sharing Plan Eligible U.S. associates of the Company who have met certain service requirements may participate in the Stifel Financial Corp. Profit Sharing 401(k) Plan (the 401(k) Plan ). Associates are permitted within limitations imposed by tax law to make pre-tax contributions

 billion and billion, respectively, and the fair value of the collateral that had been sold or repledged was million and million, respectively. We enter into interest rate derivative contracts to manage exposures that arise from business activities that result in the receipt or payment of future known and uncertain cash amounts, the value of which are determined by interest rates. Our derivative financial instruments are principally used to manage differences in the amount, timing, and duration of our known or expected cash payments related to certain variable-rate affiliated deposits. Interest rate swaps designated as cash flow hedges involve the receipt of variable-rate amounts from a counterparty in exchange for us making fixed-rate payments. Our interest rate hedging strategies may not work in all market environments and, as a result, may not be effective in mitigating interest rate risk. Derivatives notional contract amounts are not reflected as assets or liabilities in the consolidated statements of financial condition. Rather, the market or fair value of the derivative transactions are reported in the consolidated statements of financial condition as other assets or accounts payable and accrued expenses, as applicable. For a complete discussion of our activities related to derivative instruments, see Note 12 in the notes to consolidated financial statements. In the ordinary course of business, Stifel Bancorp has commitments to originate loans, standby letters of credit, and lines of credit. Commitments to originate loans are agreements to lend to a customer as long as there is no violation of any condition established by the contract. These commitments generally have fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses and may require payment of a fee. Since a portion of the commitments may expire without being drawn upon, the total commitment amounts do not necessarily represent future cash commitments. Each customer s creditworthiness is evaluated on a case-by-case basis. The amount of collateral obtained, if necessary, is based on the credit evaluation of the counterparty. Collateral held varies, but may include accounts receivable, inventory, property, plant and equipment, commercial real estate, and residential real estate. At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, Stifel Bancorp had outstanding commitments to originate loans aggregating million and million, respectively. The commitments extended over varying periods of time, with all commitments at September 30, 2024, scheduled to be disbursed in the following three months. Through Stifel Bancorp, in the normal course of business, we originate residential mortgage loans and sell them to investors. We may be required to repurchase mortgage loans that have been sold to investors in the event there are breaches of certain representations and warranties contained within the sales agreements. We may be required to repurchase mortgage loans that were sold to investors in the event that there was inadequate underwriting or fraud, or in the event that the loans become delinquent shortly after they are originated. We also may be required to indemnify certain purchasers and others against losses they incur in the event of breaches of representations and warranties and in various other circumstances, and the amount of such losses could exceed the repurchase amount of the related loans. Consequently, we may be exposed to credit risk associated with sold loans.

Lines of credit are agreements to lend to a customer as long as there is no violation of any condition established in the contract. Lines of credit generally have fixed expiration dates. Stifel Bancorp uses the same credit policies in granting lines of credit as it does for on-balance sheet instruments. At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, Stifel Bancorp had granted unused lines of credit to commercial and consumer borrowers aggregating billion and billion, respectively. We are required to evaluate our loan portfolio for any expected losses with recognition of an allowance for credit losses, when applicable. At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the expected credit losses for unfunded lending commitments was million and million, respectively.

of the equity of Turbine. During the second quarter of 2024, the Company purchased additional membership interests in Stifel Aviation Finance II, LLC SAF II ). The purchase of the additional membership interests gave the Company a controlling financial interest in SAF II. The Company has determined the interest it holds in these VIEs require consolidation in its financial statements, as it is deemed to be the primary beneficiary. The assets acquired and liabilities assumed were recorded at fair value as of the respective consolidation dates. At September 30, 2024, the assets primarily consist of aircraft engines that are under operating leases, included in other assets in the accompanying consolidated statements of financial condition. See Note 17 for additional information. The liabilities primarily consist of debt, included in accounts payable and accrued expenses in the accompanying consolidated statements of financial condition. 

Debt and Equity Investments The Company s investment in and additional capital commitments to these investment vehicles are considered variable interests. The Company s additional capital commitments are subject to call and are limited to the amount committed. These investment vehicles have net assets, primarily consisting of investments, aircraft engine-related assets, and debt. We have concluded that we are not the primary beneficiary of these VIEs, and therefore, we do not consolidate these entities. Our maximum exposure to loss is limited to the total of our carrying value. 
 Partnership Interests We have formed several non-consolidated investment funds with third-party investors that are typically organized as limited liability companies LLCs or limited partnerships. These investment vehicles have assets primarily consisting of private and public equity investments. For those funds where we act as the general partner, our company s economic interest is generally limited to management fee arrangements as stipulated by the fund operating agreements. We have generally provided the third-party investors with rights to terminate the funds or to remove us as the general partner. We have concluded that we are not the primary beneficiary of these VIEs, and therefore, we do not consolidate these entities.

Results for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 
 For the three months ended September 30, 2024, net revenues increased 17.2 to 1.2 billion from 1.0 billion during the comparable period in 2023. Net income available to common shareholders increased 153.5 to 149.2 million, or 1.34 per diluted common share for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 58.8 million, or 0.52 per diluted common share during the comparable period in 2023. 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, net revenues increased 12.6 to 3.6 billion compared to 3.2 billion during the comparable period in 2023. Net income available to common shareholders increased 38.3 to 459.4 million, or 4.16 per diluted common share for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 332.1 million, or 2.91 per diluted common share during the comparable period in 2023. 
 Our revenue growth was primarily attributable to higher investment banking, asset management, and transactional revenues, partially offset by lower net interest income. 
 Economic and Market Conditions 
 We currently operate in a challenging and uncertain economic environment. Results in the businesses in which we operate are highly correlated to general economic conditions and, more specifically, to the direction of the U.S. equity and fixed-income markets. Market volatility, overall market conditions, interest rates, economic, political, and regulatory trends, and industry competition are among the factors which could affect us and which are unpredictable and beyond our control. These factors affect the financial decisions made by market participants who include investors and competitors, impacting their level of participation in the financial markets. In addition, in periods of reduced financial market activity, profitability is likely to be adversely affected because certain expenses remain relatively fixed, including salaries and related costs, as well as portions of communications costs and occupancy expenses. Accordingly, earnings for any period should not be considered representative of earnings to be expected for any other period. For more information on economic and market conditions, refer to Risk Factors in the 2023 Form 10-K. 
 Impact of Change in Short-term Interest Rates 
 After holding the target federal funds rate steady for nearly 14 months, the Federal Reserve voted to cut rates by one half percent at its September 2024 meeting as their attention turned to addressing employment data, given the progress made on reducing underlying inflation in recent months. Projections of the federal funds rate released by the Federal Reserve in September indicate that the Federal Reserve expects rate decreases through the end of 2024, with further reductions in the coming year. 
 Potential decreases to the federal funds rate may impact our interest-based revenues. While decreases in interest rates will lower fees the Company earns from FDIC insured deposits of clients through a program offered by the Company, such decreases may be offset to a degree if the cash sweep balances increase as clients find fewer higher-yielding alternatives to deploy these balances. Future rate decreases will also reduce the rates the Company charges on customer margin loans, which will have a negative impact on our earnings.

 Investment banking Investment banking revenues include: (i) capital-raising revenues representing fees earned from the underwriting of debt and equity securities, and (ii) advisory fees related to corporate debt and equity offerings, municipal debt offerings, merger and acquisitions, private placements and other investment banking advisory fees. 
 For the three months ended September 30, 2024, investment banking revenues increased 65.6 to 243.2 million from 146.9 million in the comparable period in 2023. 
 Capital-raising revenues increased 114.3 to 106.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 from 49.6 million in the comparable period in 2023. For the three months ended September 30, 2024, equity capital-raising revenues increased 141.7 to 54.6 million from 22.6 million in the comparable period in 2023 driven by higher volumes during the quarter. For the three months ended September 30, 2024, fixed income capital-raising revenues increased 91.4 to 51.7 million from 27.0 million in the comparable period in 2023 driven by higher bond issuances during the quarter. 
 Advisory revenues increased 40.7 to 136.9 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 from 97.3 million in the comparable period in 2023. The increase is primarily attributable to higher levels of completed advisory transactions during the quarter. 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, investment banking revenues increased 31.4 to 690.4 million from 525.6 million in the comparable period in 2023.

For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, fixed income capital-raising revenues increased 42.9 to 154.7 million from 108.3 million in the comparable period in 2023 driven by higher bond issuances during 2024. 
 Advisory revenues increased 15.3 to 387.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from 336.2 million in the comparable period in 2023. The increase is primarily attributable to higher levels of completed advisory transactions. 
 Asset management Asset management revenues are primarily generated by the investment advisory fees related to asset management services provided for individual and institutional investment portfolios, along with mutual funds. Investment advisory fees are earned on assets held in managed or non-discretionary asset-based programs. Fees from private client investment portfolios and institutional fees are typically based on asset values at the end of the prior period. Asset balances are impacted by both the performance of the market and levels of net new client assets. Rising markets have historically had a positive impact on investment advisory fee revenues as existing accounts increase in value, and individuals and institutions may commit incremental funds in rising markets. 
 For the three months ended September 30, 2024, asset management revenues increased 14.9 to 382.6 million from 333.1 million in the comparable period in 2023. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, asset management revenues increased 16.7 to 1.1 billion from 969.0 million in the comparable period in 2023. Please refer to Asset management in the Global Wealth Management segment discussion for information on the changes in asset management revenues. 
 Other income Other income primarily includes investment gains and losses, rental income, and loan originations fees. For the three months ended September 30, 2024, other income increased to 18.7 million from 0.5 million during the comparable period in 2023. The increase is primarily attributable to rental income generated from our aircraft engine leasing business, higher investment gains during the quarter, and an increase in loan origination fees. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, other income increased to 39.8 million from a loss of 0.9 million during the comparable period in 2023. The increase is primarily attributable to rental income generated from our aircraft engine leasing business, higher investment gains, and an increase in loan origination fees from the comparable period in 2023. The nine months ended September 30, 2023 was negatively impacted by losses on the sale of investments.

Please refer to the Distribution of Assets, Liabilities, and Shareholders Equity; Interest Rates and Interest Differential table included in Results of Operations Global Wealth Management for additional information on Stifel Bancorp s average balances and interest income and expense. 
 Net interest income Net interest income is the difference between interest earned on interest-earning assets and interest paid on funding sources. Net interest income is affected by changes in the volume and mix of these assets and liabilities, as well as by fluctuations in interest rates and portfolio management strategies. For the three months ended September 30, 2024, net interest income decreased 8.8 to 259.6 million from 284.7 million during the comparable period in 2023. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, net interest income decreased 12.6 to 762.6 million from 872.9 million during the comparable period in 2023. 
 For the three months ended September 30, 2024, interest revenue increased 1.1 to 510.8 million from 505.2 million in the comparable period in 2023, principally as a result of higher interest-earning assets. The average interest-earning assets of Stifel Bancorp 
 54 

increased to 30.0 billion during the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 29.9 billion during the comparable period in 2023 at average interest rates of 6.26 and 6.21 , respectively. 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, interest revenue increased 5.3 to 1.5 billion from 1.4 billion in the comparable period in 2023, principally as a result of higher interest rates and interest-earning assets. 
 For the three months ended September 30, 2024, interest expense increased 13.9 to 251.2 million from 220.5 million during the comparable period in 2023. The increase is primarily attributable to higher interest rates. The average interest-bearing liabilities of Stifel Bancorp increased to 27.6 billion during the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 27.2 billion during the comparable period in 2023 at average interest rates of 3.35 and 2.91 , respectively. 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, interest expense increased 32.9 to 753.2 million from 566.6 million in the comparable period in 2023. The increase is primarily attributable to higher interest rates and interest-bearing liabilities. The average interest-bearing liabilities of Stifel Bancorp increased to 27.4 billion during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 27.2 billion during the comparable period in 2023 at average interest rates of 3.33 and 2.49 , respectively.

Compensation and benefits Compensation and benefits expenses, which are the largest component of our expenses, include salaries, bonuses, transition pay, benefits, amortization of stock-based compensation, employment taxes and other employee-related costs. A significant portion of compensation expense is comprised of production-based variable compensation, including discretionary bonuses, which fluctuates in proportion to the level of business activity, increasing with higher revenues and operating profits. Other compensation costs, including base salaries, stock-based compensation amortization, and benefits, are more fixed in nature. 
 For the three months ended September 30, 2024, compensation and benefits expense increased 17.1 to 718.1 million from 613.3 million during the comparable period in 2023. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compensation and benefits expense increased 12.8 to 2.1 billion from 1.9 billion during the comparable period in 2023. The increase in compensation and benefits expenses is primarily attributable to increased variable compensation over the comparable periods in 2023. 
 Compensation and benefits expense as a percentage of net revenues was 58.6 and 58.8 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, compared to 58.7 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively. The increase is primarily attributable to higher compensable revenues. 
 Occupancy and equipment rental For the three months ended September 30, 2024, occupancy and equipment rental expense increased 6.2 to 89.6 million from 84.4 million during the comparable period in 2023. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, occupancy and equipment rental expense increased 6.8 to 268.2 million from 251.1 million during the comparable period in 2023. The increase is primarily attributable to higher data processing and occupancy costs associated with an increase in business activity over the comparable periods in 2023. 
 Communications and office supplies Communications expense includes costs for telecommunication and data communication, primarily for obtaining third-party market data information. For the three months ended September 30, 2024, communications and office supplies expense increased 5.7 to 48.9 million from 46.2 million during the comparable period in 2023. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, communications and office supplies expense increased 5.2 to 144.4 million from 137.3 million during the comparable period in 2023. The increase is primarily attributable to higher communication and quote expenses associated with the continued investments made in our business. 
 Commissions and floor brokerage For the three months ended September 30, 2024, commissions and floor brokerage expense increased 12.7 to 16.2 million from 14.4 million during the comparable period in 2023. The increase is primarily attributable to higher electronic communication network ECN trading costs, clearing expenses, and processing expenses. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, commissions and floor brokerage expense increased 8.0 to 46.4 million from 43.0 million during the 
 55 

comparable period in 2023. The increase is primarily attributable to higher clearing expenses, ECN trading costs, and processing expenses. 
 Provision for credit losses For the three months ended September 30, 2024, provision for credit losses decreased 47.1 to 5.3 million from 10.0 million during the comparable period in 2023. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, provision for credit losses decreased 40.6 to 13.5 million from 22.7 million during the comparable period in 2023. The decrease is primarily attributable to lower provisions in the real estate sector, partially offset by growth in the loan portfolio. 
 Other operating expenses Other operating expenses primarily include license and registration fees, litigation-related expenses, which consist of amounts we accrue and/or pay out related to legal and regulatory matters, travel and entertainment, promotional expenses and expenses for professional services. 
 For the three months ended September 30, 2024, other operating expenses decreased 22.3 to 129.9 million from 167.3 million during the comparable period in 2023. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, other operating expenses decreased 4.7 to 350.4 million from 367.6 million during the comparable period in 2023. 
 The decreases are primarily attributable to lower litigation-related expenses and FDIC-insurance expense, partially offset by higher investment banking transaction expenses, professional fees, advertising, and travel and conference-related expenses. During the third quarter of 2023, we recorded 67.0 million related to provisions for legal and regulatory matters. 
 Provision for income taxes For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, our provision for income taxes was 58.2 million and 174.9 million, representing an effective tax rate of 26.8 and 26.4 , respectively, compared to 41.3 million and 140.6 million for the comparable periods in 2023, representing an effective tax rate of 37.7 and 28.1 , respectively. The effective tax rate for the three months ended September 30, 2023 was negatively impacted by the non-deductibility of the aforementioned provision for legal and regulatory matters recorded during the quarter. 
 SEGMENT ANALYSIS 
 Our reportable segments include Global Wealth Management, Institutional Group, and Other. 
 Our Global Wealth Management segment consists of two businesses, the Private Client Group and Stifel Bancorp. The Private Client Group includes branch offices and independent contractor offices of our broker-dealer subsidiaries located throughout the United States. These branches provide securities brokerage services, including the sale of equities, mutual funds, fixed income products, and insurance, as well as offering banking products to their private clients through our bank subsidiaries, which provide residential, consumer, and commercial lending, as well as FDIC-insured deposit accounts to customers of our broker-dealer subsidiaries and to the general public. 
 The success of our Global Wealth Management segment is dependent upon the quality of our products, services, financial advisors, and support personnel, including our ability to attract, retain, and motivate a sufficient number of these associates. We face competition for qualified associates from major financial services companies, including other brokerage firms, insurance companies, banking institutions, and discount brokerage firms. Segment revenue growth, operating income, and segment pre-tax operating margin are used to evaluate and measure segment performance by our management team in deciding how to allocate resources and in assessing performance. 
 The Institutional Group segment includes institutional sales and trading. It provides securities brokerage, trading, and research services to institutions with an emphasis on the sale of equity and fixed income products. This segment also includes the management of and participation in underwritings for both corporate and public finance (exclusive of sales credits generated through the Private Client Group, which are included in the Global Wealth Management segment), merger and acquisition, and financial advisory services. 
 The success of our Institutional Group segment is dependent upon the quality of our personnel, the quality and selection of our investment products and services, pricing (such as execution pricing and fee levels), and reputation. Segment operating income and segment pre-tax operating margin are used to evaluate and measure segment performance by our management team in deciding how to allocate resources and in assessing performance. 
 The Other segment includes interest income from stock borrow activities, unallocated interest expense, interest income and gains and losses from investments held, amortization of stock-based awards, and all unallocated overhead cost associated with the execution of orders; processing of securities transactions; custody of client securities; receipt, identification, and delivery of funds and securities; compliance with regulatory and legal requirements; internal financial accounting and controls; and general administration and acquisition charges. 
 We evaluate the performance of our segments and allocate resources to them based on various factors, including prospects for growth, return on investment, and return on revenues.

For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, commission revenues increased 11.9 to 371.9 million from 332.3 million in the comparable period in 2023.

 Investment banking Investment banking, which represents sales credits for investment banking underwritings, increased 59.6 to 6.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 from 3.9 million during the comparable period in 2023. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, investment banking revenues increased 34.3 to 16.3 million from 12.1 million during the comparable period in 2023.

 Interest revenue For the three months ended September 30, 2024, interest revenue increased 0.8 to 484.2 million from 480.3 million in the comparable period in 2023.

 Other income For the three months ended September 30, 2024, other income increased 248.0 to 5.0 million from a loss of 3.4 million in the comparable period in 2023. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, other income increased 164.8 to 6.8 million from a loss of 10.5 million during the comparable period in 2023. The increases are primarily attributable to lower investment losses and an increase in loan origination fees. The nine months ended September 30, 2023 was negatively impacted by losses on the sale of investments. 
 Interest expense For the three months ended September 30, 2024, interest expense increased 15.4 to 243.3 million from 210.9 in the comparable period in 2023. The increase is primarily attributable to higher interest rates and interest-bearing liabilities. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, interest expense increased 32.8 to 721.5 million from 543.1 million during the comparable period in 2023. The increase is primarily attributable to higher interest rates and interest-bearing liabilities.

Increases and decreases in interest revenue and interest expense result from changes in average balances (volume) of interest-earning bank assets and liabilities, as well as changes in average interest rates. The effect of changes in volume is determined by multiplying the change in volume by the previous year s average yield/cost. Similarly, the effect of rate changes is calculated by multiplying the change in average yield/cost by the previous year s volume. Changes applicable to both volume and rate have been allocated proportionately. 
 Net interest income Net interest income is the difference between interest earned on interest-earning assets and interest paid on funding sources. Net interest income is affected by changes in the volume and mix of these assets and liabilities, as well as by fluctuations in interest rates and portfolio management strategies. Increases in short-term interest rates have had a positive impact on our results, in particular on our net interest income. 
 For the three months ended September 30, 2024, interest revenue of 469.1 million was generated from average interest-earning assets of 30.0 billion at an average interest rate of 6.26 .

For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compensation and benefits expense increased 12.3 to 1.2 billion from 1.1 billion during the comparable period in 2023.

For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, occupancy and equipment rental expense increased 6.4 to 130.6 million from 122.7 million during the comparable period in 2023.

For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, commissions and floor brokerage expense increased 4.3 to 19.9 million from 19.1 million during the comparable period in 2023. The increase is primarily attributable to higher processing expenses, partially offset by lower clearing expenses.

For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, provision for credit losses decreased 41.9 to 13.2 million from 22.7 million during the comparable period in 2023. The decrease is primarily attributable to lower provisions in the real estate sector, partially offset by growth in the loan portfolio. 
 Other operating expenses For the three months ended September 30, 2024, other operating expenses increased 36.8 to 50.4 million from 36.9 million during the comparable period in 2023. The increase is primarily attributable to increases in litigation-related expenses associated with a recent arbitration matter, advertising, professional fees, and subscriptions, partially offset by lower FDIC-insurance expense, bank service charges, and travel and entertainment expense. 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, other operating expenses increased 25.8 to 128.6 million from 102.2 million during the comparable period in 2023.

For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, non-interest expenses decreased 15.9 and 6.6 , to 152.0 million and 429.5 million, respectively. The decreases are primarily attributable to lower provisions for legal and regulatory matters, partially offset by an increase in variable compensation over the comparable periods in 2023 and the recording of severance costs during 2024 associated with workforce reductions in certain of our foreign subsidiaries. During the third quarter of 2023, we recorded 67.0 million related to provisions for legal and regulatory matters. 
 The expenses relating to the Company s acquisition strategy are primarily attributable to integration-related activities, signing bonuses, amortization of restricted stock awards, debentures, and promissory notes issued as retention, additional earn-out expense, and amortization of intangible assets acquired. These costs were directly related to acquisitions of certain businesses and are not representative of the costs of running the Company s ongoing business. 
 For the three months ended September 30, 2024, non-interest expenses related to our acquisition strategy, included in the numbers presented in the table above, increased 34.3 to 18.5 million from 13.8 million in 2023. 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, non-interest expenses related to our acquisition strategy, included in the numbers presented in the table above, increased 17.5 to 54.5 million from 46.3 million in 2023. 
 Analysis of Financial Condition 
 Our company s consolidated statements of financial condition consist primarily of cash and cash equivalents, receivables, financial instruments owned, bank loans, investments, goodwill, loans and advances to financial advisors, bank deposits, and payables. Total assets of 38.9 billion, were up 3.2 over December 31, 2023. Our broker-dealer subsidiary s gross assets and liabilities, including 
 67 

financial instruments owned, stock loan/borrow, receivables and payables from/to brokers, dealers, and clearing organizations and clients, fluctuate with our business levels and overall market conditions. 
 As of September 30, 2024, our liabilities were comprised primarily of deposits of 28.1 billion at Stifel Bancorp, payables to customers of 668.8 million at our broker-dealer subsidiaries, accounts payable and accrued expenses of 654.6 million, senior notes, net of debt issuance costs, of 616.4 million, and accrued employee compensation of 613.1 million. To meet our obligations to clients and operating needs, we had 12.7 billion of cash or assets readily convertible into cash at September 30, 2024. 
 Cash Flow 
 Cash and cash equivalents decreased 1.4 billion to 1.9 billion at September 30, 2024, from 3.4 billion at December 31, 2023. Operating activities used cash of 204.1 million. Investing activities used cash of 1.5 billion primarily as a result of purchases of securities in our investment portfolio and growth in our loan portfolio, partially offset by proceeds received from principal paydowns, maturities, and calls of securities in our investment portfolio. Financing activities provided cash of 166.8 million primarily due to an increase in bank deposits and securities sold under agreement to repurchase, partially offset by the repayment of the Company s 4.25 Senior Notes, which matured in the third quarter of 2024, dividends paid on our common and preferred stock, tax payments related to shares withheld for stock-based compensation, and repurchases of our common stock. 
 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 Liquidity and capital are essential to our business. The primary goal of our liquidity management activities is to ensure adequate funding and liquidity to conduct our business over a range of economic and market environments, including times of broader industry or market liquidity stress events, such as those which occurred in the banking industry during fiscal 2023. In times of market stress or uncertainty, we generally maintain higher levels of capital and liquidity, including increased cash levels at our bank subsidiaries, to ensure we have adequate funding to support our business and meet our clients needs. We seek to manage capital levels to support execution of our business strategy, provide financial strength to our subsidiaries, and maintain sustained access to the capital markets, while at the same time meeting our regulatory capital requirements, and conservative internal management targets. 
 Liquidity and capital resources are provided primarily through our business operations and financing activities. Financing activities could include bank borrowings, collateralized financing arrangements, new or enhanced deposit product offerings such as the SmartRate Program, or additional capital-raising activities under our universal shelf registration statement. We believe our existing assets, most of which are liquid in nature, together with funds generated from operations and available from committed and uncommitted financing facilities, provide adequate funds for continuing operations at current levels of activity in the short-term. We also believe that we will be able to continue to meet our long-term cash requirements due to our strong financial position and ability to access capital from financial markets. 
 The Company s senior management establishes the liquidity and capital policies of our company. The Company s senior management reviews business performance relative to these policies, monitors the availability of alternative sources of financing, and oversees the liquidity and interest rate sensitivity of our company s asset and liability position. 
 Our assets, consisting mainly of cash or assets readily convertible into cash, are our principal source of liquidity. The liquid nature of these assets provides for flexibility in managing and financing the projected operating needs of the business. These assets are financed primarily by our equity capital, corporate debt, debentures to trusts, client credit balances, short-term bank loans, and proceeds from securities lending, repurchase agreements, and other payables. We currently finance our client accounts and firm trading positions through ordinary course borrowings at floating interest rates from various banks on a demand basis, securities lending, and repurchase agreements, with company-owned and client securities pledged as collateral. Changes in securities market volumes, related client borrowing demands, underwriting activity, and levels of securities inventory affect the amount of our financing requirements. Interest rate increases may harm the value of our investment portfolio, if interest rates rise, our unrealized gains on fixed income securities may decrease and our unrealized losses may increase. We would recognize the accumulated change in estimated fair value of these fixed income securities in net income when we realize a gain or loss upon the sale of the security. 
 Our bank assets consist principally of available-for-sale and held-to-maturity securities, retained loans, and cash and cash equivalents. Stifel Bancorp s current liquidity needs are generally met through deposits from brokerage clients and equity capital. We monitor the liquidity of our bank subsidiaries daily to ensure their ability to meet customer deposit withdrawals, maintain reserve requirements, and support asset growth.

Liquidity Available From Subsidiaries 
 Liquidity is principally available to our company from Stifel and Stifel Bancorp. 
 Stifel is required to maintain net capital equal to the greater of 1 million or two percent of aggregate debit items arising from client transactions. Covenants in the Company s committed financing facilities require the excess net capital of Stifel, our principal broker-dealer subsidiary, to be above a defined amount. At September 30, 2024, Stifel s excess net capital exceeded the minimum requirement, as defined. There are also limitations on the amount of dividends that may be declared by a broker-dealer without FINRA approval. See Note 16 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for more information on the capital restrictions placed on our broker-dealer subsidiaries. 
 Stifel Bancorp may pay dividends to the parent company without prior approval by its regulator as long as the dividend does not exceed the sum of Stifel Bancorp s current calendar year and the previous two calendar years retained net income and Stifel Bancorp maintains its targeted capital to risk-weighted assets ratios. 
 Although we have liquidity available to us from our other subsidiaries, the available amounts are not as significant as the amounts described above and, in certain instances, may be subject to regulatory requirements. 
 Capital Management 
 We have an ongoing authorization from the Board of Directors to repurchase our common stock in the open market or in negotiated transactions. At September 30, 2024, the maximum number of shares that may yet be purchased under this plan was 10.5 million. We utilize the share repurchase program to manage our equity capital relative to the growth of our business and help to meet obligations under our employee benefit plans. 
 Liquidity Risk Management 
 Our businesses are diverse, and our liquidity needs are determined by many factors, including market movements, collateral requirements, and client commitments, all of which can change dramatically in a difficult funding environment. During a liquidity crisis, credit-sensitive funding, including unsecured debt and some types of secured financing agreements, may be unavailable, and the terms (e.g., interest rates, collateral provisions, and tenor) or availability of other types of secured financing may change. We manage liquidity risk by diversifying our funding sources across products and among individual counterparties within those products. 
 As a holding company, whereby all of our operations are conducted through our subsidiaries, our cash flow and our ability to service our debt, including the notes, depend upon the earnings of our subsidiaries. Our subsidiaries are separate and distinct legal entities. Our subsidiaries have no obligation to pay any amounts due on the notes or to provide us with funds to pay our obligations, whether by dividends, distributions, loans, or other payments. 
 Our liquidity requirements may change in the event we need to raise more funds than anticipated to increase inventory positions, support more rapid expansion, develop new or enhanced services and products, acquire technologies, respond to acquisition opportunities, expand our recruiting efforts, or respond to other unanticipated liquidity requirements. We primarily rely on financing activities and distributions from our subsidiaries for funds to implement our business and growth strategies and repurchase our shares. Net capital 
 69 

rules, restrictions under our borrowing arrangements of our subsidiaries, as well as the earnings, financial condition, and cash requirements of our subsidiaries, may each limit distributions to us from our subsidiaries. 
 The availability of outside financing, including access to the capital markets and bank lending, depends on a variety of factors, such as market conditions, the general availability of credit, the volume of trading activities, the overall availability of credit to the financial services sector, and our credit rating. Our cost and availability of funding may be adversely affected by illiquid credit markets and wider credit spreads. As a result of any future concerns about the stability of the markets generally and the strength of counterparties specifically, lenders may from time to time curtail, or even cease to provide, funding to borrowers. 
 Our liquidity management policies are designed to mitigate the potential risk that we may be unable to access adequate financing to service our financial obligations without material business impact. The principal elements of our liquidity management framework are: (a) daily monitoring of our liquidity needs at the holding company and significant subsidiary level, (b) stress testing the liquidity positions of Stifel and our bank subsidiaries, and (c) diversification of our funding sources. 
 Monitoring of liquidity Senior management establishes our liquidity and capital policies. These policies include senior management s review of short- and long-term cash flow forecasts, review of monthly capital expenditures, the monitoring of the availability of alternative sources of financing, and the daily monitoring of liquidity in our significant subsidiaries. Our decisions on the allocation of capital to our business units consider, among other factors, projected profitability and cash flow, risk, and impact on future liquidity needs. Our treasury department assists in evaluating, monitoring, and controlling the impact that our business activities have on our financial condition, liquidity, and capital structure as well as maintains our relationships with various lenders. The objectives of these policies are to support the successful execution of our business strategies while ensuring ongoing and sufficient liquidity. 
 Liquidity stress testing (Firmwide) A liquidity stress test model is maintained by the Company that measures liquidity outflows across multiple scenarios at the major operating subsidiaries and details the corresponding impact to our holding company and the overall consolidated firm. Liquidity stress tests are utilized to ensure that current exposures are consistent with the Company s established liquidity risk tolerance and, more specifically, to identify and quantify sources of potential liquidity strain. Further, the stress tests are utilized to analyze possible impacts on the Company s cash flows, and liquidity position. The outflows are modeled over a 30-day liquidity stress timeframe and include the impact of idiosyncratic and macro-economic stress events. 
 The assumptions utilized in the Company s liquidity stress tests include, but are not limited to, the following: 
 No government support 

No access to equity and unsecured debt markets within the stress horizon 

Higher haircuts and significantly lower availability of secured funding 

Additional collateral that would be required by trading counter-parties, certain exchanges, and clearing organizations related to credit rating downgrades 

Client cash withdrawals and inability to accept new deposits 

Increased demand from customers on the funding of loans and lines of credit 

At September 30, 2024, the Company maintained sufficient liquidity to meet current and contingent funding obligations as modeled in its liquidity stress test model. 
 Liquidity stress testing (Stifel Bancorp) Our bank subsidiaries perform three primary stress tests on their liquidity position. These stress tests are based on the following company-specific stresses: (1) the amount of deposit run-off that they could withstand over a one-month period of time based on their on-balance sheet liquidity and available credit, (2) the ability to fund operations if all available credit were to be drawn immediately, with no additional available credit, and (3) the ability to fund operations under a regulatory prompt corrective action. The goal of these stress tests is to determine their ability to fund continuing operations under significant pressures on both assets and liabilities. 
 Under all stress tests, our bank subsidiaries consider cash and highly liquid investments as available to meet liquidity needs. In their analysis, our bank subsidiaries consider agency mortgage-backed securities, corporate bonds, and commercial mortgage-backed securities as highly liquid. In addition to being able to be readily financed at modest haircut levels, our bank subsidiaries estimate that each of the individual securities within each of the asset classes described above could be sold into the market and converted into cash within three business days under normal market conditions, assuming that the entire portfolio of a given asset class was not simultaneously liquidated. At September 30, 2024, available cash and highly liquid investments comprised approximately 16 of Stifel Bancorp s assets, which was well in excess of its internal target. 
 In addition to these stress tests, management performs a daily liquidity review. The daily analysis provides management with all major fluctuations in liquidity. The analysis also tracks the proportion of deposits that Stifel Bancorp is sweeping from its affiliated broker-dealer, Stifel. On a monthly basis, liquidity key performance indicators and compliance with liquidity policy limits are reported to the Board of Directors. Our bank subsidiaries have not violated any internal liquidity policy limits.

Funding Sources 
 The Company pursues a strategy of diversification of secured and unsecured funding sources (by product and by investor) and attempts to ensure that the tenor of the Company s liabilities equals or exceeds the expected holding period of the assets being financed. The Company funds its balance sheet through diverse sources. These sources may include the Company s equity capital, long-term debt, repurchase agreements, securities lending, deposits, committed and uncommitted credit facilities, Federal Home Loan Bank advances, and federal funds agreements. 
 On September 14, 2023, we filed a universal shelf registration statement with the SEC pursuant to which we can issue debt, equity and other capital instruments if and when necessary or perceived by us to be opportune. Subject to certain conditions, this registration statement will be effective through September 14, 2026. 
 Cash and Cash Equivalents We held 1.9 billion of cash and cash equivalents at September 30, 2024, compared to 3.4 billion at December 31, 2023. Cash and cash equivalents provide immediate sources of funds to meet our liquidity needs. 
 Available-for-Sale Securities We held 1.62 billion in available-for-sale investment securities at September 30, 2024, compared to 1.55 billion at December 31, 2023. As of September 30, 2024, the weighted-average life of the investment securities portfolio was approximately 1.1 years. These investment securities provide increased liquidity and flexibility to support our company s funding requirements. 
 We monitor the available-for-sale investment portfolio for other-than-temporary impairment based on a number of criteria, including the size of the unrealized loss position, the duration for which the security has been in a loss position, credit rating, the nature of the investments, and current market conditions. For debt securities, we also consider any intent to sell the security and the likelihood we will be required to sell the security before its anticipated recovery. We continually monitor the ratings of our security holdings and conduct regular reviews of our credit-sensitive assets. 
 Deposits Deposits have become our largest funding source. Deposits provide a stable, low-cost source of funds that we utilize to fund asset growth and to diversify funding sources. We have continued to expand our deposit-gathering efforts through our existing private client network and through expansion. These channels offer a broad set of deposit products that include demand deposits, money market deposits, and certificates of deposit CDs ). As of September 30, 2024, we had 28.1 billion in deposits compared to 27.3 billion at December 31, 2023. Our core deposits are primarily comprised of money market deposit accounts, non-interest-bearing deposits, and CDs. 
 Deposits are sourced by our multi-bank sweep program in which clients cash deposits in their brokerage accounts are swept into FDIC-insured interest-bearing accounts at our bank subsidiaries and various third-party banks. In addition to our historical sweep program, we offer the Stifel Smart Rate Program Smart Rate ), a high yield savings account that keeps our brokerage clients cash balances at Stifel affiliated banks through their securities accounts. Brokerage client deposits totaled 26.0 billion and 24.1 billion at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively, which includes 16.3 billion and 14.5 billion, respectively, of client cash in our Smart Rate program. The increase in money market deposits in 2024 was primarily driven by elevated client interest in the Smart Rate program. Please refer to the Distribution of Assets, Liabilities, and Shareholders Equity; Interest Rates and Interest Differential table included in Results of Operations Global Wealth Management for additional information on Stifel Bancorp s average balances and interest income and expense. 
 Short-term borrowings Our short-term financing is generally obtained through short-term bank line financing on an uncommitted, secured basis, securities lending arrangements, repurchase agreements, advances from the Federal Home Loan Bank, term loans, and committed bank line financing on an unsecured basis. We borrow from various banks on a demand basis with company-owned and customer securities pledged as collateral. The value of customer-owned securities used as collateral is not reflected in the consolidated statements of financial condition. We also have an unsecured, committed bank line available. 
 Our uncommitted secured lines of credit at September 30, 2024, totaled 880.0 million with four banks and are dependent on having appropriate collateral, as determined by the bank agreements, to secure an advance under the line. The availability of our uncommitted lines is subject to approval by the individual banks each time an advance is requested and may be denied. Our peak daily borrowing on our uncommitted secured lines was 70.0 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. There are no compensating balance requirements under these arrangements. Any borrowings on secured lines of credit are generally utilized to finance certain fixed income securities. At September 30, 2024, we had no outstanding balances on our uncommitted secured lines of credit. 
 Federal Home Loan advances are floating-rate advances. The weighted average interest rates during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 on these advances was 2.15 . The advances are secured by Stifel Bancorp s residential mortgage loan portfolio and investment portfolio. The interest rates reset on a daily basis. Stifel Bancorp has the option to prepay these advances without penalty on the interest reset date. At September 30, 2024, there were no Federal Home Loan advances. 
 Unsecured borrowings On September 27, 2023, the Company and Stifel (the Borrowers entered into an unsecured credit agreement with a syndicate of lenders led by Bank of America, N.A., as administrative agent (the Credit Agreement ). Concurrently with, and 
 71 

conditional upon, the effectiveness of the Credit Agreement, all of the commitments under the Borrowers existing 500.0 million unsecured revolving credit facility agreement were terminated. 
 The Credit Agreement has a maturity date of September 27, 2028, and provides for a committed unsecured borrowing facility for maximum aggregate borrowings of up to 750.0 million, depending on the amount of outstanding borrowings of the Borrowers from time to time during the duration of the Credit Agreement. The interest rates on borrowings under the Credit Agreement are variable and based on the Secured Overnight Financing Rate. 
 The Borrowers can draw upon this line as long as certain restrictive covenants are maintained. Under the Credit Agreement, the Borrowers are required to maintain compliance with a minimum consolidated tangible net worth covenant, as defined, and a maximum consolidated total capitalization ratio covenant, as defined. In addition, Stifel is required to maintain compliance with a minimum regulatory excess net capital percentage covenant, as defined, and our bank subsidiaries are required to maintain their status as well-capitalized, as defined. 
 Upon the occurrence and during the continuation of an event of default, the Company s obligations under the Credit Agreement may be accelerated and the lending commitments thereunder terminated. The Credit Agreement contains customary events of default, including, without limitation, payment defaults, breaches of representations and warranties, covenant defaults, cross-defaults to similar obligations, certain events of bankruptcy and insolvency, change of control, and judgment defaults. At September 30, 2024, we had no advances on the Credit Facility and were in compliance with all covenants and currently do not expect any covenant violations. 
 Federal Home Loan Bank Advances and other secured financing Stifel Bancorp has borrowing capacity with the Federal Home Loan Bank of 6.0 billion at September 30, 2024 and 64.5 million in federal funds agreements for the purpose of purchasing short-term funds should additional liquidity be needed. At September 30, 2024, there were no outstanding Federal Home Loan Bank advances. Stifel Bancorp is eligible to participate in the Fed s discount window program; however, Stifel Bancorp does not view borrowings from the Fed as a primary means of funding. The credit available in this program is subject to periodic review, may be terminated or reduced at the discretion of the Fed, and is secured by securities. Stifel Bancorp has borrowing capacity of 4.1 billion with the Fed s discount window at September 30, 2024. Stifel Bancorp receives overnight funds from excess cash held in Stifel brokerage accounts, which are deposited into a money market account. These balances totaled 26.0 billion at September 30, 2024. At September 30, 2024, there was 27.0 billion in client money market and FDIC-insured product balances. 
 Public Offering of Senior Notes On July 15, 2014, we sold in a registered underwritten public offering, 300.0 million in aggregate principal amount of 4.25 senior notes due July 2024 (the 2014 Notes ). Interest on the 2014 Notes is payable semi-annually in arrears. We may redeem the 2014 Notes in whole or in part, at our option, at a redemption price equal to 100 of their principal amount, plus a make-whole premium and accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the date of redemption. In July 2016, we issued an additional 200.0 million in aggregate principal amount of 4.25 senior notes due 2024. The 2014 Notes matured in July 2024.

Interest on the senior notes is payable quarterly in arrears in January, April, July, and October. We may redeem some or all of the senior notes at any time at a redemption price equal to 100 of the principal amount of the notes being redeemed plus accrued interest thereon to the redemption date. On October 27, 2017, we completed the sale of an additional 25.0 million aggregate principal amount of Notes pursuant to the over-allotment option. In October 2017, we received a BBB- rating on the notes. 
 On May 20, 2020, we sold in a registered underwritten public offering, 400.0 million in aggregate principal amount of 4.00 senior notes due May 2030. Interest on these senior notes is payable semi-annually in arrears in May and November.

Credit Rating 
 We believe our current rating depends upon a number of factors, including industry dynamics, operating and economic environment, operating results, operating margins, earnings trends and volatility, balance sheet composition, liquidity and liquidity management, our capital structure, our overall risk management, business diversification, and our market share and competitive position in the markets in which we operate. Deteriorations in any of these factors could impact our credit rating. A reduction in our credit rating could adversely affect our liquidity and competitive position, increase our incremental borrowing costs, limit our access to the capital markets, or trigger our obligations under certain financial agreements. As such, we may not be able to successfully obtain additional outside financing to fund our operations on favorable terms, or at all. 
 We believe our existing assets, a significant portion of which are liquid in nature, together with the funds from operations, available informal short-term credit arrangements, and our ability to raise additional capital will provide sufficient resources to meet our present and anticipated financing needs. We received a credit rating upgrade from S P Global Ratings during the first quarter of 2024. 
 Use of Capital Resources 
 We have paid 141.5 million in the form of upfront notes to financial advisors for transition pay during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. As we continue to take advantage of the opportunities created by market displacement and as competition for skilled professionals in the industry increases, we may decide to devote more significant resources to attracting and retaining qualified personnel. 
 We utilize transition pay, principally in the form of upfront demand notes, to aid financial advisors, who have elected to join our firm, to supplement their lost compensation while transitioning their customers accounts to the Stifel platform. The initial value of the notes is determined primarily by the financial advisors trailing production and assets under management. These notes are generally forgiven over a five- to ten-year period based on production. The future estimated amortization expense of the upfront notes, assuming current-year production levels and static growth for the remaining three months in 2024, and the years ended December 31, 2025, 2026, 2027, 2028, and thereafter are 58.8 million, 136.4 million, 125.3 million, 106.4 million, 92.9 million, and 183.0 million, respectively. These estimates could change if we continue to grow our business through expansion or experience increased production levels. 
 We maintain an incentive stock plan and a wealth accumulation plan that provides for the granting of stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock, performance awards, stock units, and debentures (collectively, deferred awards to our associates. Historically, we have granted stock units to our associates as part of our retention program. A restricted stock unit or restricted stock award represents the right to receive a share of the Company s common stock at a designated time in the future without cash payment by the associate and is issued in lieu of cash incentive, principally for deferred compensation and employee retention plans. The restricted stock units or restricted stock awards generally vest over the next one to ten years after issuance and are distributed at predetermined future payable dates once vesting occurs. Restricted stock awards are restricted as to sale or disposition. These restrictions lapse over the next one to two years. In addition, we sponsor non-share-based compensation plans, which includes restricted cash awards that are subject to ratable vesting terms with service requirements. We paid 67.4 million in restricted cash awards during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. These awards are amortized as compensation expense over the relevant service period. 
 At September 30, 2024, the total number of restricted stock units, PRSUs, and restricted stock awards outstanding was 13.7 million, of which 12.1 million were unvested. At September 30, 2024, there was unrecognized compensation cost for deferred awards of approximately 712.9 million, which is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 2.5 years. 
 The future estimated compensation expense of the deferred awards, assuming current year forfeiture levels and static growth for the remaining three months in 2024, and the years ended December 31, 2025, 2026, 2027, 2028, and thereafter are 64.8 million, 220.5 million, 179.7 million, 121.6 million, 72.5 million, and 53.8 million, respectively. These estimates could change if our forfeitures change from historical levels. 
 On July 18, 2024, the Company s 4.25 Senior Notes matured resulting in the retirement of the 500.0 million outstanding balance. 
 On August 1, 2024, the Company acquired Finance 500, Inc. Finance 500 and CB Resource, Inc. CBR ), which operate as strategic partners under common ownership. Finance 500 is a brokerage and investment services provider focused on underwriting FDIC-insured Certificates of Deposits and fixed income securities trading. CBR integrates ERM, strategic and capital plan solutions, and industry analytics through its fully integrated tech-enabled platform. Consideration for this acquisition consisted of cash from operations. 
 Net Capital Requirements We operate in a highly regulated environment and are subject to capital requirements, which may limit distributions to our company from our subsidiaries. Distributions from our broker-dealer subsidiaries are subject to net capital rules. These subsidiaries have historically operated in excess of minimum net capital requirements. However, if distributions were to be limited in the future due to the failure of our subsidiaries to comply with the net capital rules or a change in the net capital rules, it could have a material and adverse effect to our company by limiting our operations that require intensive use of capital, such as underwriting or trading activities, or limit our ability to implement our business and growth strategies, pay interest on and repay the principal of our debt, and/or repurchase our common stock. Our non-broker-dealer subsidiaries, Stifel Bank Trust, Stifel Bank, Stifel Trust Company, N.A., and Stifel Trust Company Delaware, N.A., are also subject to various regulatory capital requirements administered by the federal 
 73 

banking agencies. Our broker-dealer subsidiaries and our bank subsidiaries have consistently operated in excess of their capital adequacy requirements. Our Canadian subsidiary, SNC, is subject to the regulatory supervision and requirements of CIRO. 
 At September 30, 2024, Stifel had net capital of 486.2 million, which was 41.0 of aggregate debit items and 462.5 million in excess of its minimum required net capital. At September 30, 2024, all of our other broker-dealer subsidiaries net capital exceeded the minimum net capital required under the SEC rule. At September 30, 2024, SNEL s capital and reserves were in excess of the financial resources requirement under the rules of the FCA. At September 30, 2024, our banking subsidiaries were considered well capitalized under the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action. At September 30, 2024, SNC s net capital and reserves were in excess of the financial resources requirement under the rules of the CIRO. See Note 16 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for details of our regulatory capital requirements. 
 Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 
 In preparing our consolidated financial statements in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles and pursuant to the rules and regulations of the SEC, we make assumptions, judgments, and estimates that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, and expenses, and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. We base our assumptions, judgments, and estimates on historical experience and various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results could differ materially from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. On a regular basis, we evaluate our assumptions, judgments, and estimates. We also discuss our critical accounting policies and estimates with the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors. 
 We believe that the assumptions, judgments, and estimates involved in the accounting policies described below have the greatest potential impact on our consolidated financial statements. These areas are key components of our results of operations and are based on complex rules that require us to make assumptions, judgments, and estimates, so we consider these to be our critical accounting policies. Historically, our assumptions, judgments, and estimates relative to our critical accounting policies and estimates have not differed materially from actual results. 
 For more information, see Note 2 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. There have not been any material updates to our critical accounting policies and estimates as disclosed in the MD A of the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K. 
 Recent Accounting Pronouncements 
 See Note 2 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding the effect of new accounting pronouncements on our consolidated financial statements. 
 Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 
 Information concerning our off-balance sheet arrangements is included in Note 21 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Such information is hereby incorporated by reference. 
 Contractual Obligations 
 Our contractual obligations have not materially changed from those reported in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. 
 ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITAT IVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 
 Risk Management 
 Risks are an inherent part of our business and activities. Management of these risks is critical to our soundness and profitability. Risk management at our company is a multi-faceted process that requires communication, judgment, and knowledge of financial products and markets. Our senior management group takes an active role in the risk management process and requires specific administrative and business functions to assist in the identification, assessment, monitoring, and control of various risks. The principal risks involved in our business activities are: market (interest rates and equity prices), credit, capital and liquidity, operational, and regulatory and legal. 
 We have adopted policies and procedures concerning Enterprise Risk Management. The Risk Management Committee of the Board of Directors, in exercising its oversight of management s activities, conducts periodic reviews and discussions with management regarding the guidelines and policies governing the processes by which risk assessment and risk management are handled. 
 Market Risk 
 The potential for changes in the value of financial instruments owned by our company resulting from changes in interest rates and equity prices is referred to as market risk. Market risk is inherent to financial instruments, and accordingly, the scope of our market risk management procedures includes all market risk-sensitive financial instruments. 
 We trade tax-exempt and taxable debt obligations, including U.S. treasury bills, notes, and bonds; U.S. government agency and municipal notes and bonds; bank certificates of deposit; mortgage-backed securities; and corporate obligations. We are also an active 
 74 

market-maker in over-the-counter equity securities. In connection with these activities, we may maintain inventories in order to ensure availability and to facilitate customer transactions. 
 Changes in value of our financial instruments may result from fluctuations in interest rates, credit ratings, equity prices, and the correlation among these factors, along with the level of volatility. 
 We manage our trading businesses by product and have established trading departments that have responsibility for each product. The trading inventories are managed with a view toward facilitating client transactions, considering the risk and profitability of each inventory position. Position limits in trading inventory accounts are established by our Enterprise Risk Management department and monitored on a daily basis within the business units. We monitor inventory levels and results of the trading departments, as well as inventory aging, pricing, concentration, securities ratings, and risk sensitivities. 
 We are also exposed to market risk based on our other investing activities. These investments consist of investments in private equity partnerships, start-up companies, venture capital investments, and zero coupon U.S. government securities and are included under the caption Investments on the consolidated statements of financial condition. 
 Interest Rate Risk 
 We are exposed to interest rate risk as a result of maintaining inventories of interest rate-sensitive financial instruments and from changes in the interest rates on our interest-earning assets (including client loans, stock borrow activities, investments, inventories, and resale agreements) and our funding sources (including client cash balances, Federal Home Loan Bank advances, stock lending activities, bank borrowings, and repurchase agreements), which finance these assets. The collateral underlying financial instruments at the broker-dealer is repriced daily, thus requiring collateral to be delivered as necessary. Interest rates on client balances and stock borrow and lending produce a positive spread to our company, with the rates generally fluctuating in parallel. 
 We manage our inventory exposure to interest rate risk by setting and monitoring limits and, where feasible, hedging with offsetting positions in securities with similar interest rate risk characteristics. While a significant portion of our securities inventories have contractual maturities in excess of five years, these inventories, on average, turn over several times per year. 
 Value-at-Risk VaR is a statistical technique used to estimate the probability of portfolio losses based on the statistical analysis of historical price trends and volatility. It provides a common risk measure across financial instruments, markets and asset classes. We estimate VaR using a model that assumes historical changes in market conditions are representative of future changes, and trading losses on any given day could exceed the reported VaR by significant amounts in unusually volatile markets. Further, the model involves a number of assumptions and inputs. While we believe that the assumptions and inputs we use in our risk model are reasonable, different assumptions and inputs could produce materially different VaR estimates. We monitor, on a daily basis, the VaR in our trading portfolios using a ten-day horizon and a five year look-back period measured at a 99 confidence level. 
 The following table sets forth the high, low, and daily average VaR for our trading portfolios during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, and the daily VaR at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 (in thousands ):

Stifel Bancorp s interest rate risk is principally associated with changes in market interest rates related to residential, consumer, and commercial lending activities, as well as FDIC-insured deposit accounts to customers of our broker-dealer subsidiaries and to the general public. 
 Our primary emphasis in interest rate risk management for Stifel Bancorp is the matching of assets and liabilities of similar cash flow and repricing time frames. This matching of assets and liabilities reduces exposure to interest rate movements and aids in stabilizing positive interest spreads. Stifel Bancorp has established limits for acceptable interest rate risk and acceptable portfolio value risk. To ensure that Stifel Bancorp is within the limits established for net interest income, an analysis of net interest income based on various shifts in interest rates is prepared each quarter and presented to Stifel Bancorp s Board of Directors. Stifel Bancorp utilizes a third-party model to analyze the available data. 
 75 

The following table illustrates the estimated change in net interest income at September 30, 2024, based on shifts in interest rates of up to positive 200 basis points and negative 200 basis points:

Equity Price Risk 
 We are exposed to equity price risk as a consequence of making markets in equity securities. We attempt to reduce the risk of loss inherent in our inventory of equity securities by monitoring those security positions constantly throughout each day. 
 Our equity securities inventories are repriced on a regular basis, and there are no unrecorded gains or losses. Our activities as a dealer are client-driven, with the objective of meeting clients needs while earning a positive spread. 
 Credit Risk 
 We are engaged in various trading and brokerage activities, with the counterparties primarily being broker-dealers. In the event counterparties do not fulfill their obligations, we may be exposed to risk. The risk of default depends on the creditworthiness of the counterparty or issuer of the instrument. We manage this risk by imposing and monitoring position limits for each counterparty, monitoring trading counterparties, conducting regular credit reviews of financial counterparties, reviewing security concentrations, holding and marking to market collateral on certain transactions, and conducting business through clearing organizations, which guarantee performance. 
 Our client activities involve the execution, settlement, and financing of various transactions on behalf of our clients. Client activities are transacted on either a cash or margin basis. Credit exposure associated with our private client business consists primarily of customer margin accounts, which are monitored daily and are collateralized. We monitor exposure to industry sectors and individual securities and perform analyses on a regular basis in connection with our margin lending activities. We adjust our margin requirements if we believe our risk exposure is not appropriate based on market conditions. 
 We have accepted collateral in connection with resale agreements, securities borrowed transactions, and customer margin loans. Under many agreements, we are permitted to sell or repledge these securities held as collateral and use these securities to enter into securities lending arrangements or to deliver to counterparties to cover short positions. At September 30, 2024, the fair value of securities accepted as collateral where we are permitted to sell or repledge the securities was 1.8 billion, and the fair value of the collateral that had been sold or repledged was 658.0 million. 
 By using derivative instruments, we are exposed to credit and market risk on those derivative positions. Credit risk is equal to the fair value gain in a derivative, if the counterparty fails to perform. When the fair value of a derivative contract is positive, this generally indicates that the counterparty owes our company and, therefore, creates a repayment risk for our company. When the fair value of a derivative contract is negative, we owe the counterparty and, therefore, have no repayment risk. We minimize the credit (or repayment) risk in derivative instruments by entering into transactions with high-quality counterparties that are reviewed periodically by senior management. 
 76 

Stifel Bancorp extends credit to individual and commercial borrowers through a variety of loan products, including residential and commercial mortgage loans, home equity loans, construction loans, and non-real-estate commercial and consumer loans. Bank loans are generally collateralized by real estate, real property, or other assets of the borrower. Stifel Bancorp s loan policy includes criteria to adequately underwrite, document, monitor, and manage credit risk. Underwriting requires reviewing and documenting the fundamental characteristics of credit, including character, capacity to service the debt, capital, conditions, and collateral. Benchmark capital and coverage ratios are utilized, which include liquidity, debt service coverage, credit, working capital, and capital to asset ratios. Lending limits are established to include individual, collective, committee, and board authority. Monitoring credit risk is accomplished through defined loan review procedures, including frequency and scope. 
 We are subject to concentration risk if we hold large positions, extend large loans to, or have large commitments with a single counterparty, borrower, or group of similar counterparties or borrowers (i.e., in the same industry). Securities purchased under agreements to resell consist of securities issued by the U.S. government or its agencies. Receivables from and payables to clients and stock borrow and lending activities, both with a large number of clients and counterparties, and any potential concentration are carefully monitored. Stock borrow and lending activities are executed under master netting agreements, which gives our company right of offset in the event of counterparty default. Inventory and investment positions taken and commitments made, including underwritings, may involve exposure to individual issuers and businesses. We seek to limit this risk through careful review of counterparties and borrowers and the use of limits established by our senior management group, taking into consideration factors including the financial strength of the counterparty, the size of the position or commitment, the expected duration of the position or commitment, and other positions or commitments outstanding. 
 Operational Risk 
 Operational risk generally refers to the risk of loss resulting from our operations, including, but not limited to, business disruptions, improper or unauthorized execution and processing of transactions, deficiencies in our technology or financial operating systems, and inadequacies or breaches in our control processes including cyber security incidents. We operate different businesses in diverse markets and are reliant on the ability of our associates and systems to process a large number of transactions. These risks are less direct than credit and market risk, but managing them is critical, particularly in a rapidly changing environment with increasing transaction volumes. In the event of a breakdown or improper operation of systems or improper action by associates, we could suffer financial loss, regulatory sanctions, and damage to our reputation. In order to mitigate and control operational risk, we have developed and continue to enhance specific policies and procedures that are designed to identify and manage operational risk at appropriate levels throughout the organization and within such departments as Accounting, Operations, Information Technology, Legal, Compliance, and Internal Audit. These control mechanisms attempt to ensure that operational policies and procedures are being followed and that our various businesses are operating within established corporate policies and limits. Business continuity plans exist for critical systems, and redundancies are built into the systems as deemed appropriate. 
 Regulatory and Legal Risk 
 Legal risk includes the risk of private client group customer claims for sales practice violations. While these claims may not be the result of any wrongdoing, we do, at a minimum, incur costs associated with investigating and defending against such claims. See Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates in Item 2, Part I and Legal Proceedings in Item 1, Part II of this report for further discussion of our legal proceedings. In addition, we are subject to potentially sizable adverse legal judgments or arbitration awards, and fines, penalties, and other sanctions for non-compliance with applicable legal and regulatory requirements. We are generally subject to extensive regulation by the SEC, FINRA, and state securities regulators in the different jurisdictions in which we conduct business. As a bank holding company, we are subject to regulation by the Federal Reserve. Our bank subsidiaries are subject to regulation by the FDIC. As a result, we are subject to a risk of loss resulting from failure to comply with banking laws. Our international subsidiary, SNEL, is subject to the regulatory supervision and requirements of the FCA in the United Kingdom. Our Canadian subsidiary, SNC, is subject to the regulatory supervision and requirements of the CIRO. We have comprehensive procedures addressing issues such as regulatory capital requirements, sales and trading practices, use of and safekeeping of customer funds, the extension of credit, including margin loans, collection activities, money laundering, and record keeping. We act as an underwriter or selling group member in both equity and fixed income product offerings. When acting as lead or co-lead manager, we have potential legal exposure to claims relating to these securities offerings. To manage this exposure, a committee of senior executives review proposed underwriting commitments to assess the quality of the offering and the adequacy of due diligence investigation. 
 Our company, as a bank and financial holding company, is subject to regulation, including capital requirements, by the Federal Reserve. Stifel Bancorp is subject to various regulatory capital requirements administered by the FDIC and state banking authorities. Failure to meet minimum capital requirements can initiate certain mandatory and possibly additional discretionary actions by regulators that, if undertaken, could have a direct material effect on our company's and Stifel Bancorp's financial statements. 
 77 

ITEM 4. CONTROL S AND PROCEDURES 
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures
