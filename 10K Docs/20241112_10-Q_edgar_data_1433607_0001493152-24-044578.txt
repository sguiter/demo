condensed consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. 

Unless
the context requires otherwise, references in this Form 10-Q to the Company, InspireMD, we, 
 our and us refer to InspireMD, Inc., a Delaware corporation, and its subsidiaries. 

Forward-Looking
Statements 

This
Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q contains forward-looking statements, which include information relating to future events,
future financial performance, strategies, expectations, competitive environment and regulation, including revenue growth. Words such
as may, will, should, could, would, predicts, potential, 
 continue, expects, anticipates, future, intends, plans, 
 believes, estimates, and similar expressions, as well as statements in future tense, identify forward-looking
statements. Forward-looking statements should not be read as a guarantee of future performance or results and may not be accurate indications
of when such performance or results will be achieved. Forward-looking statements are based on information we have when those statements
are made or our management s good faith belief as of that time with respect to future events and are subject to risks and uncertainties
that could cause actual performance or results to differ materially from those expressed in or suggested by the forward-looking statements.
Important factors that could cause such differences include, but are not limited to: 

our
 history of recurring losses and negative cash flows from operating activities, significant future commitments and the uncertainty
 regarding the adequacy of our liquidity to pursue our complete business objectives, and substantial doubt regarding our ability to
 continue as a going concern; 

our
 need to raise additional capital to meet our business requirements in the future and such capital raising may be costly or difficult
 to obtain and could dilute out stockholders ownership interests; 

market
 acceptance of our products; 

an
 inability to secure and maintain regulatory approvals for the sale of our products; 

negative
 clinical trial results or lengthy product delays in key markets; 

our
 ability to maintain compliance with the Nasdaq listing standards; 

our
 ability to generate revenues from our products and obtain and maintain regulatory approvals for our products; 

our
 ability to adequately protect our intellectual property; 

our
 dependence on a single manufacturing facility and our ability to comply with stringent manufacturing quality standards and to increase
 production as necessary; 

the
 risk that the data collected from our current and planned clinical trials may not be sufficient to demonstrate that our technology
 is an attractive alternative to other procedures and products; 

intense
 competition in our industry, with competitors having substantially greater financial, technological, research and development, regulatory
 and clinical, manufacturing, marketing and sales, distribution and personnel resources than we do; 

entry
 of new competitors and products and potential technological obsolescence of our products; 

inability
 to carry out research, development and commercialization plans; 

loss
 of a key customer or supplier; 

technical
 problems with our research and products and potential product liability claims; 

product
 malfunctions; 

price
 increases for supplies and components; 

3 

insufficient
 or inadequate reimbursement by governmental and other third-party payers for our products; 

our
 efforts to successfully obtain and maintain intellectual property protection covering our products, which may not be successful; 

adverse
 federal, state and local government regulation, in the United States, Europe or Israel and other foreign jurisdictions; 

the
 fact that we conduct business in multiple foreign jurisdictions, exposing us to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, logistical
 and communications challenges, burdens and costs of compliance with foreign laws and political and economic instability in each jurisdiction; 

security,
 political and economic instability in the Middle East that could harm our business; and 

current
 or future unfavorable economic and market conditions and adverse developments with respect to financial institutions and associated
 liquidity risk 

The
foregoing does not represent an exhaustive list of matters that may be covered by the forward-looking statements contained herein or
risk factors that we are faced with that may cause our actual results to differ from those anticipated in our forward-looking statements.
For a discussion of these and other risks that relate to our business and investing in our common stock, you should carefully review
the risks and uncertainties described in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, and those described from time to time in our future reports
filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The forward-looking statements contained in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q are
expressly qualified in their entirety by this cautionary statement. We do not undertake any obligation to publicly update any forward-looking
statement to reflect events or circumstances after the date on which any such statement is made or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated
events.

MicroNet, a micron mesh sleeve, is attached over a stent to provide embolic protection both during and after stenting procedures. 

Our
CGuard carotid embolic prevention system CGuard EPS combines MicroNet and a unique self-expandable nitinol stent
in a single device for use in carotid artery revascularization. Our CGuard EPS originally received CE mark approval under Medical Device
Directive 93/42/EEC MDD in the European Union EU in March 2013 and was fully launched in Europe in September
2015. Subsequently, we launched CGuard EPS in over 30 countries and on February 3, 2021, we executed a distribution agreement with Chinese
partners for the purpose of expanding our presence in the Asian markets. In January 2024, we received CE mark recertification under the
EU s Medical Device Regulation regulatory framework. Currently, we are seeking strategic partners for a potential launch of CGuard
EPS in Japan and other Asian countries.

On
September 8, 2020, we received approval from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration FDA of our Investigation Device Exemption IDE ), thereby allowing us to proceed with a pivotal study of our CGuard Carotid Stent System, C-GUARDIANS, for
prevention of stroke in patients in the United States. C-GUARDIANS is a prospective, multicenter, single-arm, pivotal study to evaluate
the safety and efficacy of the CGuard Carotid Stent System when used to treat symptomatic and asymptomatic carotid artery stenosis
in patients undergoing carotid artery stenting CAS ). The study, which completed enrollment in June 2023, enrolled 316
patients across 24 trial sites in the U.S. and Europe and from April 2023 included deployment of the CGuard stent using CGuard Prime,
our next generation CAS stent platform. 

The
primary endpoint was a composite of: (1) incidence of major adverse events including Death (all-cause mortality), any Stroke, and Myocardial
Infarction (DSMI) through 30-days post index procedure, or (2) ipsilateral stroke from day 31 to day 365 post-procedure. All events were
adjudicated by an independent clinical events committee. The composite index was compared to a performance goal based on the observed
rate of the two components of the primary endpoint from previous pivotal stent trials which are considered industry standard. The performance
goal was considered met if the upper bound of the two-sided 95 confidence interval calculated from the observed primary endpoint rate
is 

In
November 2023, we announced positive 30-day follow up results from the C-GUARDIANS trial in which stenting with the CGuard Carotid Stent
System in patients with carotid artery stenosis and at high risk for carotid endarterectomy had a DSMI rate of 0.95 , measured from the
date of the procedure through 30 days follow-up post-procedure. We anticipate reporting primary endpoint results from the C-GUARDIANS
trial at the end of May 2024 that may support the submission of a premarket approval, or PMA, application in the third quarter of 2024
with a view to potential FDA approval of the CGuard Prime stent system in the first half of 2025. 

On
May 28, 2024, we announced positive one-year follow up results from the C-GUARDIANS trial in which stenting with the CGuard Carotid Stent
System in patients with carotid artery stenosis and at high risk for carotid endarterectomy had a 30-day DSMI and Ipsilateral stroke
between 31 and 365 days rate of 1.95 measured from procedure to 1-year follow-up. 

We
continue to invest in current and future potential new indications, products and manufacturing enhancements for CGuard that are expected
to reduce cost of goods and/or provide the best-in-class performing delivery systems, such as CGuard Prime. In furtherance of our strategy
that focuses on establishing the CGuard Carotid Stent System as a viable alternative to vascular surgery, we are developing a new transcarotid
artery revascularization (TCAR) system, SwitchGuard neuroprotection system SwitchGuard NPS ), for transcarotid access
and neuro protection. In addition, we intend to explore new indications for CGuard to leverage the advantages of stent design and mesh
protection, well suited in labels such as acute stroke with tandem lesions. 

We
consider our current addressable market for our CGuard Carotid Stent System and SwitchGuard NPS to be both symptomatic and asymptomatic
individuals with diagnosed high-grade carotid artery stenosis for whom intervention is preferable to medical (drug) therapy. This group
includes not only carotid artery stenting patients but also individuals undergoing carotid endarterectomy, as the two approaches compete
for the same patient population. Assuming full penetration of the intervention caseload by CGuard, we estimate that the addressable market
for CGuard Carotid Stent System and SwitchGuard NPS is approximately 1.3 billion (source: Health Research International Personal Medical
Systems, Inc. September 13, 2021 Results of Update Report on Global Carotid Stenting Procedures and Markets by Major Geography and Addressable
Markets and internal estimates). According to this same report and internal estimates, assuming full penetration of treatment for all
individuals diagnosed with high-grade carotid artery stenosis, we estimate the total available market for CGuard Carotid Stent System
and SwitchGuard NPS to be approximately 9.3 billion, which may grow over time if expanded treatment options such as CGuard Carotid Stent
System and SwitchGuard NPS lead to increased patient screening for carotid artery disease. 

In
October 2023, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Service CMS issued its final National Coverage Determination NCD ),
expanding coverage of CAS to include both asymptomatic and standard risk patients, significantly expanding the U.S. CAS addressable market.

Our
mission is to offer a comprehensive set of delivery solutions (TCAR and Transfemoral) in order to deliver best in class results through
patient outcomes by way of stent performance with CGuard Carotid Stent System and SwitchGuard NPS. 

We
were organized in the State of Delaware on February 29, 2008. 

Recent
Developments 

One
Year Results from the U.S. Investigational Device Exemption (IDE) clinical trial 

On
May 28, 2024, we announced positive one-year follow up results from the C-GUARDIANS trial of the CGuard Carotid Stent Systemin
which stenting with the CGuard Carotid Stent System in patients with carotid artery stenosis and at high risk for carotid endarterectomy
had a 30-day DSMI and Ipsilateral stroke between 31 and 365 days rate of 1.95 , measured from procedure to 1-year follow-up. 

Exercise
of Series H Warrant 

Following
the announcement of the one year follow up study results from the Company s C-GUARDIANS trial, Series H warrants to purchase 12,914,086
shares of common stock were exercised in full into 292,996 of shares of common stock and pre-funded warrants to purchase 12,621,090 shares
of common stock. The net proceeds to the Company from the exercise of the Series H Warrants were 16.9 million after deducting placement
agent fees. The Series H warrants, each exercisable at 1.3827 per common share and 1.3826 per pre-funded warrant, were issued as part
of the private placement financing that the Company consummated on May 15, 2023. 

Security
Situation in Israel 

In
October 2023, Hamas terrorists infiltrated Israel s southern border from the Gaza Strip and conducted a series of attacks on civilian
and military targets. Hamas also launched extensive rocket attacks on Israeli population and industrial centers located along Israel s
border with the Gaza Strip and in other areas within the State of Israel. These attacks resulted in extensive deaths, injuries and kidnapping
of civilians and soldiers. Following the attack, Israel s security cabinet declared war against Hamas and a military campaign against
these terrorist organizations commenced in parallel to their continued rocket and terror attacks. In addition, since the commencement
of these events, there have been continued hostilities along Israel s northern border with Lebanon (with the Hezbollah terror organization)
and on other fronts from various extremist groups in region, such as the Houthis in Yemen and various rebel militia groups in Syria and
Iraq. It is possible that hostilities with Hezbollah in Lebanon will escalate, and that other terrorist organizations, including Palestinian
military organizations in the West Bank as well as other hostile countries will join the hostilities. In addition, Iran recently launched
direct attacks on Israel involving hundreds of drones and missiles and has threatened to continue to attack Israel and is widely believed
to be developing nuclear weapons. Iran is also believed to have a strong influence among extremist groups in the region, such as Hamas
in Gaza, Hezbollah in Lebanon, the Houthi movement in Yemen and various rebel militia groups in Syria and Iraq. Such clashes may escalate
in the future into a greater regional conflict. We cannot currently predict the intensity or duration of Israel s war against Hamas,
nor can we predict how this war will ultimately affect our business and operations or Israel s economy in general. 

Submission
of Premarket Approval Application 

In
September 2024, the Company submitted a PMA application to the FDA seeking marketing approval for the CGuard Prime carotid stent system
in the U.S. 

Approval
of Investigational Device Exemption 

In
October 2024, the FDA approved the Company s IDE to initiate the CGUARDIANS II pivotal study of its CGuard Prime 80cm Carotid Stent
System during transcarotid revascularization (TCAR) procedures. 

Establishment
of U.S. Headquarters 

In
October 2024, we established our global headquarters in Miami, Florida to support the anticipated U.S, launch and commercialization of
the CGuard Prime carotid stent system.

Critical
Accounting Policies 

A
critical accounting policy is one that is both important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operation and requires
management s most difficult, subjective or complex judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect
of matters that are inherently uncertain. Our critical accounting policies are more fully described in both (i) Item 7. Management s
Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and (ii) Note 2 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial
Statements included in the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. There have not been any material changes
to such critical accounting policies since December 31, 2023.

Results
of Operations 

Three
months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023 

Revenues .
For the three months ended September 30, 2024, revenue increased by 254,000, or 16.3 , to 1,810,000, from 1,556,000 during the three
months ended September 30, 2023. This increase was predominantly driven by growth in existing and new markets. 

With
respect to geographical regions, the increase in revenue was primarily attributable to a 142,000 increase in Europe, a 109,000 increase
in Asia and a 13,000 increase in the Middle East, all for reasons mentioned in the paragraph above. This increase was offset by a 7,000
decrease in Latin America. 

Gross
Profit . For the three months ended September 30, 2024, gross profit (revenue less cost of revenues) decreased by 24,000, or 5.6 ,
to 414,000, from 438,000 during the three months ended September 30, 2023. This decrease in gross profit resulted from a 24,000 increase
in miscellaneous expense. Gross margin (gross profits as a percentage of revenue) decreased to 22.9 during the three months ended September
30, 2024, from 28.1 during the three months ended September 30, 2023, driven by the factors mentioned above. 

Research
and Development Expenses . For the three months ended September 30, 2024, research and development expenses increased by 1,805,000,
or 85.5 , to 3,915,000, from 2,110,000 during the three months ended September 30, 2023. This increase resulted primarily due to an
increase of 1,016,000 of SwitchGuard NPS development and regulatory approval process including expenses related to the IDE application
for the CGUARDIANS II pivotal study of the CGuard Prime 80cm Carotid Stent System, an increase in compensation expenses of 670,000,
mainly due to an increase of share-based compensation-related expenses and due to the hiring of the Executive Vice President and General
Manager of North America in connection with our expansion plans in the United States, an increase of 140,000 related to an early feasibility
study of CGuard Prime for the treatment of acute stroke patients with tandem lesions and an increase of 224,000 in miscellaneous expenses.
These increases were offset by a decrease of 245,000 in expenses associated with the C-Guardians FDA Study as the one-year follow-up
finalized in the second quarter of 2024 and the submission this quarter of the PMA application to the FDA. 

Selling
and Marketing Expenses . For the three months ended September 30, 2024, selling and marketing expenses increased by 596,000, or 68.0 ,
to 1,472,000, from 876,000 during the three months ended September 30, 2023. This increase resulted primarily from an increase in compensation
expenses of 524,000 as the Company build its U.S. commercial infrastructure to enter the U.S. market and an increase of 72,000 in miscellaneous
expenses. 

General
and Administrative Expenses . For the three months ended September 30, 2024, general and administrative expenses increased by 398,000,
or 12.9 , to 3,489,000, from 3,091,000 during the three months ended September 30, 2023. This increase resulted primarily from an increase
in compensation expenses of 354,000, mainly due to an increase of share-based compensation-related expenses and an increase of 44,000
in miscellaneous expenses. 

7 

Financial
Income . For the three months ended September 30, 2024, financial income increased by 111,000 or 24.1 , to 572,000, from 461,000
during the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in financial income primarily resulted from a 91,000 increase in interest
income from investment in marketable securities, money market funds and short-term bank deposits. 

Tax
Expenses. For the three months ended September 30, 2024, there was no material change in our tax expenses as compared to the three
months ended September 30, 2023. 

Net
Loss . Our net loss increased by 2,712,000, or 52.4 , to 7,890,000, for the three months ended September 30, 2024, from 5,178,000
during the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in net loss resulted primarily from an increase of 2,799,000 in operating
expenses. 

Nine
months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the Nine months ended September 30, 2023 

Revenues .
For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, revenue increased by 616,000, or 13.9 , to 5,060,000 from 4,444,000 during the nine
months ended September 30, 2023. This increase was mainly due to growth in existing and new markets, partially offset by a reduction
in clinical trial revenue driven by the conclusion of C-GUARDIANS enrollment in June 2023. 

With
respect to geographical regions, the increase in revenue was primarily attributable to a 614,000 increase in Europe, a 79,000 increase
in Asia, a 22,000 increase in Latin America and 6,000 in other territories for reasons mentioned above. This increase was offset by
a 104,000 decrease in the United States as we completed in June 2023 the enrollment of all patients in our C-Guardians IDE clinical
trial. 

Gross
Profit . For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, gross profit (revenue less cost of revenues) decreased by 20.4 , or 265,000,
to 1,037,000, compared to a 1,302,000 for the same period in 2023. This decrease in gross profit resulted from a 744,000 increase
in material and labor costs. This increase in cost was mainly due to higher sales volume, increased compensation expense for new and
current employees, additional space to build capacity for anticipated increased volume requirements and additional training expenses.
In addition, the increase resulted from 78,000 related to production facility downtime for maintenance, write-offs of 58,000 and 3,000
in miscellaneous expense. This decrease was offset by an increase of the revenues of 616,000 as described above. 

Gross
margin (gross profits as a percentage of revenue) decreased to 20.5 during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, from 29.3 during
the nine months ended September 30, 2023, driven by the factors mentioned above. 

Research
and Development Expenses . Research and Development Expenses . For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, research and development
expenses increased by 67.2 , or 3,995,000 to 9,941,000, from 5,946,000 during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. This increase
resulted primarily from an increase in compensation expenses of 2,032,000, mainly due to an increase of share-based compensation-related
expenses and due to the hiring of the Executive Vice President and General Manager of North America in connection with our expansion
plans in the United States, an increase of 1,518,000 of SwitchGuard NPS development and regulatory approval process including expenses
related to the IDE application for the CGUARDIANS II pivotal study of the CGuard Prime 80cm Carotid Stent System, an increase of 376,000
related to an early feasibility study of CGuard Prime for the treatment of acute stroke patients with tandem lesions, an increase of
 161,000 related to the establishment of operations in the United States and an increase of 394,000 in miscellaneous expenses. These
increases were offset by a decrease of 486,000 in expenses associated with the C-Guardians FDA Study as the one-year follow-up finalized
in the second quarter of 2024 and the submission this quarter of the PMA application to the U.S. FDA.

Selling
and Marketing Expenses . For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, selling and marketing expenses increased by 62.5 , or 1,598,000,
to 4,154,000, from 2,556,000 during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. This increase resulted primarily from an increase in
compensation expenses of 1,374,000 and an increase of 224,000 in miscellaneous expenses. 

General
and Administrative Expenses . For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, general and administrative expenses increased by 36.2 ,
or 2,944,000, to 11,079,000, from 8,135,000 during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. This increase resulted primarily from
an increase in share-based compensation expenses of 2,868,000 and an increase of 76,000 in miscellaneous expenses. 

Financial
Income . For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, financial income increased by 481,000, to 1,305,000 of financial income,
from 824,000 of financial income during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in financial income primarily resulted
from a 478,000 increase in interest income from investment in marketable securities, money market funds and short-term bank deposits. 

Tax
Expenses. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, there was no material change in our tax expenses as compared to the nine
months ended September 30, 2023. 

Net
Loss . Our net loss increased by 8,320,000, or 57.3 , to 22,831,000, for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, from 14,511,000
during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in net loss resulted primarily from an increase of 8,536,000 in operating
expenses and decrease of 265,000 in gross profit, offset by an increase of 481,000 in financial income. 

Liquidity
and Capital Resources 

We
had an accumulated deficit as of September 30, 2024, of 244 million, as well as a net loss of 22,831,000 and negative operating cash
flows. We expect to continue incurring losses and negative cash flows from operations until our product, CGuard EPS, reaches commercial
profitability. As a result of these expected losses and negative cash flows from operations, along with our current cash position, we
believe we do not have sufficient resources to fund operations for at least the next 12 months. Therefore, there is substantial doubt
about our ability to continue as a going concern. 

Our
plans include continued commercialization of our products and raising capital through sale of additional equity securities, debt or capital
inflows from strategic partnerships and exercise of warrants. There are no assurances, however, that we will be successful in obtaining
the level of financing needed for our operations. If we are unsuccessful in commercializing our products or raising capital, we may need
to reduce activities, curtail or cease operations. 

In
May 2023, we closed a private placement offering of 10,266,270 shares (the Private Placement Shares of our common stock,
pre-funded warrants (the Pre-Funded Warrants to purchase up to 15,561,894 shares of common stock and warrants to purchase
up to an aggregate of 51,656,328 shares of common stock, consisting of Series H warrants to purchase up to 12,914,086 shares of common
stock (the Series H Warrants ), Series I warrants to purchase up to 12,914,078 shares of common stock (the Series
I Warrants ), Series J warrants to purchase up to 12,914,086 shares of Common Stock (the Series J Warrants and Series
K warrants to purchase up to 12,914,086 shares of common stock (the Series K Warrants and together with the Series H Warrants,
Series I Warrants and Series J Warrants, the Warrants ), at an offering price of 1.6327 per Private Placement Share and
associated Warrants and an offering price of 1.6326 per Pre-Funded Warrant and associated Warrants that resulted in aggregate gross
proceeds of approximately 42.2 million, before deducting fees payable to the placement agent and other offering expenses payable by
us. If the Warrants issued in the private placement offering are exercised in cash in full this would result in an additional 71.4 million
of gross proceeds. 

In
May 2024, we entered into an Equity Distribution Agreement with Piper Sandler Co., as sales
agent Piper Sandler) to which we may offer and sell, from time to time, at our option, through or to Piper Sandler up to 17,000,000
shares of our common stock (the ATM Program ). As of the issuance date of this report, we have sold 134,316 shares
of our common stock for total gross proceeds of approximately 341 thousands under the ATM program. 

9 

During
June 2024, Series H warrants to purchase 12,914,086 shares of common stock were exercised in full into 292,996 of shares of common stock
and pre-funded warrants to purchase 12,621,090 shares of common stock. The net proceeds to the Company from the exercise of the Series
H Warrants were 16.9 million after deducting placement agent fees. 

Nine
months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the Nine months ended September 30, 2023 

General .
At September 30, 2024, we had cash and cash equivalents of 15,818,000 and marketable securities of 24,584,000, as compared to cash
and cash equivalents of 9,640,000 and marketable securities of 29,383,000 as of December 31, 2023. We have historically met our cash
needs through a combination of issuing new shares, borrowing activities and product sales. Our cash requirements are generally for research
and development, marketing and sales activities, finance and administrative costs, capital expenditures and general working capital. 

For
the nine months ended September 30, 2024, net cash used in our operating activities increased by 2,919,000, or 23.9 , to 15,118,000,
from 12,199,000 during the same period in 2023. The primary reason for the increase in cash used in our operating activities was an
increase of 2,276,000 in payments for third party related expenses and for professional services, an increase of 1,506,000 in compensation
costs paid during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, from 7,332,000 in the nine months ended September 30, 2023 to 8,838,000,
a decrease of 99,000 in interest income received from money market funds, marketable securities and bank deposits, offset in part by
an increase of 933,000 in payments received from customers. 

Cash
provided in our investing activities was 4,399,000 during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to cash used of 16,056,000
during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The primary reason for the increase in cash provided by our investing activities is
proceeds from matured marketable securities of 5,556,000, net of investment in marketable securities in the nine months ended September
30, 2024, compared to an investment in marketable securities of 28,838,000, offset by a withdrawal from short-term bank deposits, net
of investment in short-term deposits, of 18,500,000 in the nine months ended September 30, 2023 and by an increase of 925,000 in payments
made for purchase of property, plant and equipment during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 

Cash
provided by financing activities for the nine months September 30, 2024, was 16,889,000. The source of the cash provided by financing
activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, were the proceeds from exercise of Series H warrants. Cash provided by financing
activities for the nine months September 30, 2023, was 37,534,000. The source of the cash provided by financing activities during the
nine months ended September 30, 2023, were the proceeds from the Private Placement Offering in May 2023 that resulted in approximately
 37,534,000 of aggregate net proceeds. 

As
of September 30, 2024, our current assets exceeded our current liabilities by a multiple of 6.4. Current assets increased by 2,235,000
during the period and current liabilities increased by 1,245,000 during the period. As a result, our working capital increased by 990,000
to 39,129,000 as of September 30, 2024. 

Off
Balance Sheet Arrangements 

We
have no off-balance sheet transactions, arrangements, obligations (including contingent obligations) or other relationships with unconsolidated
entities or other persons that have, or may have, a material effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues
or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources. 

Factors
That May Affect Future Operations 

We
believe that our future operating results will continue to be subject to quarterly variations based upon a wide variety of factors, including
the cyclical nature of the ordering patterns of our distributors, timing of regulatory approvals, the implementation of various phases
of our clinical trials and manufacturing efficiencies due to the learning curve of utilizing new materials and equipment. Our operating
results could also be impacted by a weakening of the Euro and strengthening of the NIS, both against the U.S. dollar. Lastly, other economic
conditions we cannot foresee may affect customer demand, such as individual country reimbursement policies pertaining to our products.

Recently
Adopted and Issued Accounting Pronouncements 

See
Note 3 to our condensed financial statements in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for new accounting pronouncements
adopted.

Item
4. Controls and Procedures 

Management s
Conclusions Regarding Effectiveness of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

As
of September 30, 2024, we conducted an evaluation, under the supervision and participation of management including our chief executive
officer and chief financial officer, of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) and
Rule 15d-15(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended). There are inherent limitations to the effectiveness of any system
of disclosure controls and procedures. Accordingly, even effective disclosure controls and procedures can only provide reasonable assurance
of achieving their control objectives. 

Based
upon this evaluation, our chief executive officer and chief financial officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures are
effective at the reasonable assurance level as of September 30, 2024. 

Changes
in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 

There
were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the fiscal quarter ended September 30, 2024, that materially
affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 

PART
II - OTHER INFORMATION 

Item
1. Legal Proceedings 

From
time to time, we may become involved in various lawsuits and legal proceedings, which arise in the ordinary course of business. Litigation
is subject to inherent uncertainties, and an adverse result in these or other matters may arise from time to time that may harm our business.
There are currently no pending material legal proceedings, and we are currently not aware of any legal proceedings or claims against
us or our property that we believe will have any significant effect on our business, financial position or operating results. 

Item
1A. Risk Factors 

Except
as set forth below in this Item 1A and the Risk Factors included in our previous filings made with the SEC, there have been no material
changes to our risk factors from those disclosed in Part I. Item 1A. Risk Factors in the Form 10-K filed with the SEC on
March 5, 2024. 

Management
has concluded that there is substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern, and our condensed financial statements
for the quarter ended September 30, 2024 includes an explanatory paragraph as to our ability to continue as a going concern, which could
prevent us from obtaining new financing on reasonable terms or at all. 

Because
we have had recurring losses and negative cash flows from operating activities, substantial doubt exists regarding our ability to remain
as a going concern at the same level at which we are currently performing. Accordingly, our condensed financial statements for the quarter
ended September 30, 2024 includes an explanatory paragraph as to our potential inability to continue as a going concern. The doubts regarding
our potential ability to continue as a going concern may adversely affect our ability to obtain new financing on reasonable terms or
at all.

If
there are significant shifts in the political, economic and military conditions in Israel and its neighbors, it could have a material
adverse effect on our business relationships and profitability. 

Our
executive office, sole manufacturing facility and certain of our key personnel are located in Israel. Our business is directly affected
by the political, economic and military conditions in Israel and its neighbors. Since the establishment of the State of Israel in 1948,
a number of armed conflicts have occurred between Israel and its Arab neighbors. 

In
October 2023, Hamas terrorists infiltrated Israel s southern border from the Gaza Strip and conducted a series of attacks on civilian
and military targets. Hamas also launched extensive rocket attacks on Israeli population and industrial centers located along Israel s
border with the Gaza Strip and in other areas within the State of Israel. These attacks resulted in extensive deaths, injuries and kidnapping
of civilians and soldiers. Following the attack, Israel s security cabinet declared war against Hamas and a military campaign against
these terrorist organizations commenced in parallel to their continued rocket and terror attacks. In addition, since the commencement
of these events, there have been continued hostilities along Israel s northern border with Lebanon (with the Hezbollah terror organization)
and on other fronts from various extremist groups in region, such as the Houthis in Yemen and various rebel militia groups in Syria and
Iraq. In addition, Iran recently launched direct attacks on Israel involving hundreds of drones and missiles and has threatened to continue
to attack Israel and is widely believed to be developing nuclear weapons. Iran is also believed to have a strong influence among extremist
groups in the region, such as Hamas in Gaza, Hezbollah in Lebanon, the Houthi movement in Yemen and various rebel militia groups in Syria
and Iraq. These situations may potentially escalate in the future to more violent events which may affect Israel and us. Additionally,
Yemeni rebel group, the Houthis, launched series of attacks on global shipping routes in the Red Sea, causing disruptions of supply chain.
Such clashes may escalate in the future into a greater regional conflict. 

In
connection with the Israeli security cabinet s declaration of war against Hamas and possible hostilities with other organizations,
several hundred thousand Israeli military reservists were drafted to perform immediate military service, including five of our full time
employees in Israel. Although many of such military reservists have since been released, including the majority of our employees, they
may be called up for additional reserve duty, depending on developments in the war in Gaza and along Israel s other borders. Military
service call ups that result in absences of personnel from us for an extended period of time may materially and adversely affect our
business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations. As of the date hereof, we currently have 62 full-time employees located
in Israel and 18 employees located outside of Israel. 

Since
the war broke out on October 7, 2023, our operations have not been adversely affected by this situation, and we have not experienced
disruptions to our clinical studies. None of the clinical sites currently participating in our clinical studies are located in Israel
however we currently manufacture our CGuard at our facility in Tel Aviv, Israel. If there were a disruption to our existing manufacturing
facility or our ability to procure raw materials and ship our products, we would have no other means of manufacturing and distributing
CGuard until we were able to restore the manufacturing and distribution capability at our facility or develop alternative manufacturing
facilities and distribution capabilities. 

The
intensity and duration of the current security situation in Israel is difficult to predict at this stage, as are such war s economic
implications on the Company s business and operations and on Israel s economy in general, and
we continue to monitor the situation closely and examine the potential disruptions that could adversely affect our operations . 

Our
commercial insurance does not cover losses that may occur as a result of events associated with war and terrorism. Although the Israeli
government currently covers the reinstatement value of direct damages that are caused by terrorist attacks or acts of war, we cannot
assure you that this government coverage will be maintained or that it will sufficiently cover our potential damages. Any losses or damages
incurred by us could have a material adverse effect on our business. Any armed conflicts or political instability in the region would
likely negatively affect business conditions and could harm our results of operations. 

The
continued political instability and hostilities between Israel and its neighbors and any future armed conflict, terrorist activity or
political instability in the region could adversely affect our operations in Israel and adversely affect the market price of our shares
of common stock. In addition, several organizations and countries may restrict doing business with Israel and Israeli companies have
been and are today subjected to economic boycotts. The interruption or curtailment of trade between Israel and its present trading partners
could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. 

Finally,
political conditions within Israel may affect our operations. Israel has held five general elections between 2019 and 2022, and prior
to October 2023, the Israeli government pursued extensive changes to Israel s judicial system, which sparked extensive political
debate and unrest. To date, these initiatives have been substantially put on hold. Actual or perceived political instability in Israel
or any negative changes in the political environment, may individually or in the aggregate adversely affect the Israeli economy and,
in turn, our business, financial condition, results of operations and growth prospects.
