FINANCIAL REVIEW 
 T HE PNC F INANCIAL S ERVICES G ROUP , I NC . 
 
 This Financial Review, including the Consolidated Financial Highlights, should be read together with our unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements and unaudited Statistical Information included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q (the Report or Form 10-Q and with Items 6, 7, 8 and 9A of our 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K (our 2023 Form 10-K ). For information regarding certain business, regulatory and legal risks, see the following: the Risk Management section of this Financial Review and of Item 7 in our 2023 Form 10-K; Item 1A Risk Factors included in our 2023 Form 10-K; and the Commitments and Legal Proceedings Notes included in this Report and in our first and second quarter 2024 Form 10-Qs and Item 8 of our 2023 Form 10-K. Also, see the Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Information section in this Financial Review and the Critical Accounting Estimates and Judgments section in this Financial Review and in our 2023 Form 10-K for certain other factors that could cause actual results or future events to differ, perhaps materially, from historical performance and from those anticipated in the forward-looking statements included in this Report. See Note 14 Segment Reporting for a reconciliation of total business segment earnings to total PNC consolidated net income as reported on a GAAP basis. In this Report, PNC, we or us refers to The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. and its subsidiaries on a consolidated basis (except when referring to PNC as a public company, its common stock or other securities issued by PNC, which just refer to The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.). References to The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. or to any of its subsidiaries are specifically made where applicable. 
 
 See page 102 for a glossary of certain terms and acronyms used in this Report. 

E XECUTIVE S UMMARY 
 
 Headquartered in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, we are one of the largest diversified financial institutions in the U.S. We have businesses engaged in retail banking, including residential mortgage, corporate and institutional banking and asset management, providing many of our products and services nationally. Our retail branch network is located coast-to-coast. We also have strategic international offices in four countries outside the U.S. 
 
 Key Strategic Goals 
 At PNC we manage our company for the long term. We are focused on the fundamentals of growing customers, loans, deposits and revenue and improving profitability, while investing for the future and managing risk, expenses and capital. We continue to invest in our products, markets and brand, and embrace our commitments to our customers, shareholders, employees and the communities where we do business. 
 
 We strive to serve our customers and expand and deepen relationships by offering a broad range of deposit, credit and fee-based products and services. We are focused on delivering those products and services to our customers with the goal of addressing their financial objectives and needs. Our business model is built on customer loyalty and engagement, understanding our customers financial goals and offering our diverse products and services to help them achieve financial well-being. Our approach is concentrated on organically growing and deepening client relationships across our businesses that meet our risk/return measures. 
 
 We are focused on our strategic priorities, which are designed to enhance value over the long term, and consist of: 
 Expanding our leading banking franchise to new markets and digital platforms, 
 Deepening customer relationships by delivering a superior banking experience and financial solutions, and 
 Leveraging technology to create efficiencies that help us better serve customers. 
 
 Our capital and liquidity priorities are to support customers, fund business investments and return excess capital to shareholders, while maintaining appropriate capital and liquidity in light of economic conditions, the Basel III framework and other regulatory expectations. For more detail, see the Capital and Liquidity Highlights portion of this Executive Summary, the Liquidity and Capital Management portion of the Risk Management section of this Financial Review and the Supervision and Regulation section in Item 1 Business of our 2023 Form 10-K. 
 
 Signature Bank Portfolio Acquisition 
 
 On October 2, 2023, PNC acquired a portfolio of capital commitments facilities from Signature Bridge Bank, N.A. through an agreement with the FDIC as receiver of the former Signature Bank, New York. The acquired portfolio represented approximately 16.0 billion in total commitments, including approximately 9.0 billion of funded loans, at the time of acquisition. 
 
 Workforce Reduction 
 
 During the fourth quarter of 2023, PNC implemented a workforce reduction that is expected to reduce 2024 personnel expense by approximately 325 million, on a pre-tax basis. PNC incurred expenses of 150 million in the fourth quarter of 2023 in connection with this workforce reduction. 

1 The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. Form 10-Q 

FDIC Special Assessment 
 
 In November 2023, the FDIC approved a final rule to implement a special assessment to recover the loss to the Deposit Insurance Fund associated with protecting uninsured depositors following the closures of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank. As a result, PNC incurred a pre-tax expense of 515 million during the fourth quarter of 2023. In the first quarter of 2024, PNC incurred an additional pre-tax expense of 130 million related to the increase in the FDIC s expected losses. As of September 30, 2024, we have not recorded any further incremental expense related to recent FDIC assessments. 
 
 Second Quarter 2024 Significant Items 
 
 In the second quarter of 2024, PNC participated in the Visa exchange program, allowing PNC to convert its Visa Class B-1 common shares into approximately equal amounts of Visa Class B-2 common shares and Visa Class C common shares. This conversion event resulted in a gain of 754 million related to the Visa Class C common shares received. PNC retained the Visa Class B-2 common shares. The second quarter of 2024 also included Visa Class B-2 derivative fair value adjustments of negative 116 million and a 120 million expense related to a PNC Foundation contribution. During the second quarter, PNC also repositioned the investment securities portfolio, selling low-yielding investment securities for net proceeds of 3.8 billion, resulting in a loss of 497 million. PNC redeployed the full proceeds from the sale into higher-yielding investment securities. The combined impact to pre-tax noninterest income and pre-tax noninterest expense was 141 million and 120 million, respectively. 
 
 Hurricanes Helene and Milton 
 
 During the last week of September 2024, Hurricane Helene made landfall in Florida s panhandle, impacting a large region of the southeastern United States, including the southern Appalachians. In the second week of October 2024, Hurricane Milton made landfall on the central west coast of Florida, causing widespread damage across the state. The storms resulted in property damage to our customers, the closing or disruption of many businesses, including some of PNC s branches and facilities and damage to the community infrastructure. We continue to evaluate the impact to our businesses, and, based on our assessments to date, we do not expect these storms to have a material impact on our operating results, including credit losses.

Income Statement Highlights 
 
 Net income of 1.5 billion, or 3.49 per diluted common share, for the third quarter of 2024 increased 28 million, or 2 , compared to 1.5 billion, or 3.39 per diluted common share, for the second quarter of 2024 primarily due to higher net interest income, partially offset by lower noninterest income. 
 For the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three months ended June 30, 2024: 
 Total revenue of 5.4 billion was stable. 
 Net interest income of 3.4 billion increased 108 million, or 3 , driven by higher yields on interest-earning assets. 
 Net interest margin increased 4 basis points to 2.64 . 
 Noninterest income decreased 87 million, or 4 , as lower other noninterest income was partially offset by strong capital markets and advisory revenue. Other noninterest income included Visa derivative fair value adjustments of negative 128 million, primarily related to litigation escrow funding. The second quarter of 2024 included the benefit of 141 million of significant items. 
 Provision for credit losses of 243 million in the third quarter of 2024 primarily reflected the impact of portfolio activity. The second quarter of 2024 included a provision for credit losses of 235 million. 
 Noninterest expense decreased 30 million to 3.3 billion as increased personnel costs, reflecting higher variable compensation related to increased business activity, were more than offset by a PNC Foundation contribution expense of 120 million in the second quarter of 2024. 
 
 Net income of 4.3 billion, or 9.98 per diluted common share, for the first nine months of 2024 decreased 438 million, or 9 , compared to 4.8 billion, or 10.94 per diluted common share, for the first nine months of 2023 primarily driven by lower net interest income and a higher provision for credit losses, partially offset by higher noninterest income. 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023: 
 Total revenue decreased 141 million, to 16.0 billion. 
 Net interest income decreased 537 million, or 5 , as the benefit of higher interest-earning asset yields was more than offset by increased funding costs. 
 Net interest margin decreased 18 basis points. 
 Noninterest income increased 396 million, or 7 , primarily driven by higher capital markets and advisory fees. 
 Provision for credit losses of 633 million in the first nine months of 2024 reflected the impact of portfolio activity partially offset by an improved macroeconomic outlook. The first nine months of 2023 included a provision for credit losses of 510 million. 
 Noninterest expense increased 80 million compared to the first nine months of 2023 primarily due to a 130 million pre-tax expense in the first quarter of 2024 related to the increase in the FDIC s expected losses, as well as a second quarter PNC Foundation contribution expense. 
 
 For additional detail, see the Consolidated Income Statement Review section of this Financial Review. 
 
 Balance Sheet Highlights 
 Our balance sheet was strong and well positioned at September 30, 2024. In comparison to December 31, 2023: 
 Total assets of 564.9 billion were stable reflecting higher securities balances, partially offset by lower balances held with the Federal Reserve Bank. 
 Total loans of 321.4 billion were stable. 
 Total commercial loans increased 1.2 billion to 220.7 billion due to new production, largely related to multifamily agency warehouse lending. 
 Total consumer loans decreased 1.3 billion to 100.7 billion, as growth in automobile loans was more than offset by declines in the remaining portfolios as paydowns outpaced originations as well as lower utilization. 
 Investment securities increased 11.6 billion, or 9 , to 144.2 billion due to increased net purchase activity, primarily of U.S. Treasury securities, partially offset by portfolio paydowns and maturities. 
 Interest-earning deposits with banks, primarily with the Federal Reserve Bank, decreased 8.8 billion, or 20 , to 35.0 billion, driven by higher securities balances and lower borrowed funds. 
 Total deposits increased 2.5 billion, or 1 , to 424.0 billion reflecting higher interest-bearing deposits, partially offset by lower noninterest-bearing deposits. Interest-bearing deposits increased reflecting higher commercial balances, partially offset by lower consumer balances. Noninterest-bearing deposit balances decreased due to a decline in both commercial and consumer balances. 
 Borrowed funds decreased 4.7 billion, or 6 , to 68.1 billion due to lower FHLB borrowings, partially offset by parent company senior debt issuances. 
 
 For additional detail, see the Consolidated Balance Sheet Review section of this Financial Review.

Credit Quality Highlights 
 
 The third quarter of 2024 reflected relatively stable credit quality performance. 
 At September 30, 2024 compared to December 31, 2023: 
 Overall loan delinquencies of 1.3 billion decreased 109 million, or 8 , driven by lower consumer and commercial loan delinquencies. 
 The ACL related to loans, which consists of the ALLL and the allowance for unfunded lending related commitments, totaled 5.3 billion and 5.5 billion at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. The decrease in the comparison was driven by improved macroeconomic factors as well as portfolio activity. ACL to total loans was 1.65 and 1.70 at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. 
 Nonperforming assets increased 0.4 billion, or 18 , to 2.6 billion, primarily due to higher commercial real estate nonperforming loans. 
 Net loan charge-offs of 286 million, or 0.36 of average loans, in the third quarter of 2024 increased 24 million compared to the second quarter of 2024, primarily due to lower commercial recoveries.

 Capital and Liquidity Highlights 
 
 We maintained our strong capital and liquidity positions. 
 Common shareholders equity of 49.4 billion at September 30, 2024 increased 4.5 billion compared to December 31, 2023, due to the benefit of net income and an improvement in AOCI, partially offset by common dividends paid and common shares repurchased. 
 In the third quarter of 2024, PNC returned 0.8 billion of capital to shareholders, including more than 0.6 billion of dividends on common shares and more than 0.1 billion of common share repurchases. 
 Consistent with the SCB framework, which allows for capital return in amounts in excess of the SCB minimum levels, our Board of Directors has authorized a repurchase framework under the previously approved repurchase program of up to 100 million common shares, of which approximately 43 were still available for repurchase at September 30, 2024. Fourth quarter 2024 share repurchase activity is expected to approximate recent quarterly average share repurchase levels. PNC may adjust share repurchase activity depending on market and economic conditions, as well as other factors. PNC s SCB for the four-quarter period beginning October 1, 2024 is the regulatory minimum of 2.5 . 
 On October 3, 2024, the PNC Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend on common stock of 1.60 per share to be paid on November 5, 2024 to shareholders of record at the close of business October 16, 2024. 
 Our CET1 ratio increased to 10.3 at September 30, 2024 from 9.9 at December 31, 2023. 
 PNC elected a five-year transition provision effective March 31, 2020 to delay until December 31, 2021 the full impact of the CECL standard on regulatory capital, followed by a three-year transition period. Effective for the first quarter of 2022, PNC is now in the three-year transition period, and the full impact of the CECL standard is being phased-in to regulatory capital through December 31, 2024. The fully implemented ratios reflect the full impact of CECL and exclude the benefits of this transition provision. The estimated CET1 fully implemented ratio was 10.3 at September 30, 2024 compared to 9.8 at December 31, 2023. 
 
 PNC s ability to take certain capital actions, including returning capital to shareholders, is subject to PNC meeting or exceeding an SCB established by the Federal Reserve Board in connection with the Federal Reserve Board s CCAR process. For additional information on our liquidity and capital actions as well as our capital ratios, see Capital Management in the Risk Management section in this Financial Review, the Recent Regulatory Developments section in this Financial Review and the Supervision and Regulation section in our 2023 Form 10-K. 
 
 Business Outlook 
 Statements regarding our business outlook are forward-looking within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Our forward-looking financial statements are subject to the risk that economic and financial market conditions will be substantially different than those we are currently expecting and do not take into account potential legal and regulatory contingencies. These statements are based on our views that: 
 Job and income gains will continue to support consumer spending growth in the near term, but PNC s baseline forecast is for slower economic growth at the end of 2024 and in the first half of 2025 as high interest rates remain a drag on the economy. 
 Real GDP growth this year will trend close to 2 , and the unemployment rate will remain somewhat above 4 through the rest of 2024 and in 2025. Inflation will continue to slow as wage pressures abate, gradually moving back to the Federal Reserve s 2 long-term objective. 
 With slowing inflation PNC expects two additional federal funds rate cuts of 25 basis points each at the FOMC s remaining 
 The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. Form 10-Q 5 

meetings in 2024, with the rate ending this year in a range between 4.25 and 4.50 . PNC expects several federal funds rate cuts in 2025 as inflation continues to ease. 
 
 Consistent with the forward guidance we provided on October 15, 2024, for the fourth quarter of 2024, compared to the third quarter of 2024, we expect: 
 Average loans to be stable, 
 Net interest income to be up approximately 1 , 
 Fee income to be down 5 to 7 , 
 Other noninterest income to be 150 million to 200 million, 
 Total revenue to be stable, 
 Noninterest expense to be up 2 to 3 , 
 Net loan charge-offs to be approximately 300 million. 
 
 Other noninterest income and total revenue guidance does not forecast net securities gains or losses and other Visa activity. 
 
 We are unable to provide a meaningful or accurate reconciliation of forward-looking non-GAAP measures, without unreasonable effort, to their most directly comparable GAAP financial measures. This is due to the inherent difficulty of forecasting the timing and amounts necessary for the reconciliation, when such amounts are subject to events that cannot be reasonably predicted, as noted in our Cautionary Statement. Accordingly, we cannot address the probable significance of unavailable information. 
 
 See the Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Information section in this Financial Review and Item 1A Risk Factors included in our 2023 Form 10-K for other factors that could cause future events to differ, perhaps materially, from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements.

 Our Consolidated Income Statement is presented in Item 1 of this Report. 
 
 Net income of 1.5 billion, or 3.49 per diluted common share, for the third quarter of 2024 increased 28 million, or 2 , compared to 1.5 billion, or 3.39 per diluted common share, for the second quarter of 2024, primarily due to higher net interest income and strong capital markets and advisory revenue, partially offset by lower other noninterest income. Net income of 4.3 billion, or 9.98 per diluted common share, for the first nine months of 2024 decreased 438 million, or 9 , compared to 4.8 billion, or 10.94 per diluted common share, for the same period in 2023 driven by lower net interest income and a higher provision for credit losses, partially offset by higher noninterest income.

 (a) Interest income calculated as taxable-equivalent interest income. To provide more meaningful comparisons of interest income and yields for all interest-earning assets, as well as net interest margins, we use interest income on a taxable-equivalent basis in calculating average yields and net interest margins by increasing the interest income earned on tax-exempt assets to make it fully equivalent to interest income earned on taxable investments. This adjustment is not permitted under GAAP on the Consolidated Income Statement. For more information, see Reconciliation of Taxable-Equivalent Net Interest Income (non-GAAP) in the Statistical Information (Unaudited) section in Item 1 of this Report. 
 
 Changes in net interest income and margin result from the interaction of the volume and composition of interest-earning assets and related yields, interest-bearing liabilities and related rates paid, and noninterest-bearing sources of funding. See the Statistical 
 The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. Form 10-Q 7 

Information (Unaudited) Average Consolidated Balance Sheet And Net Interest Analysis section of this Report for additional information. 
 
 Net interest income increased 108 million, or 3 , and net interest margin increased 4 basis points compared to the second quarter of 2024 driven by higher yields on interest-earning assets. In the year-to-date comparison, net interest income decreased 537 million, or 5 , and net interest margin decreased 18 basis points, as the benefit of higher interest-earning asset yields was more than offset by increased funding costs. 
 
 Average investment securities increased 1.0 billion, or 1 , compared to the second quarter of 2024 primarily driven by net purchase activity of U.S. Treasury securities. Average investment securities decreased 1.7 billion, or 1 , in the year-to-date comparison as net purchase activity was more than offset by portfolio paydowns and maturities. Average investment securities represented 28 of average interest-earning assets for the third and second quarters of 2024, and 27 for the first nine months of 2024 compared to 28 for the first nine months of 2023. 
 
 Average loans were stable for the third quarter of 2024 compared to the second quarter of 2024. Compared to the first nine months of 2023, average loans decreased 3.1 billion, primarily due to lower average utilization of commercial loan commitments. Average loans represented 62 of average interest-earning assets for the third quarter of 2024 compared to 63 for the second quarter of 2024, and 62 for the first nine months of 2024 compared to 64 for the first nine months of 2023. 
 
 Average interest-earning deposits with banks for the third quarter of 2024 increased 4.2 billion, or 10 , compared to the second quarter of 2024, primarily reflecting deposit growth. In the year-to-date comparison, average interest-earning deposits with banks increased 10.3 billion, or 30 , due to higher borrowed funds and lower loan and securities balances, partially offset by lower deposits. 
 
 Average interest-bearing deposits for the third quarter of 2024 increased 5.4 billion, or 2 , compared to the second quarter of 2024 and 8.8 billion, or 3 , in the year-to-date comparison. The increase in both comparisons reflected growth in commercial deposits, partially offset by a decline in consumer balances. In total, average interest-bearing deposits represented 81 of average interest-bearing liabilities for both the third and second quarters of 2024, and 81 for the first nine months of 2024 compared to 83 , for the first nine months of 2023. 
 
 Average borrowed funds decreased 1.4 billion, or 2 , compared to the second quarter of 2024, reflecting lower FHLB borrowings, partially offset by parent company senior debt issuances. Compared to the first nine months of 2023, average borrowed funds increased 11.0 billion, or 17 , primarily due to parent company senior debt issuances.

Asset management and brokerage fees increased compared to the second quarter of 2024, reflecting higher average equity markets. The increase in the year-to-date comparison reflected the impact of higher average equity markets as well as higher annuity sales. PNC s discretionary client assets under management of 214 billion at September 30, 2024 increased from 196 billion and 176 billion at June 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023, respectively. In both comparisons, the increase was primarily due to higher spot equity and fixed income markets. 
 
 Capital markets and advisory fees increased compared to the second quarter of 2024, and included higher merger and acquisition advisory activity, increased asset backed financing revenue and higher underwriting fees. The increase in the year-to-date comparison was primarily due to higher merger and acquisition advisory activity and increased underwriting fees. 
 
 Card and cash management revenue decreased compared to the second quarter of 2024 reflecting the impact of credit card origination incentives, partially offset by higher treasury management product revenue. The increase compared to the first nine months of 2023 was primarily due to higher treasury management product revenue. 
 
 Lending and deposit services grew in both the quarterly and year-to-date comparisons primarily due to increased customer activity. 
 
 Residential and commercial mortgage increased compared to the second quarter of 2024 driven by higher residential mortgage servicing rights valuation, net of economic hedge. The decrease compared to the first nine months of 2023 was driven by lower residential and commercial mortgage banking activities. 
 
 Other noninterest income decreased compared to the second quarter of 2024 reflecting Visa derivative fair value adjustments of negative 128 million in the third quarter of 2024, primarily related to litigation escrow funding, while the second quarter of 2024 included the benefit of 141 million of significant items. Compared to the first nine months of 2023, the increase was driven by the benefit of significant items in the second quarter of 2024.

 Noninterest expense decreased compared to the second quarter of 2024 as increased personnel costs, reflecting higher variable compensation related to increased business activity, were more than offset by a PNC Foundation contribution expense of 120 million in the second quarter of 2024. Noninterest expense increased compared to the first nine months of 2023 due to a 130 million pre-tax expense in the first quarter of 2024 related to the increase in the FDIC s expected losses following the closures of Silicon Bank and Signature Bank, as well as the second quarter PNC Foundation contribution expense. 
 
 Effective Income Tax Rate 
 
 The effective income tax rate was 19.2 in the third quarter of 2024 compared to 18.8 for the second quarter of 2024, and 18.9 in the first nine months of 2024 compared to 16.1 for the same period in 2023.

 Our balance sheet was well positioned at September 30, 2024. In comparison to December 31, 2023: 
 Total assets were stable reflecting higher securities balances, partially offset by lower balances held with the Federal Reserve Bank. 
 Total liabilities were stable. 
 Total equity increased due to the benefit of net income and an improvement in AOCI, partially offset by dividends paid and common shares repurchased. 
 
 The ACL related to loans totaled 5.3 billion and 5.5 billion at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. The decrease in the comparison was driven by improved macroeconomic factors as well as portfolio activity. See the following for additional information regarding our ACL related to loans:

 For additional information regarding our loan portfolio see the Credit Risk Management portion of the Risk Management section in this Financial Review and Note 3 Loans and Related Allowance for Credit Losses. 
 
 Investment Securities 
 
 Investment securities of 144.2 billion at September 30, 2024 increased 11.6 billion, or 9 , compared to December 31, 2023 due to increased net purchase activity, primarily of U.S. Treasury securities, partially offset by portfolio paydowns and maturities. 
 
 In the second quarter of 2024, we repositioned the investment securities portfolio and sold available for sale securities with a market value of 3.8 billion and a weighted average yield of approximately 1.5 . The sale of these securities resulted in a loss of 497 million. We deployed the sale proceeds into available-for-sale securities with a market value of 3.8 billion and a weighted average yield of approximately 5.5 . 
 
 The level and composition of the investment securities portfolio fluctuates over time based on many factors, including market conditions, loan and deposit growth and balance sheet management activities. We manage our investment securities portfolio to optimize returns, while providing a reliable source of liquidity for our banking and other activities, considering the LCR, NSFR and other internal and external guidelines and constraints.

 Table 9 presents our investment securities portfolio by amortized cost and fair value. The relationship of fair value to amortized cost at September 30, 2024 primarily reflected the impact of higher interest rates on the valuation of fixed-rate securities. We continually monitor the credit risk in our portfolio and maintain the allowance for investment securities at an appropriate level to absorb expected credit losses on our investment securities portfolio for the remaining contractual term of the securities adjusted for expected prepayments. See Note 2 Investment Securities for additional details regarding the allowance for investment securities. 
 
 The duration of investment securities was 3.3 years and 4.2 years at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. We estimate that at September 30, 2024 the effective duration of investment securities was 3.3 years for an immediate 50 basis points parallel increase in interest rates and 3.3 years for an immediate 50 basis points parallel decrease in interest rates. Comparable amounts at December 31, 2023 for the effective duration of investment securities were 4.1 years and 4.2 years, respectively. 
 
 Based on expected prepayment speeds, the weighted-average expected maturity of the investment securities portfolio was 5.2 years and 5.5 years at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively.

 Deposits are considered an attractive source of funding due to their stability and relatively low cost to fund. Compared to December 31, 2023, our funding source composition included lower borrowed funds and higher deposit balances. 
 
 Total deposits increased reflecting higher interest-bearing deposits, partially offset by lower noninterest-bearing deposits. Interest-bearing deposits increased reflecting higher commercial balances, partially offset by lower consumer balances. Noninterest-bearing deposit balances decreased due to a decline in both commercial and consumer balances. This shift in deposit composition contributed to an increase in funding costs compared to the first and second quarters of 2024. Our total brokered deposit balances of 10.1 billion at September 30, 2024 decreased compared to 11.0 billion at December 31, 2023, and were significantly below both our internal and regulatory guidelines and limits. 
 
 Borrowed funds decreased due to lower FHLB borrowings, partially offset by parent company senior debt issuances. 
 
 The level and composition of borrowed funds fluctuates over time based on many factors, including market conditions, capital considerations, and funding needs, which are primarily driven by changes in loan, deposit and investment securities balances. While our largest source of liquidity on a consolidated basis is the customer deposit base generated by our banking businesses, we also manage our borrowed funds to provide a reliable source of liquidity for our banking and other activities, considering our LCR and NSFR requirements and other internal and external guidelines and constraints. See the Liquidity and Capital Management portion of the Risk Management section in this Financial Review for additional information regarding our liquidity and capital acti vities. See Note 7 Borrowed Funds in this Report and Note 9 Borrowed Funds in our 2023 Form 10-K for additional information related to our borrowings. See Average Consolidated Balance Sheet and Net Interest Analysis in the Statistical Information section of this Report for additional information on volume and related funding cost changes. 
 Shareholders Equity 
 Total shareholders equity of 55.7 billion at September 30, 2024 increased 4.6 billion compared to December 31, 2023, primarily due to net income of 4.3 billion and an improvement in AOCI of 2.6 billion, partially offset by dividends paid of 2.2 billion and 0.4 billion of common share repurchases.

 We have three reportable business segments: 
 Retail Banking 
 Corporate Institutional Banking 
 Asset Management Group 
 
 Total business segment financial results differ from total consolidated net income. The impact of these differences is reflected in Other, as shown in Table 79 in Note 14 Segment Reporting. Other includes residual activities that do not meet the criteria for disclosure as a separate reportable business, such as asset and liability management activities including net securities gains or losses, ACL for investment securities, certain trading activities, certain runoff consumer loan portfolios, private equity investments, intercompany eliminations, corporate overhead net of allocations, tax adjustments that are not allocated to business segments, exited businesses and the residual impact from FTP operations. 
 
 Certain amounts included in this Business Segments Review differ from those amounts shown in Note 14, primarily due to the presentation in this Financial Review of business net interest income on a taxable-equivalent basis. 
 
 See Note 14 Segment Reporting for additional information on our business segments, including a description of each business.

 Retail Banking earnings for the first nine months of 2024 increased 1.3 billion compared to the same period in 2023 primarily due to higher revenue and lower noninterest expense. 
 
 Net interest income increased in the comparison primarily due to wider interest rate spreads on the value of deposits, partially offset by declines in average deposit balances. 
 
 Noninterest income increased in the comparison reflecting a gain resulting from PNC s participation in the Visa exchange program as well as higher asset management and brokerage fees, partially offset by lower card and cash management fees. 
 
 Provision for credit losses for the first nine months of 2024 reflected the impact of portfolio activity, partially offset by an improved macroeconomic outlook. 
 
 Noninterest expense decreased in the comparison and included lower personnel expense. 
 
 Retail Banking average total loans remained stable in the first nine months of 2024 compared to the same period in 2023. Average consumer loans decreased driven by lower residential real estate, as a result of paydowns outpacing new volume, as well as continued declines in education loans from runoff in the government guaranteed portfolio. Average commercial loans increased due to higher loan commitment utilization, primarily within the automobile dealer segment. 
 
 Our focus on growing primary customer relationships is at the core of our deposit strategy in Retail Banking, which is based on attracting and retaining stable, low-cost deposits as a key funding source for PNC. We have taken a disciplined approach to pricing, focused on retaining relationship-based balances and executing on targeted deposit growth and retention strategies aimed at more rate-sensitive customers. Our goal with regard to deposits is to optimize balances, economics and long-term customer growth. In the first nine months of 2024, average total deposits decreased compared to the same period in 2023, and included the impact of quantitative tightening by the Federal Reserve and increased customer spending. 
 
 Retail Banking continues to enhance the customer experience with refinements to product and service offerings that drive value for consumers and small businesses, including our recently launched new PNC Cash Unlimited credit card. 
 
 As part of our strategic focus on growing customers and meeting their financial needs, we operate and continue to optimize a coast-to-coast network of retail branches and ATMs, which are complemented by PNC s suite of digital capabilities. In February 2024, PNC announced it would be investing nearly 1.0 billion, through 2028, to open more than 100 new branches in key locations, including Austin, Dallas, Denver, Houston, Miami, and San Antonio, and to renovate more than 1,200 existing locations across the country to enhance the customer experience.

 Corporate Institutional Banking earnings in the first nine months of 2024 increased 528 million compared to the same period in 2023 driven by higher revenue, partially offset by a higher provision for credit losses. 
 
 Net interest income increased in the comparison primarily due to wider interest rate spreads on the value of deposits, partially offset by narrower interest rate spreads on the value of loans and lower average loan balances. 
 
 Noninterest income increased in the comparison and included higher capital markets and advisory fees and growth in treasury management product revenue. 
 
 Provision for credit losses for the first nine months of 2024 reflected the impact of portfolio activity, partially offset by an improved macroeconomic outlook. 
 
 Noninterest expense increased in the comparison largely due to higher variable costs associated with increased business activity and continued investments to support growth. 
 
 Average total loans were stable compared with the nine months ended September 30, 2023: 
 Corporate Banking provides lending, equipment finance, treasury management and capital markets products and services to 
 mid-sized and large corporations, and government and not-for-profit entities. Average loans for this business were stable as lower average utilization of loan commitments was largely offset by the acquisition of capital commitment facilities from Signature Bridge Bank in the fourth quarter of 2023. 
 Real Estate provides banking, financing and servicing solutions for commercial real estate clients across the country. Average loans for this business declined largely due to paydowns outpacing new production, partially offset by a higher average utilization of loan commitments. 
 Business Credit provides asset-based lending and equipment financing solutions. The loan and lease portfolio is mainly secured by business assets. Average loans for this business declined reflecting a lower average utilization of loan commitments. 
 Commercial Banking provides lending, treasury management and capital markets products and services to smaller corporations and businesses. Average loans for this business declined driven by paydowns outpacing new production and lower average utilization of loan commitments. 
 
 The deposit strategy of Corporate Institutional Banking is to remain disciplined on pricing and focused on growing and retaining relationship-based balances over time, executing on customer and segment-specific deposit growth strategies and continuing to provide funding and liquidity to PNC. Average total deposits were stable compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023, as growth in interest-bearing deposits offset a decline in noninterest-bearing deposits. We continue to actively monitor the interest rate environment and make adjustments to our deposit strategy in response to evolving market conditions, bank funding needs and client relationship dynamics. 
 
 Product Revenue 
 In addition to credit and deposit products for commercial customers, Corporate Institutional Banking offers other services, including treasury management, capital markets and advisory products and services and commercial mortgage banking activities, for customers of all business segments. On a consolidated basis, the revenue from these other services is included in net interest income and noninterest income, as appropriate. From a business perspective, the majority of the revenue and expense related to these services is reflected in the Corporate Institutional Banking segment results, and the remainder is reflected in the results of other businesses where the customer relationships exist. The Other Information section in Table 13 includes the consolidated revenue to PNC for treasury management and commercial mortgage banking services. A discussion of the consolidated revenue from these services follows. 
 The Treasury Management business provides corporations with cash and investment management services, receivables and disbursement management services, funds transfer services and access to online/mobile information management and reporting services. Treasury management revenue is reported in noninterest income and net interest income. Noninterest income includes treasury management product revenue less earnings credits provided to customers on compensating deposit balances used to pay for products and services. Net interest income includes funding credit from all treasury management customer deposit balances. Compared to the first nine months of 2023, treasury management revenue increased due to wider interest rate spreads on the value of deposits and higher product revenue. 
 
 Commercial mortgage banking activities include revenue derived from commercial mortgage servicing (both net interest income and 
 
 18 The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. Form 10-Q 

noninterest income), revenue derived from commercial mortgage loans held for sale and hedges related to those activities. Total 
 revenue from commercial mortgage banking activities increased in the comparison primarily due to higher commercial mortgage loan 
 servicing income and a higher benefit from commercial mortgage servicing rights valuation, net of hedge, partially offset by lower revenue from commercial mortgage loans held for sale. 
 
 Capital markets and advisory includes services and activities primarily related to merger and acquisition advisory, equity capital markets advisory, asset-backed financing, loan syndication, securities underwriting and customer-related trading. The increase in capital markets and advisory fees in the comparison was largely driven by higher merger and acquisition advisory fees, underwriting fees and loan syndication fees, partially offset by lower customer-related interest rate derivative trading revenue.

Institutional Asset Management provides outsourced chief investment officer, custody, cash and fixed income client solutions, and retirement plan fiduciary investment services to institutional clients, including corporations, healthcare systems, insurance companies, municipalities and non-profits. 
 
 Asset Management Group earnings in the first nine months of 2024 increased 116 million compared to the same period in 2023, primarily driven by higher revenue and a decline in noninterest expense. 
 
 Net interest income increased in the comparison primarily due to wider interest rate spreads on the value of deposits and an increase in average loan balances, partially offset by narrower interest rate spreads on the value of loans. 
 
 Noninterest income increased in the comparison primarily driven by higher average equity markets, partially offset by the impact of client activity. 
 
 Noninterest expense decreased in the comparison, reflecting a continued focus on expense management. 
 
 Average total loans increased compared with the nine months ended September 30, 2023, primarily driven by growth in residential mortgage loans. 
 
 Average total deposits were stable in the comparison as growth in CD and deposit sweep balances was partially offset by declines in savings and noninterest bearing deposits. 
 
 Discretionary client assets under management increased in comparison to the prior year, primarily due to higher equity and fixed income markets as of September 30, 2024.

Loan Portfolio Characteristics and Analysis 
 Table 15: Details of Loans 
 In billions 
 
 We use several credit quality indicators, as further detailed in Note 3 Loans and Related Allowance for Credit Losses, to monitor and measure our exposure to credit risk within our loan portfolio. The following provides additional information about the significant loan classes that comprise our Commercial and Consumer portfolio segments. 
 
 Commercial 
 
 Commercial and Industrial 
 Commercial and industrial loans comprised 56 and 55 of our total loan portfolio at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. The majority of our commercial and industrial loans are secured by collateral that provides a secondary source of repayment should a borrower experience cash generation difficulties. Examples of this collateral include short-term assets, such as accounts receivable, inventory and securities, and long-lived assets, such as equipment, owner-occupied real estate and other business assets. 
 
 We actively manage our commercial and industrial loans to assess any changes (both positive and negative) in the level of credit risk at both the borrower and portfolio level. To evaluate the level of credit risk, we assign internal risk ratings reflecting our estimates of the borrower s PD and LGD for each related credit facility. This two-dimensional credit risk rating methodology provides granularity in the risk monitoring process and is updated on an ongoing basis through our credit risk management processes. In addition to monitoring the level of credit risk, we also monitor concentrations of credit risk pertaining to both specific industries and geographies that may exist in our portfolio. Our commercial and industrial portfolio is well-diversified across industries as shown in the following table (based on the North American Industry Classification System).

Owner occupied commercial real estate loans totaled 9.4 billion and 9.6 billion at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. These loans are included in commercial and industrial loans as the credit decisioning for servicing these loans is based on the financial conditions of the owner, not the ability of the collateral to generate income. Owner occupied commercial real estate loans are well-diversified across industries. 
 
 Commercial Real Estate 
 Commercial real estate loans of 35.1 billion as of September 30, 2024 comprised 19.6 billion related to commercial mortgages on income-producing properties, 9.9 billion of intermediate-term financing loans and 5.6 billion of real estate construction project loans. At December 31, 2023, comparable amounts were 35.4 billion, 21.0 billion, 8.0 billion and 6.4 billion, respectively. Commercial real estate primarily consists of an investment in land and/or buildings held to generate income, that income serves as the primary source for the repayment of the loan. However, for all commercial real estate assets, the disposition of the assigned collateral serves as a secondary source of repayment for the loan should the borrower experience cash generation difficulties. 
 We monitor credit risk associated with our commercial real estate loans similar to commercial and industrial loans by analyzing PD and LGD. Additionally, risks associated with commercial real estate loans tend to be correlated to the loan structure, collateral location and quality, project progress and business environment. These attributes are also monitored and utilized in assessing credit risk. The portfolio is geographically diverse due to the nature of our business involving clients throughout the U.S.

 Commercial Real Estate: Office Portfolio 
 Given the fundamental change in office demand driven by the acceptance of remote work, real estate performance related to the office sector continues to be an area of uncertainty. At September 30, 2024, our outstanding loan balances in the office portfolio totaled 7.2 billion, or 2.2 of total loans, while additional unfunded loan commitments totaled 0.3 billion. The portfolio is well diversified geographically across our coast-to-coast franchise. Within the office portfolio at September 30, 2024, criticized loans totaled 28.9 and nonperforming loans totaled 12.5 , while delinquencies were 0.1 . As measured at origination, the weighted average LTV for the office portfolio was 58.6 ; however, updated appraisals have increased the weighted average LTV inclusive of both updated property values and origination-derived values to 70.9 as of September 30, 2024. While LTV is one consideration, our risk assessment considers a number of factors in assessing the changing conditions affecting the portfolio. As of September 30, 2024, we have established reserves of 11.3 against office loans. 
 
 The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. Form 10-Q 23 

The greatest stress in our office portfolio is observed in multi-tenant office loans, which represents 54.0 of the portfolio at September 30, 2024. Within the multi-tenant classification, criticized levels were 50.2 while nonperforming loans totaled 22.4 , accounting for almost all of the nonperforming office population. The weighted average LTV inclusive of both updated property values and origination-derived values for multi-tenant is 79.6 at September 30, 2024. Additionally, commercial real estate charge-offs since the beginning of 2023 have primarily been multi-tenant office loans. Given the higher level of stress, this segment has a proportionally higher reserve rate of 16.0 . The remaining 46.0 of the office portfolio is primarily comprised of single-tenant, medical and government tenant properties. These three tenant classifications are performing considerably better, with approximately 3.6 of the book in the criticized loan category and 0.6 in the nonperforming loan category. As of September 30, 2024, the weighted average LTV inclusive of both updated property values and origination-derived values of this book is 60.2 . 
 
 The office portfolio remains an elevated area of focus for portfolio management, with internal risk ratings completed quarterly for each asset, accelerated reappraisal requirements and elevated approval levels for any credit action. Additionally, active management efforts include ongoing performance assessments as well as the review of property, lending and capital markets. Portfolio updates are distributed to senior management weekly. Collateral in the office portfolio is appraised by qualified, independent third-party state certified appraisers. New loans or loans being evaluated for extension or material modification are required to be appraised. The frequency of reappraisals outside of a credit action is based on regulatory and internal requirements. Generally, for loans with heightened risk, a cadence has been established to obtain updated appraisals at least annually. Loans that do not demonstrate a heightened risk are monitored through our ongoing management of the portfolio, including any need for a new appraisal. All appraisals are reviewed by independent qualified real estate valuation personnel. For existing office building loans, PNC employs the as-is market value from third-party appraisals to calculate LTV. 
 
 Given the ongoing change in this area, we expect additional stress in the office sector, and a portion of this stress will bear itself out as we work through maturities that will approximate 42 through September 30, 2025. Upon maturity, and where the balance is not paid in full, an extension may be granted because contractual extension terms are met; alternatively, an extension may be granted based on negotiated terms, and a portion of these extensions may involve the curtailment or charge off of principal. We continue to actively manage the portfolio, and we believe reserve levels reflect the expected credit losses in the portfolio. 
 
 Commercial Real Estate: Multifamily Portfolio 
 As of September 30, 2024, our outstanding loan balances in the multifamily portfolio totaled 16.7 billion, or 5.2 of total loans, while additional unfunded loan commitments totaled 2.7 billion. Although inflationary pressures, higher interest rates and elevated supply in certain markets have impacted internal risk assessments and regulatory classification in this portfolio, we have not seen a notable change in loan performance at this time with regards to nonperformance, delinquency or charge-offs. We continue to closely monitor our exposure in this sector. 
 
 Consumer 
 
 Residential Real Estate 
 Residential real estate loans primarily consisted of residential mortgage loans at both September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. 
 
 We obtain loan attributes at origination, including FICO scores and LTVs, and we update these and other credit metrics at least quarterly. We track borrower performance monthly. We also segment the mortgage portfolio into pools based on product type e.g. , nonconforming or conforming). This information is used for internal reporting and risk management. As part of our overall risk analysis and monitoring, we also segment the portfolio based upon loan delinquency, nonperforming status, modification and bankruptcy status, FICO scores, LTV and geographic concentrations.

 We originate residential mortgage loans nationwide through our national mortgage business as well as within our branch network. Residential mortgage loans underwritten to agency standards, including conforming loan amount limits, are typically sold with servicing retained by us. We also originate nonconforming residential mortgage loans that do not meet agency standards, which we retain on our balance sheet. Our portfolio of originated nonconforming residential mortgage loans totaled 42.2 billion at September 30, 2024, with 46 located in California. Comparable amounts at December 31, 2023 were 42.4 billion and 45 , respectively. 
 
 Home Equity 
 Home equity loans of 26.0 billion as of September 30, 2024 were comprised of 21.0 billion of home equity lines of credit and 5.0 billion of closed-end home equity installment loans. At December 31, 2023, comparable amounts were 26.2 billion, 20.6 billion and 5.6 billion, respectively. Home equity lines of credit are a variable interest rate product with fixed rate conversion options available to certain borrowers. 
 
 Similar to residential real estate loans, we obtain loan attributes at origination, including FICO scores and LTVs, and we update these and other credit metrics at least quarterly. Borrower performance of this portfolio is tracked on a monthly basis. We also segment the population into pools based on product type e.g. , home equity loans, legacy brokered home equity loans, home equity lines of credit or legacy brokered home equity lines of credit) and track the historical performance of any related mortgage loans regardless of whether we hold such liens. This information is used for internal reporting and risk management. As part of our overall risk analysis and monitoring, we also segment the portfolio based upon loan delinquency, nonperforming status, modification and bankruptcy status, FICO scores, LTV, lien position and geographic concentration. 
 
 The credit performance of the majority of the home equity portfolio where we hold the first lien position is superior to the portion of the portfolio where we hold the second lien position but do not hold the first lien. Lien position information is generally determined at the time of origination and monitored on an ongoing basis for risk management purposes. We use a third-party service provider to obtain updated loan information, including lien and collateral data that is aggregated from public and private sources.

 Automobile 
 Auto loans of 15.1 billion as of September 30, 2024 comprised 14.1 billion in the indirect auto portfolio and 1.0 billion in the direct auto portfolio. At December 31, 2023, comparable amounts were 14.9 billion, 13.8 billion and 1.1 billion, respectively. The indirect auto portfolio consists of loans originated primarily through independent franchised dealers, including dealers located in our newer markets. This business is strategically aligned with our core retail banking business. 

The following table presents certain key statistics related to our indirect and direct auto portfolios:

 We continue to focus on borrowers with strong credit profiles as evidenced by the weighted-average loan origination FICO scores noted in Table 20. We offer both new and used auto financing to customers through our various channels. At September 30, 2024, the portfolio balance was composed of 43 new vehicle loans and 57 used vehicle loans. Comparable amounts at December 31, 2023 were 45 and 55 , respectively. 
 
 The auto loan portfolio s performance is measured monthly, including both updated collateral values and FICO scores that are obtained at least quarterly. For internal reporting and risk management, we analyze the portfolio by product channel and product type and regularly evaluate default and delinquency experience. As part of our overall risk analysis and monitoring, we segment the portfolio by geography, channel, collateral attributes and credit metrics which include FICO score, LTV and term.

Nonperforming Assets and Loan Delinquencies 
 Nonperforming Assets 
 Nonperforming assets include nonperforming loans and leases, OREO and foreclosed assets. Nonperforming loans are those loans accounted for at amortized cost whose credit quality has deteriorated to the extent full collection of contractual principal and interest is not probable. Loans held for sale, certain government insured or guaranteed loans and loans accounted for under the fair value option are excluded from nonperforming loans. See Note 1 Accounting Policies in our 2023 Form 10-K for details on our nonaccrual policies. 

The following table presents a summary of nonperforming assets by major category:

 Increases in nonperforming assets from December 31, 2023 were primarily driven by higher commercial real estate nonperforming loans. 

The following table provides details on the change in nonperforming assets for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023:

 As of September 30, 2024, approximately 97 of total nonperforming loans were secured by collateral. 
 
 Loan Delinquencies 
 We regularly monitor the level of loan delinquencies and believe these levels are a key indicator of credit quality in our loan portfolio. Measurement of delinquency status is based on the contractual terms of each loan. Loans that are 30 days or more past due are considered delinquent. Loan delinquencies include government insured or guaranteed loans, loans accounted for under the fair value option and PCD loans. Amounts exclude loans held for sale. 
 
 We manage credit risk based on the risk profile of the borrower, repayment sources, underlying collateral, and other support given current events, economic conditions and expectations. We refine our practices to address operating environment changes such as inflation levels, industry specific risks, interest rate levels, the level of consumer savings and deposit balances, and structural and secular changes such as those arising from the pandemic. To mitigate losses and enhance customer support, we offer loan modifications and collection programs to assist our customers.

As such, they are excluded from nonperforming loans. 
 
 Loan Modifications 
 We provide relief to our customers experiencing financial hardships through a variety of solutions. Commercial loan and lease modifications are based on each individual borrower s situation, while consumer loan modifications are evaluated under our hardship relief programs. For additional information on our commercial real estate, office-related modification offerings, see the Commercial Real Estate portion of the Credit Risk Management section of this Financial Review. 
 
 See Note 3 Loans and Related Allowance for Credit Losses for additional information on loan modifications to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty. 
 
 Allowance for Credit Losses 
 Our determination of the ACL is based on historical loss and performance experience, current economic conditions, the reasonable and supportable forecasts of future economic conditions and other relevant factors, including current borrower and/or transaction characteristics and assessments of the remaining estimated contractual term as of the balance sheet date. We maintain the ACL at an appropriate level for expected losses on our existing investment securities, loans, equipment finance leases, other financial assets and unfunded lending related commitments.

 Liquidity and Capital Management 
 Our liquidity risk framework and related monitoring measures and tools, including internal liquidity stress testing as well as compliance with internal and regulatory limits and guidelines, are described in further detail in the Liquidity and Capital Management section of our 2023 Form 10-K. 
 
 One of the ways we monitor our liquidity is by reference to the LCR, a regulatory minimum liquidity requirement designed to ensure that covered banking organizations maintain an adequate level of liquidity to meet net liquidity needs over the course of a hypothetical 30-day stress scenario. PNC and PNC Bank calculate the LCR daily and are required to maintain a regulatory minimum of 100 . The LCR for both PNC and PNC Bank exceeded the regulatory minimum requirement throughout the third quarter of 2024. Fluctuations in our LCR result from changes to the components of the calculation, including high-quality liquid assets and net cash outflows, as a result of ongoing business activity. 
 
 The NSFR is designed to measure the stability of the maturity structure of assets and liabilities of banking organizations over a one-year time horizon. PNC and PNC Bank calculate the NSFR daily and are required to maintain a regulatory minimum of 100 . The NSFR for both PNC and PNC Bank exceeded the regulatory minimum requirement throughout the third quarter of 2024.

We provide additional information regarding regulatory liquidity requirements and their potential impact on us in the Supervision and Regulation section of Item 1 Business and Item 1A Risk Factors of our 2023 Form 10-K. 
 
 Sources of Liquidity 
 Our largest source of liquidity on a consolidated basis is the customer deposit base generated by our banking businesses. These deposits provide relatively stable and low-cost funding. Total deposits increased to 424.0 billion at September 30, 2024 from 421.4 billion at December 31, 2023. Interest-bearing deposits increased reflecting higher commercial balances, partially offset by lower consumer balances. Noninterest-bearing deposit balances decreased due to a decline in both commercial and consumer balances. As of September 30, 2024, uninsured deposits represented approximately 44 of our total deposit base, which is estimated based on the regulatory instructions in the Consolidated Reports of Condition and Income - FFIEC 031. The majority of our uninsured deposits are related to commercial operating and relationship accounts, which we define as commercial deposit customers who utilize two or more PNC products. See the Funding Sources portion of the Consolidated Balance Sheet Review and Business Segments Review sections of this Financial Review for additional information on our deposits and related strategies. 
 We may also obtain liquidity through various forms of funding, such as senior notes, subordinated debt, FHLB borrowings, securities sold under repurchase agreements, commercial paper and other short-term borrowings. See the Funding Sources section of the Consolidated Balance Sheet Review in this Financial Review and Note 7 Borrowed Funds in this Report for additional information related to our borrowings. 

Total senior and subordinated debt, on a consolidated basis, increased due to the following activity: 
 Table 26: Senior and Subordinated Debt 
 In billions 2024 January 1 31.7 Issuances 6.7 Calls and maturities (2.4) Other 0.7 September 30 36.7 
 
 Additionally, PNC maintains access to contingent funding sources that include unused borrowing capacity and certain liquid assets. PNC has a contingency funding plan designed to ensure that liquidity sources are sufficient to meet ongoing obligations and commitments, particularly in the event of liquidity stress. This plan is designed to examine and quantify the organization s liquidity under various internal liquidity stress scenarios and is periodically tested to assess the plan s reliability. Additionally, the plan provides the strategies for addressing liquidity needs and responsive actions we would consider during liquidity stress events, which could include the issuance of incremental debt, preferred stock, or additional deposit actions, including the issuance of brokered CDs. The plan also addresses the governance, frequency of reporting and the responsibilities of key departments in the event of liquidity stress. 
 
 PNC defines our primary contingent liquidity sources as cash held at the Federal Reserve Bank, investment securities and unused borrowing capacity at the FHLB and Federal Reserve Bank. The following table summarizes our primary contingent liquidity sources at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023:

 (c) Total borrowing capacity with the Federal Reserve Bank was 79.9 billion at September 30, 2024 and 47.2 billion at December 31, 2023. PNC had no outstanding borrowings with the Federal Reserve Bank at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. 
 
 As part of PNC s contingency planning, we preposition a portion of our available held to maturity investment securities at the Federal Reserve Bank s Discount Window, supporting our resilience and operational readiness. 

The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. Form 10-Q 31 

Bank Liquidity 
 In addition to our primary contingent liquidity sources, under PNC Bank s 2014 bank note program, as amended, PNC Bank may from time to time offer up to 40.0 billion aggregate principal amount outstanding at any one time of its unsecured senior and subordinated notes with maturity dates more than nine months (in the case of senior notes) and five years or more (in the case of subordinated notes) from their date of issue. At September 30, 2024, PNC Bank s remaining capacity to issue under the program was 33.3 billion. 
 
 Under PNC Bank s 2013 commercial paper program, PNC Bank has the ability to offer up to 10.0 billion of its commercial paper to provide additional liquidity. At September 30, 2024, there were no issuances outstanding under this program. 
 
 Additionally, PNC Bank may also access funding from the parent company through deposits placed at the bank or issuing intercompany senior unsecured notes. 
 
 See Note 16 Subsequent Events for additional information on the October 22, 2024 announcement of the November 4, 2024 redemption of all outstanding 0.2 billion senior floating rate bank notes due on December 2, 2024. 
 Parent Company Liquidity 
 In addition to managing liquidity risk at the bank level, we manage the parent company s liquidity. The parent company s contractual obligations consist primarily of debt service related to parent company borrowings and funding non-bank affiliates. Additionally, the parent company maintains liquidity to fund discretionary activities such as paying dividends to our shareholders, share repurchases and acquisitions. 
 
 At September 30, 2024, available parent company liquidity totaled 26.4 billion. Parent company liquidity is held in intercompany cash and investments. For investments with longer durations, the related maturities are aligned with scheduled cash needs, such as the maturity of parent company debt obligations. 
 
 The principal source of parent company liquidity is the dividends or other capital distributions it receives from PNC Bank, which may be impacted by the following: 
 Bank-level capital needs, 
 Laws, regulations and the results of supervisory activities, 
 Corporate policies, 
 Contractual restrictions, and 
 Other factors. 
 
 There are statutory and regulatory limitations on the ability of a national bank to pay dividends or make other capital distributions or to extend credit to the parent company or its non-bank subsidiaries. The amount available for dividend payments by PNC Bank to the parent company without prior regulatory approval was 6.8 billion at September 30, 2024. See Note 19 Regulatory Matters in our 2023 Form 10-K for further discussion of these limitations. 
 
 In addition to dividends from PNC Bank, other sources of parent company liquidity include cash and investments, as well as dividends and loan repayments from other subsidiaries and dividends or distributions from equity investments. We can also generate liquidity for the parent company and PNC s non-bank subsidiaries through the issuance of debt and equity securities, including certain capital instruments, in public or private markets and commercial paper. Under the parent company s 2014 commercial paper program, the parent company has the ability to offer up to 5.0 billion of commercial paper to provide additional liquidity. At September 30, 2024, there were no issuances outstanding under this program. 
 
 The following table details parent company note issuances in the third quarter of 2024:

 Contractual Obligations and Commitments 
 We have contractual obligations representing required future payments on borrowed funds, time deposits, leases, pension and postretirement benefits and purchase obligations. See the Liquidity and Capital Management portion of the Risk Management section of our 2023 Form 10-K for more information on these future cash outflows. Additionally, in the normal course of business, we have various commitments outstanding, certain of which are not included on our Consolidated Balance Sheet. We provide information on our commitments in Note 8 Commitments. 
 
 Credit Ratings 
 PNC s credit ratings affect the cost and availability of short and long-term funding, collateral requirements for certain derivative instruments and the ability to offer certain products. 
 
 In general, rating agencies base their ratings on many quantitative and qualitative factors, including capital adequacy, liquidity, asset quality, business mix, level and quality of earnings, and the current legislative and regulatory environment, including implied government support. A decrease, or potential decrease, in credit ratings could impact access to the capital markets and/or increase the cost of debt, and thereby adversely affect liquidity and financial condition. For additional information on the potential impacts from a downgrade to our credit ratings, see Item 1A Risk Factors in our 2023 Form 10-K.

 Capital Management 
 Detailed information on our capital management processes and activities is included in the Supervision and Regulation section of Item 1 of our 2023 Form 10-K. 
 
 We manage our funding and capital positions by making adjustments to our balance sheet size and composition, issuing or redeeming debt, issuing equity or other capital instruments, executing treasury stock transactions and capital redemptions or repurchases, and managing dividend policies and retaining earnings. 
 
 In the third quarter of 2024, PNC returned 0.8 billion of capital to shareholders, including more than 0.6 billion of dividends on common shares and more than 0.1 billion of common share repurchases. Consistent with the SCB framework, which allows for capital return in amounts in excess of the SCB minimum levels, our Board of Directors has authorized a repurchase framework under the previously approved repurchase program of up to 100 million common shares, of which approximately 43 were still available for repurchase at September 30, 2024. Fourth quarter 2024 share repurchase activity is expected to approximate recent quarterly average share repurchase levels. PNC may adjust share repurchase activity depending on market and economic conditions, as well as other factors. PNC s SCB for the four-quarter period beginning October 1, 2024 is the regulatory minimum of 2.5 . 
 
 The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. Form 10-Q 33 

On October 3, 2024 the PNC Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend on common stock of 1.60 per share to be paid on November 5, 2024 to shareholders of record at the close of business October 16, 2024.

 (a) The ratios are calculated to reflect PNC s election to adopt the CECL five-year transition provisions. Effective for the first quarter 2022, PNC is now in the three-year transition period and the full impact of the CECL standard is being phased-in to regulatory capital through December 31, 2024. 
 (b) The ratios are calculated to reflect the full impact of CECL and exclude the benefits of the optional five-year transition. 
 (c) As permitted, PNC and PNC Bank have elected to exclude AOCI related to both available for sale securities and pension and other post-retirement plans from CET1 capital. 
 (d) Basel III standardized approach risk-weighted assets are based on the Basel III standardized approach rules and include credit and market risk-weighted assets. 
 (e) The Supplementary leverage ratio is calculated based on Tier 1 capital divided by Supplementary leverage exposure, which takes into account the quarterly average of both on balance sheet assets as well as certain off-balance sheet items, including loan commitments and potential future exposure under derivative contracts. 
 (f) All ratios are calculated using the regulatory capital methodology applicable to PNC and calculated based on the standardized approach. 
 (g) Leverage ratio is calculated based on Tier 1 capital divided by Average quarterly adjusted total assets. 
 
 PNC s regulatory risk-based capital ratios are calculated using the standardized approach for determining risk-weighted assets. Under the standardized approach for determining credit risk-weighted assets, exposures are generally assigned a pre-defined risk weight. Exposures to high volatility commercial real estate, nonaccruals, FDMs, past due exposures and equity exposures are generally subject to higher risk weights than other types of exposures. 
 The regulatory agencies have adopted a rule permitting certain banks, including PNC, to delay the estimated impact on regulatory capital stemming from implementing CECL. CECL s estimated impact on CET1 capital, as defined by the rule, is the change in retained earnings at adoption plus or minus 25 of the change in CECL ACL at the balance sheet date, excluding the allowance for PCD loans, compared to CECL ACL at adoption. Effective for the first quarter of 2022, PNC is now in the three-year transition period, and the full impact of the CECL standard is being phased-in to regulatory capital through December 31, 2024. See additional discussion of this rule in the Supervision and Regulation section of Item 1 Business and Item 1A Risk Factors of our 2023 Form 10-K. 
 
 34 The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. Form 10-Q 

At September 30, 2024, PNC and PNC Bank were considered well capitalized based on applicable U.S. regulatory capital ratio requirements. To qualify as well capitalized, PNC must have Basel III capital ratios of at least 6 for Tier 1 risk-based capital and 10 for Total risk-based capital, and PNC Bank must have Basel III capital ratios of at least 6.5 for Common equity Tier 1 risk-based capital, 8 for Tier 1 risk-based capital, 10 for Total risk-based capital and a Leverage ratio of at least 5 . 
 
 Federal banking regulators have stated that they expect the largest U.S. BHCs, including PNC, to have a level of regulatory capital well in excess of the regulatory minimum and have required the largest U.S. BHCs, including PNC, to have a capital buffer sufficient to withstand losses and allow them to meet the credit needs of their customers through estimated stress scenarios. We seek to manage our capital consistent with these regulatory principles, and we believe that our September 30, 2024 capital levels were aligned with them. 
 
 We provide additional information regarding regulatory capital requirements and some of their potential impacts, including the proposed rules to adjust the Basel III framework, in the Supervision and Regulation section of Item 1 Business, Item 1A Risk Factors and Note 19 Regulatory Matters in our 2023 Form 10-K. 
 
 Market Risk Management 
 See the Market Risk Management portion of the Risk Management section in our 2023 Form 10-K for additional discussion regarding market risk. 
 
 Market Risk Management Interest Rate Risk 
 Interest rate risk results primarily from our traditional banking activities of gathering deposits and extending loans. Many factors, including economic and financial conditions, movements in interest rates and consumer preferences, affect the difference between the interest that we earn on assets, the interest that we pay on liabilities and the level of our noninterest-bearing funding sources. Due to the repricing term mismatches and embedded options inherent in certain of these products, changes in market interest rates not only affect expected near-term earnings, but also the economic values of these assets and liabilities. 
 
 Our Asset and Liability Management group centrally manages interest rate risk as prescribed in our market risk-related risk management policies, which are approved by management s ALCO and the Risk Committee of the Board of Directors. 
 
 PNC utilizes sensitivities of NII and EVE to a set of interest rate scenarios to identify and measure its short-term and long-term structural interest rate risks. 
 
 NII Sensitivity results for the third quarters of 2024 and 2023 follow: 
 
 Table 31: Net Interest Income Sensitivity Analysis Third Quarter 2024 Third Quarter 2023 Net Interest Income Sensitivity Simulation (a) 
 Effect on NII in first year from shocked interest rate: 200 basis point instantaneous increase (0.5) (0.3) 200 basis point instantaneous decrease (0.6) 
 (a) The effect on NII in the first year from a 100 basis point instantaneous increase or decrease is not materially different from the 200 basis point scenarios as disclosed above. 
 When forecasting NII, we make certain key assumptions that can materially impact the resulting sensitivities, including the following: 
 Future Balance Sheet Composition: Our balance sheet composition is dynamic and based on our forecasted expectations. As of the third quarter of 2024, the projected balance sheet composition by the end of year one is generally consistent with the spot composition as of the third quarter of 2024. 
 
 Deposit Betas: Deposit pricing changes are primarily driven by changes in the Federal Funds rate. PNC s deposit beta was 32 for September 2024. We define deposit beta as the change in deposit rate paid on total interest-bearing deposits divided by the change in the upper level of the average stated Federal Funds rate range since August 2024, the start of the current easing rate cycle. For rate sensitivity purposes, PNC assumes the cumulative deposit beta will increase from the current level. Prior to the beginning of the easing cycle, PNC s beta calculation represented the change in deposit rate paid on interest-bearing non-maturity deposits divided by the change in the upper level of the stated Federal Funds rate since the first quarter of 2022, the start of the rising rate cycle. For interest rate risk modeling, PNC uses dynamic beta models to adjust assumed repricing sensitivity depending on market rate levels as well as other factors. The dynamic beta assumptions reflect historical experience and future expectations. Actual deposit rates paid may differ from modeled projections due to variables such as competition for deposits and customer behavior. 
 
 Asset Prepayments: PNC includes prepayment assumptions for both loan and investment portfolios. Mortgage and home equity portfolios utilize an industry standard model to drive estimated prepayments that increase in lower rate environments. Commercial and 
 The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. Form 10-Q 35 

other consumer loan portfolios assume static constant prepayment rates that are consistent across rate scenarios, as those portfolios historically do not exhibit significantly different prepayment behaviors based upon the level of market rates. 
 
 Impact of Derivatives : PNC uses interest rate derivatives, some of which are forward starting, to hedge floating rate commercial loans. PNC had 48.8 billion in receive fix/pay float swaps as of September 30, 2024, with a weighted average duration of 2.45 years and an average fixed rate of 3.44 . As of September 30, 2024, PNC also had collars in place, reflecting 12.5 billion of caps and 12.5 billion of floors, that are used to hedge these commercial loans. Additionally, PNC utilizes receive fix/pay float swaps as a means of hedging fixed rate debt, as well as pay fix/receive float swaps as a means of hedging the investment securities portfolio. See Note 12 Financial Derivatives in this Report for additional information on how we use derivatives to hedge commercial loans, investment securities and fixed rate debt. 
 
 EVE sensitivity results for the third quarters of 2024 and 2023 follow: 
 Table 32: Economic Value of Equity Sensitivity Analysis 
 Third Quarter 2024 Third Quarter 2023 Economic Value of Equity Sensitivity Simulation 200 basis point instantaneous increase (4.2) (7.0) 200 basis point instantaneous decrease (4.1) 0.8 
 
 EVE measures the present value of all projected future cash flows associated with a point-in-time balance sheet and does not include projected new volume. EVE sensitivity to interest rate changes is a complementary metric to NII sensitivity analysis and represents an estimation of long-term interest rate risk. PNC calculates its EVE sensitivity by measuring the changes in the economic value of assets, liabilities and off-balance sheet instruments in response to an instantaneous +/-200 bps parallel shift in interest rates. Similar to the NII sensitivity analysis, we incorporate dynamic deposit repricing and loan prepayment assumptions. These methodologies are largely consistent between the EVE and NII sensitivity analyses. Additionally, deposit attrition is a significant contributor to EVE sensitivity. Deposit attrition is projected based on a dynamic model developed using long-term historical deposit behavior in addition to management assumptions including accelerated attrition for pandemic related excess deposits. PNC performs various sensitivity analyses to understand the impact of faster and slower deposit attrition on our risk metrics, with the results reported to ALCO. 
 
 Compared to the third quarter of 2023, there have been no material changes to our NII sensitivity and EVE sensitivity assumptions, including data sources that drive assumptions setting. 
 
 Market Risk Management Customer-Related Trading Risk 
 We engage in fixed income securities, derivatives and foreign exchange transactions to support our customers investing and hedging activities. These transactions, related hedges and the credit valuation adjustment related to our customer derivatives portfolio are marked-to-market daily and reported as customer-related trading activities. We do not engage in proprietary trading of these products. 
 
 We use VaR as the primary means to measure and monitor market risk in customer-related trading activities. VaR is used to estimate the probability of portfolio losses based on the statistical analysis of historical market risk factors. VaR is calculated for each of the portfolios that comprise our customer-related trading activities of which the majority are covered positions as defined by the Market Risk Rule. VaR is computed with positions and market risk factors updated daily to ensure each portfolio is operating within its acceptable limits. See the Market Risk Management Customer-Related Trading Risk section of our 2023 Form 10-K for more information on our models used to calculate VaR and our backtesting process. 
 
 Customer-related trading revenue was 75 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 118 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease was primarily due to lower derivative client sales revenue. 
 Market Risk Management Equity And Other Investment Risk 
 Equity investment risk is the risk of potential losses associated with investing in both private and public equity markets. In addition to extending credit, taking deposits, underwriting securities and trading financial instruments, we make and manage direct investments in a variety of transactions, including management buyouts, recapitalizations and growth financings in a variety of industries. We also have investments in affiliated and non-affiliated funds that make similar investments in private equity, consistent with regulatory limitations. The economic and/or book value of these investments and other assets are directly affected by changes in market factors. 
 Various PNC business units manage our equity and other investment activities. Our businesses are responsible for making investment decisions within the approved policy limits and associated guidelines.

 Tax Credit Investments 
 Included in our equity investments are direct tax credit investments and equity investments held by consolidated entities. These tax credit investment balances included unfunded commitments totaling 2.4 billion and 2.5 billion at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. These unfunded commitments are included in Other liabilities on our Consolidated Balance Sheet. 
 
 Note 4 Loan Sale and Servicing Activities and Variable Interest Entities in our 2023 Form 10-K has further information on tax credit investments. 
 
 Private Equity and Other 
 The largest component of our other equity investments is our private equity portfolio. The private equity portfolio is an illiquid portfolio consisting of mezzanine and equity investments that vary by industry, stage and type of investment. Private equity investments carried at estimated fair value totaled 2.3 billion and 2.2 billion at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. As of September 30, 2024, 2.1 billion was invested directly in a variety of companies, and 0.2 billion was invested indirectly through various private equity funds. 
 
 During the second quarter of 2024, PNC participated in the Visa exchange program, allowing PNC to convert its Visa Class B-1 common shares into approximately equal amounts of Visa Class B-2 common shares and Visa Class C common shares. This conversion event resulted in a gain of 754 million related to the Visa Class C common shares received. PNC retained the Visa Class B-2 common shares. The Visa Class B-2 common shares, which are included in our other equity investments at cost, remain subject to the same restrictions that were imposed on the Visa Class B-1 common shares. Participation in the exchange required PNC to agree to a make-whole agreement that subjects PNC to the same indemnity obligations to Visa as prior to participation in the exchange program. 
 
 The Visa Class B-2 common shares that we own are transferable only under limited circumstances until the resolution of the pending interchange litigation or Visa launches another exchange program allowing PNC to convert a portion of its Visa Class B-2 common shares into freely transferable Visa Class C common shares. At September 30, 2024, the estimated value of our total investment in the Visa Class B-2 common shares was approximately 0.7 billion, while our cost basis was insignificant. The estimated value does not represent fair value of the Visa Class B-2 common shares given the shares limited transferability and the lack of observable transactions in the marketplace. See Note 14 Fair Value and Note 20 Legal Proceedings in our 2023 Form 10-K for additional information regarding our Visa agreements. 
 
 We also have certain other equity investments, the majority of which represent investments in affiliated and non-affiliated funds with both traditional and alternative investment strategies. Net gains related to these investments were 31 million and 17 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023, respectively. 
 
 Financial Derivatives 
 Financial derivatives involve, to varying degrees, market and credit risk. Derivatives represent contracts between parties that usually require little or no initial net investment and result in one party delivering cash or another type of asset to the other party based on a notional and an underlying as specified in the contract. Therefore, cash requirements and exposure to credit risk are significantly less than the notional amount on these instruments. 
 
 We use a variety of financial derivatives as part of the overall asset and liability risk management process to help manage exposure to market risk (primarily interest rate) and credit risk inherent in our business activities. We also enter into derivatives with customers to facilitate their risk management activities. 
 
 Further information on our financial derivatives is presented in Note 1 Accounting Policies, Note 14 Fair Value and Note 15 Financial Derivatives in our 2023 Form 10-K and in Note 11 Fair Value and Note 12 Financial Derivatives in this Report. 
 
 Not all elements of market and credit risk are addressed through the use of financial derivatives, and such instruments may be ineffective for their intended purposes due to unanticipated market changes, among other reasons.

R ECENT R EGULATORY D EVELOPMENTS 
 
 Resolution Planning 
 In August 2024, the Federal Reserve and FDIC finalized new guidance for holding company resolution plans submitted by triennial full filers, such as PNC, under section 165(d) of the Dodd-Frank Act and the implementing regulations. The guidance generally applies expectations from the 2019 resolution plan guidance applicable to U.S. GSIBs. Firms like PNC with a multiple point of entry resolution strategy will be required to incorporate more severe plan assumptions and include new required plan content, operational capabilities and legal entity rationalization, among other requirements. PNC s next 165(d) resolution plan is due October 1, 2025, per an extension provided by the Federal Reserve and FDIC in finalizing the new guidance. 
 
 Other Regulatory Developments 
 On October 22, 2024, the CFPB issued a final rule under Section 1033 of the Dodd-Frank Act requiring certain entities, including PNC Bank, to, upon request, make available to a consumer or third party authorized by the consumer certain information the entity has concerning a consumer financial product or service covered by the rule. In issuing the rule, the CFPB said that the rule will move the U.S. closer to an open banking system and will let consumers more easily switch banks or other providers. In general, the final rule requires covered data providers, such as PNC Bank, to establish a developer interface satisfying specific security and other standards, accept data sharing requests by third parties authorized by the consumer through that developer interface and, in response to such a request, make that data available in electronic form to consumers and authorized third parties, including data aggregators. PNC Bank will be prohibited from charging fees for maintaining the developer interface or providing access to such data. PNC and PNC Bank may also act as authorized third parties receiving data under the rule from institutions, and the rule places data security, authorization, and other obligations on those third parties, including limitations on secondary uses of the data received. PNC Bank must comply with the rule beginning on April 1, 2026, and we are still assessing the impact of this rule. 
 
 C RITICAL A CCOUNTING E STIMATES AND J UDGMENTS 
 
 Our consolidated financial statements are prepared by applying certain accounting policies. Note 1 Accounting Policies in our 2023 Form 10-K describes the most significant accounting policies that we use. Certain of these policies require us to make estimates or economic assumptions that may vary under different assumptions or conditions, and such variations may significantly affect our reported results and financial position for the period or in future periods. The policies and judgments related to residential and commercial MSRs and Level 3 fair value measurements are described in Critical Accounting Estimates and Judgments in our 2023 Form 10-K. The following details the critical estimates and judgments around the ACL. 
 Allowance for Credit Losses 
 
 We maintain the ACL at levels that we believe to be appropriate as of the balance sheet date to absorb expected credit losses on our existing investment securities, loans, equipment finance leases, other financial assets and unfunded lending related commitments, for the remaining estimated contractual term of the assets or exposures, taking into consideration expected prepayments and estimated recoveries. Our determination of the ACL is based on historical loss and performance experience, as well as current borrower and transaction characteristics including collateral type and quality, current economic conditions, reasonable and supportable forecasts of future economic conditions and other relevant factors. We use methods sensitive to changes in economic conditions to interpret these factors and to estimate expected credit losses. We evaluate and, when appropriate, enhance the quality of our data and models and other methods used to estimate the ACL on an ongoing basis. We incorporate qualitative factors in the ACL that reflect our best estimate of expected losses that may not be adequately represented in our quantitative methods or economic assumptions. The major drivers of ACL estimates include, but are not limited to: 
 Current economic conditions: Our forecast of expected losses depends on economic conditions as of the estimation date. As current economic conditions evolve, forecasted losses could be materially affected. 
 Scenario weights and design: Our loss estimates are sensitive to the shape, direction and rate of change of macroeconomic forecasts and thus vary significantly between upside and downside scenarios. Changes to the probability weights assigned to these scenarios and the timing of peak business cycles reflected by the scenarios could materially affect our loss estimates. 
 Current borrower quality: Our forecast of expected losses depends on current borrower and transaction characteristics, including credit metrics and collateral type/quality. As borrower quality evolves, forecasted losses could be materially affected. 
 Portfolio composition: Changes to portfolio volume and mix could materially affect our estimates, as CECL reserves 
 would be recognized upon origination or acquisition and derecognized upon paydown, maturity or sale. 
 
 For all assets and unfunded lending related commitments within the scope of the CECL standard, the applicable ACL is composed of one or a combination of the following components: (i) collectively assessed or pooled reserves, (ii) individually assessed reserves and 
 (iii) qualitative (judgmental) reserves. Our methodologies and key assumptions for each of these components are discussed in Note 1 
 Accounting Policies in our 2023 Form 10-K. 

38 The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. Form 10-Q 

Reasonable and Supportable Economic Forecast 
 Pursuant to the CECL standard, we are required to consider reasonable and supportable forecasts in estimating expected credit losses. For this purpose, we have established a framework that includes a three-year forecast period and the use of four economic scenarios with associated probability weights, which in combination create a forecast of expected economic outcomes. Credit losses estimated in our reasonable and supportable forecast period are sensitive to the shape and severity of the scenarios used and weights assigned to them. 
 
 To forecast the distribution of economic outcomes over the reasonable and supportable forecast period, we generate four economic forecast scenarios using a combination of quantitative macroeconomic models, other measures of economic activity and forward-looking expert judgment. Each scenario is then given an associated probability (weight) to represent our current expectation within that distribution over the forecast period. This process is informed by current economic conditions, expected business cycle evolution and the expert judgment of PNC s RAC. This approach seeks to provide a reasonable representation of the forecast of expected economic outcomes and is used to estimate expected credit losses across a variety of loans, securities and other financial assets. Each quarter, the scenarios and their respective weights are presented to RAC for approval. 
 
 The scenarios used for the period ended September 30, 2024 consider, among other factors, ongoing inflationary pressures and the corresponding tightness of monetary policy and credit availability. Given these factors, growth is expected to slow from current levels in the coming quarters. While recession risks remain elevated, our most-likely expectation at September 30, 2024 is that the U.S. economy avoids a recession. 
 
 We used a number of economic variables in our scenarios, with two of the most significant drivers being real GDP and the U.S. unemployment rate. The following table presents a comparison of these two economic variables based on the weighted-average scenario forecasts used in determining our ACL at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. 

Table 34: Key Macroeconomic Variables in CECL Weighted-Average Scenarios 
 Assumptions as of September 30, 2024 
 2024 2025 2026 U.S. real GDP (a) 1.8 0.8 2.2 U.S. unemployment rate (b) 4.4 5.1 4.7 Assumptions as of December 31, 2023 
 2024 2025 2026 U.S. real GDP (a) 0.1 1.5 2.0 U.S. unemployment rate (b) 4.5 4.6 4.2 
 (a) Represents year-over-year growth rates. 
 (b) Represents quarterly average rate at December 31, 2024, 2025 and 2026, respectively. 
 
 Real GDP growth is expected to end 2024 at 1.8 on a weighted average basis, up from the 0.1 assumed at December 31, 2023, primarily due to stronger economic activity in 2024 than what was expected at the end of 2023. Growth then slows to 0.8 in 2025, before increasing to 2.2 in 2026. The weighted-average unemployment rate is expected to end 2024 at 4.4 down slightly from the 4.5 level assumed at December 31, 2023. The weighted-average unemployment rate is then expected to increase moderately through 2025 before decreasing to 4.7 by the fourth quarter of 2026. 
 
 The current state of the economy continues to reflect uncertainty due to the fundamental change in office demand from the acceptance of remote work, combined with inflationary pressures, interest rate movements and housing affordability. As such, for both our commercial and consumer loan portfolios, PNC identified and performed significant analyses around segments impacted by such uncertainties to ensure our reserves are appropriate, given our current macroeconomic expectations. 
 
 We believe the economic scenarios effectively reflect the distribution of potential economic outcomes. Additionally, through in-depth and granular analysis we have addressed reserve requirements for the specific populations most affected in the current environment. Through this approach, we believe the reserve levels appropriately reflect the expected credit losses in the portfolio as of the balance sheet date.

 As of September 30, 2024, we performed an evaluation under the supervision of and with the participation of our management, including the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer and the Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures and of changes in our internal control over financial reporting. 
 
 Based on that evaluation, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer and our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934) were

effective as of September 30, 2024, and that there has been no change in PNC s internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the third quarter of 2024 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 

C AUTIONARY S TATEMENT R EGARDING F ORWARD -L OOKING I NFORMATION 
 
 We make statements in this Report, and we may from time to time make other statements, regarding our outlook for financial performance, such as earnings, revenues, expenses, tax rates, capital and liquidity levels and ratios, asset levels, asset quality, financial position, and other matters regarding or affecting us and our future business and operations, including our sustainability strategy, that are forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act. Forward-looking statements are typically identified by words such as believe, plan, expect, anticipate, see, look, intend, outlook, project, forecast, estimate, goal, will, should and other similar words and expressions. 
 Forward-looking statements are necessarily subject to numerous assumptions, risks and uncertainties, which change over time. Future events or circumstances may change our outlook and may also affect the nature of the assumptions, risks and uncertainties to which our forward-looking statements are subject. Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date made. We do not assume any duty and do not undertake any obligation to update forward-looking statements. Actual results or future events could differ, possibly materially, from those anticipated in forward-looking statements, as well as from historical performance. As a result, we caution against placing undue reliance on any forward-looking statements. 
 Our forward-looking statements are subject to the following principal risks and uncertainties. 
 Our businesses, financial results and balance sheet values are affected by business and economic conditions, including: 
 Changes in interest rates and valuations in debt, equity and other financial markets, 
 Disruptions in the U.S. and global financial markets, 
 Actions by the Federal Reserve Board, U.S. Treasury and other government agencies, including those that impact money supply, market interest rates and inflation, 
 Changes in customer behavior due to changing business and economic conditions or legislative or regulatory initiatives, 
 Changes in customers , suppliers and other counterparties performance and creditworthiness, 
 Impacts of sanctions, tariffs and other trade policies of the U.S. and its global trading partners, 
 Impacts of changes in federal, state and local governmental policy, including on the regulatory landscape, capital markets, taxes, infrastructure spending and social programs, 
 Our ability to attract, recruit and retain skilled employees, and 
 Commodity price volatility. 
 Our forward-looking financial statements are subject to the risk that economic and financial market conditions will be substantially different than those we are currently expecting. These statements are based on our views that: 
 Job and income gains will continue to support consumer spending growth in the near term, but PNC s baseline forecast is for slower economic growth at the end of 2024 and in the first half of 2025 as high interest rates remain a drag on the economy. 
 Real GDP growth this year will trend close to 2 , and the unemployment rate will remain somewhat above 4 through the rest of 2024 and in 2025. Inflation will continue to slow as wage pressures abate, gradually moving back to the Federal Reserve s 2 long-term objective. 
 With slowing inflation PNC expects two additional federal funds rate cuts of 25 basis points each at the FOMC s remaining meetings in 2024, with the rate ending this year in a range between 4.25 and 4.50 . PNC expects several federal funds rate cuts in 2025 as inflation continues to ease. 
 PNC s ability to take certain capital actions, including returning capital to shareholders, is subject to PNC meeting or exceeding minimum capital levels, including a stress capital buffer established by the Federal Reserve Board in connection with the Federal Reserve Board s CCAR process. 
 PNC s regulatory capital ratios in the future will depend on, among other things, PNC s financial performance, the scope and terms of final capital regulations then in effect and management actions affecting the composition of PNC s balance sheet. In addition, PNC s ability to determine, evaluate and forecast regulatory capital ratios, and to take actions (such as capital distributions) based on actual or forecasted capital ratios, will be dependent at least in part on the development, validation and regulatory review of related models and the reliability of and risks resulting from extensive use of such models. 
 Legal and regulatory developments could have an impact on our ability to operate our businesses, financial condition, results of operations, competitive position, reputation, or pursuit of attractive acquisition opportunities. Reputational impacts could affect matters such as business generation and retention, liquidity, funding and ability to attract and retain employees. These developments could include: 
 Changes to laws and regulations, including changes affecting oversight of the financial services industry, changes in the enforcement and interpretation of such laws and regulations and changes in accounting and reporting standards. 
 The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. Form 10-Q 41 

Unfavorable resolution of legal proceedings or other claims and regulatory and other governmental investigations or other inquiries resulting in monetary losses, costs, or alterations in our business practices and potentially causing reputational harm to PNC. 
 Results of the regulatory examination and supervision process, including our failure to satisfy requirements of agreements with governmental agencies. 
 Costs associated with obtaining rights in intellectual property claimed by others and of adequacy of our intellectual property protection in general. 
 Business and operating results are affected by our ability to identify and effectively manage risks inherent in our businesses, including, where appropriate, through effective use of systems and controls, third-party insurance, derivatives, and capital management techniques and to meet evolving regulatory capital and liquidity standards. 
 Our reputation and business and operating results may be affected by our ability to appropriately meet or address environmental, social or governance targets, goals, commitments or concerns that may arise. 
 We grow our business in part through acquisitions and new strategic initiatives. Risks and uncertainties include those presented by the nature of the business acquired and strategic initiative, including in some cases those associated with our entry into new businesses or new geographic or other markets and risks resulting from our inexperience in those new areas, as well as risks and uncertainties related to the acquisition transactions themselves, regulatory issues, the integration of the acquired businesses into PNC after closing or any failure to execute strategic or operational plans. 
 Competition can have an impact on customer acquisition, growth and retention and on credit spreads and product pricing, which can affect market share, deposits and revenues. Our ability to anticipate and respond to technological changes can also impact our ability to respond to customer needs and meet competitive demands. 
 Business and operating results can also be affected by widespread manmade, natural and other disasters (including severe weather events), health emergencies, dislocations, geopolitical instabilities or events, terrorist activities, system failures or disruptions, security breaches, cyberattacks, international hostilities, or other extraordinary events beyond PNC s control through impacts on the economy and financial markets generally or on us or our counterparties, customers or third-party vendors and service providers specifically. 
 We provide greater detail regarding these as well as other factors in our 2023 Form 10-K and subsequent Form 10-Qs and elsewhere in this Report, including in the Risk Factors and Risk Management sections and the Legal Proceedings and Commitments Notes of the Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements in these reports. Our forward-looking statements may also be subject to other risks and uncertainties, including those discussed elsewhere in this Report or in our other filings with the SEC.

The comparable amounts at December 31, 2023 were million and million, respectively. These amounts are included in Other assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. 
 (b) Credit ratings represent a primary credit quality indicator used to monitor and manage credit risk. Of our total securities portfolio, were rated AAA/AA at both September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. 
 (c) Amortized cost is presented net of allowance of million for securities available for sale, primarily related to non-agency commercial mortgage-backed securities, and million for securities held to maturity at September 30, 2024. The comparable amounts at December 31, 2023 were million and million, respectively. 
 (d) Held to maturity securities transferred from available for sale are included in held to maturity at fair value at the time of the transfer. The amortized cost of held to maturity securities included net unrealized losses of billion at September 30, 2024 related to securities transferred, which are offset in AOCI, net of tax. The comparable amount at December 31, 2023 was billion. 
 
 The fair value of investment securities is impacted by interest rates, credit spreads, market volatility and liquidity conditions. Securities available for sale are carried at fair value with net unrealized gains and losses included in Total shareholders equity as AOCI, unless credit-related. Net unrealized gains and losses are determined by taking the difference between the fair value of a security and its amortized cost, net of any allowance. Securities held to maturity are carried at amortized cost, net of any allowance. Investment securities at September 30, 2024 included million of net unsettled purchases that represent non-cash investing activity, and accordingly, are not reflected on the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows. The comparable amount for September 30, 2023 was million of net unsettled purchases.

See Note 1 Accounting Policies in our 2023 Form 10-K for a discussion of the methodologies used to determine the allowance for investment securities. 
 
 At September 30, 2024, AOCI included pretax losses of million from derivatives that hedged the purchase of investment securities classified as held to maturity. The losses will be accreted to interest income as an adjustment of yield on the securities. 
 
 Table 36 presents the gross unrealized losses and fair value of securities available for sale that do not have an associated allowance for investment securities at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. These securities are segregated between investments that had been in a continuous unrealized loss position for less than twelve months and twelve months or more, based on the point in time that the fair value declined below the amortized cost basis. All securities included in the table have been evaluated to determine if a credit loss exists. As part of that assessment, as of September 30, 2024, we concluded that we do not intend to sell and believe we will not be required to sell these securities prior to recovery of the amortized cost basis.

 portfolio segments Commercial and Consumer. Each of these segments comprises multiple loan classes. Classes are characterized by similarities in risk attributes and the manner in which we monitor and assess credit risk. 
 See Note 1 Accounting Policies in our 2023 Form 10-K for additional information on our loan related policies. 
 
 Credit Quality 
 We closely monitor economic conditions and loan performance trends to manage and evaluate our exposure to credit risk within the loan portfolio based on our defined loan classes. In doing so, we use several credit quality indicators, including, but not limited to, trends in delinquency rates, nonperforming status, analyses of PD and LGD ratings, updated credit scores and originated and updated LTV ratios. 
 We manage credit risk based on the risk profile of the borrower, repayment sources, underlying collateral and other support given current events, economic conditions and expectations. We refine our practices to address operating environment changes such as inflation levels, industry specific risks, interest rate levels, the level of consumer savings and deposit balances, and structural and secular changes such as those arising from the pandemic. To mitigate losses and enhance customer support, we offer loan modifications and collection programs to assist our customers.

The comparable amounts at December 31, 2023 were billion and billion, respectively. 
 Nonperforming Assets 
 Nonperforming assets include nonperforming loans and leases, OREO and foreclosed assets. Nonperforming loans are those loans accounted for at amortized cost whose credit quality has deteriorated to the extent that full collection of contractual principal and interest is not probable. Interest income is not recognized on these loans. Loans accounted for under the fair value option are reported as performing loans; however, when nonaccrual criteria is met, interest income is not recognized on these loans. Additionally, certain

At the end of the or months, the borrower is returned to the original contractual interest rate and minimum payment amount specified in the original lending agreement. 
 Fully-amortized repayment plans are also granted, the most common of which being a month program. In this program, we convert the borrower s drawn and unpaid balances into a fully-amortized repayment plan consisting of an interest rate of and an adjusted minimum payment percentage of of the outstanding balance. This fully-amortized program is designed in a manner that allows the drawn and unpaid amounts to be recaptured at the end of the months. 
 Home equity loans and lines of credit 
 Fixed payment plan programs establish a modified monthly payment that is informed by the borrower s financial situation and the current market environment at the time of modification, among other factors. As such, we may change the borrower s interest rate, modify the term of the loan, and/or defer payment to arrive at the modified monthly payment. Each of the aforementioned terms may increase or decrease, and may vary from loan to loan, based on the individual loan and borrower characteristics.

 An instrument s categorization within the hierarchy is based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement. Changes from one quarter to the next related to the observability of inputs to a fair value measurement may result in a reclassification (transfer) of assets or liabilities between hierarchy levels.

 Net Investment Hedges 
 We enter into foreign currency forward contracts to hedge non-U.S. dollar net investments in foreign subsidiaries against adverse changes in foreign exchange rates. We assess whether the hedging relationship is highly effective in achieving offsetting changes in the value of the hedge and hedged item by qualitatively verifying that the critical terms of the hedge and hedged item match at the inception of the hedging relationship and on an ongoing basis. Net investment hedge derivatives are classified as foreign exchange contracts. There were no components of derivative gains or losses excluded from the assessment of the hedge effectiveness for the periods presented.

 Offsetting and Counterparty Credit Risk 
 
 We generally utilize a net presentation on the Consolidated Balance Sheet for those derivative financial instruments entered into with counterparties under legally enforceable master netting agreements. The master netting agreements reduce credit risk by permitting the closeout netting of all outstanding derivative instruments under the master netting agreement with the same counterparty upon the occurrence of an event of default. The master netting agreement also may require the exchange of cash or marketable securities to collateralize either party s net position. For additional information on derivative offsetting and counterparty credit risk, see Note 15 Financial Derivatives in our 2023 Form 10-K.

 In addition to using master netting agreements and other collateral agreements to reduce credit risk associated with derivative instruments, we also seek to manage credit risk by evaluating credit ratings of counterparties and by using internal credit analysis, limits and monitoring procedures. 
 
 At September 30, 2024, cash and debt securities (primarily agency mortgage-backed securities) totaling billion were pledged to us under master netting agreements and other collateral agreements to collateralize net derivative assets due from counterparties and to

billion under these agreements to collateralize net derivative liabilities owed to counterparties and to meet initial margin requirements. These totals may differ from the amounts presented in the preceding offsetting table because these totals may include collateral exchanged under an agreement that does not qualify as a master netting agreement or because the total amount of collateral pledged exceeds the net derivative fair values with the counterparty as of the balance sheet date due to timing or other factors, such as initial margin. To the extent not netted against the derivative fair values under a master netting agreement, the receivable for cash pledged is included in Other assets and the obligation for cash held is included in Other liabilities on our Consolidated Balance Sheet. Securities pledged to us by counterparties are not recognized on our balance sheet. Likewise, securities we have pledged to counterparties remain on our balance sheet. 
 
 Credit-Risk Contingent Features 
 
 Certain derivative agreements contain various credit-risk-related contingent provisions, such as those that require our debt to maintain a specified credit rating from one or more of the major credit rating agencies. If our debt ratings were to fall below such specified ratings, the counterparties to the derivative instruments could request immediate payment or demand immediate and ongoing full collateralization on derivative instruments in net liability positions. The following table presents the aggregate fair value of derivative instruments with credit-risk-related contingent features, the associated collateral posted in the normal course of business and the maximum amount of collateral we would be required to post if the credit-risk-related contingent features underlying these agreements had been triggered on September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023.

 million. The estimates included in this amount are based on our analysis of currently available information and are subject to significant judgment and a variety of assumptions and uncertainties. As new information is obtained we may change our estimates. Due to the inherent subjectivity of the assessments and unpredictability of outcomes of legal proceedings, any amounts accrued or included in this aggregate amount may not represent the ultimate loss to us from the legal proceedings in question. Thus, our exposure and ultimate losses may be higher, and possibly significantly so, than the amounts accrued or this aggregate amount. 
 
 As a result of the types of factors described in Note 20 Legal Proceedings in our 2023 Form 10-K, we are unable, at this time, to estimate the losses that are reasonably possible to be incurred or ranges of such losses with respect to some of the Disclosed Matters, and the aggregate estimated amount provided above does not include an estimate for every Disclosed Matter. Therefore, as the estimated aggregate amount disclosed above does not include all of the Disclosed Matters, the amount disclosed above does not represent our maximum reasonably possible loss exposure for all of the Disclosed Matters. The estimated aggregate amount also does not reflect any of our exposure to matters not so disclosed, as discussed below under Other. 
 
 We include in some of the descriptions of individual Disclosed Matters certain quantitative information related to the plaintiff s claim against us as alleged in the plaintiff s pleadings or other public filings or otherwise publicly available information. While information of this type may provide insight into the potential magnitude of a matter, it does not necessarily represent our estimate of reasonably possible loss or our judgment as to any currently appropriate accrual. 
 
 Some of our exposure in Disclosed Matters may be offset by applicable insurance coverage. We do not consider the possible availability of insurance coverage in determining the amounts of any accruals (although we would record the amount of related insurance recoveries that are deemed probable up to the amount of the accrual) or in determining any estimates of possible losses or ranges of possible losses.

 (a) Nonaccrual loans are included in loans, net of unearned income. The impact of financial derivatives used in interest rate risk management is included in the interest income/expense and average yields/rates of the related assets and liabilities. Basis adjustments related to hedged items are included in noninterest-earning assets and noninterest-bearing liabilities. Average balances of securities are based on amortized historical cost (excluding adjustments to fair value, which are included in other assets). Average balances for certain loans and borrowed funds accounted for at fair value are included in noninterest-earning assets and noninterest-bearing liabilities, with changes in fair value recorded in Noninterest income. 
 (b) Loan fees for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023 were 48 million and 47 million, respectively. Loan fees for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023 were 139 million and 137 million, respectively. 
 (c) Interest income calculated as taxable-equivalent interest income. To provide more meaningful comparisons of interest income and yields for all interest-earning assets, as well as net interest margins, we use interest income on a taxable-equivalent basis in calculating average yields and net interest margin by increasing the interest income earned on tax-exempt assets to make it fully equivalent to interest income earned on taxable investments. This adjustment is not permitted under GAAP. See Reconciliation of Taxable-Equivalent Net Interest Income in this Statistical Information section for more information.

 (a) The interest income earned on certain interest-earning assets is completely or partially exempt from federal income tax. As such, these tax-exempt instruments typically yield lower returns than taxable investments. To provide more meaningful comparisons of net interest income, we use interest income on a taxable-equivalent basis by increasing the interest income earned on tax-exempt assets to make it fully equivalent to interest income earned on taxable investments. This adjustment is not permitted under GAAP.

Such GAAP reconciliations may be in materials for the applicable presentation, in materials for prior presentations or in our annual, quarterly or current reports.

 have been paid or declared and set apart for payment. The Board of Directors currently intends to continue the policy of paying quarterly cash dividends. The amount of any future dividends will depend on economic and market conditions, our financial condition and operating results, and other factors, including contractual restrictions and applicable government regulations and policies (such as those relating to the ability of bank and non-bank subsidiaries to pay dividends to the parent company and regulatory capital limitations). The amount of our dividend is also currently subject to the results of the supervisory assessment of capital adequacy and capital planning processes undertaken by the Federal Reserve as part of the CCAR process, which includes setting PNC s SCB, as described in the Capital Management portion of the Risk Management section of this Report and in the Supervision and Regulation section in Item 1 of our 2023 Form 10-K.

You will also continue to be eligible to receive financial planning services from The Ayco Company through December 31, 2024. 7. You will be eligible to enroll in and receive talent transition services through the My Next Season, Plus Program. 8. You are not eligible to participate in PNC s Displacement Benefits Plan or its Severance Plan, but this Agreement will be considered in lieu thereof. 9.

Certain provisions of the Code continue to apply even after you are no longer employed by PNC. 

Ganesh Krishnan July 24 2024 Page 3 11. You will not engage in any Competitive Activity (defined below) in the United States during the period commencing on the Separation Date and ending on the six-month anniversary of the Separation Date (the Non-Compete Period ). For purposes of this Agreement, Competitive Activity means any employment or other service with any of the companies listed as members of PNC s peer group in the Compensation Discussion and Analysis section of PNC s 2024 Proxy Statement, including service as an agent, consultant, independent contractor, employee, officer or director. To the extent that you engage in Competitive Activity prior to the end of the Non- Compete Period, PNC will cancel the remaining portion of the Continued Base Salary Payments and the Severance Payment as of the date of such determination. If any of this paragraph 11 is determined by a court of competent jurisdiction to be unenforceable because it is unreasonable either as to length of time or area to which the restriction applies, it is the intent of both parties that the court reduce and reform the restriction to apply the greatest limitations considered enforceable by the court. If it becomes necessary or desirable for PNC to seek compliance with the provisions of this paragraph 11 by legal proceedings, the period during which you will comply with said provisions will extend for a period of 6 months from the date PNC institutes legal proceedings for injunctive or other relief. 12. You understand and agree that, both during and after your employment with PNC, except as required by law and subject to the retained rights described in paragraphs 20-22 below, you must maintain the confidentiality of all information and knowledge acquired by you during your employment with PNC, which belongs to PNC or its customers, and which has not been published, disseminated or otherwise become a matter of general public knowledge. This includes non-public information about PNC s or its customers businesses, operations, finances, customers, employees, whether in written form or committed to memory. For the avoidance of doubt, you may reveal your post-employment restrictions as contained in this Agreement and as contained in your equity award agreements under the applicable equity incentive plans to your provider of talent transition services and potential future employers without violating any confidentiality restrictions. 13. You acknowledge and agree that, except as otherwise required by law or as permitted under paragraphs 20-22 of this Agreement, you will refrain from making any comments or engaging in publicity or any other action or activity which could reasonably be expected to adversely affect the personal or professional reputation of PNC or any of its current or former directors, officers or employees. You should direct all reference requests from prospective employers or others to PNC s third party administrator, The Work Number (1-800-367-5690 or www.theworknumber.com). PNC s standard policy and practice is that it will not provide references or respond to inquiries from potential employers or other third parties regarding your PNC employment, but will verify, through The Work Number, only your dates of employment and last position held. If you provide authorization, The Work Number will also release compensation information for the current and previous two calendar years. 

Ganesh Krishnan July 24 2024 Page 4 14. During and after separation from your employment, you agree to reasonably cooperate with PNC, its subsidiaries and affiliates, at any level, and any of their officers, directors, shareholders, or employees: (a) concerning requests for information about the business of PNC or its subsidiaries or affiliates or your involvement and participation therein; (b) in connection with any investigation or review by PNC or any federal, state or local regulatory, quasi-regulatory or self-governing authority (including, without limitation, the Securities and Exchange Commission) as any such investigation or review relates to events or occurrences that transpired while you were employed by PNC; and (c) with respect to transition and succession matters. Your cooperation shall include, but not be limited to (taking into account your personal and professional obligations, including those to any new employer or entity to which you provide services), being available to meet and speak with officers or employees of PNC or its counsel at reasonable times and locations, executing accurate and truthful documents and taking such other actions as may reasonably be requested by PNC or its counsel to effectuate the foregoing. PNC agrees to reimburse you for all reasonable expenses incurred with respect to any obligations arising under this paragraph. 15. On or before your Separation Date, you must return all PNC property including any identification cards, stationery, secure IDs, credit cards, keys, computers and any related equipment, files, records, documents, manuals, software, data and any other items or information belonging to PNC or its customers, shareholders, officers, directors or employees. This also includes any files or records that are electronically stored on a personal computer or any other storage device. 16. Although your Separation Date is August 1, 2024, it is understood and agreed that your employment may be terminated earlier by you voluntarily or by PNC for Cause, which for purposes of this Agreement, shall be defined as a violation of PNC s Code of Business Conduct and Ethics or related employee conduct policies, or a breach of this Agreement. If the event(s) giving rise to a Cause determination is curable, you will be a reasonable opportunity to cure the violation or breach and obviate the early termination. To be eligible to receive payments or benefits under this Agreement, you must be actively employed by PNC or on an approved leave until the Separation Date. 17. You agree to the following representations, and recognize that each of them is an important consideration for PNC's willingness to enter into this Agreement with you: (a) You have carefully read and understand each provision in this Agreement and have been advised that you may discuss with an attorney of your choosing whether to accept and sign this Agreement, and have been given the opportunity to consult with such attorney; (b) You have been given at least 21 days after receipt of the original version of this Agreement to consider whether to sign it, and you waive any right to an extension of that time based on any revisions to this Agreement after discussions with your attorney or PNC;

General Waiver and Release. In exchange for the payments and benefits offered by PNC, you: (a) Fully, irrevocably and unconditionally release and forever discharge PNC and any of its predecessor or affiliate companies and each and all of their officers, directors, agents, representatives, employees and shareholders, and their successors and assigns, and all persons acting by, through, under, for or in concert with them (hereinafter individually or collectively, the Released Parties from any and all charges, complaints and liability for claims of any kind or nature, known or unknown which you now have or could claim to have regarding events that occurred on or before the expiration of the revocation period set forth in paragraph 17(c) above (hereinafter referred to as a Claim or Claims ), including, without limitation, Claims of or based on negligence, intentional torts, breach of contract (implied, oral or written), violation of federal, state or local laws that prohibit discrimination or retaliation, the Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967 ADEA ), any employee welfare benefit or pension plan governed by the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended, the Civil Rights Act of 1964, as amended, the Older Workers Benefit Protection Act, as amended, the Americans with Disabilities Act, as amended, Section 503 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, the

You further waive any Claim or right to payment of attorneys' fees or expenses; and (b) To the extent permitted by law, you agree not to commence, directly or indirectly, any action, suit, or proceeding based upon any Claims released in this Agreement, except that you may bring a Claim to enforce this Agreement or under the ADEA to challenge the release of Claims under the ADEA set forth above. You further agree that: (1) if you commence an action or proceeding in violation of this Agreement, you shall be liable for the reasonable attorneys fees and costs incurred by PNC as a result; and (2) if any such action or proceeding is commenced, in whole or in part, on your behalf by any third person, entity or agency in any forum, including without limitation in a class or collective action against any of the Released Parties, you waive any Claim or right in connection with such action or proceeding to any resulting money damages or other personal, legal or equitable relief awarded by any court or governmental authority. 19.

Ganesh Krishnan July 24 2024 Page 7 20. Nothing in this Agreement, including the confidentiality provisions (paragraphs 12) and the general waiver and release (paragraph 18), is intended to discourage you from communicating or participating in an investigation with a federal, state or local government agency or commission, including but not limited to the Securities and Exchange Commission, the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, the National Labor Relations Board, or the Occupational Safety and Health Administration. You further understand and agree that you are not required to contact or receive consent from PNC before engaging in communications with a government agency. 21. By signing this Agreement, you waive the right to receive damages or other relief, whether equitable or legal, from any charge or action you may file, or which is filed on your behalf with a government agency, but it will not limit your ability to receive an incentive award authorized under federal statute or regulation for information provided to the Securities and Exchange Commission or other federal or state regulatory or law enforcement agency, if applicable. 22. Regardless of any other provision in this Agreement, you may be entitled to immunity and protection from retaliation under the Defend Trade Secrets Act of 2016 for disclosing trade secrets under certain limited circumstances, as set forth in PNC s Defend Trade Secrets Act policy. 23.

You and PNC agree that if any portion of this Agreement (other than the general waiver and release in paragraph 18) is determined by a court to be invalid or unenforceable for any reason, that determination will not affect the remaining terms of this Agreement. To the extent any portion of the Agreement found to be invalid or unenforceable can be modified to make it valid and enforceable, it shall be deemed to be so modified. To the extent the offending provision cannot be modified and still comport with the parties' intent, it shall be deemed deleted from the Agreement. 25. You agree that if you breach any of your obligations under this Agreement, including the agreement not to sue, you shall return any and all amounts that have been provided to you under this Agreement, and PNC will make no further payments to you under this Agreement. You further understand and agree that PNC may seek any other relief it is entitled to under this Agreement or applicable law as a result of your breach of the Agreement. 26. Any dispute or claim arising out of or relating to this Agreement may be brought only in the Court of Common Pleas of Allegheny County, Pennsylvania, or in the federal court for the 

Ganesh Krishnan July 24 2024 Page 8 Western District of Pennsylvania, as appropriate, which shall apply Pennsylvania Law in the interpretation of the Agreement. Both you and PNC also waive any right to trial by jury with regard to any action arising under or in connection with this Agreement. 27. Neither this Agreement, nor any of the rights, obligations or interests arising under the Agreement may be assigned to another person or entity without the prior written consent of the parties. 28. You agree that you are solely responsible for any applicable taxes (including, without limitation, income and excise taxes), penalties and interest that you incur in connection with the payments and benefits under this Agreement. If any such withholding is required prior to the time amounts are payable to you hereunder or if such amounts are not sufficient to satisfy such obligation in full, the withholding will be taken from other compensation then payable to you or as otherwise determined by PNC. This Agreement is intended to comply with or be exempt from Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, and related regulations and guidance (collectively Code Section 409A ). PNC will have discretion to interpret this Agreement and any associated documents in any manner that creates an exemption from (or compliance with) the requirements of Code Section 409A. Severance benefits under this Agreement are intended to be exempt from Code Section 409A under the short-term deferral exception, to the maximum extent applicable, and then under the separation pay exception, to the maximum extent applicable. For purposes of Code Section 409A, each payment hereunder shall be treated as a separate payment and the right to a series of installment payments under this Agreement shall be treated as a right to a series of separate payments. To the extent a payment under this Agreement is subject to (and not exempt from) Code Section 409A: (a) Whenever a payment under this Agreement specifies a payment period with reference to a number of days (for example, payment shall be made within forty-five (45) days of your Separation Date ), the actual date of payment within the specified period shall be at the sole discretion of PNC. (b) You cannot, directly or indirectly, designate the calendar year of any payment to be made under this Agreement. (c) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, if you are considered a specified employee for purposes of Code Section 409A and if payment of any amounts under this Agreement is required to be delayed for a period of six months after separation from service pursuant to Code Section 409A, payment of such amounts shall be delayed as required by Code Section 409A, and the accumulated amounts shall be paid in a lump sum payment within ten days after the end of the six-month period. If you die during the postponement period prior to the payment of benefits, the amounts withheld on 

Ganesh Krishnan July 24 2024 Page 9 account of Code Section 409A shall be paid to the personal representative of your estate within 45 days after the date of your death. (d) All reimbursements and in-kind benefits provided under this Agreement shall be made or provided in accordance with the requirements of Section 409A of the Code, including, where applicable, the requirement that (i) any reimbursement is for expenses incurred during the period of time specified in this Agreement, (ii) the amount of expenses eligible for reimbursement, or in kind benefits provided, during a calendar year may not affect the expenses eligible for reimbursement, or in kind benefits to be provided, in any other calendar year, (iii) the reimbursement of an eligible expense will be made no later than the last day of the calendar year following the year in which the expense is incurred, and (iv) the right to reimbursement or in kind benefits is not subject to liquidation or exchange for another benefit. If you concur with the terms and conditions of this Agreement, please sign, date and return it to me no later than August 6, 2024. You should keep a copy for your records.
