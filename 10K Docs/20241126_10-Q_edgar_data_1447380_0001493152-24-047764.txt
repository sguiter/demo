The
Company s execution of the Asset Purchase Agreement has met the criteria to be reported as discontinued operations. In accordance
with GAAP, assets and liabilities of discontinued operations are presented separately in the Consolidated Balance Sheets, and results
of discontinued operations are reported as a separate component of Consolidated net loss in the Consolidated Statements of Loss, for
all periods presented, resulting in changes to the presentation of certain prior period amounts. Cash flows from discontinued operations
are not reported separately in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. The assets and liabilities of discontinued operations
are presented separately in the Consolidated Balance Sheets for all periods presented. 

of cash as of September 30, 2024. We had a net loss of for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, and we used
 of cash in our operating activities during that time. In the nine months ended September 30, 2023 we had a net loss of 
and used of cash in our operating expenses. We raised million in cash Convertible Notes issued during 2023. We raised
an additional million from the issuance of convertible notes in 2024. There is substantial doubt that our additional cash from our
warrant conversion along with our expected cash flow from operations, will be sufficient to fund our 12-month plan of operations, and
there can be no assurance that we will not require significant additional capital within 12 months. 

As
shown in the accompanying financial statements, the Company has incurred net losses from operations resulting in an accumulated deficit
of million as of September 30, 2024. Further losses are anticipated in the development of the Company s business raising
substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. The ability to continue as a going concern is dependent
upon the Company generating profitable operations in the future and/or obtaining the necessary financing to meet its obligations and
repay its liabilities arising from normal business operations when they come due. Management intends to finance operating costs over
the next 12 months with proceeds from the sale of securities, and/or revenues from operations. These financial statements do not include
any adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification of recorded asset amounts, or amounts and classification of liabilities
that might result from this uncertainty.

Secured
Promissory Notes 

On
June 30, 2021, we entered into a Credit Facility Agreement (the Credit Agreement with Thomas Akin, one of the Company s
directors (the Lender ). The Credit Agreement was amended on November 11, 2022. The Company can borrow up to 
under the Credit Agreement the Credit Facility ). 

The
Credit Facility is secured by all of our tangible and intangible assets including intellectual property. This loan bears interest on
the unpaid balance at the rate of fifteen percent per annum. The Company may prepay this loan without notice, penalty, or charge.
In consideration of the Lender s agreement to provide the Credit Facility, the Company issued warrants to purchase shares of its
common stock at an exercise price of per share in connection with the issuance of funds under the Credit Agreement. The warrants
are exercisable for a period commencing upon issuance of the corresponding notes and ending 36 months after issuance of the financing.
In addition, . 

Under
the original terms of the Credit Agreement, the Company was to begin repaying the principal amount, plus accrued interest, in equal
monthly installments commencing on June 30, 2022, and ending on June 30, 2024. On November 11, 2022, an amendment to the Credit Agreement
was signed. The amendment updated the payment terms to the following: Without limiting the foregoing Section 2.3(a), Borrower
shall repay the principal amount of all Advances, plus accrued interest thereon, in 24 equal monthly installments commencing on January
31, 2023 and continuing thereafter on the last day of each month (or, if such last day is not a Business Day, on the Business Day immediately
preceding such last day. Interest on the unpaid Advances will accrue from the date of each Advance at a rate equal to fifteen percent per annum. Interest will be calculated on the basis of 365 days in a year. The amendment raised the maximum amount of the
Credit Facility to . In addition, the interest which is accrued monthly between July 1, 2022, and December 31, 2022, will be
settled into equity. Common Stock will be issued at the end of each month at a rate of per share of common stock in the amount
of the interest accrued for each month. 

On
January 31, 2023, the Company then entered into Amendment No. 1 (the Amendment ), which amends our existing Credit Facility
Agreement [1] , dated as of November 11, 2022, between the Company and Thomas B. Akin, and any convertible notes issued
thereunder. The Amendment amends the existing Credit Facility Agreement to extend the maturity of the agreement and related convertible
notes thereunder until December 1, 2025. Principal payments have been deferred to a period beginning on January 1, 2024 and ending December
1, 2025, and further provides that any accrued interest on unpaid advances under the agreement is to be paid quarterly in shares of our
common stock, at a price per share equal to the volume-weighted average price of our common stock quoted on the Over-The Counter Venture
Market operated by OTC Markets Group Inc. OTCQB over the ninety (90) trading days immediately preceding such date.
The Amendment provides for corresponding amendments to the form of convertible notes to be issued under the Credit Agreement in the future
and any outstanding convertible notes issued under the existing Credit Facility Agreement. The Amendment was considered a debt modification
as the cash flows under the amended terms do not differ by at least 10 from the cash flows under the original agreement. 

On
January 31, 2024 amended terms were agreed upon and the Company then entered into Amendment No. 2 (the Amendment signed
on May 3,2024, which amends the terms of the Credit Facility Agreement, between the Company and Thomas B. Akin, and any convertible notes
issued thereunder. The Amendment amends the existing Credit Facility Agreement to extend the maturity of the agreement and related convertible
notes thereunder until June 30, 2026. Principal payments have been deferred to a period beginning on July 31, 2024 and ending June 30,
2026.

real-world products and offers. The key elements to our strategy are:

 our Recurrency platform into digital environments and deliver rewards based on activities taken in a digital environment. Because
 of our long history operating as a loyalty marketing solution we believe we have a defensible head start and ability to continue
 building products and features that will retain our competitive advantage.

 out and differentiate our platform; (3) opportunities for substantial expense reductions through integration into our platform; and

 in the technology industry. We plan to continue our investment in building a strong intellectual property portfolio.

Foreign
Currency 

The
Company s financial results are impacted by volatility in the Canadian/U.S. Dollar exchange rate. The average U.S. Dollar exchange
rate for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, was 1 Canadian equals 0.74 U.S. Dollars, respectively. This compares to
an average rate of 1 Canadian equals 0.74 during the same period in 2023. The Company s functional or measurement currency is
the U.S. Dollar. Based on a U.S. Dollar functional currency, the following are the key areas impacted by foreign currency volatility: 

The
 Company sells products primarily in U.S. Dollars; therefore, reported revenues are not highly impacted by foreign currency volatility. 

A
 portion of the Company s expenses are incurred in Canadian Dollars and therefore fluctuate in U.S. Dollars as the U.S. Dollar
 varies. A weaker U.S. Dollar results in an increase in translated expenses, and a stronger U.S. Dollar results in a decrease. 

Changes
 in foreign currency rates also impact the translated value of the Company s working capital that is held in Canadian Dollars.
 Foreign exchange rate fluctuations result in foreign exchange gains or losses based upon movement in the translated value of Canadian
 working capital into U.S. Dollars. 

The
change in foreign currency was a gain of 1,358 and a loss of 91,825 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. 

The
change in foreign currency was a gain of 216,687 and a gain of 123,190 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. 

Liquidity
and Capital Resources 

As
of September 30, 2024, we had current assets of 1,367,564, including 532,450 in cash, and current liabilities of 8,090,773, resulting
in a working capital deficit of 6,723,209. 

We
believe as of the date of this report, we do not have the working capital on hand, along with our expected cash flow from operations
and budget reductions, to sufficiently fund our current level of operations through the end of the next 12 months or beyond. We will
require additional capital and will seek to obtain additional working capital through the sale of our securities and, if available, bank
lines of credit. There can be no assurance we will be able to obtain access to capital as and when needed, or that the terms of any available
financing will be commercially reasonable. 

The
Company entered in to a sublease on March 1, 2024 for its office facilities in Chandler, AZ through February 28, 2025. Monthly rental
payments including rental of office furniture and excluding taxes, are 24,470. The Company has transition to a 100 remote work force
and this has resulted in a decrease in monthly rental expense.

4. Controls and Procedures. 

Evaluation
of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

As
required by Rule 13a-15(b) promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act ), our management,
with the participation of our Principal Executive Officer and Interim Chief Financial Officer, evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure
controls and procedures, as defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(e), as of the end of the period covered by this report. Disclosure
controls and procedures, as defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(e), are controls and other procedures that are designed to ensure
that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed,
summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include,
without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we
file or submit under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Principal Executive Officer and
Interim Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Based on this evaluation, our
management, including our Principal Executive Officer and Interim Chief Financial Officer, concluded that as of September 30, 2024 our
disclosure controls and procedures were not effective. 

As
a small company with limited resources that are mainly focused on the development and sales of software products and services, the Company
does not employ a sufficient number of staff in its finance department to possess an optimal segregation of duties or to provide optimal
levels of oversight. This has resulted in certain audit adjustments and management believes that there may be a possibility for a material
misstatement to occur in future periods while it employs the current number of personnel in its finance department. 

Changes
in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 

There
were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act,
that occurred during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect,
our internal control over financial reporting.
