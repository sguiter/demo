EXPLANATORY
NOTE 

This
Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q (this Form 10-Q of Next Bridge Hydrocarbons, Inc. (the Company, we, 
 our, or us for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, includes consolidated comparative financial statements
and disclosures for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 which have been restated from the Form 10-Q, previously filed on November
14, 2023, for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC (the Original
Filing ). 

Reference
Note 12 in the accompanying Notes to Financial Statements for detailed disclosure of items amended by the restatement. 

Items
Amended in this Filing 

This
Form 10-Q amends and restates the consolidated financial statements and related disclosures from the Original Filing principally as it
relates to an impairment analysis with respect to the Orogrande properties that was performed during the 2023 audit and the related reaudit
of the Company s fiscal year 2022 consolidated financial statements. The Orogrande impairment adjustment made at December 31, 2022
arose from circumstances that continue to apply at September 30, 2024. 

For
the year ended December 31, 2023, the Company determined that it was in the best interest of the Company and its stockholders to engage
a new independent public accounting firm, M K CPAS, PLLC (the Accounting Firm ). Due to the change in auditor,
the Company also determined that it was in the best interest of the Company to prepare restated financial statements for the fiscal year
ended December 31, 2022. The Accounting Firm, acting solely in its capacity as the Company s independent registered accounting
firm, issued its report on the restated financial statements for the 2022 fiscal year based on its audit and audited the financial statements
for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023. The Accounting Firm reviewed materials provided by the Company that would customarily be
considered in connection with a complete audit in compliance with the auditing standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board,
including historical data and information available at the time of the restatement audit with respect to the lack of revenue earned from
the oil and natural gas property subject to the Orogrande Project mineral lease, and the uncertainty with respect to the renewal of the
lease term. As a result, the Company and its management determined that, based on the applicable GAAP standards for extractive activities,
there was a triggering event with respect to the uncertainty of the mineral lease renewal and, since the mineral lease and the oil and
natural gas properties subject thereto have always been identified as unevaluated property since the 2022 fiscal year and
for all subsequent periods, the Company reasonably determined that such assets should have been fully impaired for the 2022 fiscal year
and all subsequent periods. 

Management
applied accounting procedures to examine the need for an impairment adjustment to the carrying value of its unevaluated oil and natural
gas properties. A triggering event related to the potential expiration of the underlying mineral lease related to the Company s
Orogrande Project on December 31, 2024 was noted. Although negotiation discussions with the lessor are in progress, there was no assurance
that the mineral lease would, in fact, be renewed before December 31, 2024. The conclusion reached was to impair 100 of the carrying
value of the Company s oil and natural gas assets as of December 31, 2023. The Company s management determined that full
impairment is in line with the standard practices within the oil and gas exploration industry for periods in which the term of the lease
is uncertain and subject to renewal. 

Given
the combined auditing engagement for 2022 with the audit for 2023, the Company recorded an impairment adjustment as of December 31, 2022,
and as of December 31, 2023. Interim 2023 quarters also require impairment adjustments for additions related to Orogrande development
cost additions to the full cost pool during each quarter to achieve consistency with audited financials for the year ended December 31,
2023, which were included in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K that was filed with the SEC on July 17, 2024.

CAUTIONARY
NOTE REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS 

This
quarterly report on Form 10-Q contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act
of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act ). These forward-looking
statements may be identified by their use of terms such as anticipate, assume, believe, budget, 
 can, could, estimate, expect, forecast, goal, intend, 
 may, pending, plan, potential, projected, will, and
similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements. All statements other than statements of historical facts included
in this report are forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements appear throughout this report, and include statements about
such matters as: 

amount
 and timing of future production of oil and natural gas; 

amount,
 nature and timing of capital expenditures; 

the
 number of anticipated wells to be drilled after the date hereof; 

the
 availability of exploration and development opportunities; 

our
 financial or operating results; 

our
 cash flow and anticipated liquidity; 

operating
 costs including lease operating expenses, administrative costs and other expenses; 

finding
 and development costs; 

our
 business strategy; and 

other
 plans and objectives for future operations. 

Our
actual results and condition could differ materially from those implied or expressed in the forward-looking statements for any reason.
They can be affected by a number of factors, including, among others: 

the
 risks described in Risk Factors in Part I, Item 1A of our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December
 31, 2023, filed on July 17, 2024; 

the
 volatility of prices and supply of, and demand for, oil and natural gas; 

the
 timing and success of our drilling activities; 

the
 numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities of oil and natural gas reserves and actual future production rates and associated
 costs; 

our
 ability to successfully identify, execute or effectively integrate future acquisitions; 

the
 usual hazards associated with the oil and natural gas industry, including fires, well blowouts, pipe failure, spills, explosions
 and other unforeseen hazards; 

our
 ability to effectively market our oil and natural gas; 

the
 availability of rigs, equipment, supplies and personnel; 

our
 ability to discover or acquire additional reserves; 

our
 ability to satisfy future capital requirements; 

4 

changes
 in regulatory requirements; 

general
 economic conditions, status of the financial markets and competitive conditions; 

our
 ability to retain key members of our senior management and key employees; and 

our
 ability to renew oil and gas leases before they expire. 

Moreover,
we operate in a rapidly evolving environment. New risk factors and uncertainties emerge from time to time, and it is not possible for
our management to predict all the risk factors and uncertainties, nor can we assess the impact of all factors on our business or the
extent to which any factor, or combination of factors, may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking
statements. We qualify all of our forward-looking statements by these cautionary statements. 

You
should not rely upon forward-looking statements as predictions of future events. The forward-looking statements made in this report relate
only to events or information available to us as of the date of this report. Except as required by law, we undertake no obligation to
update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.

DEFINITIONS 

The
following are abbreviations and definitions of terms commonly used in the oil and gas industry and in this report. Natural gas equivalents
and crude oil equivalents are determined using the ratio of six Mcf to one barrel. All references to us , our ,
 we , NBH , or Next Bridge mean Next Bridge Hydrocarbons, Inc. and where applicable, its consolidated
subsidiaries. 

Bbl 
means a barrel of U.S. 42 gallons of oil. 

Bcf 
means one billion cubic feet of natural gas. 

BOE 
means one barrel of oil equivalent. 

Completion 
means the installation of permanent equipment for the production of oil or gas. 

Condensate 
means natural gas in liquid form produced in connection with natural gas wells. 

Exploratory
well means a well drilled to find a new field or to find a new productive reservoir in a field previously found to be productive
of oil or natural gas in another reservoir or to extend a known reservoir. 

Gross 
when used with respect to acres or wells, production or reserves refers to the total acres or wells in which we or another specified
person has a working interest. 

MBbls 
means one thousand barrels of oil. 

Mcf 
means one thousand cubic feet of natural gas. 

Net 
when used with respect to acres or wells, refers to gross acres of wells multiplied, in each case, by the percentage working interest
owned by us. 

NGL 
refers to natural gas liquids, which is composed exclusively of carbon and hydrogen. 

Oil 
means crude oil or condensate. 

Operator 
means the individual or company responsible for the exploration, development, and production of an oil or gas well or lease. 

Proved
developed non-producing means reserves (i) expected to be recovered from zones capable of producing but which are shut-in
because no market outlet exists at the present time or whose date of connection to a pipeline is uncertain or (ii) currently behind the
pipe in existing wells, which are considered proved by virtue of successful testing or production of offsetting wells. 

Proved
developed producing means reserves expected to be recovered from currently producing zones under continuation of present operating
methods. This category includes recently completed shut-in gas wells scheduled for connection to a pipeline in the near future. 

Proved
developed reserves means reserves that can be expected to be recovered through existing wells with existing equipment or operating
methods. 

Proved
reserves means the estimated quantities of crude oil, natural gas, and natural gas liquids which geological and engineering
data demonstrate with reasonable certainty to be recoverable in future years from known reservoirs under existing economic and operating
conditions, i.e., prices and costs as of the date the estimate is made. Prices include consideration of changes in existing prices provided
by contractual arrangements. 

6 

Proved
undeveloped reserves means reserves that are expected to be recovered from new wells on undrilled acreage, or from existing
wells where a relatively major expenditure is required for recompletion. Reserves on undrilled acreage are limited to those drilling
locations offsetting productive wells that are reasonably certain of production when drilled or where it can be demonstrated with certainty
that there is continuity of production from the existing productive formation. 

Recompletion 
means the completion for production of an existing well bore in another formation from which the well has been previously completed. 

Royalty 
means an interest in an oil and gas lease that gives the owner of the interest the right to receive a portion of the production from
the leased acreage (or of the proceeds of the sale thereof), but generally does not require the owner to pay any portion of the costs
of drilling or operating the wells on the leased acreage. Royalties may be either landowner s royalties, which are reserved by
the owner of the leased acreage at the time the lease is granted, or overriding royalties, which are usually reserved by an owner of
the leasehold in connection with a transfer to a subsequent owner. 

SEC 
means the United States Securities and Exchange Commission. 

Working
interest means an interest in an oil and gas lease that gives the owner of the interest the right to drill for and produce
oil and gas on the leased acreage and requires the owner to pay a share of the costs of drilling and production operations. The share
of production to which a working interest owner is entitled will always be smaller than the share of costs that the working interest
owner is required to bear, with the balance of the production accruing to the owners of royalties. For example, the owner of a 100 working
interest in a lease burdened only by a landowner s royalty of 12.5 would be required to pay 100 of the costs of a well but would
be entitled to retain 87.5 of the production.

 September

 (Unaudited) 

for the nine months
ended September 30, 2024. The Company expects to incur further losses in the development of its business. The Company had a working capital
deficit as of September 30, 2024, of . These conditions raise substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue
as a going concern. 

The
Company s ability to continue as a going concern is dependent on its ability to generate future profitable operations or to obtain
the necessary financing to meet its obligations and repay its liabilities arising from normal business operations when they come due.
Management s plan to address the Company s ability to continue as a going concern includes: (1) obtaining debt or equity
funding from private placement, institutional, or public sources; (2) obtaining loans from financial institutions, where possible, or
(3) participating in joint venture transactions with third parties. Although management believes that it will be able to obtain the necessary
funding to allow the Company to remain a going concern through the methods discussed above, there can be no assurances that such methods
will prove successful. 

These
consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern and therefore, the financial
statements do not include any adjustments to reflect the possible future effects on the recoverability and classification of assets or
the amount and classifications of liabilities that may result from the outcome of this uncertainty. 

12 

of interest on
unevaluated properties. Capitalized interest for the year ended December 31, 2023, was . 

The
ceiling test calculation uses a commodity price assumption which is based on the unweighted arithmetic average of the price on the first
day of each month for each month within the prior 12-month period and excludes future cash outflows related to estimated abandonment
costs. 

The
determination of oil and natural gas reserves is a subjective process, and the accuracy of any reserve estimate depends on the quality
of available data and the application of engineering and geological interpretation and judgment. Estimates of economically recoverable
reserves and future net cash flows depend on a number of variable factors and assumptions that are difficult to predict and may vary
considerably from actual results. In particular, reserve estimates for wells with limited or no production history are less reliable
than those based on actual production. Subsequent re-evaluation of reserves and cost estimates related to future development of proved
oil and natural gas reserves could result in significant revisions to proved reserves. Other issues, such as changes in regulatory requirements,
technological advances, and other factors which are difficult to predict could also affect estimates of proved reserves in the future. 

Estimated
interest and penalties related to potential underpayment on any unrecognized tax benefits are classified as a component of tax expense
in the statements of operation. The Company has not recorded any interest or penalties associated with unrecognized tax benefits for
the nine months ended September 30, 2024, or for the nine months ended September 30, 2023.

Unevaluated
costs as of September 30, 2024, and December 31, 2023, include cumulative costs of developing projects including the Orogrande and Hazel
Projects in West Texas, costs related to the Oklahoma Properties, and unevaluated costs related to the Louisiana Wildcat projects. The
 325,710 balance of oil and natural gas properties as of September 30, 2024, is entirely attributable to the Wildcat projects. Accumulated
impairment adjustments relate solely to the Orogrande Project. In accordance with required accounting adjustments related to the Spin-Off,
the carrying value of the oil and natural gas assets were adjusted to fair value as of December 15, 2022. Impairment adjustments disclosed
above were partially recorded as of December 31, 2022, as of December 31, 2023, March 31, 2024, June 30, 2024 and as of September 30,
2024. 

The
Company periodically adjusts for the separation of evaluated versus unevaluated costs within its full cost pool to recognize the value
impairment related to the expiration of, or changes in market value, of unevaluated leases. The impact of reclassifications as they become
necessary is to increase the basis for calculation of future period s depletion, depreciation and amortization which effectively
recognizes the impairment on the consolidated statement of operations over future periods. Reclassified costs also become evaluated costs
for purposes of ceiling tests, and which may cause recognition of increased impairment expense in future periods. There were no remaining
cumulative unevaluated costs for the Orogrande Project which had been impaired within the Company s full cost pool totals as of
September 30, 2024, or at December 31, 2023. The balance of oil and gas properties as of September 30, 2024 consists of accumulated costs
associated with the Wildcat properties. 

The
Company had no proved reserve value associated with our properties as of September 30, 2024. 

Due
to the volatility of commodity prices, should oil and natural gas prices decline in the future, it is possible that a write-down could
occur. Proved reserves are estimated quantities of crude oil, natural gas, and NGLs, which geological and engineering data demonstrate
with reasonable certainty to be recoverable from known reservoirs under existing economic and operating conditions. The independent engineering
estimates include only those amounts considered to be proved reserves and do not include additional amounts which may result from new
discoveries in the future, or from application of secondary and tertiary recovery processes where facilities are not in place or for
which transportation or marketing contracts are not in place. Estimated reserves to be developed through secondary or tertiary recovery
processes are classified as unevaluated properties. 

Current
Projects 

The
Company is an energy company engaged in the acquisition, exploration, exploitation and/or development of oil and natural gas properties
in the United States. The Company is primarily focused on the acquisition of early-stage projects, the development and delineation of
these projects, and then the monetization of those assets once these activities are completed. 

The
Company s primary focus is the development of interests in oil and natural gas projects it holds in the Permian Basin in West Texas.
The Company also holds minor interests in certain other oil and natural gas projects in Central Oklahoma. 

As
of September 30, 2024, the Company had interests in four oil and natural gas projects: the Orogrande Project in Hudspeth County, Texas,
the Hazel Project in Sterling, Tom Green, and Irion Counties, Texas, two wells in Central Oklahoma, and the Wildcat properties that hold
mineral leases in Louisiana. 

Orogrande
Project, West Texas 

On
August 7, 2014, Torchlight entered into a Purchase Agreement with Hudspeth, McCabe Petroleum Corporation MPC ), and Gregory
McCabe Mr. McCabe ). Mr. McCabe was the sole owner of both Hudspeth and MPC. Under the terms and conditions of the Purchase
Agreement, Torchlight purchased 100 of the capital stock of Hudspeth which held certain oil and natural gas assets, including a 100 
working interest in approximately 172,000 predominately contiguous acres in the Orogrande Basin in West Texas. Mr. McCabe has, at his
option, a 10 working interest back-in after payout and a reversionary interest if drilling obligations are not met, all under the terms
and conditions of a participation and development agreement among Hudspeth, MPC and Mr. McCabe. Such back-in interest is expected to
be contributed to the Company pursuant to that certain Contribution Agreement (as defined below). Mr. McCabe also holds a 4.5 overriding
royalty interest in the Orogrande acreage, which he obtained prior to, and was not a part of the August 2014 transaction. 

Effective March 27, 2017, the Orogrande acreage became
subject to a Development Unit Agreement 2837 with University Lands DU Agreement ), which allows for all 192 existing leases
covering approximately 134,000 gross acres leased from University Lands to be combined into one drilling and development unit for development
purposes. The term of the DU Agreement expires on December 31, 2024, and the time to drill on the drilling and development unit continues
through December 31, 2024. The DU Agreement also grants the right to extend the DU Agreement through December 31, 2028 if compliance with
the DU Agreement is met and the extension fee associated with the additional time is paid. The Company expects to exercise its option
to extend the term under the DU Agreement prior to its expiration. Reference Note 11 Subsequent Events. 

Drilling obligations under the DU Agreement include
five wells per year in years 2021, 2022, 2023, and 2024. The drilling obligations are minimum yearly requirements and may be exceeded
if acceleration is desired. 

Drilling

On
December 21, 2022, the Company entered into that certain Agreement and Plan of Merger (the Merger Agreement with Hudspeth,
Wolfbone, MPC and Mr. McCabe, pursuant to which in a series of transactions the oil and natural gas leases, the lands covered by such
leases, pooling and communitization agreements, rights-of-way, the surface estate of the lands and all wells located in Orogrande Project
will be transferred, conveyed and assigned to Hudspeth (or its designated assignee) in consideration of (1) treating the Orogrande Obligations

2016) elected to convert into a total 33.33 working interest in our Hazel Project, reducing TEI s ownership from 66.66 to a 33.33 
working interest. 

Acquisition
of Additional Interests in Hazel Project 

On
January 30, 2017, Torchlight entered into and closed an Agreement and Plan of Reorganization and a Plan of Merger with an entity which

Louisiana
Projects 

In
March 2024, we enter into and closed a Contribution Agreement with Wildcat Partners SPV, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company Wildcat ),
under which Wildcat transferred to us 100 of the issued and outstanding membership interests in each of (a) Wildcat Cowboy, LLC, a Texas
limited liability company Cowboy ), (b) Wildcat Packer, LLC, a Texas limited liability company Packer ),
(c) Wildcat Panther, LLC, a Texas limited liability company Panther and (d) Wildcat Valentine, LLC, a Texas limited liability
company Valentine ). As consideration, we issued 2,500,000 shares of our common stock, under the terms and conditions of
the Contribution Agreement. 

Since assets in only two of the four limited liability
companies that were acquired were included in the Participation Agreements for subsequent sales (see below) that followed soon after
closing the acquisition, a valuation of common shares issued in the acquisition was conducted to arrive at the basis the assets acquired.
An independent valuation was obtained which concluded the fair value per common share was .18 at the date of the acquisition for total
consideration of the 2,500,000 shares valued at 450,000. The Company allocated the 450,000 valuation to the assets sold in the amount
of 351,000. Additional basis in assets sold of 171,641 was recorded to acknowledge lease rental cost previously paid by MPC, for a
total basis in assets sold of 522,641. 

MPC
previously owned and sold to Wildcat the underlying oil and gas prospects owned by Cowboy, Packer, Panther and Valentine. MPC always
retained a 25 back-in after payout and various overriding royalty interests in the prospects owned by Cowboy, Packer, Panther and Valentine,
but MPC agreed to waive its 25 back-in after payout but retain its overriding royalty interests in all such prospects in an effort to
facilitate the transactions described below, including the sale of the leases owned by Valentine, including a leasehold estates in approximately
3,878.90 gross acres and 3,626.25 net acres of land situated in Lafourche Parish, Louisiana (the Valentine Leases ), and
the leases owned by Panther, including leasehold estates in approximately 618 gross acres and 618 net acres of land situated in Acadia
Parish, Louisiana (the Panther Leases ), the leases owned by Packer, including leasehold estates in approximately 4,349
gross acres and 4,349 net acres of land situated in Acadia and Lafourche Parish, Louisiana (the Packer Leases ), the leases
owned by Cowboy, including leasehold estates in approximately 835 gross acres and 835 net acres of land situated in Acadia Parish, Louisiana
(the Cowboy Leases). 

Concurrent with the closing of the above transactions with Wildcat, we
entered into and closed a Participation Agreement with Magnetar Exploration, L.P. Magnetar ), an unrelated developer of
oil and gas properties, for the sale of certain leasehold rights owned by two of the four limited liability companies. Under the Participation
Agreement with Magnetar, we sold a 100 working interest, entitled to not less than a 75 net revenue interest, in and to the Valentine
Leases, along with a 100 right, title and interest in all contracts affecting the Valentine Leases, all under the terms and conditions
of such Participation Agreement, including the following consideration: (a) Magnetar paid 964,448 from which we were required to pay
bonuses of 240,000 and 60,000 to Zebrowski Consulting for consulting services related to the transaction, resulting in net proceeds
to us of 664,448; (b) Magnetar agrees to pay all delay rentals pertaining to the Valentine Leases which accrue during calendar year 2024
and during the months of January through August of 2025, provided, however, that if the initial test well is commenced at any time prior
to the end of August, 2025, Magnetar s obligation to bear delay rental expenses thereafter will be deemed terminated, and the obligation
for the payment of subsequent delay rentals shall be governed by the subject operating agreement; (c) in the event Magnetar has not commenced
actual drilling operations on lands covered by the Valentine Leases on or prior August 31, 2025, then Magnetar shall have the option to
continue paying rentals or extending the leases within the Area of Mutual Interest (the AMI until December 31, 2026; (d)
we will have the option to participate for up to a 1/3 working interest in the initial test well to be undertaken by Magnetar on lands
covered by the Valentine Leases, with this right to extend to subsequent wells to be undertaken by Magnetar, subject to the further provisions
regarding operations; and (e) at least three working days prior to its spudding the initial test well, Magnetar will pay to us a spud
fee of 600,000 of which 360,000 of the cost thereof will be shared with consultants leaving us with 240,000. 

Also concurrent with the closing of the above transactions
with Wildcat, we also entered into and closed a Participation Agreement with Magnetar under which we sold to Magnetar a 100 working interest,
entitled to not less than a 75 net revenue interest, in and to the Panther Leases covering approximately 618 gross acres of land situated
within the AMI provided therein, along with a 100 right, title and interest in all contracts affecting the Panther Leases, for the following
consideration: (a) Magnetar paid 428,918.05 to us and 70,081.95 to MPC for delay rentals paid by it; (b) Magnetar agrees to reimburse
McCabe for its payment of delay rentals to sustain certain of the Panther Leases coming due in March and April 2024 in the amount of 70,081.98;
(c) Magnetar agrees to pay all delay rentals pertaining to the Panther Leases which accrue during calendar year 2024, shown to be 23,888.90;
(d) in the event Magnetar is unable to commence actual drilling operations on lands covered by the Subject Panther Leases on or prior
February 1, 2025, then Magnetar shall have the option to extend or take new leases on any of the Panther Leases that would expire during
the following 12 calendar months; (e) we will have the option to participate up to a 1/3 working interest in the initial test well to
be undertaken by Magnetar on lands covered by the Panther Leases, with this right to extend to subsequent wells to be undertaken by Magnetar,
subject to the further provisions regarding operations; (f) prior to its spudding the initial test well, Magnetar will pay to us a spud
fee equal to 100,000 of which 20,000 will be shared with a consultant. 

The company recorded a Gain on the Sale of properties
from the Wildcat acquisition of 618,504 during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 proceeds from sales totaling 1,141,142
less the Company s basis in assets sold of 522,641. 

The
McCabe Contribution Agreement 

On
July 25, 2023, the Company entered into a Contribution Agreement among the Company, Mr. McCabe, and MPC, an entity exclusively owned
and operated by Mr. McCabe (the McCabe Contribution Agreement ), pursuant to which Mr. McCabe will contribute up to a ten
percent (10 back-in working interest option for the Orogrande Project exercisable following the point in time at which the proceeds
of all production from all operations conducted on the Orogrande Project (exclusive of royalty, overriding royalty and taxes chargeable
to the working interest) equals the actual cost incurred by NBH and its predecessors in drilling, testing, equipping and the cost of
operating the wells located on the Orogrande Prospect, inclusive of overhead charges (the Back-In Interest ), an option
originally granted to Mr. McCabe pursuant to that certain Participation Agreement, dated September 23, 2014 (the Participation
Agreement ), by and among Mr. McCabe, Hudspeth, and MPC, and MPC will contribute up to one hundred percent (100 of the interest
currently held by MPC in the drilling project located on over 1,150 acres in Vermillion Parish, Louisiana (the Bronco Prospect ).
Pursuant to the McCabe Contribution Agreement, and subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions provided therein, including the
effectiveness of the Company s Registration Statement on Form S-1 (File No. 333-273442) filed with the SEC on July 26, 2023 (as
amended, the Registration Statement ), Mr. McCabe would contribute an amount of the Back-In Interest and MPC would contribute
an amount of the Bronco Prospect in proportion to the percentage of shares of common stock of NBH that were directly registered in the
name of the beneficial owner with the Company s transfer agent on or prior to the record date (as defined in the Registration Statement)
and remain directly registered with the Company s transfer agent for the holding period (as defined in the Registration Statement). The
Registration Statement, however, was ultimately withdrawn at the request of the SEC and the Company is presently evaluating other alternatives. 

During
the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we recorded an account payable to reimburse MPC of 97,027 to recognize payments made previously
by MPC to maintain the Bronco oil and natural gas leases. Since the transfer of the Bronco project has not occurred as of September 30,
2024, these costs are recorded as Prepayments - development costs. 

On
March 31, 2023, the Company entered into an amendment to the 2021 Note and an amendment to Loan Agreement in order to extend each of
the 2021 Note Maturity Date and the Maturity Date respectively from March 31, 2023, to October 3, 2023. Such amendments also removed
the provisions allowing for extensions of the 2021 Note Maturity Date and the Maturity Date in the event the Company raised 30 million
or more in capital through debt or equity or a combination thereof by March 31, 2023. 

Under
the terms of the Arrangement Agreement that governed the merger transaction between Torchlight and Meta in June 2021, the oil and natural
gas assets were to be sold or spun out from Meta and the costs of any sale or spin-off incurred by Meta were to be borne the then-existing
shareholders of Torchlight. The amount of the reimbursement payable to Meta in connection with the Spin-Off is 2.59 million which was
added to the principal amount of the Loan Agreement for a principal balance outstanding of 7.59 million as of March 31, 2023. Concurrently
with the amendment to the Loan Agreement, the Company made a prepayment of 1 million to reduce the principal balance to 6.59 million. 

On
August 7, 2023, Mr. McCabe and Meta entered into a Loan Sale Agreement whereby Mr. McCabe purchased from Meta (i) the 2021 Note and (ii)
all outstanding loans made to the Company by Meta pursuant to the Loan Agreement (the Loan Purchase ). As a result of the
Loan Purchase, Mr. McCabe replaced Meta as the lender and secured party under the 2021 Note and the Loan Agreement. Additionally, as
part of the Loan Purchase, Meta assigned to Mr. McCabe its lien on 25 of the Orogrande Prospect. The Company s obligations and
responsibilities under the 2021 Note and the Loan Agreement remain unchanged. 

The
combined balance on the 2021 Note and the Loan Agreement as of September 30, 2024, was 21.22 million. As of September 30, 2024, the
combined total accrued and unpaid interest under the 2021 Note and the Loan Agreement was 4.34 million.

Company having the option to extend the loan by one additional year. The loan will bear interest at the rate of 0 per annum and will
be payable in one balloon payment of principal and interest on the maturity date. If we elect to extend the loan for one year, the loan
will continue to bear interest at the rate of 0 per annum and will be payable in one balloon payment of principal and interest on the

ITEM 2.
MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 

The
following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our unaudited
consolidated financial statements and related notes that are included elsewhere in this report and the audited consolidated financial
statements and related notes included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. Some of the information
contained in this discussion and analysis constitutes forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Actual results
could differ materially from those discussed in these forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause or contribute to these differences
include, but are not limited to, those discussed below and elsewhere in this report, particularly under the section titled Cautionary
Statement Concerning Forward-Looking Statements. 

Executive
Summary 

We
were incorporated in Nevada on August 31, 2021, as OilCo Holdings, Inc. and changed our name to Next Bridge Hydrocarbons, Inc. pursuant
to our Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation filed on June 30, 2022. We are an energy company engaged in the acquisition, exploration,
exploitation and development of oil and natural gas properties in the United States. Our primary focus has been the development of interests
in an oil and natural gas project we hold in the Orogrande Basin in West Texas in Hudspeth County, Texas (the Orogrande Project ).
In addition, we have minor interests in the Eastern edge of the Midland Basin in Sterling, Tom Green and Irion Counties, Texas (the Hazel
Project ), two minor well interests located in Oklahoma (the Oklahoma Properties and undeveloped mineral lease interests
in Louisiana (the Wildcat Project ). 

We
operate our business through nine wholly owned subsidiaries: Torchlight Energy, Inc. (TEI), Hudspeth Oil Corporation, Torchlight Hazel,
LLC, Wolfbone Investments LLC, Hudspeth Operating LLC (Hudspeth), Wildcat Panther LLC, Wildcat Valentine LLC, Wildcat Cowboy LLC, and
Wildcat Packer LLC. 

The Orogrande Project is subject to a Development
Unit Agreement 2837 with University Lands (the DU Agreement which allows for all 192 existing leases covering approximately
134,000 gross acres leased from University Lands to be combined into one drilling and development unit for development purposes. The term
of the DU Agreement expires on December 31, 2024, and the time to drill on the drilling and development unit continues through December
31, 2024. The DU Agreement also grants the right to extend the DU Agreement through December 31, 2028 if we are in compliance with the
DU Agreement and the extension fee associated with the additional time is paid. As of September 30, 2024, we expected to exercise the
option to extend prior to the expiration of the DU Agreement. As of September 30, 2024, leases covering approximately 134,000 acres remain
in effect. Our drilling obligations under the DU Agreement include five wells for 2024. 

On
October 8, 2024, we announced that University Lands has decided not to extend our subsidiary s Development Unit Agreement for
the Orogrande asset, which expires on December 31, 2024. University Lands has also sought to terminate the Development Unit
Agreement effective immediately, which the Company has not agreed to do. 

Future
Plans and Direction 

In
September of 2024 the Company entered into negotiations with McCabe Petroleum Corporation MPC to acquire MPC s ownership in the
Louisiana Heritage Play LHP ), a collection of several drilling prospects located throughout the southern Louisiana on-shore Gulf Coast
region. These negotiations culminated in the signing of a Letter of Intent in October of 2024 to acquire MPC s net revenue interest
in the LHP. 

32 

This
acquisition is in addition to several others completed earlier in 2024 and late 2023, namely the Bronco, Valentine and Panther prospects,
and serves to further increase our footprint in the Gulf Coast region of onshore Louisiana. This area is home to multiple known high-grade
sand reservoirs and regarded as a richly productive exploratory-target environment. It is renowned for its abundant natural gas and oil
reserves and located in a state offering favorable regulatory framework and attractive economics. 

These
acquisitions continue our dynamic shift towards this geographic area with the strategic focus of expanding our goal of becoming a leading
independent oil and gas company that delivers high tech, high impact exploration opportunities. This is a path we intend to continue
down as we endeavor to both acquire additional prospects in the area and develop further exploratory opportunities within the LHP itself
from its extensive datasets. We are focusing on multi trillion cubic feet exploration opportunities within onshore South Louisiana, with
the intent to build and execute on a conventional exploration program, potentially one of the largest in the USA. 

Market
Conditions, Commodity Prices and Interest Rates 

U.S.
and global markets have experienced heightened volatility following impactful geopolitical events, consistent evidence of widespread
inflation, as well as increased fears of an economic recession. Recent measures have been taken by the U.S. Federal Reserve to combat
persistent inflation by increasing interest rates throughout 2023 and 2024. The global banking sector has experienced material disruptions
which has also contributed to market volatility. Further, the full-scale military invasion of Ukraine by Russian troops has continued
unabated since February 2022 coupled with related economic sanctions imposed on Russia further exacerbating supply shortages, leading
to disruptions in the credit and capital markets, including significant uncertainty in commodity prices, during 2022 and into 2024. Prices
for oil and natural gas are determined primarily by prevailing market conditions, which have been and could continue to be volatile. 

The
combination of geopolitical events, inflation and the rising rate environment has led to increasing forecasts of a U.S. or global recession.
Any such recession could prolong market volatility or cause a decline in commodity prices, among other potential impacts. 

We
cannot estimate the length or gravity of the future impact these events will have on our results of operations, financial position, liquidity
and the value of oil and natural gas reserves.

General
and Administrative Expenses 

Our
general and administrative expense for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024, was 1,670,375 compared with 9,028,536 for the
same period from the prior year. Our general and administrative expenses consisted of employee compensation expense, accounting and administrative
costs, legal and other professional consulting fees, and other general corporate expenses. The change in general and administrative expenses
in 2024, compared to 2023, is primarily due to decreased employee compensation and a decrease in consulting fees, filing fees, legal
fees, and expense recorded relative to the issuance of employee stock options. 

Our
general and administrative expense for the three-month period ended September 30, 2024, was 478,856 compared with 3,509,378 for the
same period from the prior year. Our general and administrative expenses consisted of employee compensation expense, accounting and administrative
costs, legal and other professional consulting fees, and other general corporate expenses. The change in general and administrative expenses
in 2024, compared to 2023, is primarily due to decreased employee compensation and a decrease in consulting fees, filing fees, legal
fees, and expense recorded relative to the issuance of employee stock options. 

Liquidity
and Capital Resources 

The
business of exploring for, developing and producing oil and natural gas is capital intensive. Because oil, natural gas and NGL reserves
are a depleting resource, like all upstream operators, we must make capital investments to grow and even sustain production. Our principal
liquidity requirements are to finance operations, fund capital expenditures and acquisitions and satisfy any indebtedness obligations.
Cash flows are subject to a number of variables, including the level of oil and natural gas production and prices, and the significant
capital expenditures required to more fully develop our oil and natural gas properties. Historically, our primary sources of capital
funding and liquidity have been from borrowings. At times and as needed, we may also issue debt or equity securities. We estimate the
combination of the sources of capital discussed above will continue to be adequate to meet our short and long-term liquidity needs but
there can be no assurances that any such sources will be available if needed. 

Cash
on hand and operating cash flow can be subject to fluctuations due to trends and uncertainties that are beyond our control. Our ability
to issue equity and obtain credit on favorable terms may be impacted by a variety of market factors as well as fluctuations in our results
of operations.

2021
Note and Loan Agreement 

On
August 7, 2023, Mr. McCabe and Meta entered into a Loan Sale Agreement whereby Mr. McCabe purchased from Meta (i) the 2021 Note and (ii)
all outstanding loans made to the Company by Meta pursuant to the Loan Agreement (the Loan Purchase ). As a result of the
Loan Purchase, Mr. McCabe replaced Meta as the lender and secured party under the 2021 Note and the Loan Agreement. Additionally, as
part of the Loan Purchase, Meta assigned to Mr. McCabe its lien on 25 of the Orogrande Prospect. The Company s obligations and
responsibilities under the 2021 Note and the Loan Agreement remain unchanged. 

On
October 1, 2023, we entered into an amendment to the 2021 Note and an amendment to the Loan Agreement with Mr. McCabe as successor in
interest to Meta extending the 2021 Note Maturity Date. An additional Amendment effective September 30, 2024 extended the maturity date
to December 31, 2024. 

The
2021 Note is fully drawn with a principal balance outstanding of 15 million, bears interest at 8 per annum, computed on the basis of
a 360-day year, and matures on January 3, 2024. If an event of default occurred and is continuing, interest on the 2021 Note may accrue
at the default rate of 12 per annum. Additionally, we have an aggregate principal balance of 6.59 million outstanding under the Loan
Agreement which bears interest at a fixed rate of 8 per annum if no event of default exists, and at a fixed rate of 12 per annum if
an event of default exists. 

The
combined balance on the 2021 Note and the Loan Agreement as of September 30, 2024, was 21.22 million. As of September 30, 2024, the
combined total accrued and unpaid interest under the 2021 Note and the Loan Agreement was 4.34 million. 

December
2022 Note 

On
December 22, 2022 we issued an unsecured promissory note in the principal amount of up to 20 million in favor of Mr. McCabe (the 2022
Note ), which bears interest at 5 per annum, computed on the basis of a 365-day year. As of September 30, 2024, the Company had
a balance of 21.28 million and accrued and unpaid interest of 1.58 million due under the 2022 Note. An Amendment effective September
30, 2024, extended the maturity date to December 31, 2024. 

As

Note, as detailed above, totaling 42.50 million, and additional borrowing and adjustment to the December 2022 note during the nine months
ended September 30, 2024, as detailed below: 

On
January 23, 2024, Mr. McCabe loaned 1,000,000 to us, which was evidenced under a 0 Senior Unsecured Promissory Note effective as of
that date (the McCabe Note ), which provided, among other things, that the loan will be due on February 28, 2025, with the
Company having the option to extend the loan by one additional year. The loan will bear interest at the rate of 0 per annum and will

will continue to bear interest at the rate of 0 per annum and will be payable in one balloon payment of principal and interest on the
extended maturity date. 

Additionally,
on March 28, 2024, 278,053 was added to the principal of the loan in lieu of reimbursing Mr. McCabe for lease rentals connected to the
Louisiana properties acquired on that date. Additional reimbursements due to Mr. McCabe of 1,750 were added to the balance of the Note
during the three months ended September 30, 2024. 

Imputed
interest has been recorded on the -0- note in the amount of 25,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024.

CAPCO
Note February 2024 

On
February 29, 2024, CAPCO Holding, Inc., a Texas corporation Capco ), loaned us 2,000,000 under a 12 Secured Promissory
Note (the Capco Note ), which provides, among other things, that the loan will be due in one year, with us having the option
to extend the loan by one additional year. The loan will bear interest at the rate of 12 per annum and will be payable in one balloon
payment of principal and interest on the maturity date. If we elect to extend the loan for one year, we must pay all accrued interest
for that first year, and thereafter, the loan will bear interest at a rate that is mutually agreeable to us and Capco, which rate will
not exceed 18 per annum, and will be payable in one balloon payment of principal and interest on the extended maturity date. As part
of the transaction, Gregory McCabe, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, entered into a Stock Pledge and Security Agreement with
Capco under which he pledged 250,000 of his shares of common stock of the Company to secure our obligations under the Capco Note. Further,
Mr. McCabe entered into a Subordination Agreement (the Subordination Agreement with Capco and us under which Mr. McCabe
agreed to subordinate all of the Company s indebtedness and obligations owed to Mr. McCabe to the Capco Note, under the terms and
conditions of the Subordination Agreement. Accrued and unpaid interest as of September 30, 2024 was 140,995. 

As
of September 30, 2024, we had 147,054 of liquidity, comprised of cash and cash equivalents on hand. Our short and long-term capital
requirements consist primarily of funding our development and drilling activities, payment of contractual obligations and debt service. 

At
September 30, 2024, we had working capital deficit of 49,994,659 and total assets of 1,222,182. Stockholders deficit was 49,802,224.
The negative working capital is principally due to notes payable which will be payable within one year. 

Management
believes that our currently available resources may not provide sufficient funds to enable us to meet our financing and drilling obligations
for the 2024 fiscal year. We anticipate that we will continue to incur operating losses and generate negative cash flows from operations
for the foreseeable future. As a result, we will need additional capital resources to fund our operations both in the short term and
in the long term, prior to achieving break even or positive operating cash flow. While we do not have any committed sources of capital,
we expect to continue to opportunistically seek access to additional funds through public or private equity offerings or debt financings,
through partnering or other strategic arrangements, including credit application arrangements with our third party servicers, or a combination
of the foregoing. Despite our efforts, we may face obstacles in continuing to attract new financing due to industry conditions and our
history and current record of net losses. We can provide no assurance that we will be able to obtain the financing required to meet our
stated objectives or even to continue as a going concern. 

We
do not expect to pay cash dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future.

ITEM 4.
CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 

Evaluation
of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

As
of September 30, 2024, we carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of our chief executive officer
and chief financial officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in
Rule 13a-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934). Based on this evaluation, our chief executive officer and chief financial
officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of September 30, 2024 to provide reasonable assurance
that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports filed or submitted by us under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is
recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms, and to provide reasonable
assurance that information required to be disclosed by us is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our chief executive
officer and chief financial officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. This determination is based
on the previously reported material weaknesses management previously identified in our internal control over financial reporting, as
disclosed in our last annual report on Form 10-K. We are in the process of remediating the material weaknesses in our internal control.
We believe the completion of these processes should remedy our disclosure controls and procedures. We will continue to monitor these
issues. 

It
should be noted that any system of controls, however well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, and not absolute, assurance
that the objectives of the system will be met. In addition, the design of any control system is based in part upon certain assumptions
about the likelihood of future events. Because of these and other inherent limitations of control systems, there is only the reasonable
assurance that our controls will succeed in achieving their goals under all potential future conditions. 

Changes
in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 

There
were no changes in our internal controls over financial reporting (as such term is defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Securities Exchange
Act of 1934) that occurred during the quarter ended September 30, 2024 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially
affect, our internal controls over financial reporting.

whether before or after the Closing Date, with respect to the accuracy or inaccuracy of or compliance with, any such representation,
warranty, covenant or agreement. The waiver of any condition based on the accuracy of any representation or warranty, or on the performance

addition to any other remedies that any indemnified party may have under Applicable Laws (whether asserted in a proceeding at law or

8.3 Indemnification
Procedures . 

(a) A
claim for indemnification for any matter not involving a third party claim may be asserted by notice to the Party from whom indemnification
is sought; provided that failure to so notify the indemnifying party shall not preclude the indemnified party from any indemnification
which such indemnified party may claim in accordance with this Article VIII . 

(b) If
any indemnified party receives notice of the assertion or commencement of any action made or brought by any Person who is not a party
to this Agreement or an Affiliate of a party to this Agreement or a representative of the foregoing (a Third Party Claim against such indemnified party with respect to which the indemnifying party is obligated to provide indemnification under this Agreement,
the indemnified party shall give the indemnifying party reasonably prompt written notice thereof, but in any event not later than 30
calendar days after receipt of such notice of such Third Party Claim. The failure to give such prompt written notice shall not, however,
relieve the indemnifying party of such indemnifying party s indemnification obligations, except and only to the extent that the
indemnifying party forfeits rights or defenses by reason of such failure. The indemnifying party shall have the right to participate
in, or by giving written notice to the indemnified party, to assume the defense of any Third Party Claim at the indemnifying party s
expense and by the indemnifying party s own counsel, and the indemnified party shall cooperate in good faith in such defense; provided,
that if the indemnifying party is the Contributor, such indemnifying party shall not have the right to defend or direct the defense of
any such Third Party Claim that seeks an injunction or other equitable relief against the indemnified party. In the event that the indemnifying
party assumes the defense of any Third Party Claim, subject to Section 8.3(c) , the indemnifying party shall have the right
to take such action as the indemnifying party deems necessary to avoid, dispute, defend, appeal or make counterclaims pertaining to any
such Third Party Claim in the name and on behalf of the indemnified party. The indemnified party shall have the right to participate
in the defense of any Third Party Claim with counsel selected by such indemnified party subject to the indemnifying party s right
to control the defense thereof. The fees and disbursements of such counsel shall be at the expense of the indemnified party, provided,
that if in the reasonable opinion of counsel to the indemnified party, (i) there are legal defenses available to an indemnified party
that are different from or additional to those available to the indemnifying party; or (ii) there exists a conflict of interest between
the indemnifying party and the indemnified party that cannot be waived, the indemnifying party shall be liable for the reasonable fees
and expenses of counsel to the indemnified party in each jurisdiction for which the indemnified party determines counsel is required.
If the indemnifying party elects not to compromise or defend such Third Party Claim, fails to promptly notify the indemnified party in
writing of such indemnified party s election to defend as provided in this Agreement, or fails to diligently prosecute the defense
of such Third Party Claim, the indemnified party may, subject to Section 8.3(c) , pay, compromise, defend such Third Party Claim
and seek indemnification for any and all Losses based upon, arising from or relating to such Third Party Claim. 

Contribution Agreement Page 19 of 53 

(c) Notwithstanding
any other provision of this Agreement, the indemnifying party shall not enter into settlement of any Third Party Claim without the prior
written consent of the indemnified party, except as provided in this Section 8.3(c) . If a firm offer is made to settle a
Third Party Claim without leading to liability or the creation of a financial or other obligation on the part of the indemnified party
and provides, in customary form, for the unconditional release of each indemnified party from all liabilities and obligations in connection
with such Third Party Claim and the indemnifying party desires to accept and agree to such offer, the indemnifying party shall give written
notice to that effect to the indemnified party. If the indemnified party fails to consent to such firm offer within ten (10) days after
such indemnified party s receipt of such notice, the indemnified party may continue to contest or defend such Third Party Claim
and in such event, the maximum liability of the indemnifying party as to such Third Party Claim shall not exceed the amount of such settlement
offer. If the indemnified party fails to consent to such firm offer and also fails to assume defense of such Third Party Claim, the indemnifying
party may settle the Third Party Claim upon the terms set forth in such firm offer to settle such Third Party Claim. If the indemnified
party has assumed the defense pursuant to Section 8.3(b) , the indemnified party shall not agree to any settlement without
the written consent of the indemnifying party (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed).

lands are included in this Agreement subject to the terms and conditions set forth below. 

Next
