During the third quarter of 2024, the Company determined it was more likely than not that the Company would be able to realize the benefit of the deferred tax assets in the United States, resulting in the release of the valuation allowance. In reaching this determination, the Company considered the growing trend of profitability over the last three years in the United States, as well as expectations regarding the generation of future taxable income.

 million, . The potential payment amount as expressed in U.S. dollars varies with the Philippine peso to U.S. dollar exchange rate. In December 2017, a group of 97 of the former employees of the Philippine subsidiary indicated that they proposed to record the judgment as to themselves in New Jersey. In January 2018, in response to an action initiated by Innodata Inc., the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey USDC entered a preliminary injunction that enjoins these former employees from pursuing or seeking recognition or enforcement of the judgment against Innodata Inc. in the United States during the pendency of the action and until further order of the USDC. In June 2018, the USDC entered a consent order administratively closing the action subject to return of the action to the active docket upon the written request of Innodata Inc. or the former employees, with the USDC retaining jurisdiction over the matter and the preliminary injunction remaining in full force and effect. On February 21, 2024, David D Agostino filed a putative class action captioned D Agostino v. Innodata Inc., et al., in the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey against the Company and certain of its current and former officers (the Securities Class Action ). On October 30, 2024 the presiding judge in the Securities Class Action appointed a lead plaintiff and approved the lead plaintiff s choice of counsel. The Securities Class Action complaint asserts claims under Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and Rule 10b-5 promulgated thereunder, and it alleges, among other things, that the defendants made false and misleading statements regarding the Company s artificial intelligence AI technology and services. The plaintiff seeks unspecified damages, fees, interest, and costs. The Company intends to defend itself vigorously, but the Company cannot predict the outcome of the action at this time and can give no assurance that the asserted claims will not have a material adverse effect on its financial position or results of operations. Subsequently, on March 25, 2024, the Company received a letter from the staff of the Securities and Exchange Commission, Division of Enforcement (the SEC ), requesting the Company preserve certain documents and data; on August 7, 2024 the Company received a grand jury subpoena from the U.S. Department of Justice DOJ requesting the Company to produce certain documents; and on September 23, 2024 the Company received a subpoena from the SEC requesting certain information. The Company believes that the SEC and DOJ requests are related to the conduct alleged in the Securities Class Action, and is cooperating with these investigations. The Company is unable to predict when these matters will be resolved or what further action, if any, the SEC or DOJ may take in connection with it. The Company is also subject to various other legal proceedings and claims that have arisen in the ordinary course of business. While management currently believes that the ultimate outcome of these proceedings will not have a material adverse effect on the Company s consolidated financial position or overall trends in consolidated results of operations, litigation is subject to inherent uncertainties. Substantial recovery against the Company in the above-referenced Philippine action could have a material adverse impact on the Company, and unfavorable rulings or recoveries in the other proceedings could have a material adverse impact on the consolidated operating results in the period in which the ruling or recovery occurs. In addition, the Company s estimate of the potential impact on the Company s consolidated financial position or overall consolidated results of operations for the above referenced legal proceedings could change in the future. The Company s legal accruals related to legal proceedings and claims are based on the Company s determination of whether or not a loss is probable. The Company reviews outstanding proceedings and claims with external counsel to assess probability and estimates of loss. The accruals are adjusted if necessary. While the Company intends to defend these matters vigorously, adverse outcomes that it estimates could reach approximately in the aggregate beyond recorded amounts are reasonably possible. If circumstances change, the Company may be required to record adjustments that could be material to its reported consolidated financial condition and results of operations.

 Business Overview Innodata Inc. (Nasdaq: INOD) (including its subsidiaries, the Company, Innodata, we, us or our is a global data engineering company. We believe that data and Artificial Intelligence AI are inextricably linked. Our mission is to help the world s leading technology companies and enterprises drive Generative AI / AI innovation, which we believe will contribute to a safer and more prosperous world. Innodata was founded on a simple idea: engineer the highest quality data so organizations across broad industry segments could make smarter decisions. Today, we believe we are delivering the highest quality data for some of the world s most innovative technology companies to use to train the AI models of the future. AI holds the promise that computers can perceive and understand the world, enabling products and services that would have been previously unimaginable and impossible with traditional coding. AI learns from data, and the highest-performing AI will have learned from the highest-quality data. We believe that we can contribute meaningfully by harnessing our capabilities, honed over 35+ years, in collecting and annotating data at scale with consistency and high accuracy. We are also helping companies deploy and integrate AI into their operations and products and providing innovative AI-enabled industry platforms, helping ensure that our customers businesses are prepared for a world in which machines augment human activity in ways previously unimaginable. We developed our capabilities and honed our approaches progressively over the last 35+ years creating high-quality data for many of the world s most demanding information companies. Approximately eight years ago, we formed Innodata Labs, a research and development center, to research, develop and apply machine learning and emerging AI to our large-scale, human-intensive data operations. In 2019, we began packaging the capabilities that emerged from our R D efforts in order to align with several fast-growing new markets and help companies use AI and machine learning ML to drive performance benefits and business insights. Our historical core competency in high-quality data, combined with these R D efforts in applied AI, created the foundation for the evolution of our offerings, which include AI Data Preparation, AI Model Deployment and Integration, and AI-Enabled Industry Platforms. AI Data Preparation For several of the world s large technology companies, we support their efforts at building generative AI foundation models. For these companies, we provide or are poised to provide a range of scaled data solutions and services. Our scaled data solutions include providing instruction data sets for fine-tuning large language models LLMs to understand prompts, to accept instruction, to converse, to apparently reason, and to perform the myriad of incredible feats that many of us have now experienced. We also provide reinforcement learning and reward modeling, services which are critical to provide the guardrails against toxic, bias and harmful responses, and model evaluation services. For social media companies, robotics companies, financial services companies, and many others, we collect or create training data, annotate training data, and train AI algorithms for working with images, text, video, audio, code and sensor data. We utilize a variety of leading third-party tools, proprietary tools and customer tools. For text annotation, we use our proprietary data annotation platform that incorporates AI to reduce costs while improving consistency and quality of output. Our proprietary data annotation platform features auto-tagging capabilities that apply to both classical and generative AI tasks. The platform encapsulates many of the innovations we conceived of in the course of its 35+ year history of creating high-quality data. In addition, because collecting real-world data is often impracticable (due to data privacy regulations or the rarity of cohorts and outliers), we create high-quality synthetic data that maintains all of the statistical properties of real-world data, using a combination of domain specialists and machine technologies that leverage LLMs.

 AI Model Deployment and Integration We help businesses leverage the latest AI technologies to achieve their goals. We develop custom AI models (where we select the appropriate algorithms, tune hyperparameters, train and validate the models, and update the models as required). We also help businesses fine-tune their own custom versions of our proprietary models and third-party foundation models to address domain-specific and customer-specific use cases. For our customers that provide products and solutions that require intensive text data processing and analytics, in addition to deploying and integrating AI models, we often provide a range of data engineering support services including data transformation, data curation, data hygiene, data consolidation, data extraction, data compliance, and master data management. Our customers span a diverse range of industries and a wide range of AI use cases, benefiting from the short time-to-value and high economic returns of our AI solutions and platforms. AI-Enabled Industry Platforms Our AI-enabled industry platforms address specific, niche market requirements we believe we can innovate with AI/ML technologies. We deploy these industry platforms as software-as-a-service SaaS and as managed services. These platforms benefit from our technology infrastructure, our industry-specific knowledge, our strong customer relationships and experience merging technology with the business processes of our customers. To date, we have built an industry platform for medical records data extraction and transformation (which we brand as Synodex and an industry platform for public relations (which we brand as Agility PR Solutions ). We are in the development with an additional AI-enabled industry platform to serve financial services institutions. Our Synodex industry platform transforms medical records into useable digital data organized in accordance with our proprietary data models or customer data models. Our Agility industry platform provides marketing communications and public relations professionals with the ability to target and distribute content to journalists and social media influencers world-wide and to monitor and analyze global news (print, web, radio and TV) and social media. Our operations are presently classified and reported in three reporting segments: Digital Data Solutions (DDS), Synodex and Agility. Prevailing Economic Conditions and Seasonality Prevailing Economic Conditions With the current level of demand for our services, we believe we have existing cash and cash equivalents that provide sufficient sources of liquidity to satisfy our financial needs for at least the next 12 months from the date of the filing of this Report (refer to Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Liquidity and Capital Resources for additional information). In the event we experience a significant or prolonged reduction in revenues, the likelihood of which is uncertain, we would seek to manage our liquidity by utilizing the Revolving Credit Facility, reducing capital expenditures, deferring investment activities, and reducing operating costs. Seasonality Our quarterly operating results are subject to certain fluctuations. We experience fluctuations in our revenue and earnings as we replace and begin new projects, which may have some normal start-up delays, or we may be unable to replace a project entirely. These and other factors may contribute to fluctuations in our operating results from quarter to quarter. In addition, as some of our Asian facilities are closed during holidays in the fourth quarter, we typically incur higher wages, due to overtime, that reduce our margins. Our Synodex subsidiary experiences seasonal fluctuations in revenues. Typically, revenue is lowest in the third quarter of the calendar year and highest in the fourth quarter of the calendar year. The seasonality is directly linked to the number of life insurance applications received by the insurance companies.

 For further information, refer to the risk factor titled Quarterly fluctuations in our revenues and results of operations could make financial forecasting difficult and could negatively affect our stock price. in Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. Non-GAAP Financial Measures In addition to the financial information prepared in conformity with U.S. GAAP GAAP ), we provide certain non-GAAP financial information. We believe that these non-GAAP financial measures assist investors in making comparisons of period-to-period operating results. In some respects, management believes non-GAAP financial measures are more indicative of our ongoing core operating performance than their GAAP equivalents by making adjustments that management believes are reflective of the ongoing performance of the business. We believe that the presentation of this non-GAAP financial information provides investors with greater transparency by providing investors a more complete understanding of our financial performance, competitive position, and prospects for the future, particularly by providing the same information that management and our Board of Directors use to evaluate our performance and manage the business. However, the non-GAAP financial measures presented in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q have certain limitations in that they do not reflect all of the costs associated with the operations of our business as determined in accordance with GAAP. Therefore, investors should consider non-GAAP financial measures in addition to, and not as a substitute for, or as superior to, measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. Further, the non-GAAP financial measures that we present may differ from similar non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies. Adjusted Gross Profit and Adjusted Gross Margin We define Adjusted Gross Profit as revenues less direct operating costs attributable to Innodata Inc. and its subsidiaries in accordance with U.S. GAAP, plus depreciation and amortization of intangible assets, stock-based compensation, non-recurring severance and other one-time costs included within direct operating cost. We define Adjusted Gross Margin by dividing Adjusted Gross Profit over total U.S. GAAP revenues. We use Adjusted Gross Profit and Adjusted Gross Margin to evaluate results of operations and trends between fiscal periods and believe that these measures are important components of our internal performance measurement process. The following table contains a reconciliation of Gross Profit and Gross Margin in accordance with the U.S. GAAP attributable to Innodata Inc. and its subsidiaries to Adjusted Gross Profit and Adjusted Gross Margin for the three and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 (in thousands).

 Results of Operations The amounts in the MD A below have been rounded. All percentages have been calculated using rounded amounts. Three Months Ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 Revenues Total revenues were 52.2 million and 22.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, an increase of 30.0 million or approximately 136 . Revenues from the DDS segment were 44.7 million and 16.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, an increase of 28.6 million or approximately 178 . The increase was primarily attributable to higher volume from an existing customer. Revenues from the Synodex segment were 1.9 million and 1.7 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, an increase of 0.2 million or 12 . The increase was primarily attributable to higher volume from existing customers. Revenues from the Agility segment were 5.6 million and 4.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, an increase of 1.2 million or approximately 27 . The increase was principally attributable to higher volumes from subscriptions to our Agility AI-enabled industry platform. One customer in the DDS segment generated approximately 59 and 11 of the Company s total revenues for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. No other customer accounted for 10 or more of total revenues during these periods. Further, revenues from non-U.S. customers accounted for 17 and 40 of the Company s total revenues for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Direct Operating Costs Direct operating costs consist of direct and indirect labor costs, occupancy costs, data center hosting fees, cloud services, content acquisition costs, depreciation and amortization, travel, telecommunications, computer services and supplies, realized (gain) loss on forward contracts, foreign currency revaluation (gain) loss, and other direct expenses that are incurred in providing services to our customers. Direct operating costs were 30.9 million and 13.9 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, an increase of 17.0 million or 122 . The cost increase was primarily due to increased headcount to support higher volumes from an existing customer. The increase in direct operating costs includes 15.6 million from direct and indirect labor related costs primarily on account of new hires and higher incentives; an unfavorable impact of foreign exchange rate fluctuations of 0.6 million, higher depreciation and amortization of capitalized developed software of 0.3 million; higher AWS and other cloud subscriptions of 0.3 million; and higher content costs of 0.2 million. Direct operating costs as a percentage of total revenues were 59 and 63 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The decrease in direct operating cost as a percentage of total revenues was primarily due to higher revenues in all segments and lower direct operating costs in the Synodex segment; offset in part by higher direct operating costs in the DDS and Agility segments. Direct operating costs for the DDS segment were 27.0 million and 10.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, an increase of 16.8 million or 165 . The cost increase was primarily due to increased headcount to support higher volumes from an existing customer. The increase in direct operating costs includes 15.7 million from direct and indirect labor related costs primarily on account of new hires and higher incentives; an unfavorable impact of foreign exchange rate fluctuations of 0.6 million; higher depreciation and amortization of capitalized developed software of 0.3 million; and higher AWS and other cloud subscriptions of 0.2 million. Direct operating costs for the DDS segment as a percentage of DDS segment revenues were 60 and 63 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The decrease in direct operating costs of the DDS segment as a percentage of DDS segment revenues was primarily attributable to higher revenues, offset in part by higher direct operating costs.

The Revolving Credit Facility s borrowing base is calculated on the basis of (i) 85 of eligible accounts (other than eligible foreign accounts and unbilled accounts), plus (ii) the lesser of (a) 80 of eligible accounts that are unbilled accounts and (b) 30 of all eligible accounts, plus (iii) the lesser of (a) 85 of eligible foreign accounts, (b) 20 of all eligible accounts and (c) 4.0 million, minus (iv) certain other reserves and adjustments. As of September 30, 2024, such borrowing base calculation equaled approximately 17.9 million. The Credit Agreement contains a financial covenant that requires the Borrowers, on a consolidated basis, to maintain a fixed charge coverage ratio of not less than 1.10 to 1.00. Except as set forth in the Credit Agreement, borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility bear interest at a rate equal to the daily simple secured overnight financing rate SOFR plus 2.25 . We did not utilize the Revolving Credit Facility during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 or during the subsequent period through the filing date of this Report. On August 8, 2024, we filed a Registration Statement on Form S-3 (Registration No. 333-281379) (the Form S-3 with the SEC. The Form S-3, which includes a base prospectus, allows us to offer and sell, from time to time, in one or more offerings, common stock, preferred stock, debt securities, warrants or units up to an aggregate public offering price of 50.0 million. On September 16, 2024 we filed Amendment No.1 to the Form S-3. The Form S-3 was declared effective by the SEC on October 10, 2024. The Form S-3 is intended to preserve our flexibility to raise capital from time to time, if and when needed. Cash Flows Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities Cash provided by our operating activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 17.7 million resulting from net income of 18.4 million, adjusted for non-cash expenses of 1.9 million and a decrease in working capital of 2.6 million. Refer to the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows for further details. Cash provided by our operating activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 was 5.8 million resulting from our net loss of 2.5 million, adjusted for non-cash expenses of 7.1 million and an increase in working capital of 1.2 million. Refer to the condensed consolidated statements of cash flows for further details. Net Cash Used in Investing Activities For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, cash used in our investing activities was 5.5 million and 3.8 million, respectively. These capital expenditures were principally for the purchase of technology equipment including servers, network infrastructure and workstations, and expenditures for capitalized developed software. Capital expenditures for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 amounting to 5.5 million consisted of 3.2 million for the DDS segment, 1.5 million for the Agility segment and 0.8 million for the Synodex segment. During the next 12 months, it is anticipated that capital expenditures for capitalized developed software and ongoing technology, equipment and infrastructure upgrades will approximate to 6.0 million, a portion of which we may finance. Net Cash Provided by Financing Activities Cash provided by financing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 was 0.2 million primarily from proceeds of stock option exercises of 0.8 million, offset in part by payment of long-term obligations of 0.5 million and withholding taxes on net settlement of restricted stock awards of 0.1 million. Cash provided by financing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 was 2.8 million primarily from proceeds of stock option exercises of 3.1 million, offset in part by payment of long-term obligations of 0.3 million.

 Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Our discussion and analysis of our results of operations, liquidity and capital resources is based on our condensed consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in conformity with U.S. GAAP. The preparation of the condensed consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates and judgments, including those related to revenue recognition, allowance for credit losses and billing adjustments, long-lived assets, intangible assets, goodwill, valuation of deferred tax assets, value of securities underlying stock-based compensation, litigation accruals, pension benefits, valuation of derivative instruments and estimated accruals for various tax exposures. We base our estimates on historical and anticipated results and trends and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, including assumptions as to future events. These estimates form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. By their nature, estimates are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty. Actual results may differ from our estimates and could have a significant adverse effect on our condensed consolidated results of operations and financial position. The significant accounting policies used in preparing our condensed consolidated financial statements contained in this Report are the same as those described in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K, unless otherwise noted, and we believe those critical accounting policies affect our more significant estimates and judgments in the preparation of our condensed consolidated financial statements. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements None. Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk Not applicable for smaller reporting companies. Item 4. Controls and Procedures We maintain disclosure controls and procedures (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (Exchange Act), that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Under the supervision, and with the participation of our management, including our principal executive officer and our principal financial officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures, as defined under Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(e), as of September 30, 2024. Based on this evaluation, our principal executive officer and our principal financial officer concluded that, as of September 30, 2024, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective. There have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(f) or 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
