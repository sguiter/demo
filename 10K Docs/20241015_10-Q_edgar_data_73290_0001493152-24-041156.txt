 NOTES
TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED) 

million
as of August 31, 2024. As of August 31, 2024, the Company had cash and cash equivalents of approximately and working capital
of approximately . 

On
July 21, 2020, the Company filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission SEC a Form S-3 shelf registration statement
and base prospectus which was declared effective by the SEC on September 30, 2020. The 2020 Shelf Registration Statement registered common
shares that could be issued by the Company in a maximum aggregate amount of up to . 

On
January 22, 2021, the Company filed a prospectus supplement to the base prospectus included in a registration statement filed with the
SEC on July 21, 2020, and declared effective by the SEC on September 30, 2020, for purposes of selling up to in at-the-market 
offerings, as defined in Rule 415 promulgated under the Securities Act (the 2021 ATM Offering ). 

During
the year ended May 31, 2023, the Company sold 
shares of its common stock at prices ranging from 
to 
pursuant to the 2021 ATM Offering, which resulted in gross proceeds of approximately 
and net proceeds to the Company of ,
after deducting commissions for each sale and legal, accounting, and other fees related to offering in the amount of . 

On March 7, 2023,
the Company sold shares of common stock in a firm commitment public offering at a gross sales price of per share, with
net total proceeds, after deducting issuance fees and expenses of , of approximately . As a result of this public offering,
the Company terminated the 2021 ATM Offering. 

As
part of our financing plan, on September 28, 2023, we filed a shelf registration statement on Form S-3 with the SEC,
which was declared effective on September 29, 2023, allowing the Company to issue up to in
common shares. Under this registration statement, shares of our common stock may be sold from time to time for up to three years
from the filing date. On May 10, 2024, the Company filed a prospectus supplement with the SEC to facilitate the sale
of up to 
in common stock through ATM offerings, as defined in Rule 415 under the Securities Act. As part of this transaction, the Company
incurred 
in deferred offering costs. The amount of capital that we can raise under the ATM offering is highly dependent upon the trading
volume and the trading price of our stock. The average trading volume of our stock over the last three full calendar months is 
shares per day and the high and low trading price of our stock during the same period of time was 
and , respectively. If our stock
continues to trade at low volumes and price, the amount of capital that we can raise under the ATM offering will be
constrained. 

The
Company intends to use the net proceeds from this offering for general corporate purposes, including, but not limited to, sales and marketing
activities, clinical studies and product development, acquisitions of assets, businesses, companies, or securities, capital expenditures,
and working capital needs. 

Management assesses whether the Company has sufficient liquidity to fund its costs for the next twelve months from
each financial statement issuance date to determine if there is a substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a
going concern. The
Company s ability to continue as a going concern over the next twelve months is influenced by several factors, including: 

Our
 need and ability to generate additional revenue from international opportunities and our new product launches; 

Our
 need to access the capital and debt markets to meet current obligations and fund operations; 

Our
 capacity to manage operating expenses and maintain gross margins as we grow; and 

Our
 ability to retain key employees and maintain critical operations with a substantially reduced workforce. 

Management
has analyzed the Company s cash flow requirements through November 2025 and beyond. Based on this analysis, we believe our current
cash and cash equivalents are insufficient to meet our operating cash requirements and strategic growth objectives for the next twelve
months. 

To
address our capital needs and sustain operations beyond the next year, we are actively pursuing strategies to increase sales, reduce
expenses, sell non-core assets, seek additional financing through debt or equity, and seek other strategic alternatives. While we are
committed to these plans, there is no assurance that these efforts will be successful or sufficient to meet our capital requirements. 

As part of our efforts to reduce costs, we have initiated significant cost-cutting measures to extend our cash runway
and work towards increasing revenues to cover overhead costs. These measures include a workforce reduction of nearly 15 in July 2024
and a substantial reduction in other operating expenses. 

These
factors raise substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. Our future viability depends on the
successful execution of our strategic plans, securing additional financing, and achieving profitable operations. 

The
Company s consolidated financial statements as of August 31, 2024 were prepared on a going concern basis, which contemplates the
realization of assets and the settlement of liabilities and commitments in the normal course of business. 

for the three months ended August 31, 2024, compared to 
for the same period in 2023. For the three months ended August 31, 2024, the Company had two key customers located in North America
and Asia, respectively, who collectively accounted for 
of net sales. For the three months ended August 31, 2023, the Company had one key customer located in a Asia, accounting
for 
of net sales. 

As
of August 31, 2024, and May 31, 2024, total gross receivables were approximately and , respectively. On these dates,
the Company had two and four key customers, respectively, located in Asia and Europe. These customers accounted for
 and of the gross accounts receivable, respectively. 

For the three months ended August 31, 2024, and 2023, two and one key vendors
accounted for 
and 
of the purchases of raw materials, respectively. As of August 31, 2024, and May 31, 2024, one and two key vendors represented 
and 
of the Company s accounts payable, respectively. 

old were usually reserved unless collection was reasonably assured. Under the application of ASC 326, the Company s historical
credit loss experience provides the basis for the estimation of expected credit losses, as well as current economic and business conditions,
and anticipated future economic events that may impact collectability. In developing its expected credit loss estimate, the Company evaluated
the appropriate grouping of financial assets based upon its evaluation of risk characteristics, including consideration of the types
of products and services sold. Account balances are written off against the allowance for expected credit losses after all means of collection
have been exhausted and the potential for recovery is considered remote. 

Occasionally,
certain long-standing customers who routinely place large orders will have unusually large receivable balances relative to the total
gross receivables. Management monitors the payments for these large balances closely and very often requires payment of existing invoices
before shipping new sales orders. 

As
of August 31, 2024 and May 31, 2024, the Company has established a reserve of approximately and respectively, for credit
losses.

rights, years for purchased technology use rights, and patents are based on their individual useful lives which average around 
years. Amortization expense was approximately and for the three months ended August 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. 

The
Company assesses the recoverability of these intangible assets by determining whether the amortization of the asset s balance over
its remaining life can be recovered through projected undiscounted future cash flows. The Company uses a qualitative assessment to determine
whether there is any impairment. During the three months ended August 31, 2024, and 2023, there were impairment adjustments.

Holdings are accounted for at the Company s initial cost, minus any impairment (if any), plus or minus changes resulting

received are recorded as other income. 

The
Company assesses its equity holdings for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an
equity holding may not be recoverable. Management reviewed the underlying net assets of the Company s equity method holding as
of August 31, 2024 and determined that the Company s proportionate economic interest in the entity indicates that the equity holding
was not impaired. There were no observable price changes in orderly transactions for identical or a similar holding or security of the

, consisting of state minimum and foreign
miscellaneous taxes. During the three months ended August 31, 2024, the Company had a net operating loss NOL that generated
deferred tax assets for NOL carryforwards. Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are recognized for temporary differences between
the financial statements and income tax carrying values using tax rates in effect for the years such differences are expected to reverse.
Due to uncertainties surrounding our ability to generate future taxable income and consequently realize such deferred income tax assets,
the Company has determined that it is more likely than not that these deferred tax assets will not be realized. Accordingly, the
Company has established a full valuation allowance against its deferred tax assets as of August 31, 2024. 

The
Company s policy is to recognize any interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as a component of income tax expense.
For the three months ended August 31, 2024, the Company had no accrued interest or penalties related to uncertain tax positions.

In
addition, the Company leases a small office in Lindau, Germany on a month-to-month basis, as headquarters for BioEurope GmbH, its Germany

For
purposes of determining straight-line rent expense, the lease term is calculated from the date the Company first takes possession of
the facility, including any periods of free rent and any renewal options periods that the Company is reasonably certain of exercising.
The Company s office and equipment leases generally have contractually specified minimum rent and annual rent increases are included
in the measurement of the right-of-use asset and related lease liabilities. Additionally, under these lease arrangements, the Company
may be required to pay directly, or reimburse the lessors, for some maintenance and operating costs. Such amounts are generally variable
and therefore not included in the measurement of the right-of-use asset and related lease liabilities but are instead recognized as variable

ITEM
2. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 

You
should read the following discussion and analysis in conjunction with our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements and
the accompanying notes thereto included in Part I, Item 1 of this Report and the audited consolidated financial statements in our
Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended May 31, 2024 (our 2024 Annual Report). This discussion and analysis contains
forward-looking statements that are based on our management s current beliefs and assumptions, which statements are subject to
substantial risks and uncertainties. Our actual results of operations may differ materially from those expressed or implied by these
forward-looking statements as a result of many factors, including those discussed in Risk Factors included in Part I,
Item 1A of our 2024 Annual Report. 

OVERVIEW 

We
are a global biomedical technology company that develops, patents, manufactures and markets advanced diagnostic and therapeutic
products. Our diagnostic test kits are used to analyze blood, urine, nasal or fecal material from patients in the diagnosis of
various diseases, food intolerances and other medical complications . They can also be used to measure or detect the presence and
levels of specific bacteria, hormones, antibodies, antigens and other substances, which may exist in the human body in extremely
small concentrations. Our products are designed to enhance the health and well-being of people, while reducing total
healthcare costs. 

Our
extensive range of medical diagnostic products is sold worldwide, primarily in two markets: clinical laboratories and point-of-care
settings, including physicians offices and over-the-counter sales at major retailers such as Walmart, CVS Pharmacy, and
Amazon. Most of our products are Conformite Europeenne CE marked and/or registered with regulatory agencies in
various countries for diagnostic use, with several also cleared by the FDA for sale in the United States. 

Technological
advances in medical diagnostics have enabled diagnostic tests to be performed not only in clinical laboratories but also at home and
at the point-of-care in physicians offices. One of our key objectives has been to develop and market rapid diagnostic tests that
are accurate, utilize easily obtained patient specimens, and are simple to perform without the need for complex instrumentation. Our
home use (over-the-counter) and professional use (physicians office, clinics, etc.) rapid diagnostic test products help manage
existing medical conditions and may save lives through early detection and diagnosis of specific diseases. Traditionally, such tests
required the expertise of medical technologists and sophisticated equipment, with results often not available for days. We believe our
rapid point-of-care tests, when properly used, can be as accurate as laboratory tests. Our products require limited to no instrumentation,
deliver reliable results in minutes, and can be performed with confidence at home or in a physician s office. 

We
invest resources in the research and development of new products designed to diagnose and, in some cases, treat several
major medical diseases. These products are either internally developed or licensed from others. Our experienced and highly trained
technical personnel, including Ph.D. holders and other scientists, are dedicated to developing new products and managing technology transfer
activities. Our technical staff, many of whom have extensive experience from previous employment at large diagnostic manufacturing companies,
bring a wealth of industry knowledge. Additionally, we rely on our Scientific Advisory Board, comprised of leading medical doctors and
clinicians, to guide our clinical studies and product development efforts. 

A
key outcome from our recent research and development efforts is our patented diagnostic-guided therapy DGT product, developed
on the inFoods technology platform. This innovative product is designed to treat gastrointestinal conditions such as irritable bowel
syndrome IBS and other inflammatory diseases. The DGT product targets chronic inflammatory illnesses that are widespread and prevalent
in large markets. We have launched the inFoods IBS product, which leverages this patented technology. 

The
inFoods IBS product utilizes a simple blood test to identify patient-specific foods that, when eliminated from the diet, may alleviate
IBS symptoms such as pain, bloating, diarrhea, cramping, and constipation. Unlike broad and difficult-to-manage dietary restrictions,
the inFoods IBS product pinpoints a patient s heightened immunoreactivity to specific foods known to frequently trigger IBS
symptoms. By removing the foods identified as problematic, patients can achieve relief from their IBS symptoms. 

13 

We launched our inFoods product across numerous gastroenterology GI physician groups in various states and regions,
including collaboration with one of the largest GI groups in the U.S. Feedback from GI specialty physicians have generally been positive,
and we are actively expanding our network by onboarding additional physician practices. These GI practices are beginning to prescribe
inFoods IBS to their patients. Our dedicated sales team is deepening relationships within the GI segment and strategically targeting
opportunities to introduce inFoods to other medical specialties. By leveraging their expertise and building strong partnerships,
our sales team is now working to engage with key physician groups outside the GI field such as integrated health practices and primary-care
general practitioners. These efforts aim to broaden our market reach and enhance the overall adoption of inFoods across various
healthcare sectors and to capitalize on the distinct advantages of inFoods for a strong foundation of meaningful growth in the future.
We are also continuing to evaluate distribution, partnership and licensing opportunities with U.S. and multinational companies, which
have the potential to significantly aid in the commercialization and accelerated growth of inFoods products both domestically and
internationally. 

Beyond
the inFoods product line, the Company has achieved a significant milestone with the development of hp+detect , a diagnostic
test designed to detect Helicobacter pylori H. pylori bacteria in the gastrointestinal tract. H. pylori is a prevalent
infection, affecting approximately 35 of the U.S. population and 45 of the population in Europe s largest countries. This bacterium
is the strongest known risk factor for gastric cancer, which remains one of the leading causes of cancer-related deaths worldwide. 

The
hp+detect test offers physicians and medical centers a reliable tool for diagnosing H. pylori infections and monitoring treatment
efficacy. The test is marketed directly to laboratories, where patient samples are processed to provide timely and accurate diagnoses.
To support the widespread adoption and distribution of hp+detect , the Company is actively engaging with large reference laboratories,
aiming to improve patient outcomes through early detection and effective treatment of H. pylori infections. 

Due to the slower-than-expected launch of the Company s key products, inFoods IBS and hp+detect ,
the Company has initiated significant cost-cutting measures to extend its cash runway and work towards increasing revenues to cover overhead
costs. These measures include a workforce reduction of nearly 15 during this fiscal quarter, which incurred one-time labor costs such
as severance, impacting typical cost trends and margins. In addition, the Company is actively exploring strategic opportunities to enhance
and create shareholder value.

For the three months ended August 31, 2024, consolidated net sales reached approximately 1,807,000, compared to
 1,713,000 for the same period in 2023, representing an increase of 94,000, or 5 . This growth was largely driven by a 222,000 increase
in higher demand from new and existing customers as well as new contract manufacturing agreements.
However, over-the-counter OTC sales in the retail market declined by 116,000. In 2023, OTC sales benefited from the rollout
of our products with CVS, which included large upfront orders. Additionally, this quarter s performance was impacted by timing delays
in clinical lab orders from our distributor in Asia. 

For
the three months ended August 31, 2024, consolidated cost of sales amounted to approximately 1,518,000, or 84 of net sales,
compared to 1,301,000, or 76 of net sales, for the same period in 2023, representing an increase of 217,000, or 17 . A key driver
of the cost increase was directly correlated to the growth in contract manufacturing sales. Additionally, direct labor costs were
significantly impacted by one-time severance expenses related to the reduction in force RIF executed in July, which
elevated labor costs and negatively impacted gross margins. Gross margin was negatively impacted by 12 by the one-time RIF expenses
within the fiscal quarter. Excluding these RIF-related costs, gross margins are consistent with the prior period.

Selling,
General and Administrative Expenses 

For the three months ended August 31, 2024, consolidated selling, general, and administrative expenses were approximately
 1,360,000, compared to 1,172,000 for the same period in 2023, reflecting an increase of 188,000, or 16 . This increase was primarily
driven by one-time severance expenses related to the July RIF and introduction of a sales force, which did not exist in the prior year. The new sales team added
 146,000 in additional costs compared to the prior period. Legal expenses also rose by 64,000, as the prior year benefited
from a one-time discount on legal fees related to settlement work. Excluding this discount, legal spending would have been consistent
with historical levels. 

Research
and Development 

For the three months ended August 31, 2024, consolidated research and development R D expenses
totaled approximately 297,000, representing a decrease of 37 from 472,000 in the same period of 2023. This 175,000 reduction was primarily
driven by an 86,000 decline in R D wages resulting from the one-time severance expenses associated with the RIF executed in July.
In line with the Company s strategic initiatives for cost-cutting measures, several clinical trials were reduced, resulting in decreased
expenditures. Additionally, with the commercialization of inFoods IBS, there has been a deliberate reduction in R D allocations
to this area, contributing to an overall decrease of 80,000 in related expenses. 

Interest
and Dividend Income 

For
the three months ended August 31, 2024, interest and dividend income totaled approximately 56,000, compared to 123,000 for the
corresponding period in 2023, representing a decrease of 67,000, or 54 . This reduction was primarily attributable to lower market
interest rates affecting our lower cash balances, which had decreased by August 31, 2024.

LIQUIDITY,
CAPITAL RESOURCES AND GOING CONCERN 

The
following are the principal sources of liquidity:

 May

 Cash
 and cash equivalents 
 2,820,000 
 4,170,000 
 
 Working
 capital including cash and cash equivalents 
 4,294,000 
 5,527,000 

As
of August 31, 2024 and May 31, 2024, the Company had cash and cash equivalents of approximately 2,820,000 and 4,170,000, respectively.
As of August 31, 2024 and May 31, 2024, the Company had working capital of approximately 4,294,000 and 5,527,000, respectively. 

The
Company s ability to continue as a going concern over the next twelve months is influenced by several factors, including: 

Our
 need and ability to generate additional revenue from international opportunities and our new product launches; 

Our
 need to access the capital and debt markets to meet current obligations and fund operations; 

Our
 capacity to manage operating expenses and maintain gross margins as we grow; and 

Our
 ability to retain key employees and maintain critical operations with a substantially reduced workforce. 

Management
has analyzed the Company s cash flow requirements through November 2025 and beyond. Based on this analysis, we believe our current
cash and cash equivalents are insufficient to meet our operating cash requirements and strategic growth objectives for the next twelve
months. 

To address our capital needs and sustain operations beyond the next year, we are actively pursuing strategies to
increase sales, reduce expenses, sell non-core assets, seek additional financing through debt or equity, and seek other strategic alternatives.
While we are committed to these plans, there is no assurance that these efforts will be successful or sufficient to meet our capital requirements. 

As
part of our efforts to reduce costs, we have initiated significant cost-cutting measures to extend our cash runway and work towards increasing
revenues to cover overhead costs. These measures include a workforce reduction of nearly 15 in July 2024 and a substantial reduction
in other operating expenses. 

As
part of our financing plan, on September 28, 2023, we filed a shelf registration statement on Form S-3 with the
Securities and Exchange Commission SEC ), which was declared effective on September 29, 2023, allowing us to
issue up to 20,000,000 in common shares. Under this registration statement, shares of our common stock may be sold from time to
time for up to three years from the filing date. On May 10, 2024, the we filed a prospectus supplement with the SEC to facilitate the sale of up to 5,500,000 in common stock through at-the-market ATM offerings, as defined in Rule 415 under the
Securities Act. As part of this transaction, we incurred 81,000 in deferred offering costs. The amount of capital that we
can raise under the ATM offering is highly dependent upon the trading volume and the trading price of our stock. The average trading
volume of our stock over the last three full calendar months is approximately 83,068 shares per day and the high and low trading
price of our stock during the same period of time was 0.59 and 0.28, respectively. If our stock continues to trade at low volumes
and price, the amount of capital that we can raise under the ATM offering will be constrained. 

We intend to use the net proceeds from the ATM offering for general corporate purposes, including, but not limited to, sales and marketing
activities, clinical studies and product development, acquisitions of assets, businesses, companies, or securities, capital expenditures,
and working capital needs. 

While
we are committed to these plans, there is no assurance that these efforts will be successful or sufficient to meet our capital requirements. 

These
factors raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. Our future viability depends on the
successful execution of our strategic plans, securing additional financing, and achieving profitable operations. 

Operating
Activities 

During
the three months ended August 31, 2024, cash used in operating activities was approximately 1,344,000. The primary factors that contributed
to this were a loss of approximately 1,316,000, an increase in accounts receivable of 616,000, and a decrease in lease liability of
 78,000. These were partially offset by a decrease in inventories of 429,000, a decrease in prepaid expenses and other of 106,000,
and non-cash expenses of approximately 191,000 . 

During
the three months ended August 31, 2023, cash used in operating activities was approximately 1,674,000. The primary factors that contributed
to this were a loss of approximately 1,132,000, non-cash expenses of 122,000, primarily associated with depreciation and amortization,
share-based compensation, inventory reserves and amortization of right-of-use assets. This was partially offset by changes in asset and
liability accounts of 664,000. 

Investing
Activities 

During
the three months ended August 31, 2024, we did not acquire any new property, equipment, or patents. 

During
the three months ended August 31, 2023, cash used in investing activities was approximately 63,000. During the three months ended August
31, 2023, we purchased approximately 21,000 of property and equipment and had 42,000 in expenditures related to patents. 

15 

Financing
Activities 

During
the three months ended August 31, 2024, and 2023, the Company did not have any cash provided by financing activities, with no net proceeds from the sale of common stock or stock option exercises. 

OFF
BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS 

There
were no off-balance sheet arrangements as of August 31, 2024. 

CRITICAL
ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES 

The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires us to make a number of estimates and assumptions that
affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial
statements. Such estimates and assumptions may affect the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. We evaluate
and base our estimates and assumptions on historical experience and various other factors and circumstances that we believe to be reasonable.
Different assumptions or conditions may cause actual results to differ materially from these estimates. We continue to monitor significant
estimates made during the preparation of our financial statements. We believe our estimates and assumptions are reasonable under the current
conditions; however, actual results may differ from these estimates under different future conditions. 

We believe that the estimates and assumptions that are most important to the portrayal of our financial condition
and results of operations, in that they require subjective or complex judgments, form the basis for the accounting policies deemed to
be most critical to us. These relate to revenue recognition, bad debts, inventory overhead application, inventory reserves, lease liabilities
and right-of-use assets. We believe estimates and assumptions related to these critical accounting policies are appropriate under the
circumstances; however, should future events or occurrences result in unanticipated consequences, there could be a material impact on
our future financial conditions or results of operations. There have been no significant changes to our critical accounting policies from
those disclosed in our 2024 Annual Report. We suggest that our significant accounting policies be read in conjunction with this Management s
Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. Please refer to Note 2 for information on Significant Accounting
Policies. 

ITEM
3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 

We
are a smaller reporting company as defined by Rule 12b-2 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act and are not required to provide the information
under this item. 

ITEM
4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 

Our management evaluated the
effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act
of 1934, as amended, or the Exchange Act, as of the end of the period covered by this report. Our management recognizes that any controls
and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving its objectives, and management
is required to apply its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures. Our disclosure controls
and procedures have been designed to provide reasonable assurance of achieving its objectives. 

Based on their evaluation as
of August 31, 2024, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures
(as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) were effective at the reasonable assurance level to
ensure that the information required to be disclosed by us in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q (our Quarterly Report was (1) recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and regulations; and (2)
accumulated and communicated to the our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer to allow timely
decisions regarding required disclosure. 

There have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended August 31, 2024
that have materially affected, or that is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

PART
II. OTHER INFORMATION 

ITEM
1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS 

From 
time to time, we are involved in legal proceedings, claims, and litigation arising in the ordinary course of business, which
may impact our financial results. 

As
of August 31, 2024, there were no pending legal proceedings. However, the outcome of any future legal matters, claims, or litigation
could potentially have a material adverse effect on our quarterly or annual operating results or cash flows when resolved
in subsequent periods. Nonetheless, based on current information, management believes these matters will not have a material adverse
effect on the our consolidated financial position, results of operations, or cash flows. 

ITEM
1A. RISKS FACTORS 

Investing in our common stock involves certain risks. Before making an
investment decision, you should carefully consider all the information within this Quarterly Report, including the information contained
in Part I, Item 2, Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, as well as in our condensed
consolidated financial statements and the related notes contained in Part I, Item 1 within this Quarterly Report. In addition, you should
carefully consider the risks and uncertainties described in Part I, Item 1A, Risk Factors, of our 2024 Annual Report, as
well as in our other public filings with the SEC. If any of the identified risks are realized, our business, results of operations, financial
condition, liquidity, and prospects could be materially and adversely affected. In that case, the trading price of our common stock may
decline, and you could lose all or part of your investment. In addition, other risks of which we are currently unaware, or which we do
not currently view as material, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition, and
prospects. 

During the three months ended August 31, 2024, there were no material changes to the risks and uncertainties described
in Part I, Item 1A, Risk Factors, of our 2024 Annual Report.
