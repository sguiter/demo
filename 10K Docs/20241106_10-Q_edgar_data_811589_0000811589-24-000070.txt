 FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS 
 Part I of this report contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, which statements are inherently subject to risks and uncertainties. Forward-looking statements are statements that include projections, predictions, expectations or beliefs about future events or results or otherwise are not statements of historical fact. Further, forward-looking statements are intended to speak only as of the date made. Such statements are often characterized by the use of qualifying words (and their derivatives) such as expect, believe, estimate, plan, project, or other statements concerning our opinions or judgment about future events. Our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in any forward-looking statements, as they will depend on many factors about which we are unsure, including many factors which are beyond our control. Factors that could influence the accuracy of such forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, the financial success or changing strategies of our customers, our level of success in integrating acquisitions, actions of government regulators, the level of market interest rates, geopolitical influences and general economic conditions. For additional information about factors that could affect the matters discussed in this paragraph, see the Risk Factors section of our 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K ("2023 Annual Report") and Item 1A of Part II of this report.

 Government-sponsored enterprise securities Mortgage-backed securities Corporate bonds State and local governments Total unrealized loss position 
 As of September 30, 2024, the Company's securities portfolio included securities of which securities were in an unrealized loss position. As of December 31, 2023, the Company's securities portfolio included securities of which securities were in an unrealized loss position. 
 In the above tables, all of the securities that were in an unrealized loss position at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 are bonds that the Company has determined are in a loss position due primarily to interest rate factors and not credit quality concerns. In arriving at this conclusion, the Company reviewed third-party credit ratings and considered the severity of the impairment. The state and local government investments are comprised almost entirely of highly-rated municipal bonds issued by state and local governments throughout the nation. The Company has no significant concentrations of bond holdings from one state or local government entity. Nearly all of our mortgage-backed securities were issued by Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation ("FHLMC"), Federal National Mortgage Association ("FNMA"), Government National Mortgage Association ("GNMA"), or the Small Business Administration ("SBA"), each of which is a government agency or GSE and guarantees the repayment of the securities. 
 At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company determined that expected credit losses associated with held to maturity securities and available for sale debt securities were insignificant. 
 Due after five years but within ten years Due after ten years Mortgage-backed securities Total securities 
 At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, investment securities with carrying values of million and million, respectively, were pledged as collateral for public deposits. In addition, at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, investment securities with carrying values of million and million, respectively, were pledged as collateral for Federal Reserve Bank ("Federal Reserve") borrowings. 
 At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, there were no holdings of securities of any one issuer, other than the U.S. Government and its agencies or GSEs, in an amount greater than 10 of shareholders' equity. 
 There were no sales of investment securities during the three months ended September 30, 2024.

 million. As the Class B stock did not initially have a readily determinable fair value, it was carried at 0 prior to the sale. 
 During the second quarter of 2024, the Company received proceeds from sales of securities of million and recorded million in gross losses from the sales. This loss was partially offset by the million gain on the sale of the Visa stock discussed above. Included in "Securities losses, net" in the consolidated statements of income, during the first quarter of 2024, the Company received proceeds from the call of a security of million and recorded a thousand loss related to the unamortized premium balance at the time of the call. During the first quarter of 2023, the Company sold substantially all of the securities acquired from GrandSouth at their initially recorded fair values. Accordingly, there was no gain or loss recorded on the sale of acquired securities. 
 Included in Other assets in the consolidated balance sheets are investments in Federal Home Loan Bank FHLB and Federal Reserve stock totaling million and million at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. These investments do not have readily determinable fair values. The FHLB stock had a cost of million and million at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively, and serves as part of the collateral for the Company s line of credit with the FHLB and is also a requirement for membership in the FHLB system. The Federal Reserve stock had a cost and fair value of million and million at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively, and is a requirement for Federal Reserve member bank qualification. Periodically, both the FHLB and Federal Reserve recalculate the Company s required level of holdings, and the Company either buys more stock or redeems a portion of the stock at cost. The Company determined that neither stock was impaired at either period end.

 Construction, development other land loans Commercial real estate - owner occupied Commercial real estate - non owner occupied Multi-family real estate Residential 1-4 family real estate Home equity loans/lines of credit Consumer loans Total 
 Given that the storm impacted the area just prior to September 30, 2024 and recovery continues in many communities, the Company performed analyses to identify possible impacts from the storm and has reserved accordingly based upon the information available at this time. The Company applied increased reserve rates based upon severe economic factors to the approximately million of loans in the most impacted path of Hurricane Helene. Additionally, the Company performed an initial evaluation of the largest commercial loans in that area and applied incremental reserves to those loans that were suspected of having higher potential property damage or economic impact from the storm. Due to the potential exposure from Hurricane Helene, the ACL on these impacted loans increased by million, expanding the ACL as a percent of loans in the impacted geography from to as of September 30, 2024 and adding basis points to the overall ACL as a percent of total loans, which was as of September 30, 2024. 
 Allowance for Unfunded Loan Commitments 
 In addition to the ACL on loans, the Company maintains an allowance for lending-related commitments such as unfunded loan commitments and letters of credit. The Company estimates expected credit losses over the contractual period in which the Company is exposed to credit risk via a contractual obligation to extend credit, unless that obligation is unconditionally cancellable by the Company. The allowance for lending-related commitments on off-balance sheet credit exposures is adjusted as a provision for unfunded commitments expense. The estimate includes consideration of the likelihood that funding will occur, which is based on a historical funding study derived from internal information, and an estimate of expected credit losses on commitments expected to be funded over its estimated life, which are the same loss rates that are used in computing the ACL on loans. The allowance for unfunded loan commitments of million and million at September 30, 2024 and

 Amortization expense of all amortizable intangible assets totaled million and million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and million and million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. 
 Goodwill is evaluated for impairment on at least an annual basis, with the annual evaluation occurring as of October 31 of each year. Goodwill is also evaluated for impairment any time there is a triggering event indicating that impairment may have occurred. No triggering events were identified during 2024 to date and, therefore, the Company did not perform interim impairment evaluations. The Company's most recent evaluation of goodwill, which occurred in the fourth quarter of 2023, indicated that there was goodwill impairment. There was no change to carrying amounts of goodwill during 2024.

The Company also leases office space for several operational departments. The lease agreements have maturity dates ranging from November 2024 through May 2076, some of which include options for multiple five - and extensions. The weighted average remaining life of the lease term for these leases was years as of September 30, 2024. Certain of the Company's lease agreements include variable lease payments based on changes in inflation, with the impact of that factor being insignificant to the Company's total lease expense. As permitted by applicable accounting standards, the Company has elected not to recognize leases with original lease terms of twelve months or less (short-term leases) on the Company's consolidated balance sheets. The short-term lease cost for each period presented was insignificant. 
 Leases are classified as either operating or finance leases at the lease commencement date and all of the Company's leases have been determined to be operating leases. Lease expense for operating leases and short-term leases is recognized on a straight-line basis over the applicable lease term. Right-of-use assets represent the Company's right to use an underlying asset for the lease term and lease liabilities represent the Company's obligation to make lease payments arising from the lease. Right-of-use assets and lease liabilities are recognized at the lease commencement date based on the estimated present value of lease payments over the lease term.

 The following is a description of the valuation methodologies used for financial instruments measured at fair value. 
 Securities Available for Sale When quoted market prices are available in an active market, the securities are classified as Level 1 in the valuation hierarchy. If quoted market prices are not available, but fair values can be estimated by observing quoted prices of securities with similar characteristics, the securities are classified as Level 2 on the valuation hierarchy. Most of the fair values for the Company s Level 2 securities are determined by the Company's third-party bond accounting provider using matrix pricing. Matrix pricing is a mathematical technique widely used in the industry to value debt securities without relying exclusively on quoted prices for the specific securities but rather by relying on the securities relationship to other benchmark quoted securities. For the Company, Level 2 securities include U.S Treasury bonds, mortgage-backed securities, commercial mortgage-backed obligations, government-sponsored enterprise securities, and corporate bonds. In cases where Level 1 or Level 2 inputs are not available, securities are classified within Level 3 of the hierarchy.

 Fair value estimates are made at a specific point in time, based on relevant market information and information about the financial instrument. These estimates do not reflect any premium or discount that could result from offering for sale at one time the Company s entire holdings of a particular financial instrument. Because no highly liquid market exists for a significant portion of the Company s financial instruments, fair value estimates are based on judgments regarding future expected loss experience, current economic conditions, risk characteristics of various financial instruments, and other factors. These estimates are subjective in nature and involve uncertainties and matters of significant judgment and therefore cannot be determined with precision. Changes in assumptions could significantly affect the estimates. 
 Fair value estimates are based on existing on- and off-balance sheet financial instruments without attempting to estimate the value of anticipated future business and the value of assets and liabilities that are not considered financial instruments. Significant assets and liabilities that are not considered financial assets or liabilities include

 The Company recog nized income tax benefits related to stock-based compensation expense in its income statement of an d for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and and for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. 
 At September 30, 2024, the sole equity-based compensation plan of the Company was the First Bancorp 2024 Equity Plan (the "Equity Plan"), which was approved by shareholders on May 31, 2024. As of September 30, 2024, the Equity Plan had shares remaining available for grant. During the second quarter, the First Bancorp 2014 Equity Plan expired and was replaced by the Equity Plan. 
 The Equity Plan is intended to serve as a means to attract, retain, and motivate key employees and directors and to associate the interests of the Equity Plan's participants with those of the Company and its shareholders. The Equity Plan allows for both grants of stock options and other types of equity-based compensation, including stock appreciation rights, restricted and unrestricted stock, restricted performance stock, and performance units. For the last several years, the only equity-based compensation granted by the Company has been shares of restricted stock, as it relates to employees, and unrestricted stock as it relates to non-employee directors. 
 There have been no material changes to the treatment of stock awards and equity grants as discussed in Note 15 of the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. 
 In addition to employee equity awards, the Company's practice is to grant unrestricted common shares to each non-employee director (currently in total) in June of each year. The grants were valued at approximately in 2024. Compensation expense associated with these director awards is fully recognized by the date of the award since there are no vesting conditions.

Item 2 - Management's Discussion and Analysis of Consolidated Results of Operations and Financial Condition 

Highlights of the results for the quarter and year-to-date period are presented below (refer also to additional discussion in the "Results of Operations" and "Financial Condition" sections following). Comparisons for the financial periods presented are impacted by the GrandSouth acquisition which was completed on January 1, 2023 with the related core system conversion occurring in March 2023. 

Overview and Highlights at and for Three Months Ended September 30, 2024 
 
 We earned net income of 18.7 million, or 0.45 diluted EPS, during the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to net income of 29.9 million, or 0.73 diluted EPS, for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease in net income in the current year period as compared to the prior year period was driven primarily by a 14.2 million increase in provision for credit losses, 13.0 million of which was related to anticipated impact from Hurricane Helene and a higher cost of funds, partially offset by a higher yield on interest earning assets, both of which were driven by the overall interest rate environment for the past year. Adjusting for the impact from Hurricane Helene, our adjusted net income was 29.0 million, or 0.70 per diluted share, for the third quarter. 
 Net interest income for the third quarter of 2024 was 83.0 million, a 2.0 decrease from the 84.7 million recorded in the third quarter of 2023. The decrease in net interest income from the prior year period was driven by higher cost of funds, partially offset by higher yield on earning assets. 
 Net interest margin ("NIM") on a tax-equivalent basis decreased in the third quarter of 2024 to 2.90 from 2.97 for the third quarter of 2023 as a result of the higher cost of funds and decreased loan accretion, partially offset by increases in market interest rates driving higher yields on loans and other earning assets. 
 We remained well-capitalized by all regulatory standards. Capital grew during the quarter with a total common equity Tier 1 ratio of 14.37 , Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 15.19 and total risk-based capital ratio of 16.65 at September 30, 2024, all growing for the quarter and from September 30, 2023. 
 The provision for credit losses for the third quarter of 2024 was 14.2 million, driven by an incremental provision of 13.0 million related to the potential exposure from Hurricane Helene and 2.1 million of net charge-off activity, partially offset by generally improving economic forecasts that lead to a reduction in the reserves required for unfunded commitments. See the "Allowance for Credit Losses, Allowance for Unfunded Commitments, and Loan Loss Experience" discussion in the Financial Condition section of Management's Discussion and Analysis. 
 Noninterest income for the three months ended September 30, 2024 totaled 13.6 million which was a decrease of 1.6 million, or 10.5 , from the comparable period of 2023 and was primarily related to an decrease in Other income, net, related to the timing of the recognition of gain and loss from other investment activity, which does not include available for sale or held to maturity securities. 
 Noninterest expense of 59.9 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2024 decreased 2.4 million, or 3.8 , from the three months ended September 30, 2023. This decrease is attributable to a 2.4 million decrease in other operating expenses. 
 These third quarter results include the potential impact of Hurricane Helene of 13.4 million, comprised of 13.0 million of provision for potential credit loss exposure in our footprint hardest hit by Helene, 0.3 million of estimated property damages and an additional 0.1 million of other impacts. After considering the tax effect of these items, our net income was reduced by 10.3 million. 

Overview and Highlights at and for Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 
 
 We earned net income of 72.7 million, or 1.76 diluted EPS, during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to net income of 74.5 million, or 1.81 diluted EPS, for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Adjusting for the potential impact from Hurricane Helene, our adjusted net income was 83.0 million, or 2.01 per diluted share, for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 
 
 Page 37 

Index 

 Net interest income for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 243.4 million, a 7.9 decrease from the 264.2 million recorded for the comparable period of 2023. The decrease in net interest income was driven by higher cost of funds, partially offset by higher yields on interest earning assets. 
 NIM on a tax-equivalent basis decreased to 2.86 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from 3.12 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 related to higher cost of funds driven by increases in market rates and competition for deposits. Higher rates on interest-bearing liabilities and lower purchase accounting loan discount accretion were partially offset by increased loan yields from market rate increases and pricing on new loans. 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company recorded 15.9 million in provision for credit losses as compared to 14.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The higher provision in 2024 was significantly impacted by the 13.0 million provision related to Hurricane Helene. The 2023 provision was primarily driven by the GrandSouth acquisition as follows: (1) a one-time provision of 12.2 million for non-credit deteriorated loans; and (2) a one-time initial provision for unfunded commitments of 1.9 million. 
 Noninterest income for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 totaled 41.1 million, a decrease of 1.9 million, or 4.4 , from the comparable period of 2023 primarily related to decreased Other income, net of 1.9 million and increased securities losses of 1.2 million, partially offset by an increase in SBA loan sale gains of 1.3 million. 
 Noninterest expense decreased 20.7 million, or 10.4 , to 177.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the prior year period, primarily driven by a 13.5 million decrease in merger expenses resulting from the GrandSouth acquisition along with a 4.7 million decrease in other operating expenses and a 1.6 million decrease in personnel expense. 
 These 2024 year to date results include the potential impact of Hurricane Helene of 13.4 million. This comprised of 13.0 million of provision for potential credit loss exposure in our footprint hardest hit by Helene, 0.3 million of estimated property damages and an additional 0.1 million of other impacts. After considering the tax effect of these items, our net income was reduced by 10.3 million. 

Total assets at September 30, 2024 amounted to 12.2 billion, a 0.3 increase from December 31, 2023, and was driven primarily by higher interest-bearing cash balances, partially offset by a short term strategy to intentional reduce investment securities and loan balances. The primary balance sheet changes are presented below. 
 Total loans amounted to 8.0 billion at September 30, 2024, reflecting a contraction of 136.6 million from December 31, 2023. 
 Total deposits were 10.5 billion at September 30, 2024, an increase of 473.3 million, or 4.72 , from December 31, 2023. 
 Credit quality continued to be strong at September 30, 2024, with NPAs of 0.38 of total assets as of September 30, 2024, up slightly from 0.37 at December 31, 2023. 
 On-balance sheet liquidity ratio was 17.7 at September 30, 2024. Available off-balance sheet sources totaled 2.4 billion at quarter end, resulting in a total liquidity ratio of 35.2 . 
 Capital grew during the quarter, keeping us well-capitalized by all regulatory standards. At September 30, 2024, our total common equity Tier 1 ratio was 14.37 , our Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio was 15.19 and our total risk-based capital ratio was 16.65 . All capital ratios grew during the quarter and from September 30, 2023. 
 
 Critical Accounting Estimates 
 The accounting principles we follow and our methods of applying these principles conform with GAAP and with general practices followed by the banking industry. Certain policies inherently have a greater reliance on the use of estimates, assumptions, or judgments and as such, have a greater possibility of producing results that could be materially different than originally reported. We have identified the determination of our ACL and related Allowance for Unfunded Commitments, as well as business combinations, related fair value measurements and goodwill determination to be the accounting areas that require the most subjective or complex judgments, estimates, and assumptions, and where changes in those judgments, estimates, and assumptions (based on new or additional

 information, changes in the economic climate and/or market interest rates, etc.) could have a significant effect on our financial statements. See the "Allowance for Credit Losses, Allowance for Unfunded Commitments, and Loan Loss Experience" discussion in the Financial Condition section of Management's Discussion and Analysis. 
 There have been no material changes to the Company's significant accounting policies as discussed in Note 1 of the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023.

 RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 
 Net Interest Income 
 Net interest income is our largest source of revenue and is the difference between the interest earned on interest-earning assets (generally loans and investment securities) and the interest expense incurred in connection with interest-bearing liabilities (generally deposits and borrowed funds). Changes in the net interest income are the result of changes in volume and the net interest spread which affects NIM. Volume refers to the average dollar levels of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities. Net interest spread refers to the difference between the average yield on interest-earning assets and the average cost of interest-bearing liabilities. NIM refers to net interest income divided by average interest-earning assets and is influenced by the level and relative mix of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities. Net interest income is also influenced by external factors such as local economic conditions, competition for loans and deposits, and market interest rates. 
 Net interest income for the three months ended September 30, 2024 amounted to 83.0 million, a decrease of 1.7 million, or 2.0 , from the 84.7 million recorded in the third quarter of 2023. The decrease was primarily driven by higher cost of funds, partially offset by higher yields on earning assets. While average interest-earning assets for the third quarter of 2024 increased 83.9 million, or 0.7 , from the comparable period of the prior year, the mix of assets shifted to higher earning assets, with average loans growing 79.9 million and short term investments growing 400.0 million, while taxable securities decreased 391.5 million. The increase in the cost of interest bearing deposits of 64 basis points between the third quarter of 2023 and the third quarter of 2024 more than offset improvements from earning asset mix changes and higher yields. This resulted in the reduction in our tax-equivalent NIM (see discussion below) from 2.97 for the third quarter of 2023 to 2.90 for the third quarter of 2024. 
 For internal purposes, we evaluate our NIM on a tax-equivalent basis by adding the tax benefit realized from tax-exempt loans and securities to reported interest income then dividing by total average earning assets. We believe that analysis of tax-equivalent NIM is useful and appropriate because it allows a comparison of net interest income in different periods without taking into account the different mix of taxable versus non-taxable loans and investments that may have existed during those periods.The following is a reconciliation of reported net interest income to tax-equivalent net interest income and the resulting NIM as reported and on a tax-equivalent basis.

 (3) Includes tax-equivalent adjustments of 722,000 and 740,000 for three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, to reflect the tax benefit that we receive related to tax-exempt securities and tax-exempt loans, which carry interest rates lower than similar taxable investments/loans due to their tax-exempt status. This amount has been computed assuming a 23 tax rate and is reduced by the related nondeductible portion of interest expense.

 Overall, as demonstrated in the table above, despite the change in the mix of earning assets to higher yielding assets, the compression in NIM drove the decrease in net interest income. 
 During 2023, the Federal Reserve increased the fed funds rate four times for a total of 100 basis points, in addition to the substantial increases made during 2022. During 2024, the Federal Reserve did not change rates until mid September at which point the fed funds rate was reduced 50 basis points. These changes resulted in a decrease of 50 basis points in fed funds rates between September 2023 and September 2024, with an average prime rate of 8.43 for three months ended September 30, 2024, a slight decrease from the prior year period. During much of 2024, the market yield curve was inverted. 
 Average loan volumes for the three months ended September 30, 2024 were 79.9 million higher than the same period in 2023. In addition, interest rates on loans increased 19 basis points to 5.51 for the third quarter of 2024, resulting in an increase in interest income on loans of 4.6 million. 
 Due to the impact of the aforementioned fed funds increases in 2022 and 2023 and the resulting increased market rates along with higher average balances, deposit interest expense for the three months ended September 30, 2024 increased 13.8 million compared to the same period in 2023. Average interest-bearing deposit balances increased 500.6 million while rates on those deposits increased 64 basis points as compared to the same period in the prior year. 
 Average borrowings were 341.7 million lower in the third quarter of 2024 as compared to the third quarter of 2023 due in large part to the decreased utilization of short-term borrowings to fund loan growth and manage fluctuations in deposit balances. This decrease in volume of borrowings between periods was partially offset by higher rates on the remaining borrowings, with overall rates increasing 209 basis points in the third quarter of 2024 from the third quarter of 2023. These changes resulted in the 4.6 million decrease in interest expense on borrowings. 
 The decrease in NIM was directly related to higher rates on interest-bearing liabilities driven by the aforementioned short-term Federal Reserve rate increases in 2022 and 2023, the inverted yield curve in 2024 and the repricing of our deposits during the last year occurring at a more rapid pace than the increase in yields on interest-earning assets. 
 
 Net interest income for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 amounted to 243.4 million, a decrease of 20.7 million, or 7.9 , from the 264.2 million recorded in the nine months ended September 30, 2023. As described above, the Federal Reserve actions from 2022 through 2024 affected market rates which had resulting impacts on the rates we paid or received in 2023 and 2024. Similar to the impact during the three months ended September 30, 2024, the decrease for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was also driven by higher cost of funds, partially offset by increased yields on interest-earning assets. Our tax-equivalent NIM fell to 2.86 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from 3.12 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 as discussed further below. 
 The following is a reconciliation of reported net interest income to tax-equivalent net interest income and the resulting NIM as reported and on a tax-equivalent basis.

 Overall, as demonstrated in the table above, the reduction in NIM, partially offset by higher earning asset volumes, drove the decrease in net interest income. 
 During 2023, the Federal Reserve increased the fed funds rate four times for a total of 100 basis points, in addition to the substantial increases made during 2022. During 2024, the Federal Reserve did not change rates until mid September at which point the fed funds rate was reduced 50 basis points. These changes resulted in a decrease of 50 basis points in fed funds rates between September 2023 and September 2024, with an average prime rate of 8.48 for nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 8.09 for the prior year period. During much of 2024, the market yield curve was inverted. 
 Average loan volumes for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 were 224.1 million higher than the same period in 2023 due to organic loan growth. In addition, interest rates on loans increased 22 basis points to 5.49 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, resulting in an increase in loan interest income of 22.5 million. 
 Primarily due to higher market rates as well as the increase in average balances, deposit interest expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 increased 51.4 million compared to the same period in 2023. Average interest-bearing deposit balances increased 467.0 million while rates on those deposits increased 87 basis points as compared to the same period in the prior year. 
 Interest expense on borrowings decreased 6.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the same period in 2023 due to the 173.3 million decrease in the average volume of borrowings between periods, partially offset by a 61 basis point increase in the rates on those borrowings. The lower balances were due in large part to a decreased reliance on short-term borrowings during 2024 as deposit growth provided additional liquidity. The remaining borrowings are longer term in nature and carry higher interest rates than those that were paid off. 
 NIM decreased 26 basis points between the comparable periods as higher loan yields and reduced cost of borrowings were more than offset by the higher cost of deposits, also driven by the increases in Fed funds rates during 2022 and 2023 and competition for deposits. 

Our NIM for all periods presented benefited from the net accretion income arising from purchase accounting premiums/discounts associated with acquisitions. Presented in the table below is the amount of accretion which increased net interest income in each time period presented. 
 For the Three Months Ended September 30, For the Nine Months Ended September 30, in thousands) 2024 2023 2024 2023 Interest income increased by accretion of loan discount on acquired loans 2,003 2,766 6,743 9,043 Total interest income impact 2,003 2,766 6,743 9,043 Interest expense increased by discount accretion of deposits (174) (709) (681) (2,606) Interest expense increased by discount accretion of borrowings (193) (215) (572) (635) Total net interest expense impact (367) (924) (1,253) (3,241) Total impact on net interest income 1,636 1,842 5,490 5,802 
 The most significant component of the purchase accounting adjustments in each year was loan discount accretion on purchased loans. Generally, the level of loan discount accretion will decline each year due to the natural reduction in outstanding balance of acquired loans. 
 At September 30, 2024 and 2023, unaccreted loan discounts on purchased loans amounted to 17.3 million and 26.5 million, respectively. The GrandSouth acquired portfolio comprised the majority of the remaining unaccreted loan discount at September 30, 2024. 
 In addition to the loan discount accretion recorded on acquired loans, we recorded accretion on the discounts associated with the retained unguaranteed portions of SBA loans sold in the secondary market. The level of SBA

 loan discount accretion will fluctuate relative to the SBA loan portfolio balances. At September 30, 2024 and 2023, the unaccreted loan discounts on SBA loans amounted to 3.3 million and 4.0 million, respectively. 
 Provision for Credit Losses and Provision for Unfunded Commitments 
 The provision for credit losses is comprised of the provision for loan losses and the provision for unfunded commitments. The provision recorded in each period represents the amount required such that the total ACL reflects the current estimate of life of loan credit losses in the loan portfolio and the allowance for unfunded commitments reflects the current expected losses on unfunded loan commitments that are expected to result in outstanding loan balances. Our estimate of credit losses is determined using a complex model that relies on reasonable and supportable forecasts and historical loss information to determine the balance of the ACL and allowance for unfunded commitments. Refer also to Critical Accounting Estimates in Item 7 of the 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC for more information. 
 The provision for credit losses was 14.2 million and zero for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and 15.9 million and 14.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. 
 For the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the same period in 2023, the higher provision was primarily due to the 13.0 million provision specifically attributed to Hurricane Helene. Generally improving economic forecasts that lead to a reduction in the reserves required for unfunded commitments during the three months ended September 30, 2024, but the effect was not as impactful as was the case in the three months ended September 30, 2023 by 0.6 million. 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the same period in 2023, the higher provision was primarily due to the 13.0 million provision specifically attributed to Hurricane Helene and a 0.4 million increase in net charge off activity for the period, partially offset by generally improving economic forecasts that lead to a reduction in the reserves required for unfunded commitments. The provision for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 was directly related to the GrandSouth acquisition, which consisted of: (1) a one-time provision of 12.2 million for non-credit deteriorated loans; and (2) a one-time initial provision for unfunded commitments of 1.9 million. 
 Within the portions of Western North and South Carolina that were significantly impacted by Hurricane Helene, the Company identified borrowers with approximately 755 million of loans outstanding. Given that the storm impacted the area just prior to September 30, 2024 and recovery continues in many communities, the Company performed analyses to identify possible impacts from the storm and has reserved accordingly based upon the information available at this time. The Company applied increased reserve rates based upon severe economic factors to the approximately 755 million of loans in the path of Helene. Additionally, the Company performed an initial evaluation of the largest commercial loans in its impacted markets and applied incremental reserves to those loans that were suspected of having higher potential property damage or economic impact from the storm The incremental provision related to the potential exposure from Hurricane Helene added 0.16 to the ACL as of September 30, 2024. 
 Additional discussion of the CECL method and our asset quality and credit metrics, which impact our provision for credit losses, is provided in the "Nonperforming Assets" and "Allowance for Credit Losses, Allowance for Unfunded Commitments, and Loan Loss Experience" sections following.

 Noninterest Income 
 Our noninterest income amounted to 13.6 million and 15.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and 41.1 million and 42.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The lower noninterest income in the current quarter as compared to the same prior year period is primarily the result of lower "Other income, net," partially offset by an increase in "Presold mortgage loan fees and gains on sale." The decreased noninterest income for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the same period in 2023 is a result of "Securities losses, net" in 2024 and lower "Other income, net," partially offset by increased "SBA loan sale gains." Details of the more significant components of noninterest income are presented in the table below. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, the change in "Other income, net" was related to the timing of the recognition of gain and loss from other investment activity, which does not include available for sale or held to maturity securities.

 Total noninterest expenses totaled 59.9 million and 62.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and 177.3 million and 198.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The primary contributors to the 2.4 million, or 3.8 , decrease in noninterest expense for the third quarter of 2024 as compared to the same period of 2023 were the 1.4 million decrease in "Other operating expenses", the 0.6 million decrease in "Non-credit losses," and the 0.5 million decrease in "Equipment related expenses," partially offset by an increase in "Total personnel expense" of 0.5 million. The primary contributors to the 20.7 million decrease for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the same period in 2023 were the 13.5 million decrease in "Merger and acquisition expenses," the 2.7 million decrease in "Other operating expenses," the 1.7 million decrease in "Non-credit losses," and the 1.6 million decrease in "Total personnel expenses." The decline in "Other operating expenses" was primarily related to a 2.4 million charge in 2023 for the estimated termination costs associated with the Company's pension plan. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, there was an overall effort my management to cut costs and control expenses.

 Income Taxes 
 We recorded income tax expense of 3.9 million and 7.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Our effective tax rate was 17.2 and 20.6 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The lower effective tax rate for 2024 was attributable primarily to decreased pretax income driven by the potential impact of Hurricane Helene. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, we recorded tax expense of 18.6 million and 19.8 million, respectively. Our effective tax rate was 20.4 and 21.0 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. 

FINANCIAL CONDITION 
 Total assets at September 30, 2024 amounted to 12.2 billion, a 38.5 million, or 0.3 , increase from December 31, 2023 and was primarily related to higher interest-bearing cash balances, partially offset by reductions in investment securities and loan balances. 
 Total loans at September 30, 2024 amounted to 8.0 billion, a decrease of 136.6 million, or 1.7 , from December 31, 2023. The mix of our loan portfolio remained substantially the same at September 30, 2024 as compared to December 31, 2023, with the exception of "Construction, development other land loans," which, as a percentage of the loan portfolio, fell from 12 at December 31, 2023 to 9 at September 30, 2024. The majority of our real estate loans were personal mortgages and commercial loans where real estate provides additional security for the loan. Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements presents additional detail regarding our mix of loans. At September 30, 2024, we had no notable concentrations in geographies or industries, including in office or hospitality categories. The Company's exposure to non-owner occupied commercial office loans represented approximately 5.7 of the total portfolio at September 30, 2024, with the largest loan being 26.6 million and the average loan outstanding balance being 1.3 million. Non-owner occupied office loans were generally in non-metro markets and the 10 largest loans in this category represented less than 2 of the total loan portfolio at September 30, 2024. 
 Total investment securities were 2.4 billion at September 30, 2024, a decrease of 293.8 million from December 31, 2023. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company made no purchases of investment securities. There were no sales of investment securities during the third quarter of 2024. 
 
 Page 47 

Index 

 During the second quarter of 2024, the Company sold 142.9 million of available for sale investment securities at a 4.7 million loss that was substantially offset by the 4.5 million gain on sale of the VISA B shares during that quarter. The call of a security during the first quarter of 2024 resulted in a loss of 975 thousand related to the unamortized premium balance. In addition, the Company continues to utilize cash flows from investment securities to fund earning assets and repay borrowings and brokered deposits. 
 The composition of our investment portfolio remained substantially the same at September 30, 2024 as at December 31, 2023, with the exception of U.S. Treasuries, of which 175.9 million was sold or matured during the first nine months of 2024 and Mortgage-backed securities, of which 34.6 million and 169.3 million were sold, matured or were paid down during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively. The composition of the investment portfolio continued to reflect our investment strategy of maintaining an appropriate level of liquidity while providing a stable source of income. The investment portfolio also provides a balance to interest rate risk and credit risk in other categories of the balance sheet while providing a vehicle for the investment of available funds, furnishing liquidity, and supplying securities to pledge as required collateral for certain deposits. 
 The unrealized loss on available for sale securities totaled 331.5 million at September 30, 2024. Refer to Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements for additional detailed information regarding our mix of investments and the unrealized losses for each category. We evaluated the unrealized losses on individual securities at September 30, 2024 and determined them to be of a temporary nature due primarily to interest rate factors and not credit quality concerns. In arriving at this conclusion, we reviewed third-party credit ratings and considered the severity of the impairment. 
 Total deposits amounted to 10.5 billion at September 30, 2024, an increase of 473.3 million, or 4.7 , from December 31, 2023. Brokered deposits decreased 3.1 million from year end, while organic growth from customer deposits totaled 476.4 million. 
 We continue to have a diversified and granular deposit base which has remained stable with continued growth in customer deposits, primarily money market accounts. Our deposit mix has remained relatively consistent and has not changed significantly and there has been no notable shift in deposits from noninterest-bearing to interest-bearing.

 Nonperforming Assets 
 NPAs are defined as nonaccrual loans, modifications to borrowers in financial distress, loans past due 90 or more days and still accruing interest, and foreclosed real estate. NPAs are summarized as follows: 
 in thousands) 
 September 30, 2024 December 31, 2023 Nonperforming assets Nonaccrual loans 34,125 32,208 Modifications to borrowers in financial distress 10,262 11,719 Total nonperforming loans 44,387 43,927 Foreclosed real estate 1,519 862 Total nonperforming assets 45,906 44,789 Asset Quality Ratios Nonaccrual loans to total loans 0.43 0.40 Nonperforming loans to total loans 0.55 0.54 Nonperforming assets to total loans and foreclosed properties 0.57 0.55 Nonperforming assets to total assets 0.38 0.37 Allowance for credit losses to total loans 1.53 1.35 Allowance for credit losses to nonaccrual loans 359.61 341.07 Allowance for credit losses to nonperforming loans 276.47 250.08 
 As shown in the table above, total NPAs at September 30, 2024 increased slightly to 45.9 million from year end and related primarily to the 1.9 million increase in nonaccrual loans, partially offset by the 1.5 million decrease in modifications to borrowers in financial distress. 
 "Commercial and industrial" is the largest category of nonaccrual loans, at 10.3 million, or 30.2 , of total nonaccrual loans, followed by "Commercial real estate - owner occupied" at 10.1 million, or 29.6 , of total nonaccrual loans. Included in various loan categories are nonaccrual SBA loans totaling 21.7 million at September 30, 2024, or 63.5 of total nonaccrual loans, and which have 11.8 million in guarantees from the SBA. 
 As reflected in Note 4 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements, total classified loans decreased 4.9 to 51.5 million at September 30, 2024 compared to 54.2 million at December 31, 2023. The decrease resulted primarily from improvements in "Home equity loans/lines of credit" loans of 1.9 million and "Commercial real estate - owner occupied" loans of 1.8 million, partially offset by an increase in "Residential 1-4 family real estate" of 2.0 million. Special mention loans increased 34.2 from 44.1 million at December 31, 2023 to 59.2 million at September 30, 2024. The majority of the increase was attributable to "Commercial real estate - owner occupied" loans, which increased 14.7 million. 
 
 Allowance for Credit Losses, Allowance for Unfunded Commitments, and Loan Loss Experience 
 The total allowance for credit losses amounted to 122.7 million at September 30, 2024 compared to 109.9 million at December 31, 2023. Fluctuations in the ACL are based on loan mix and growth, changes in the levels of 
 nonperforming loans, economic forecasts impacting loss drivers, other assumptions and inputs to the CECL model, 
 and as occurred in 2023, adjustments for acquired loan portfolios. As discussed previously in the "Provision for Credit Losses and Provision for Unfunded Commitments" section, much of the change to the level of ACL during the period ended September 30, 2024 was primarily related to the provision of 13.0 million related to potential impact from Hurricane Helene, slower prepayment assumptions and updated economic forecasts which are a key assumption in the CECL model and which indicated improvement in some factors, but also to a continued reduction of the commercial real estate pricing index, thus projecting a higher allowance for credit losses balance, partially offset by reductions in loan balances during the period. The ACL as a percent of loans at September 30, 2024 was 1.53 , 16 basis points of which was attributable to the potential impact from Hurricane Helene. 
 Within the portions of Western North and South Carolina that were significantly impacted by Hurricane Helene, the Company identified borrowers with approximately 755 million of loans outstanding. The following is a summary of the categories of those loans outstanding as of September 30, 2024: 
 
 Page 49 

Index 

 in thousands) Balance Commercial and industrial 10,481 Construction, development other land loans 29,429 Commercial real estate - owner occupied 98,958 Commercial real estate - non owner occupied 284,825 Multi-family real estate 25,677 Residential 1-4 family real estate 266,554 Home equity loans/lines of credit 39,470 Consumer loans Total 755,394 
 Given that the storm impacted the area just prior to September 30, 2024 and recovery continues in many communities, the Company performed analyses to identify possible impacts from the storm and has reserved accordingly based upon the information available at this time. The Company applied increased reserve rates based upon severe economic factors to the approximately 755 million of loans in the most impacted path of Helene. Additionally, the Company performed an initial evaluation of the largest commercial loans in that area and applied incremental reserves to those loans that were suspected of having higher potential property damage or economic impact from the storm. Due to the impact from from Hurricane Helene, the ACL on these impacted loans increased by 13.0 million, expanding the ACL as a percent of loans in the impacted markets from 1.29 to 3.01 as of September 30, 2024 and adding 0.16 to the overall ACL as a percent of total loans as of September 30, 2024. 
 The ACL reflects our estimate of life of loan expected credit losses that will result from the inability of our borrowers to make required loan payments. We use systematic methodologies to determine the ACL for loans and the allowance for certain off-balance-sheet credit exposures. We consider the effects of past events, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts on the collectability of the loan portfolio. The ACL is calculated using collectively evaluated pools for loans with similar risk characteristics applying the discounted cash flow ("DCF") method. When a loan no longer shares similar risk characteristics with its segment, the loan is evaluated on an individual basis applying a DCF or asset approach for collateral-dependent loans. 
 For the periods indicated, the following table summarizes our balances of loans outstanding, average loans outstanding, ACL, charge-offs and recoveries, and key ratios: 
 in thousands) Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 Twelve Months Ended December 31, 2023 Nine Months Ended September 30, 2023 Loans outstanding at end of period 8,013,538 8,150,102 8,027,037 Average amount of loans outstanding 8,064,480 7,902,628 7,840,344 Allowance for credit losses, at period end 122,718 109,853 108,198 Total charge-offs (7,460) (10,175) (7,575) Total recoveries 2,292 3,701 2,845 Net charge-offs (5,168) (6,474) (4,730) Ratios: Net charge-offs as a percent of average loans (annualized) 0.09 0.08 0.08 Allowance for credit losses as a percent of loans at end of period 1.53 1.35 1.35 
 While our estimate of the ACL involves a high degree of judgment, we believe the ACL was adequate at each period end presented. Our assessment of the ACL involves uncertainty and judgment and is subject to change in future periods. The amount of any changes could be significant if the assessment of loan quality or collateral values changes substantially with respect to one or more loan relationships or portfolios or if there is a significant change in the reasonable and supportable forecast or assumptions used to model our expected credit losses. No assurance can be given that we will not in any particular period sustain loan losses that are sizable in relation to the amounts reserved or that subsequent evaluations of the loan portfolio, in light of conditions and factors then prevailing, will not require significant changes in the ACL or future charges to earnings. In addition, various regulatory agencies, as an integral part of their examination process, periodically review our ACL and the value of our collateral-dependent

 loans. Such agencies may require us to recognize adjustments to the ACL based on their judgments about information available at the time of their examinations. Refer also to Critical Accounting Policies Allowance for Credit Losses on Loans and Allowance for Unfunded Commitments in Note 1 to the 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC for more information. 
 In addition to the ACL on loans, we maintain an allowance for lending-related commitments such as unfunded loan commitments. We estimate expected credit losses associated with these commitments over the contractual period in which we are exposed to credit risk via a contractual obligation to extend credit, unless that obligation is unconditionally cancellable. The allowance for lending-related commitments on off-balance sheet credit exposures is adjusted as a component of the provision for credit losses expense. The estimate includes consideration of the likelihood that funding will occur and an estimate of expected credit losses on commitments expected to be funded over its estimated life. The allowance for unfunded commitments of 9.3 million and 11.4 million at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively, is classified on the consolidated balance sheets within "Other liabilities." The decline in the level of the allowance between periods was driven by the reduction in reserve rates and balances of available lines of credit during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 
 
 Liquidity, Commitments, and Contingencies 
 Our liquidity is determined by our ability to convert assets to cash or acquire alternative sources of funds to meet the needs of our customers who are withdrawing or borrowing funds, and to maintain required reserve levels, pay expenses and operate the Company on an ongoing basis. Our primary liquidity sources are net income from operations, cash and due from banks, federal funds sold and other short-term investments. Our securities portfolio has a high percentage of amortizing mortgage-backed securities generating monthly cash flows. In addition, the portfolio is comprised almost entirely of readily marketable securities, which could also be sold to provide cash. We also maintain available lines of credit from the FHLB and the Federal Reserve, as well as federal funds lines from several correspondent banks which are summarized below. 
 At September 30, 2024, the Company had the following sources of readily available borrowing capacity: 
 An existing borrowing capacity with the FHLB of approximately 1.3 billion which can be structured as either short-term or long-term borrowings, depending on the particular funding or liquidity need, and is secured by a blanket lien on most of our real estate loan portfolio, select securities from our investment portfolio, and our FHLB stock (of which 0.8 million and 280.9 million were outstanding at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively); 
 Federal funds lines with several correspondent banks totaling 265.0 million, which provide for overnight unsecured federal funds purchased (of which none were outstanding at September 30, 2024 or December 31, 2023); and, 
 A line of credit with the Federal Reserve through its discount window borrowing program of approximately 799.6 million which is secured by a blanket lien on a portion of our commercial and consumer loan portfolio (excluding real estate loans) and specific investment securities. All of this line was available at both September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. 
 Our overall on-balance sheet liquidity ratio was 17.7 at September 30, 2024 compared to 14.6 at December 31, 2023. We define our liquidity ratio as net liquid assets (cash, unpledged securities and other marketable assets) as a percentage of our net liabilities (unpledged deposits and borrowings). Our total liquidity ratio, including the 2.4 billion in available lines of credit at quarter end, was 35.2 as of September 30, 2024. Not included in these ratios are the readily available sources of funds through brokered deposits. As of September 30, 2024, our brokered deposits availability was 1.8 billion per our internal policy. 
 The amount and timing of our contractual obligations and commercial commitments have not changed materially since December 31, 2023, the detail of w hich is presented in the "Contractual Obligations and Other Commercial Commitments" table of our 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K. In addition, we are not involved in any legal proceedings that, in our opinion, could have a material effect on our consolidated financial position. 
 
 Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements and Derivative Financial Instruments 
 Off-balance sheet arrangements include transactions, agreements, or other contractual arrangements pursuant to which we have obligations or provide guarantees on behalf of an unconsolidated entity. We have no off-balance 
 
 Page 51 

Index 

 sheet arrangements of this kind other than letters of credit and repayment guarantees associated with our trust preferred securities and subordinated debentures. 
 In the normal course of business, we are exposed to certain risks arising from both our business operations and economic conditions. As an element of our risk management strategies, we may enter into derivative financial instruments to manage exposures that arise from business activities that result in the receipt or payment of future known and uncertain cash amounts, the value of which are determined by interest rates. Derivative financial instruments include futures, forwards, interest rate swaps, options contracts, and other financial instruments with similar characteristics. 
 We do not engage in significant derivatives activities. However, in 2023 to accommodate customers, we implemented a program whereby we enter into interest rate swaps with certain commercial loan customers, with offsetting positions to dealers under a back-to-back swap program. At September 30, 2024, the Company's derivative financial instruments consisted entirely of customer back-to-back interest rate swaps which are not designated as hedges. Under this program, the Company executes interest rate swaps with commercial banking customers to facilitate their risk management strategies. Those interest rate swaps are simultaneously economically hedged by offsetting derivatives that the Company executes with a third party, such that the Company minimizes its net risk exposure resulting from such transactions. As the interest rate derivatives associated with this program are not designated as hedging instruments, changes in the fair value of both the customer derivatives and the offsetting derivatives are recognized directly in earnings. There have been no material changes from the derivative positions discussed in Note 13 of the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. 
 
 Capital Resources 
 The Company is regulated by the Federal Reserve and is subject to the securities registration and public reporting regulations of the SEC. Our Bank is also regulated by the Federal Reserve and the North Carolina Office of the Commissioner of Banks ("NCCOB"). We must comply with regulatory capital requirements established by the Federal Reserve and the NCCOB. Failure to meet minimum capital requirements can initiate certain mandatory, and possibly additional discretionary, actions by regulators that, if undertaken, could have a direct material effect on our financial statements. We are not aware of any recommendations of regulatory authorities or otherwise which, if they were to be implemented, would have a material effect on our liquidity, capital resources, or operations. 
 Under Basel III standards and capital adequacy guidelines and the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action, we must meet specific capital guidelines that involve quantitative measures of our assets, liabilities, and certain off-balance sheet items as calculated under regulatory accounting practices. Our capital amounts and classification are also subject to qualitative judgments by the regulators about components, risk weightings, and other factors. 
 The Federal Reserve's capital standards require us to maintain minimum ratios of common equity tier 1 capital to total risk-weighted assets, tier 1 capital to total risk-weighted assets, and total capital to risk-weighted assets of 4.50 , 6.00 and 8.00 , respectively. Common equity tier 1 capital is comprised of common stock and related surplus, plus retained earnings, and is reduced by goodwill and other intangible assets, net of associated deferred tax liabilities. Tier 1 capital is comprised of common equity tier 1 capital plus "additional tier 1 capital", which includes non-cumulative perpetual preferred stock and trust preferred securities. Total risk-based capital is comprised of tier 1 capital plus qualifying subordinated debentures, and certain adjustments, the largest of which is our ACL and allowance for unfunded commitments. The Company has elected to exclude AOCI related primarily to available for sale securities from common equity tier 1 capital. Risk-weighted assets refer to our on- and off-balance sheet exposures, adjusted for their related risk levels using formulas set forth in Federal Reserve regulations. 
 In addition to the risk-based capital requirements described above, we are subject to a leverage capital requirement, which calls for a minimum ratio of Tier 1 capital (as defined above) to quarterly average total assets of 3.00 to 5.00 , depending upon the institution s composite ratings as determined by its regulators. The Federal Reserve has not advised us of any requirement specifically applicable to us. 
 At September 30, 2024, our capital ratios exceeded the regulatory minimum ratios discussed above. The capital ratios at September 30, 2024 increased as compared to 2023 year end ratios related primarily to retention of earnings increasing capital, combined with loan reductions and shifts in asset mix to lower risk-weighted assets.

 The following table presents the capital ratios for the Company and the regulatory minimums discussed above for the periods indicated: 
 September 30, 2024 December 31, 2023 Minimum required Risk-based capital ratios: Common equity Tier 1 to Tier 1 risk weighted assets 14.37 13.20 7.00 Tier I capital to Tier 1 risk weighted assets 15.19 13.99 8.50 Total risk-based capital to Tier II risk weighted assets 16.65 15.54 10.50 Leverage capital ratio: Tier 1 capital to quarterly average total assets 11.29 10.91 4.00 
 The Bank is also subject to capital requirements that do not vary materially from the Company s capital ratios presented above. At September 30, 2024, the Bank exceeded the minimum ratios established by the regulatory authorities. 
 In addition to regulatory capital ratios, we also closely monitor our ratio of tangible common equity ("TCE") to tangible assets, which is a non-GAAP financial measure. The TCE ratio was 8.47 at September 30, 2024 compared to 7.56 at December 31, 2023.

 Stock Repurchase Plans 
 On January 30, 2024, the Board of Directors of the Company authorized the repurchase of up to 40 million in shares of the Company s common stock. Any such repurchases would be made pursuant to a plan approved by and containing provisions about the timing, purchase prices and quantities purchased determined by management in its discretion. During the quarter ended September 30, 2024, the Company did not make any such purchases. 

Item 3 Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 
 Market Risk 
 Market risk is the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in the fair value of financial instruments due to changes in interest rates, exchange rates, and equity prices. The Company s market risk is composed primarily of interest rate risk inherent in the normal course of lending and deposit-taking activities. We are also exposed to market risk in our investing activities. We do not have any trading assets or activities. 
 Interest Rate Risk 
 Net interest income is our most significant component of earnings and we consider interest rate risk to be our most significant market risk. Our net interest income results from the difference between the yields we earn on our interest-earning assets, primarily loans and investments, and the rates that we pay on our interest-bearing liabilities, primarily deposits and borrowings. When interest rates change, the yields we earn on our interest-earning assets and the rates we pay on our interest-bearing liabilities do not necessarily move in tandem with each other because 
 
 Page 53 

Index 

 of the difference between their maturities and repricing characteristics and which can negatively impact net interest income. 
 Interest rates are highly sensitive to many factors that are beyond our control, including general economic conditions and policies of various governmental and regulatory agencies and, in particular, the Federal Reserve. Changes in monetary policy, including changes in interest rates, influence not only the interest we receive on loans and investments and the amount of interest we pay on deposits and borrowings, but such changes could also affect the average duration of our mortgage portfolio, investment securities and other interest-earning assets. 
 Our goal is to structure our asset/liability composition to maximize net interest income while managing interest rate risk so as to minimize the adverse impact of changes in interest rates on net interest income and capital in either a rising or declining interest rate environment. Profitability is affected by fluctuations in interest rates. A sudden and substantial change in interest rates may impact our earnings adversely because the interest rates of the underlying assets and liabilities do not change at the same speed, to the same extent or on the same basis. 
 Interest rate risk is monitored through the use of several complementary modeling tools, primarily earnings simulation modeling, and economic value simulation (net present value estimation). These models measure changes in a variety of interest rate scenarios. While interest rate risk models have limitations, taken together they represent a reasonably comprehensive view of the magnitude of our interest rate risk, the level of risk through time, and the amount of exposure to changes in certain interest rate relationships. Earnings simulation and economic value models are utilized by management on a regular basis as they more effectively measure the cash flow and optionality impacts than does a static gap analysis. From the various model results and our expectations regarding future interest rate movements, the national, regional and local economies, and other financial and business risk factors, we quantify the overall magnitude of interest sensitivity risk and then determine appropriate strategies and practices governing asset growth and pricing, funding sources and pricing, and off-balance sheet commitments. 
 Earnings Simulation Analysis 
 We use net interest income simulations which measure the short-term earnings exposure from changes in market rates of interest. The model calculates an earnings estimate based on current and projected balances and rates, incorporating our current financial position with assumptions regarding future business to calculate net interest income under varying hypothetical rate scenarios. This method is subject to the accuracy of the assumptions that underlie the process, but it provides a better analysis of the sensitivity of earnings to changes in interest rates than other analyses, such as the static gap analysis. 
 Assumptions used in the model are derived from historical trends and management s outlook. The model assumes a static balance sheet with cash flows reinvested in similar instruments to maintain the balance sheet levels and current composition. Actual cash flows and repricing characteristics for our balance sheet instruments are input to the model. The model incorporates market-based assumptions regarding the impact of changing interest rates on the prepayment rate of certain assets and liabilities. Because these assumptions are inherently uncertain, actual results may differ from simulated results. 
 Different interest rate scenarios and yield curves are used to measure the sensitivity of earnings to changing interest rates in both a "shocked" instantaneous move and a "ramped" move of rates. Interest rates on different asset and liability accounts move differently when the Federal Reserve changes rates and such assumptions are reflected in the different rate scenarios. The model does not take into account any future actions that management may take to mitigate the impact of interest rate changes, and it is our strategy to proactively change the volume and mix of our balance sheet in order to mitigate our interest rate risk. 
 There has been no significant change in the Company's estimated net interest income sensitivity position from December 31, 2023. From a net interest income perspective, the Company generally has a fairly neutral interest sensitivity position in the short-term (within a twelve-month period) and within the lower ranges (+ - 100 to 200 basis points) of interest rate changes. With the current inverted interest rate yield curve, modeling of net interest income in changing rate environments presents particular challenges. As of September 30, 2024, the net interest income sensitivity indicates a slight asset sensitive position in both rising and falling rates over a one year period; however, a steepening of the yield curve reduces the impact of a 200 basis point reduction in rates to less than 2 of net interest income over a one year period and less than a 1 reduction over a two year period. The interest rate yield curve remains flat/inverted as of September 30, 2024. A flat or inverted interest rate yield curve is an unfavorable interest rate environment for many financial institutions, including the Bank, as short-term interest rates generally drive our deposit pricing and longer-term interest rates generally drive loan pricing. When these rates converge or 
 
 Page 54 

Index 

 invert, the profit spread we realize between loan yields and deposit rates narrows, which pressures our NIM, as was the case in 2022 and 2023. 
 With regard to rising rates, with an immediate increase or shock of 200 basis points in market rates we would expect to realize an increase in net interest income of approximately 3 over both a one-year and two-year horizon. As previously noted, these assumptions are inherently uncertain, and actual results may differ from simulated results. Subsequent to September 30, 2024 market indications indicate that the yield curve may begin to normalize and steepen. In addition to the 50 basis points reduction in September 2024, the market consensus is that the Federal Reserve will continue to reduce short-term rates through late 2024 and into 2025. With reductions by the Federal Reserve, we are actively managing the cost of funds. Further, variable rate interest-earning assets will likely reprice to lower rates. Our ability to reduce cost of funds may be impacted by market competition for deposits. 
 Economic Value Simulation 
 Economic value simulation is used to calculate the estimated fair value of assets and liabilities over different interest rate environments. Economic values are calculated based on discounted cash flow analysis. The net economic value of equity is the economic value of all assets minus the economic value of all liabilities assuming a liquidation of the current balance sheet. The change in net economic value over different rate environments is an indication of the longer-term earnings capability of the balance sheet. The same assumptions are generally used in the economic value simulation as in the earnings simulation, including immediate and parallel rate shocks and static assumptions for deposit average decay rate and average lives. 
 As of December 31, 2023, the Company s economic value of equity ("EVE") was generally liability sensitive in both a rising and falling interest rate environment, which continues to be the case as of September 30, 2024. In the rising rate scenarios, EVE declines and in the falling rate scenarios, EVE improves. The decline in EVE under a rising rate environment is driven by the composition of the loans and investment portfolios, primarily related to fixed rate loans and fixed rate mortgage-backed securities as compared to a higher proportion of deposits having variable rates. In a rising rate environment, the fixed rate loan and securities portfolios tend to extend due to slower prepayments, thus lowering their relative valuation in the EVE calculation. In declining rate environments, these same loan and securities portfolios tend to prepay. As of September 30, 2024, the impact of increasing rates on EVE are less severe than at December 31, 2023. Further, at the same date, the benefit from declining rates on EVE remains positive in most declining rate scenarios, but at a lower level than at December 31, 2023. 
 Additional discussion concerning our exposure to interest rate risk is presented in Item 7A of the 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC. 
 Inflation 
 Our financial statements have been prepared in accordance with GAAP, which requires the financial position and operating results to be measured principally in terms of historic dollars without considering the change in the relative purchasing power of money over time due to inflation. 
 Nearly all of the Company s assets and liabilities are monetary in nature, and as such, changes in interest rates (as discussed above) generally affect the financial condition of the Company to a greater degree than changes in the rate of inflation. Although interest rates are influenced by changes in the inflation rate, they do not necessarily change at the same rate or in the same magnitude as the inflation rate. Inflation affects the Company s results of operations mainly through increased operating costs, and the impact of inflation on banks in general is normally not as significant as its influence on those businesses that have large investments in plant and inventories. We review pricing of our products and services, as well as our controllable operating and labor costs in light of current and expected costs due to inflation, to mitigate the inflationary impact on financial performance to the extent possible. 

Item 4 Controls and Procedures 
 Management, under the supervision of and with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, assessed the effectiveness of the design and operation of the Company s disclosure controls and procedures, which are our controls and other procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our periodic reports with the SEC is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the required time periods. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to 
 
 Page 55 

Index 

 ensure that information required to be disclosed is communicated to our management to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Based on this assessment, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures as of September 30, 2024 are effective in allowing timely decisions regarding disclosure to be made about material information required to be included in our periodic reports with the SEC. In addition, there has been no change in our internal control over financial reporting which has occurred during, or subsequent to, the period covered by this report that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 

Part II. Other Information 
 
 Item 1 Legal Proceedings 
 Various legal proceedings may arise in the ordinary course of business and may be pending or threatened against the Company and its subsidiaries. Neither the Company nor any of its subsidiaries are involved in any pending legal proceedings that management believes are material to the Company or its consolidated financial position. If an exposure were to be identified, it is the Company s policy to establish and accrue appropriate reserves during the accounting period in which a loss is deemed to be probable and the amount is determinable. 
 
 Item 1A Risk Factors
