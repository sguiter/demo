The Company s tax returns for the years 2018 to 2023 are open for tax examination by U.S. federal and state, and the Danish tax authorities. The Company maintains a full valuation allowance on its U.S. and foreign deferred tax assets. The assessment regarding whether a valuation allowance is required considers both positive and negative evidence when determining whether it is more likely than not that deferred tax assets are recoverable. In making this assessment, significant weight is given to evidence that can be objectively verified. In its evaluation, the Company considered its cumulative losses historically and in recent years and its forecasted losses in the near term as significant negative evidence. Based upon review of available positive and negative evidence, the Company determined that the negative evidence outweighed the positive evidence and a full valuation allowance on its U.S. and foreign deferred tax assets will be maintained. The Company will continue to assess the realizability of its deferred tax assets and will adjust the valuation allowance as needed. The net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards may become subject to an annual limitation in the event of certain cumulative changes in the ownership interest of significant stockholders over a three-year period in excess of 50 , as defined under Sections 382 and 383 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 IRC ).

You should carefully read the information under Forward-Looking Statements in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. For convenience of presentation some of the numbers have been rounded in the text below. Overview We are a commercial-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on the development and commercialization of novel, antibody-based therapeutic products for the treatment of cancer. We are leveraging our proprietary antibody platforms and deep expertise in the field of antibodies to develop a broad portfolio of innovative medicines largely in the space of pre-targeted radio-isotope labeled therapeutics. Our only approved drug DANYELZA (naxitamab-gqgk) received accelerated approval by the United States Food and Drug Administration, or the FDA, in November 2020 for the treatment, in combination with Granulocyte Macrophage Colony Stimulating Factor, or GM-CSF, of pediatric patients one year of age and older and adult patients with relapsed or refractory, or R/R, high risk neuroblastoma, or NB, in the bone or bone marrow who have demonstrated a partial response, minor response, or stable disease to prior therapy. We are commercializing DANYELZA in the United States and began shipping in February 2021. In October 2024, we achieved a three-year extension of DANYELZA U.S. patent through February 2034. DANYELZA in combination with GM-CSF has been evaluated in a Phase 2 clinical study in front-line high-risk NB, or HR NB, for patients in first complete remission, including those that did not undergo autologous stem cell transplant. DANYELZA plus GM-CSF in combination with chemotherapy (irinotecan + temozolamide) was also evaluated and shown to be effective in patients with refractory or multiple relapsed HR-NB disease. DANYELZA is currently being evaluated in an ongoing pivotal-stage multicenter trial (Study 201) which is designed to satisfy the accelerated approval confirmatory study and post-marketing requirements of the FDA. In addition, a Phase 2 clinical study in second line relapsed osteosarcoma patients with pulmonary-only recurrence and with complete surgical remission, has completed enrolment and is undergoing evaluation of results. In late June 2024, we received a preliminary draft abstract of certain results from MSK s investigator-initiated Phase 2 study of naxitamab in second line relapsed osteosarcoma patients (Study 15-096; NCT02502786). For the 39 patients in the study with pulmonary-only recurrence, the summary stated that there were 14 event-free patients at 12 months, rather than MSK s primary endpoint of 16 event-free patients at 12 months. Analysis of the full study results is still under way. Once we obtain the full data set, we plan to undertake further analysis to evaluate tumor GD2 expression in the study subjects, efficacy, and the degree of correlation with clinical response in both primary and secondary endpoints. We intend to use the results of such further analysis to inform our determinations with respect to further development of naxitamab-based immunotherapy in patients with relapsed OS. The results of Study 15-096 are expected to be presented by the MSK sponsor/investigator team later this year at a scientific conference. Our partner the Beat Childhood Cancer Research Consortium, or BCC, is leading a multi-center Phase 2 trial evaluating naxitamab in combination with standard induction therapy for patients with newly diagonalized HR NB. We have 22 active sites and treated 11 patients with recruitment ongoing as of September 30, 2024. The amended protocol for the transition to a comparison with an external control is currently in process and being evaluated. We expect the trial 

 28 

Table of Contents 
 to transition from a single-arm trial, to a comparative trial with an external control arm that reflects current standard of care for induction therapy with comparable patient population that is carefully selected and propensity score matched. Our aim for the trial is to demonstrate superiority in Complete Response at the end of induction therapy in the naxitamab arm versus the standard of care. In advanced breast cancer, we are partnering with the Ohio State University on a Phase 1b/2 trial investigating TGF NKs, gemcitabine plus naxitamab in patients with GD2-positive metastatic breast cancer. The recruiting for patients was initiated in the three months ended September 30, 2024. Evaluation of dose-limiting toxicities with the combination of gemcitabine and natural killer NK cells, and the persistence of NK cells in the blood, will be followed by the addition of naxitamab. Upon the outcome of this trial, we would consider moving forward with a multi-center Phase 2 trial. In patients with refractory Ewing sarcoma, the Institute of Mother and Child in Poland is leading a randomized Phase 2 trial evaluating the efficacy and safety of naxitamab. This trial was initiated during the fourth quarter of 2023. Three patients have been dosed in the naxitamab arm and recruitment is ongoing as of September 30, 2024. We expect a total of 16 patients in the naxitamab arm. We expect to complete the trial in 2028. In addition, we are in discussions with the MD Andersen Cancer Center to initiate a multi-center Phase 1/2 study with a Phase 1 run-in, that seeks to test the hypothesis that the addition of naxitamab to current standard of care, will increase the objective response rate in patients with metastatic Triple Negative Breast Cancer who have received at least one prior line of systemic therapy for metastatic disease. The study, which is anticipated to start in the first quarter in 2026, will further inform us on a future Phase 2 program in Triple Negative Breast Cancer. We are using our proprietary SADA PRIT Technology to advance a series of antibody constructs, using a two-step pre-targeting approach. The antibody fragments bind to the tumor before a radioactive payload is subsequently injected. The aim is specifically to deliver the radioactive payload to the tumor while minimizing exposure to normal tissue as indicated in non-clinical studies. GD2-SADA for potential use in GD2-positive solid tumors is our first SADA PRIT construct, and we had our first clinical patients dosed in April 2023 in our Phase 1, dose-escalation, single-arm, open-label, non-randomized, multicenter trial, for the treatment of certain solid tumor cancers, including small cell lung cancer, sarcoma, and malignant melanoma. The latest patient cohort, cohort 6, opened in the fourth quarter of 2024, and has expanded to include patients with HR NB (above 16 years of age). We currently have seven active treatment sites as of September 30, 2024. Patients dosed with the GD2-SADA protein have not experienced dose limiting toxicities or treatment related serious adverse events. Based on the SPECT/CT scans performed, we believe that we have demonstrated proof of concept for GD2-SADA by demonstrating that the GD2-SADA molecules can find and bind to tumors and that the radionuclide targets the SADA molecules. We have completed cohorts 1 to 5, using a radioactive payload upto 200 mCi and a two to five days interval between the SADA protein and the payload. The initial blood pharmacokinetic PK profile of the construct in these patients dosed with the 0.3 mg/kg, 1 mg/kg and 3 mg/kg of protein appears to match our pre-clinical models in terms of clearance data, and the blood PK profiles from patients are comparable and supportive of the current dose interval of two to five days. Further, we plan to submit an IND to the FDA for a Phase 1 multicenter study of GD2-SADA for the potential treatment of pediatric neuroblastoma in the first half of 2025, pending results from the 1001 study Part A. The IND for our first hematological target, the CD38-SADA construct for the treatment of patients with Relapsed or Refractory Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma was cleared in October 2023, and we are currently screening and plan to dose the first patient in 2024. We believe the SADA PRIT Technology could potentially improve the efficacy of immunological therapeutics, e.g., naked monoclonal antibodies, in tumors that have not historically demonstrated meaningful responses to immunological agents. In January 2023, following receipt of a complete response letter in November 2022 from the FDA for our Biologics License Application for radiolabeled 131 I-omburtamab for central nervous system leptomeningeal metastases, or CNS-LM, we announced a strategic restructuring plan designed to extend our cash resources and prioritize resources on the commercialization and potential label extension of DANYELZA and development of the SADA PRIT

Table of Contents 
 Technology platform. In connection with the restructuring, we determined to deprioritize our radiolabeled omburtamab development program for CNS-LM. In addition, we deprioritized other pipeline programs, including activities relating to the GD2-GD3 Vaccine and CD33 bispecific antibody constructs by delaying trial initiation and overall timelines as part of the restructuring plan. We completed the restructuring in May 2023, which resulted in an approximately 35 reduction to our then workforce. As previously disclosed, last year we determined to deprioritize all development work on radiolabeled omburtamab for CNS-LM, and to deprioritize the development work on our GD2-GD3 Vaccine and CD33 bispecific antibody constructs to continue focusing our development resources on additional indications for DANYELZA and potential applications for our SADA PRIT platform. We estimate that our cash and cash equivalents, when combined with anticipated DANYELZA revenues, should support our operations into 2027. This estimate reflects our current business plan, including our development plans and business strategy following the restructuring, which is supported by assumptions that may prove to be inaccurate, such that we could use our available capital resources sooner than we currently expect. This estimate assumes no income from new partnerships or other new business development activities, and no further development of the radiolabeled omburtamab program, the GD2-GD3 Vaccine and the CD33 bispecific antibody constructs. We cannot provide any assurance that we will be able to obtain additional capital from additional equity or debt financing, collaborations, licensing arrangements, or other sources. Since our inception on April 30, 2015, we have devoted substantially all of our resources to organizing and staffing our company, business planning, identifying potential product candidates, conducting pre-clinical studies of our product candidates and clinical trials of our lead product candidates, commercializing our approved product, raising capital, and acquiring and developing our technology platform among other matters. We developed DANYELZA and our product candidates based on intellectual property subject to several license agreements with MSK, and one agreement with the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. These agreements are important to our business; for a more detailed discussion of their terms and conditions, see further details in NOTE 9 LICENSE AGREEMENTS AND COMMITMENTS in the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 1. Financial Statements in this Form 10-Q. To date, we have financed our operations primarily through private placements of our securities, proceeds from our IPO and proceeds from our two subsequent public offerings, product and license revenues generated from DANYELZA, and the proceeds from our sale of the Priority Review Voucher, or PRV, obtained upon FDA approval of DANYELZA. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we had an accumulated deficit of 480.3 million and 457.5 million, respectively. We experienced net losses of 7.0 million and 22.9 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, and our net loss was 7.7 million and 20.4 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively. We have incurred significant net operating losses in every year since our inception. We expect our net operating losses to decrease in the future as our DANYELZA product revenue grows to help fund our significant research and development expenses. Our net losses may fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter and year to year as we: continue to advance DANYELZA through the various regulatory processes both in the United States and internationally; continue to advance our other product candidates through pre-clinical and clinical development; continue to identify additional research programs and additional product candidates, as well as additional indications for existing product candidates; initiate pre-clinical studies and clinical trials for any additional product candidates we may identify; develop, maintain, expand and protect our intellectual property portfolio; and hire additional research, sales force, commercialization, clinical and scientific personnel.

 For DANYELZA, and for any other product candidates for which we obtain regulatory approval, if any, we expect to incur milestone costs, as well as commercialization expenses related to product sales, marketing, manufacturing and distribution. Accordingly, we may continue to fund our operations through public or private equity or debt financing or other sources, including strategic collaborations. We may, however, be unable to raise additional funds or enter into such other arrangements when needed on favorable terms or at all. Our failure to raise capital or enter into such other arrangements as and when needed would have a negative impact on our financial condition and our ability to develop our current product candidates, or any additional product candidates. Because of the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with the development of our existing product candidates and any future product candidates, our platform and technology and because the extent to which we may enter into collaborations with third parties for development of any of our product candidates is uncertain, we are unable to estimate the amounts of increased capital outlays and operating expenses associated with completing the research and development of our product candidates. If we raise additional funds through collaborations, strategic alliances, or licensing arrangements with third parties, we may have to relinquish valuable rights to our technologies, future revenue streams, research programs, product candidates or grant licenses on terms that may not be favorable to us and could have a negative impact on our financial condition. Components of Our Results of Operations Product Revenue, Net Product revenue consists of sales of DANYELZA, and royalty revenue generated from the sales of DANYELZA. License Revenue License revenue consists of payments received for the licensing rights to DANYELZA. For a discussion of our material license agreements, refer to NOTE 3 SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES in the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8. Financial Statements in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. Operating Costs and Expenses Cost of goods sold Cost of goods sold includes direct and indirect costs related to the manufacturing and distribution of DANYELZA, including materials, third-party manufacturing costs, packaging services, freight, labor costs for personnel involved in the manufacturing process, indirect overhead costs, third-party royalties payable on our net product revenues and charges for excess and obsolete inventory reserves and inventory write-offs. License royalties License royalties include third-party royalty expenses related to license revenues that have been recognized. Research and development Research and development expenses consist of expenses incurred in connection with the discovery and development of our product candidates. We expense research and development costs as incurred. These expenses include, but are not limited to: sponsored research, laboratory facility services, clinical trial and data service at MSK under the Sponsored Research Agreements, or the SRAs, the two CFSAs, the MCTA, and the MDSA, with MSK; expenses incurred under agreements with CROs, as well as investigative sites and consultants that conduct our non-clinical and pre-clinical studies and clinical trials;

 expenses incurred under agreements with CMOs, including manufacturing scale-up expenses and the cost of acquiring and manufacturing pre-clinical study and clinical trial materials, including manufacturing of validation batches; upfront, milestone and other non-revenue related payments due under our third-party licensing agreements; employee-related expenses, which include salaries, benefits, travel and stock-based compensation; expenses related to regulatory activities, including filing fees paid to regulatory agencies; outsourced professional scientific development services; and allocated expenses for utilities and other facility-related costs, including rent, insurance, supplies and maintenance expenses, and other operating costs. 
 The successful development and regulatory approval of our product candidates is highly uncertain. At this time, we cannot reasonably estimate or know the nature, timing and costs of the efforts that will be necessary to complete the remainder of the development of DANYELZA or any other product candidates we may develop. This uncertainty is due to the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with the duration and cost of clinical trials, which vary significantly over the life of a project as a result of many factors, including, but not limited to: the number of clinical sites included in the trials; the availability and length of time required to enroll a sufficient number of suitable patients in our clinical trials; the actual probability of success for our product candidates, including the safety and efficacy, early clinical data, competition, manufacturing capability and commercial viability; significant and changing government regulation and regulatory guidance; the performance of our existing and any future collaborators; the number of doses patients receive; the duration of patient follow-up; the results of our clinical trials and pre-clinical studies; the establishment of commercial manufacturing capabilities; adequate ongoing availability of raw materials and drug substance for clinical development and any commercial sales; the terms and timing of potential regulatory approvals, including the timing of any BLA and Marketing Authorization Application, or MAA, submissions and their acceptance; the potential receipt of marketing approvals, including a safety, tolerability and efficacy profile that is satisfactory to the FDA, the European Medicines Agency, or EMA, and European Commission, or any other non-U.S. regulatory authority;

 any requirement by the FDA, the EMA and the European Commission, or any other non-US regulatory authority to conduct post market surveillance or safety studies; the expense of filing, prosecuting, defending and enforcing any patent claims and other intellectual property rights; and the success of commercialization of approved products. 
 A change in the outcome of any of these variables with respect to the development of a product candidate could mean a significant change in the costs and timing associated with the development of that product candidate. For example, in its complete response letter CRL for omburtamab, and in our Type A meeting held subsequent to receipt of the CRL, the FDA made recommendations for us to consider in terms of a potential trial design to demonstrate substantial evidence of effectiveness and a favorable benefit-risk profile, and we have determined to deprioritize our radiolabeled omburtamab development program for CNS-LM. If we are required and we determine to conduct additional clinical trials of a product candidate, we will need substantial additional funds and there is no assurance that the results of any such additional clinical trials will be sufficient for approval. Research and development activities are central to our business model. Product candidates in later stages of clinical development generally have higher development costs than those in earlier stages of clinical development, primarily due to the increased size and duration of later-stage clinical trials. Our research and development expenses include personnel costs, including stock-based compensation, and the costs of conducting clinical trials and potentially preparing regulatory submissions for our pipeline candidates, including supplementary regulatory submissions for DANYELZA. In January 2023, we announced a strategic restructuring plan designed to extend our cash resources and prioritize resources, and we are currently focused on the continued commercialization and potential label extension of DANYELZA and development of the SADA PRIT Technology platform. In addition to deprioritizing development of omburtamab for CNS-LM, we have deprioritized further work related to the GD2-GD3 Vaccine and CD33 bispecific antibody constructs. Following the January 2023 restructuring, our research and development expenses have decreased from historic averages. Our Research and Development expenses have decreased for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 when compared to the same period in 2023. Selling, general, and administrative Selling, general, and administrative expenses consist primarily of employee related expenses, including salaries, bonus, benefits, and stock-based compensation expenses for personnel in executive, commercial, finance and administrative functions. Other significant costs include facility costs not otherwise included in research and development expenses or cost of goods sold, legal fees relating to corporate matters, and fees for patent, accounting, tax, and consulting services. Our selling, general, and administrative expenses include administrative costs to support continued research and development activities, potential commercialization of additional product candidates and additional indications and costs associated with operating as a public company, including expenses related to services associated with maintaining compliance with exchange listing and SEC requirements, director and officer insurance costs and investor and public relations costs. Other income, net Other income, net primarily consists of interest income earned on our money market fund and foreign currency transaction gains and losses. Other income, net can vary quarter-to-quarter based on interest rates and foreign currency fluctuations. Critical Accounting Policies and Significant Judgments and Estimates Our management s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements, which we have prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting

Table of Contents 
 principles, or GAAP. We believe that several accounting policies are significant to understanding our historical and future performance. We refer to these policies as critical because these specific areas generally require us to make judgments and estimates about matters that are uncertain at the time we make the estimate, and different estimates which also would have been reasonable could have been used. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates and judgments, including those described in greater detail below. We base our estimates on historical experience and other market specific or other relevant assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. A summary of significant changes in critical accounting policies and significant judgements and estimates for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 are included in NOTE 3 SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES in the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 1. Financial Statements in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.

Our international product revenue, net was 3.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, a decrease of 19 compared to 3.9 million in the three months ended September 30, 2023. Product revenue, net from international markets includes 1.3 million from Latin America driven by recurring orders following commercial launches in Brazil and Mexico in the second quarter of 2024, and 1.0 million from Eastern Asia. Product revenue, net from Western Europe in the three months ended September 30, 2023 included 3.0 million of product revenue, net from our distribution partner, WEP. Our distribution partner in Western Europe operates our named patient program in the region. We did not have any shipments to Western Europe region in the three months ended September 30, 2024. Product revenue, net from the United States was 15.3 million and 16.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, representing a 5 decline primarily due to an unfavorable price mix, partially offset by increased volume. We recognized royalty revenue from our distribution partners of 1.1 million and 0.4 million in the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. License revenue There was no license revenue in the three months ended September 30, 2024. We recorded 0.5 million in license revenue for the three months ended September 30, 2023 upon the September 2023 achievement of marketing authorization for DANYELZA in Mexico within the terms of the non-refundable license milestone under our sublicense agreement with Adium. Cost of Goods Sold Our cost of goods sold includes amounts related to materials, third-party contract manufacturing, third-party packaging services, freight, indirect labor costs, third-party royalties for approved products, and indirect overhead costs. Cost of goods sold was 2.3 million and 2.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Cost of goods sold included 1 lower vial volumes in the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same period in 2023, and the three months ended September 30, 2023 included an inventory write-down of 0.4 million for an inventory batch that did not meet out quality specification.

 We define gross margin as net product revenues less cost of goods sold divided by net product revenues. Our gross margin stayed relatively flat at 88 and 87 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Our gross margin in the three months ended September 30, 2023 was slightly lower due to the above noted inventory write-down. License Royalties License royalties include third-party royalty expenses related to license revenues that have been recognized. We did not record any license royalty expense for the three months ended September 30, 2024. We recorded 50 thousand license royalty expense for the three months ended September 30, 2024 related to the September 2023 achievement of marketing authorization for DANYELZA in Mexico within the terms of the non-refundable license milestone under our sublicense agreement with Adium. Research and Development We do not record our research and development expenses on a program by program or on a product-by-product basis as they primarily relate to personnel, research, manufacturing, license fees, and consumable costs, which are simultaneously deployed across multiple projects under development. These costs are included in the table below.

The 4.2 million decrease in research and development expenses was primarily attributable to the recognition of 4.1 million milestones and license acquisition costs related to our SADA License Agreement during the three months ended September 30, 2023, as we determined certain time-based clinical milestones within the agreement were probable based on the availability of necessary data and the assessment of clinical progress in the third quarter of 2023. Selling, General, and Administrative Selling, general, and administrative expenses were 13.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to 10.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The 3.4 million increase in selling, general and administrative expenses was primarily attributable to a 1.2 million increase related to our former Chief Financial Officer s separation and consulting agreements, 1.1 million increase in personnel cost, inclusive of stock-based compensation and 0.5 million increase in professional and consulting fees. The agreements with our former Chief Financial Officer are described in NOTE 9 LICENSE AGREEMENT AND COMMITMENTS in the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 1. Financial Statements in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.

 Interest and Other Income Interest and other income for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was 1.9 million as compared to interest and other income of 0.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. Our interest and other income increased by 1.7 million primarily due to a 1.9 million of foreign currency transactional gains in the three months ended September 30, 2024, partially offset by a 0.2 million decrease in interest earned on our cash and cash equivalents. Provision for Income Taxes Provision for income taxes was 0.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to 0.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in provision for income taxes was primarily driven by a decrease in loss before income taxes.

The decrease was primarily driven by a 0.7 million decrease in international product revenue, net in the nine months ended September 30, 2024, while product revenue in the United States, net was relatively flat. Our distribution partner in Western Europe operates our named patient program in the region, for and the product revenue, net for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 included the initial inventory stocking order in anticipation of the launch of the program, which did not recur in 2024. Product revenue, net from Eastern Asia in the nine months ended September 30, 2023 also included an initial commercial launch inventory stocking order for the commercial launch of DANYELZA in China during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Our Latin America region experienced commercial launches in Brazil and Mexico and our product revenue, net reflects an initial inventory stocking order in the nine months ended September 30, 2024. We recognized royalty revenue from our distribution partners of 4.1 million and 3.8 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. License revenue In January 2024, we accepted the price for DANYELZA in Brazil from the Brazilian Medicines Market Regulation Chamber, or CMED. We received a 0.5 million regulatory-based milestone payment in connection with the price approval from CMED in the nine months ended September 30, 2024. We recorded 0.5 million in license revenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 upon the September 2023 achievement of marketing authorization for DANYELZA in Mexico within the terms of the non-refundable license milestone under our sublicense agreement with Adium. Cost of Goods Sold Our cost of goods sold includes amounts related to materials, third-party contract manufacturing, third-party packaging services, freight, indirect labor costs, third-party royalties for approved products, and indirect overhead costs. Cost of goods sold was 7.4 million and 9.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Cost of goods sold included 37 lower vial volume in the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same period in 2023, and inventory write-downs totaling 0.8 million for two inventory batches that did not meet out quality specification in the nine months ended September 30, 2023.

 We define gross margin as net product revenues less cost of goods sold divided by net product revenues. Our gross margin was at 88 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 85 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Our gross margin increased in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 due to a favorable gross profit mix from revenue in our international regions, particular Eastern Asia that had an inventory order in the nine months ended September 30, 2023, and the above noted inventory write-down in the nine months ended September 30,2023. License Royalties License royalties include third-party royalty expenses related to license revenues that have been recognized. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, license royalties were related to MSK s share of licensing revenues. We incurred license royalty expense of 50,000 during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 in connection with the price approval from CMED in January 2024. We incurred license royalty expense of 50 thousand during the nine months ended September 30, 2023 related to licensing revenue recognized upon September 2023 achievement of marketing authorization for DANYELZA in Mexico within the terms of the non-refundable license milestone under our sublicense agreement with Adium. Research and Development We do not record our research and development expenses on a program by program or on a product-by-product basis as they primarily relate to personnel, research, manufacturing, license fees, and consumable costs, which are simultaneously deployed across multiple projects under development. These costs are included in the table below.

The 4.0 million decrease in research and development expenses is primarily driven by the recognition of 4.1 million in milestones and license acquisition costs during the nine months ended September 30, 2023, as noted below, a 1.4 million decrease in personnel costs, inclusive of stock-based compensation due to acceleration of stock-based compensation and other expenses in connection with the restructuring in January 2023, and a 0.8 million decrease in outsourced manufacturing, partially offset by a 3.0 million increase in clinical trials. We recognized 4.1 million in milestones and license acquisition costs related to our SADA License Agreement recognized in the three months ended September 30, 2023, as we determined certain time-based clinical milestones within the agreement were probable based on the availability of necessary data and the assessment of clinical progress in the third quarter of 2023. The 3.0 million increase in clinical trials is primarily driven by our increased SADA PRIT program clinical trial activities in 2024, which is partially offset by a decrease in outsourced manufacturing for SADA PRIT programs, which had increased production in the nine months ended September 30, 2023 in anticipation of the clinical trial activities in 2023 and 2024.

 Selling, General, and Administrative Selling, general, and administrative expenses were 42.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to 33.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The 8.5 million increase in selling, general, and administrative expenses was partially attributable to a net impact of 3.6 million related to the settlement of a shareholder class-action lawsuit in the nine months ended September 30, 2024, and an additional 0.2 million related to another legal settlement in the nine months ended September 30, 2024. Both settlements are described in NOTE 9 LICENSE AGREEMENT AND COMMITMENTS in the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 1. Financial Statements in this Form 10-Q. The increase also includes a 1.2 million increase related to our former Chief Financial Officer s separation and consulting agreements, 1.1 million increase in personnel cost inclusive of stock-based compensation and 0.8 million in professional and consulting fees. The agreements with our former Chief Financial Officer are described in NOTE 9 LICENSE AGREEMENT AND COMMITMENTS in the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 1. Financial Statements in this Form 10-Q. Interest and Other Income Interest and other income for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 3.0 million compared to 2.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Our interest and other income increased by 0.6 million primarily due to a 1.1 million of foreign currency transactional gains, partially offset by a 0.3 million decrease in interest earned on our cash and cash equivalents. Provision for Income Taxes Provision for income taxes was 0.6 million and 0.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The increase in provision for income taxes was primarily driven by certain U.S. state jurisdictions, and, to a lesser extent, limitation on utilization of U.S. federal net operating losses. Liquidity and Capital Resources Overview We have experienced significant use of cash to fund our net operating losses since inception. We expect our net operating losses to decrease in the future as revenues from our only approved product, DANYELZA, grow and contribute to funding our significant research expenses. Our net losses may fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter and year to year. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we had cash and cash equivalents of 68.1 million and 78.6 million, respectively. We estimate that our cash and cash equivalents, when combined with anticipated DANYELZA revenues, should support our operations into 2027. This estimate is based on our current business plan, and on assumptions that may prove to be wrong, and we could use our available capital resources sooner than we currently expect. This estimate assumes no income from new partnerships or other new business development activities, and no further development of the radiolabeled omburtamab program, the GD2-GD3 Vaccine or the CD33 bispecific antibody constructs. We cannot provide any assurance that we will be able to obtain additional capital from additional equity or debt financing, collaborations, licensing arrangements, or other sources. For an analysis of the type of contractual obligations and the relevant time periods for the related cash requirements of such obligations which may have a material impact on our liquidity and capital resources refer to NOTE 9 LICENSE AGREEMENTS AND COMMITMENTS in the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 1.

The 5.4 million decrease in cash used in operating activities was primarily due to a decrease in cash used for working capital of 7.9 million, which was primarily driven by an 8.9 million increase in accounts receivable collections, and a 4.4 million decrease in cash payments against accounts payables and accrued liabilities, during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the corresponding period in 2023, partially offset by 4.1 million of increased spending on inventories, and increased net loss of 2.4 million, primarily attributable to a payment of 3.6 million related to the settlement of a shareholder class-action lawsuit in the nine months ended September 30, 2024, and an additional legal settlement payment of 0.2 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2024. Both settlements are described in NOTE 9 LICENSE AGREEMENT AND COMMITMENTS in the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 1. Financial Statements in this Form 10-Q. Net Cash From Investing Activities We did not generate or use cash for investing activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. Net Cash From Financing Activities Net cash provided by financing activities was 3.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, which resulted from proceeds from exercised stock options. We did not generate or use cash for financing activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Funding Requirements Our cash and cash equivalents were 68.1 million as of September 30, 2024. We estimate that our cash and cash equivalents, when combined with anticipated DANYELZA revenues, should support operations into 2027. This estimate is based on our current business plan and on assumptions that may prove to be wrong, and we could use our available capital resources sooner than we currently expect. This estimate assumes no new partnerships or other new business development and no further development of the radiolabled omburtamab program, the GD2-GD3 Vaccine and the CD33 bispecific antibody constructs. We plan to advance the development of our pipeline programs, initiate new research and pre-clinical development efforts, seek marketing approval for any additional product candidates and indications that we successfully develop, and promote commercialization of approved products. Accordingly, we may need to obtain substantial

 additional funding in connection with our continuing operations. We cannot provide any assurance that we will be able to obtain additional capital from any new equity or debt financing, collaborations, licensing arrangements, or other sources. If we are unable to raise capital when needed or on attractive terms, we would be forced to delay, reduce or eliminate our research and development programs and/or commercialization efforts. Our future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including: the scope, progress, timing, costs and results of clinical trials for developing DANYELZA, and conducting pre-clinical studies and clinical trials for our SADA PRIT constructs; research and pre-clinical development efforts for any future product candidates that we may develop; our ability to enter into and the terms and timing of any collaborations, licensing agreements, distribution agreements or other arrangements; the achievement of milestones or occurrence of other developments that trigger payments under any collaboration or other agreements; the number of future product candidates that we may pursue and their development requirements; the outcome, timing and costs of seeking regulatory approvals; the costs of commercialization activities for any of our product candidates that may receive marketing approval to the extent such costs are not the responsibility of any future collaborators, including the costs and timing of establishing product sales, marketing, distribution and manufacturing capabilities; the amount and timing of future revenue, if any, received from commercial sales of our current and future product candidates upon any marketing approvals; proceeds received, if any, from monetization of any future PRVs; our headcount and associated costs as we focus our research and development efforts on additional indications for DANYELZA and our SADA PRIT Technology and expand our commercial infrastructure; the costs of preparing, filing and prosecuting patent applications, maintaining and protecting our intellectual property rights and defending against intellectual property related claims; and the costs of operating as a public company. 
 We may never generate the necessary data or results required to obtain additional marketing approval and achieve commercial success. Accordingly, we will need to continue to rely on additional financing to achieve our business objectives. We expect to finance our cash needs through a combination of securities offerings, debt financing, collaborations, strategic alliances and licensing arrangements. Further, adequate additional financing may not be available to us on acceptable terms, or at all. Contractual Obligations and Commitments A summary of the financial balances related to our material outstanding contractual commitments and the maximum financial impact related to milestones under those contractual obligations are included in NOTE 9 LICENSE AGREEMENTS AND COMMITMENTS in the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 1. Financial Statements in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.

 For a discussion of our material license agreements, see the section entitled Contractual Obligations and Commitments in Part II. Item 7. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023. Research and development is inherently uncertain and, should such research and development fail, the MSK License Agreement, the CD33 License Agreement, and SADA License Agreement are cancelable at our option. We have also considered the development risk and each party s termination rights under the three license agreements when considering whether any contingent payments, certain of which also contain time-based payment requirements, were probable. In addition, to the extent we enter into sublicense arrangements, we are obligated to pay to MSK a percentage of certain payments that we receive from sublicensees of the rights licensed to us by MSK, for which the percentage varies based upon the nature of the clinical or development milestone. To date, we have not entered into any sublicenses related to the CD33 License, the SADA License or the MabVax/Y-mAbs Sublicense. We have entered into sublicenses and distribution agreements with Swixx for the Eastern Europe region, SciClone for the Eastern Asia region, and Takeda for Israel in 2020, Adium for the Latin America region in 2021, WEP for the Western Europe region in 2022, TRPharm la Sanayi Ticaret A. ., TRPharm FZ-LLC for Turkey in 2024 and Nobelpharma Co. Ltd. for Japan in 2024, as allowed under the MSK License. Our failure to meet certain conditions under such arrangements could cause the related license to such licensed product to be canceled and could result in termination of the entire respective arrangement with MSK. In addition, we may terminate the MSK License, the CD33 License, or the SADA License with prior written notice to MSK. Known Trends, Geopolitical Events and Uncertainties On February 24, 2022, Russia launched a wide-ranging attack on Ukraine. Sanctions issued by the U.S. and other countries against Russia and related counter-sanctions issued by Russia have made it very difficult for us to operate in Russia, and we terminated our clinical trials of DANYELZA in Russia and put on hold our regulatory activities to obtain marketing authorization for DANYELZA in Russia subsequently to the attack. Although the long-term implication of the conflict between Ukraine and Russia remains uncertain at this time, it did not result in material impact on our financial results for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. On October 7, 2023, Hamas militants infiltrated Israel s southern border from the Gaza Strip and conducted a series of attacks on civilian and military targets. The ensuing conflict in the region may have an adverse impact on Takeda Israel s ability to sell our products and/or collect receivables from customers in the State of Israel pursuant to our exclusive licensing and distribution agreement with Takeda Israel, as well as on Takeda Israel s ability to pursue the development, marketing and/or commercialization of DANYELZA in the State of Israel, West Bank and Gaza Strip, which may ultimately have an adverse impact on the amount of royalties we receive. Although the long-term implication of the conflict in the Middle East remains uncertain at this time, it did not result in a material impact on our financial results for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. We face various worldwide health care changes that may continue to result in pricing pressures, including health care cost containment and government legislation. Inflation may also materially affect our business and corresponding financial position and cash flows. Inflationary factors, such as increases in the cost of our clinical trial materials and supplies, interest rates and overhead costs have and may continue to adversely affect our operating results.

 Item 4. Controls and Procedures. Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures Our management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, evaluated, as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report, the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13(a) 15(e) and 15d 15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the Exchange Act). Based on that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective at the reasonable assurance level as of September 30, 2024. In designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, management recognized that controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives. Further, because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that misstatements due to error or fraud will not occur or that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within the Company will be detected. Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting There was no change in our internal control over financial reporting, (as defined in Rules 13a 15(f) and 15d 15(f) under the Exchange Act) during the quarter ended September 30, 2024, that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. PART II - OTHER INFORMATION Item 1. Legal Proceedings. The information called for by this item is incorporated herein by reference to NOTE 9 LICENSE AGREEMENTS AND COMMITMENTS in the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 1. Financial Statements in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Item 1A. Risk Factors. Below we are providing, in supplemental form, changes to our risk factors from those previously disclosed in Part I, Item 1A of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 and in Part II, Item 1A of our Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q for the quarterly periods ended March 31, 2024 and June 30, 2024. Our risk factors disclosed in Part I, Item 1A of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, and in Part II, Item 1A of our Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q for the quarterly periods ended March 31, 2024 and June 30, 2024 provide additional discussion regarding these supplemental risks and we encourage you to read and carefully consider all of the risk factors disclosed in those sections, together with the below, for a more complete understanding of the risks and uncertainties material to our business . The commercial success of DANYELZA and of any future approved products will depend upon the degree of market acceptance by physicians, patients, third-party payors, and others in the medical community. The commercial success of DANYELZA, and of any future approved products, will depend in part on market acceptance by physicians, patients, third-party payors, and others in the medical community. For example, current cancer treatments like surgery, chemotherapy or radiation therapy are well-established in the medical community, and doctors may continue to rely on these treatments. DANYELZA was not listed in the treatment recommendations for neuroblastoma in the guideline published in July 2024 by the National Comprehensive Cancer Network, a none-profit alliance of 33 leading cancer care centers. If DANYELZA or any future approved products do not achieve an adequate level of acceptance, we may not generate significant revenues from sales of drugs and we may not become profitable. The degree of market acceptance of DANYELZA, and of any future product, if approved for commercial sale, will depend on a number of factors, including: 

 44 

Table of Contents 
 the efficacy and safety of the product and the prevalence and severity of any side effects; developing processes for the safe administration of the product, including long-term follow-up for all patients who receive the product; the potential advantages of the product compared to competitive therapies; whether the product is designated under physician treatment guidelines as a first-, second- or third-line therapy; our ability, or the ability of any potential future collaborators, to offer the product for sale at competitive prices; the product s convenience and ease of administration compared to alternative treatments and any requirement for in-patient versus out-patient administration; the willingness of the target patient population to try, and of physicians to prescribe, the product; limitations or warnings, including distribution or use restrictions contained in the product s approved labeling; the strength of sales, marketing and distribution support; changes in the standard of care for the targeted indications for the product; the willingness of the target patient populations to try new therapies and enroll in ongoing clinical trials, and of physicians to prescribe these therapies; relative convenience and ease of administration; availability and amount of coverage and reimbursement from government payors, managed care plans and other third-party payors; and the timing of competitive product introductions and other actions by competitors in the marketplace .

 33 

terminate it earlier) less the present value (similarly calculated) of all payments of rent to be received through the end of the Term (had there been no election to terminate it earlier) from a lessee, if any, of the Leased Premises at the time of calculation (and it shall be assumed for purposes of such calculations that (i) the amount of future Addi tional Rent due per year under this Agreement will be equal to the average Addi tional Rent per month due during the twelve (12) full calendar months immed iately preceding the date of any such calcula tion, increas ing annually at a rate of eight (8 percent compounded, (ii) if any calculation is made before the first anniversary of the end of the No Pass Through Period, the average Addi tional Rent due for any month after the end of the No Pass Through Period will be equal to eight and one-half (8 1/2 three (3 percent of the sum of the Base Year Operating Expenses, Base Year Taxes, Annual Amortized Capital Expenditures and Tenant Electric Charges (considered on an annual basis), (iii) if any calculation is made before the beginning of the Base Year, the sum of Base Year Taxes and Base Year Operational Expenses shall be assumed to be 5.00 per gross rentable square foot and (iv) if any calcula tion is made before the end of the Base Year, Base Year Taxes and Base Year Operational Expenses may be extrapolated based on the year to date experience of the Landlord), to the extent in excess of the present value, calculated in the same manner, of fair market rental value of the Leased Premises over the balance of the then remaining Term; and 23 . 2 . 3 the Landlord s reasonably estimated cost of demolishing any leasehold improvements to the Leased Premises if such demolition is necessary, in the Landlord s reasonable judgement, to lease the Leased Premises, or portions thereof, to others. 23 . 2 . 4 that amount, which as of the occurrence of the Event of Default, bears the same ratio to the costs, if any, incurred by the Landlord (and not paid by the Tenant) in building out the Leased Premises in accordance with section 5 of this Agreement as the number of months remaining in the Term (im mediately before the occurrence of the Event of Default) bears to the number of months in the entire Term (immediately before the occurrence of the Event of Default). 23 . 3 In the event the Landlord elects the right and remedy set forth in subsection 23.1.2 of this Agreement, Re-Leasing Damages shall be equal to the Rent less any rent actually and timely received by the Landlord from any lessee of the Leased Premises or any portion thereof, payable at the respective times that Rent is payable under the Agreement plus the cost, if any, to the Landlord of building out or otherwise preparing the Leased Premises for, and leasing the Leased Premises to, any such lessee. 23 . 4 In the event the Landlord elects the right and remedy set forth in subsection 23.1.3 of this Agreement, Holdover Damages shall mean damages at the rate per month or part thereof equal to the greater of: (a) one and one-half times one-twelfth (1/12) of the then Market Rental Rate plus all Additional Rent as set forth in this Agreement or (b) double the average amount of all payments of Rent due under this Agreement during each of the last twelve (12) full calendar months prior to the Landlord s so electing or, in the event the Term shall have terminated by expiration under subsec tion 24.1.1 of this Agreement, the last full twelve (12) calendar months of the Term, in either case payable in full on the first day of each holdover month or part thereof. The Tenant s obligations under this subsection 23.4 shall survive the expiration or earlier termination of this Agreement. 23 . 5 In connection with any summary proceed ing to disposs ess and remove the Tenant from the Leased Premises under subsect ion 23.1.3 of this Agreement, the Tenant hereby waives: 23 . 5 . 1 any notices for delivery of possession thereof, of termination, of demand for removal therefrom, of the cause therefor, to cease, to quit and all other notices that might other wise be required pursuant to 2A N.J.S.A. 18-53 et seq .; 23 . 5 . 2 any right the Tenant might otherwise have to transfer or remove such proceeding 
 34 

from the court (or the particular division or part of the court) or other forum in which it shall have been instituted by the Landlord to another court, division or part; and 23 . 5 .3 any right the Tenant might otherwise have to appeal any judgment awarding possession of the Leased Premises to the Landlord. 23 . 6 The enumeration of rights and remedies in this section 23 of the Agreement is not intended to be exhaustive or exclusive of any rights and remedies which might otherwise be available to the Landlord, or to force an election of one or more rights and remedies to the exclusion of others, concurrently, consecutively or sequential ly. On the contrary, each right and remedy enumer ated in this section 23 of the Agreement is intended to be cumulative with each other right and remedy enumerated in this section 23 of the Agreement and with each other right and remedy that might otherwise be available to the Landlord; and the selection of one or more of such rights and remedies at any time shall not be deemed to prevent resort to one or more others of such rights and remedies at the same time or a subsequent time, even with regard to the same occurrence sought to be remedied. 24 Termination of the Term . 24 . 1 The Term shall terminate upon the earliest of the following events to occur: 24 . 1 . 1 expiration of the Term; 24 . 1 . 2 in connection with a transaction contemplated by section 16 of this Agreement, the later of (a) the vesting of the acquiring party s right to possession or (b) the Tenant s vacating the Leased Premises; 24 . 1 . 3 under the circumstances contemplated by subsection 15.1 of this Agreement: 24.1.3.1 upon the destruction of the Building or upon the Building s sustaining such degree of damage that the Landlord intends not to rebuild the Building (which termination shall be effective as of the date of the subject casualty); 24.1.3.2 upon the Landlord s giving timely and otherwise proper notice of its election to cancel this Agreement, as contemplated by subsection 15.1.1 or subsection 15.1.2 of this Agreement; 24.1.3.3 upon the Tenant s giving timely and otherwise proper notice of its election to cancel this Agreement, as contemplated by subsection 15.1.2 of this Agreement; 24.1.3.4 upon the Tenant s giving prompt notice of the failure of the Landlord to give, on a timely basis, either notice contemplated by subsection 15.1 of this Agreement and that the Tenant desires termination of the Term (which termination shall be effective as of the date of the subject casualty with respect to those portions of the Leased Premises rendered unus able by the subject casualty and as of the date of the Tenant s giving notice with respect to those portions of the Leased Premises which were not rendered unusable by the subject casual ty); or 24.1.3.5 under the circumstances contemplated by subsection 15.1.2 of this Agreement, upon the expiration of forty five (45) additional days (without the Landlord s completion of its restoration obligation in the interim) after the Tenant shall have given prompt notice that the Landlord has not restored the Leased Premises on a timely basis and that the Tenant desires termination of the Term (which termination shall be effective as of the date of the subject casualty with respect to those portions of 
 35 

the Leased Premises rendered unusable by the subject casualty and as of the date of the Tenant s giving notice with respect to those portions of the Leased Premises which were not rendered unusable by the subject casualty); 24 . 1 . 4 the effective date of any election by the Landlord under subsection 17.3.3 of this Agreement in response to the Tenant s notice of the Tenant s desire to assign this Agreement or, as to such portion proposed to be sublet, to sublet a portion of the Leased Premises; or 24 . 1 . 5 the effective date of any election by the Landlord to terminate the Term under subsection 23.1.1 of this Agreement. 24 . 2 No termination of the Term shall have the effect of releasing the Tenant from any obligation or liability theretofore incurred and, until the Tenant shall have surrendered the Leased Premises in accordance with section 21 of this Agreement, from any obligation or liability thereafter incurred. 25 Mortgage and Underlying Lease Priority . This Agreement and the estate, interest and rights hereby created for the benefit of the Tenant are, and shall always be, subordinate to any mortgage (other than a mortgage created by the Tenant or a sale, transfer or other disposition by the Tenant in the nature of a security interest in violat ion of subsections 17.1.4 and 22.5, respective ly, of this Agree ment) already or afterwards placed on the Carnegie Center Complex, the Proper ty, the Common Facilities, the Building or any estate or interest therein, includ ing, without limiting the generality of the foregoing, any new mortgage or any mortgage exten sion, renewal, modification, consolidat ion, replacement, supplement or substitu tion. This Agreement and the estate, interest and rights hereby created for the benefit of the Tenant are, and shall always be, subordinate to any ground lease already or afterwards made with regard to the Carnegie Center Complex, the Property, the Common Facilities, the Building or any estate or interest therein, includ ing, without limiting the generality of the foregoing, any new ground lease or any ground lease exten sion, renewal, modificat ion, consolidation, replace ment, supple ment or substitution. The provisions of this section 25 shall be self-effecting; and no further instrument shall be necessary to effect any such subordination. Never theless, the Tenant hereby consents that any mortga gee or mortgagee s suc cessor in interest may, at any time and from time to time, by notice to the Tenant, subord inate its mortgage to the estate and interest created by this Agreement; and upon the giving of such notice, the subject mortgage shall be deemed subordinate to the estate and interest created by this Agreement regardless of the respec tive times of execution or delivery of either or of recording the subject mortgage. 26 Transfer by Landlord . 26 . 1 The Landlord shall have the right at any time and from time to time to sell, transfer, lease or otherwise dispose of the Carnegie Center Complex, the Property, the Common Facil ities or the Building or any of the Landlord s inter ests therein, or to assign this Agreement or any of the Land lord s rights thereunder. 26 . 2 Upon giving notice of the occurrence of any transac tion contemplated by subsection 26.1 of this Agree ment, the Landlord shall thereby be relieved of any obligation that might otherwise exist under this Agreement with respect to periods subsequent to the effective date of any such transac tion. If, in connection with any transac tion contemplated by subsection 26.1 of this Agreement the Landlord transfers, or makes allowance for, any Security Deposit of the Tenant and gives notice of that fact to the Tenant, the Landlord shall thereby be relieved of any further obligation to the Tenant with regard to any such Security Deposit; and the Tenant shall look solely to the transferee with respect to any such Security Deposit. 26 . 3 In the event of the occurrence of any transaction contemplated by subsection 26.1 of this 
 36 

Agreement the Tenant, upon written request therefor from the transferee, shall attorn to and become the tenant of such transferee upon the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement. 26 . 4 Notwithstanding anything to the contrary that may be set forth in subsections 26.1, 26.2 and 26.3 of this Agreement, in the event any mortgage contemplated by section 25 of this Agreement is enforced by the respective mortgagee pursuant to remedies provided in the mortgage or otherwise provided by law or equity and any person succeeds to the interest of the Landlord as a result of, or in connection with, any such enforce ment, the Tenant shall, upon the request of such successor in interest, automatically attorn to and become the Tenant of such successor in interest without any change in the terms or provis ions of this Agreement, except that such successor in interest shall not be bound by any payment of Basic Rent or Addit ional Rent (exclusive of prepay ments in the nature of a Security Deposit) for more than one month in advance; and, upon the request of such successor in interest, the Tenant shall execute, acknowledge and deliver any reasonable instru ment(s) confirming such attornment. 26 . 5 If this Agreement and the estate, interest and rights hereby created for the benefit of the Tenant are ever subject and subordinate to any ground lease contemplated by section 25 of this Agreement: 26 . 5 . 1 upon the expiration or earlier terminat ion of the term of any such ground lease before the termination of the Term under this Agreement, the Tenant shall attorn to, and become the Tenant of, the lessor under any such ground lease and recognize such lessor as the Landlord under this Agreement for the balance of the Term; and 26 . 5 . 2 such expiration or earlier termination of the term of any such ground lease shall have no effect on the Term under this Agreement. 26.6 Notwithstanding anything to the contrary that may be set forth in section 25 of this Agreement, with respect to any mortgages or ground leases contemplated by section 25 of this Agreement, the Landlord shall use its reasonable commercial efforts to obtain from each such mortgagee and ground lessor a commercially reasonable form of non-disturbance, attornment and subordination agreement including a provision to the effect that, in the event of enforcement of any remedies provided in the respective mortgage or ground lease or otherwise, so long as an Event of Default shall not have occurred, the Tenant shall not be disturbed in its possession of the Leased Premises in accordance with this Agreement, and which does not include any provision increasing the Tenant s obligations otherwise due, or diminishing the Tenant s rights otherwise available, in either case in accordance with this Agreement. Any processing or other fee that the mortgagee or ground lessor may charge and any reasonable legal expense that the Landlord may incur in connection with performing its obligations under this subsection shall be paid by the Tenant. 27 Indemnification . 27 . 1 To the fullest extent permitted by law, the Tenant waives any right to contribution against the Landlord Parties and agrees to indemnify and save harmless the Landlord Parties from and against all claims of whatever nature by a third party arising from or claimed to have arisen from (i) any act, omission or negligence of the Tenant Parties; (ii) any accident, injury or damage whatsoever caused to any person, or to the property of any person, occurring in or about the Leased Premises from the earlier of (a) the date on which any Tenant first enters the Leased Premises for any reason or (b) the Commencement Date, and thereafter throughout and until the end of the Term, and after the end of the Term for so long after the end of the Term as a material amount of the Tenant s Property remains in the Leased Premises so as to create a reasonable risk of casualty or damage, or the Tenant or anyone acting by, through or under the Tenant may use, be in occupancy any part of, or have access to the Leased 
 37 

Premises or any portion thereof; (iii) any accident, injury or damage whatsoever occurring outside the Leased Premises but within the Building, within the Common Facilities, on the Property or within the Carnegie Center Complex, where such accident, injury or damage results, or is claimed to have resulted, from any act, omission or negligence on the part of any of the Tenant Parties; or (iv) any breach of this Agreement by the Tenant; all to the extent not arising solely out of Landlord s gross negligence or willful misconduct. The Tenant shall pay such indemnified amounts as they are incurred by the Landlord Parties. This indemnification shall not be construed to deny or reduce any other rights or obligations of indemnity that a Landlord Party may have under this Agreement. The indemnification rights of the Landlord Parties provided in this Agreement are their exclusive indemnification rights with respect to this Agreement. The Landlord Parties waive any additional rights to indemnification they may have against the Tenant Parties with respect to this Agreement under common law. 27 . 2 In the event that the Tenant breaches any of its indemnity obligations hereunder: (i) the Tenant shall pay to the Landlord Parties all liabilities, loss, cost, or expense (including reasonable attorney s fees) incurred as a result of said breach, and the reasonable value of time expended by the Landlord Parties as a result of said breach; and (ii) the Landlord Parties may deduct and offset from any amounts due to the Tenant under this Agreement any amounts owed by the Tenant pursuant to this section 27. 27 . 3 The indemnification obligations under this section 27 shall not be limited in any way by any limitation on the amount or type of damages, compensation or benefits payable by or for the Tenant or any subtenant or other occupant of the Leased Premises under workers compensation acts, disability benefit acts, or other employee benefit acts. The Tenant waives any immunity from or limitation on its indemnity or contribution liability to the Landlord Parties based upon such acts. 27.4 The Tenant shall require its subtenants and other occupants of the Leased Premises to provide similar indemnities to the Landlord Parties in a form reasonably acceptable to the Landlord. 27.5 The terms of this section 27 shall survive any termination or expiration of this Agreement. 27.6 The foregoing indemnity and hold harmless agreement shall include indemnity for all costs, expenses and liabilities (including, without limitation, reasonable attorneys fees and disbursements) incurred by the Landlord Parties in connection with any such claim or any action or proceeding brought thereon, and the defense thereof. In addition, in the event that any action or proceeding shall be brought against one or more Landlord Parties by reason of any such claim, the Tenant, upon request from the Landlord Party, shall resist and defend such action or proceeding on behalf of the Landlord Party by counsel appointed by the Tenant s insurer (if such claim is covered by insurance without reservation) or otherwise by counsel reasonably satisfactory to the Landlord Party. The Landlord Parties shall not be bound by any compromise or settlement of any such claim, action or proceeding without the prior written consent of such Landlord Parties. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, neither party shall in any event be liable to the other for indirect or consequential damages. 27.7 The Tenant agrees to use and occupy the Leased Premises, and to use such other portions of the Building, the Property and the Carnegie Center Complex as the Tenant is given the right to use by this Agreement, at the Tenant s own risk. The Landlord Parties shall not be liable to the Tenant Parties for any damage, injury, loss, compensation, or claim (including, but not limited to, claims for the interruption of or loss to a Tenant s business) based on, arising out of or resulting from any cause whatsoever, including, but not limited to, repairs to any portion of the Leased Premises, the Building, the Property or the Carnegie Center Complex, any fire, robbery, theft, mysterious disappearance, or any other crime or casualty, the actions of any tenants of Other Leased Premises or of any other person or persons, or any leakage in any part or portion of the Leased Premises, the Common Facilities, the Building or the 
 38 

Property, or from water, rain or snow that may leak into, or flow from any part of the Leased Premises, the Common Facilities, the Building or the Property, or from drains, pipes or plumbing fixtures in the Building or on the Property. Any goods, property or personal effects stored or placed in or about the Leased Premises shall be at the sole risk of the Tenant, and neither the Landlord Parties nor their insurers shall in any manner be held responsible therefor. The Landlord Parties shall not be responsible or liable to a Tenant, or to those claiming by, through or under a Tenant, for any loss or damage that may be occasioned by or through the acts or omissions of persons occupying adjoining premises or any part of the premises adjacent to or connecting with the Leased Premises or any part of the Building or otherwise. The provisions of this section shall be applicable to the fullest extent permitted by law, and until the expiration or earlier termination of the Term, and during such further period as a material amount of the Tenant s Property remains in the Leased Premises so as to create a reasonable risk of casualty or damage, or the Tenant or anyone acting by, through or under the Tenant may use, or be in occupancy of any part of, or have access to the Leased Premises or of the Building. 27.8 Subject to the limitations set forth in subsections 14.12, 27.7 and 28.3 of this Agreement, and to the extent not resulting from any intentional act, omission, negligence or willful misconduct of the Tenant or its contractors, licensees, invitees, agents, servants or employees, the Landlord agrees to indemnify and save harmless the Tenant from and against any claim by a third party arising from any injury to any person occurring in the Leased Premises, in the Building, on the Property or in the Carnegie Center Complex after the date that possession of the Leased Premises is first delivered to Tenant and until the expiration or earlier termination of the Term, to the extent such injury results from the negligence or willful misconduct of the Landlord or the Landlord s employees, or from any breach or default by the Landlord in the performance or observance of its covenants or obligations under this Agreement; provided, however, that in no event shall the aforesaid indemnity render the Landlord responsible or liable for any loss or damage to fixtures, personal property or other property of the Tenant, and the Landlord shall in no event be liable for any of Tenant s indirect or consequential damages. The Tenant shall provide notice of any such third party claim to the Landlord as soon as practicable. The Landlord shall have the right, but not the duty, to defend the claim. The provisions of this subsection 27.8 shall not be applicable to (i) the holder of any mortgage now or hereafter on the Property or the Building (whether or not such holder shall be a mortgagee in possession of or shall have exercised any rights under a conditional, collateral or other assignment of leases and/or rents respecting the Property or the Building), or (ii) any person acquiring title as a result of, or subsequent to, a foreclosure of any such mortgage or a deed in lieu of foreclosure, except to the extent of liability insurance maintained by either of the foregoing. 28 Parties Liability . 28 . 1 None of the following occurrences shall constitute a breach of this Agreement by the Landlord, a termination of the Term, an active or con structive eviction or an occurrence requiring an abatement of Rent: 28 . 1 . 1 the inability of the Landlord to provide any utility or service to be provided by the Landlord, as described in section 8 of this Agreement which is due to causes beyond the Landlord s control, or to necessary or advisable improvements, maintenance, repairs or emergency, so long as the Landlord uses reasonable efforts and diligence under the circum stances to restore the interrupted service or utility; 28 . 1 . 2 any improvement, modification, altera tion or other change made to the Carnegie Center Complex, the Property, the Building or the Common Facili ties by the Landlord consis tently with the Land lord s obligations set forth in subsection 13.2 of this Agree ment; and 
 39 

28 . 1 . 3 any change in any Federal, state or local law or ordinance. 28 . 2 In the event Landlord or Tenant is in any way delayed, impeded, interrupted, stopped or prevented from performing any of its obligations under this Lease (except, with respect to Tenant, its obligations to give notice with respect to any option explicitly set forth in this Lease, to surrender the Premises as and when required by this Lease and to maintain insurance as required by this Lease) due to fire, casualty, act of God, epidemic, pandemic, breach of cyber security, strike, lockout, labor dispute or disruption, disruption in the supply chain or other inability by the exercise of reasonable diligence to obtain materials or parts, act of war, terrorism, breakdown, accident, civil commotion, laws, regulations, restrictions, orders, quarantines, construction moratoria or other action or inaction by any local, state or federal governmental or health authority (including, without limitation, any shelter-in-place orders, stay at home orders, occupancy restrictions or limitations or any restriction on travel related to the forgoing that preclude or restrict Landlord or Tenant or their agents, contractors or employees from accessing or using the Premises), or any other cause or event to the extent beyond such party s reasonable control regardless of whether such cause or event is (i) related to the specifically enumerated causes or events in this paragraph or (ii) foreseeable or unforeseeable (each, an event of Force Majeure ), such cause or event of Force Majeure shall excuse the performance of the obligation of such party under this Lease for a period equal to such delay, impediment, interruption, stoppage or prevention, including the time necessary to repair any damage caused by the Force Majeure event, if any. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Lease and for avoidance of doubt, in no event will (i) any party be entitled to claim Force Majeure due to any act or inaction within its reasonable control, (ii) financial hardship constitute an event of Force Majeure nor (iii) any event of Force Majeure in any way (a) affect, excuse, suspend, reduce or abate the obligation of Tenant to timely pay all rent and other charges payable by Tenant pursuant to the terms of this Lease, except as expressly provided in Section 14 and Section 15. 28 . 3 In the event the Landlord is an individ ual, partner ship, joint venture, association or a participant in a joint tenancy or tenancy in common, the Landlord, the partners, venturers, members and joint owners shall not have any personal liability or obligation under or in connection with this Agree ment or the Tenant s use and occupancy of the Leased Premises; but recourse shall be limited exclusively to the Landlord s interest in the Building. 28 . 4 If, at any time during the Term, the payment or collection of any Rent otherwise due under this Agreement shall be limited, frozen or otherwise subjected to a moratorium by applicable law, and such limitation, freeze or other morator ium shall subsequently be lifted, whether before or after the terminat ion of the Term, such aggregate amount of Rent as shall not have been paid or collected during the Term on account of any such limita tion, freeze or other moratorium, shall thereupon be due and payable at once. There shall be added to the maximum period of any other wise applic able statute of limitation the entire period during which any such limitation, freeze or other morator ium shall have been in effect. 28 . 5 If this Agreement is executed by more than one person as the Tenant, their liability under this Agreement and in connection with the use and occupancy of the Leased Premises shall be joint and several. 28 . 6 In the event any rate of interest, or other charge in the nature of interest, calculated as set forth in this Agreement would lead to the imposition of a rate of interest in excess of the maximum rate permitted by applicable usury law, only the maximum rate permitted shall be charged and collected. 28 . 7 The rule of construction that any ambiguities that may be contained in any contract shall be construed against the party drafting the contract shall be inapplicable in construing this Agreement.
