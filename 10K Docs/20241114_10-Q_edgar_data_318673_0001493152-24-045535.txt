Accounting
Standards Issued But Not Yet Adopted 

ASU
No. 2018-12: Financial Services Insurance (Topic 944): Targeted Improvements to the Accounting for Long-Duration Contracts 
 Issued in August 2018, ASU 2018-12 is intended to improve the timeliness of recognizing changes in the liability for future
policy benefits on traditional long-duration contracts by requiring that assumptions be updated after contract inception and by modifying
the rate used to discount future cash flows. The standard is aimed at improving the accounting for certain market-based options or guarantees
associated with deposit or account balance contracts, simplifying amortization of deferred acquisition costs while improving and expanding
required disclosures. ASU No. 2018-12 is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2024 and interim reporting
periods beginning after December 15, 2025. The Company will adopt the standard commencing with its annual reporting period ending December
31, 2025. The Company is nearing completion of its analysis and implementation of the new standard, including the identification of cohorts,
system updates, and design. The Company has engaged its team of actuaries, accountants, and systems specialists and consulted external
system providers as part of the implementation. The Company is in the process of estimating the impact of the new guidance on the consolidated
financial statements.

2) Recent Accounting Pronouncements (Continued) 

ASU
No. 2023-09: Income Taxes (Topic 740): Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures Issued in December 2023, ASU
2023-09 requires that public business entities, on an annual basis: (i) disclose specific categories in the rate reconciliation and (ii)
provide additional information for reconciling items that meet a quantitative threshold. In addition, the amendments in this update require
that all entities disclose on an annual basis the following information about income taxes paid: (i) the amount of income taxes paid
(net of refunds received) disaggregated by federal (national), state, and foreign taxes and (ii) the amount of income taxes paid (net
of refunds received) disaggregated by individual jurisdictions in which income taxes paid (net of refunds received) is equal to or greater
than 5 percent of total income taxes paid (net of refunds received). ASU 2023-09 is effective for the Company beginning on January 1,
2025. The Company is in the process of estimating the impact of the new guidance on the consolidated financial statements. 

ASU
No. 2023-07: Segment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures Issued in November
2023, ASU 2023-07 requires enhanced disclosures about significant segment expenses. The key amendments include: (i) disclosures on significant
segment expenses that are regularly provided to the chief operating decision maker (CODM) and included within each reported measure of
segment profit or loss on an annual and interim basis; (ii) disclosures on an amount for other segment items by reportable segment and
a description of its composition on an annual and interim basis. The other segment items category is the difference between segment revenue
less the significant expenses disclosed and each reported measure of segment profit or loss; (iii) providing all annual disclosures on
a reportable segment s profit or loss and assets currently required by FASB ASC Topic 280, Segment Reporting in interim periods;
and (iv) specifying the title and position of the CODM. ASU 2023-07 is effective for the Company for annual periods beginning January
1, 2024 and interim periods beginning January 1, 2025. The Company is in the process of estimating the impact of the new guidance on
the consolidated financial statements. 

The
Company has reviewed other recent accounting pronouncements and has determined that they will not significantly impact the Company s
results of operations or financial position.

Evaluation
of Allowance for Credit Losses 

See
Note 2 regarding the adoption of ASU 2016-13. 

On
a quarterly basis, the Company evaluates its fixed maturity securities classified as available for sale to identify any potential credit
losses. This evaluation includes a review of current ratings by the National Association of Insurance Commissions NAIC and other industry rating agencies. Securities with a rating of 1 or 2 are considered investment grade and are not reviewed for credit
loss unless current market data or recent company news could lead to a credit downgrade. Securities with ratings of 3 to 5 are evaluated
for credit loss. The evaluation involves assessing all facts and circumstances surrounding each security including, but not limited to,
historical values, interest payment history, projected earnings, and revenue growth rates as well as a review of the reason for a downgrade
in the NAIC rating. Based on the analysis of a security that is rated 3 to 5, a determination is made whether the security will likely
make interest and principal payments in accordance with the terms of the financial instrument. Securities with a rating of 6 are automatically
determined to be impaired and a credit loss is recognized in earnings. 

Where
the decline in fair value of fixed maturity securities is attributable to changes in market interest rates or to factors such as market
volatility, liquidity and spread widening, and the Company anticipates recovery of all contractual or expected cash flows, the Company
does not consider these securities to have credit loss because the Company does not intend to sell these securities and it is not more
likely than not the Company will be required to sell these securities before a recovery of amortized cost, which may be at maturity. 

If
the Company intends to sell a fixed maturity security or if it is more likely than not that the Company will be required to sell a security
before recovery of its amortized cost basis, a credit loss has occurred and the difference between the amortized cost and the fair value
that relates to the expected credit loss is recognized as a loss in earnings, included in gains (losses) on investments and other assets
on the condensed consolidated statements of earnings. 

If
the Company does not intend to sell a debt security and it is less likely than not that the Company will be required to sell the debt
security but the Company also does not expect to recover the entire amortized cost basis of the security, a credit loss is recognized
in earnings for the amount of the expected credit loss with a corresponding allowance for credit losses as a contra-asset account. The
credit loss is included in gains (losses) on investments and other assets on the condensed consolidated statements of earnings. The recognized
credit loss is limited to the total unrealized loss on the security due to a change in credit. 

Amounts
on available for sale fixed maturities that are deemed to be uncollectible are written off and removed from the allowance for credit
loss. A write-off may also occur if the Company intends to sell a security or when it is more likely than not that the Company will be
required to sell the security before the recovery of its amortized cost. 

The
Company does not measure a credit loss allowance on accrued interest receivable, included in accrued investment income on the condensed
consolidated balance sheets, as the Company writes off any accrued interest receivable balance to net investment income in a timely manner
(after 90 days) when the Company has concerns regarding collectability.

Quality Indicators 

The
NAIC assigns designations to fixed maturity securities. These designations range from Class 1 (highest quality) to Class 6 (lowest quality).
The NAIC designations are utilized by insurers in preparing their annual statutory statements. NAIC Class 1 and 2 are considered investment
grade while the NAIC Class 3 through 6 designations are considered non-investment grade. Based on the NAIC designations, the Company
had and of its fixed maturity securities rated investment grade as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively.

Mortgage
Loans Held for Investment 

Mortgage
loans held for investment consist of first and second mortgages. The mortgage loans bear interest at rates ranging from to ,
maturity dates range from to years and the loans are secured by real estate. 

Concentrations
of credit risk arise when a number of mortgage loan debtors have similar economic characteristics that would cause their ability to meet
contractual obligations to be similarly affected by changes in economic conditions. Although the Company has a diversified mortgage loan
portfolio consisting of residential mortgages, commercial loans and residential construction loans and requires collateral on all real
estate exposures, a substantial portion of the relevant debtors ability to honor obligations is dependent upon the economic stability
of the geographic region in which the debtors do business or are employed. As of September 30, 2024, the Company had , , , 
and , of its mortgage loans from borrowers located in the states of Utah, Florida, Texas, Arizona, and California, respectively. As
of December 31, 2023, the Company had , , , and of its mortgage loans from borrowers located in the states of Utah, Florida,
California, Texas, and Arizona respectively. 

Mortgage
loans held for investment are carried at their unpaid principal balances adjusted for net deferred fees, charge-offs, premiums, discounts,
and the related allowance for credit losses. Interest income is included in net investment income on the condensed consolidated statements
of earnings and is recognized when earned. The Company defers related material loan origination fees, net of related direct loan origination
costs, and amortizes the net fees over the terms of the loans. Origination fees are included in net investment income on the condensed
consolidated statements of earnings. 

Mortgage
loans are secured by the underlying property and require an appraisal at the time of underwriting and funding. Generally, the Company
requires that loans not exceed 80 of the fair market value of the respective loan collateral. For loans of more than 80 of the fair
market value of the respective loan collateral, additional collateral or mortgage insurance by an approved third-party insurer is required.

Evaluation
of Allowance for Credit Losses 

See
Note 2 regarding the adoption of ASU 2016-13. 

The
allowance for credit losses is a valuation account that is deducted from the amortized cost basis of the Company s mortgage loans
held for investment to present the net amount expected to be collected. The Company reports in net earnings, as a credit loss expense,
the amount necessary to adjust the allowance for credit losses for the Company s current estimate of expected credit losses on
mortgage loans held for investment. This credit loss expense is included in other expenses on the condensed consolidated statements of
earnings. 

Once
a mortgage loan is past due 90 days, it is the policy of the Company to end the accrual of interest income on the loan and reverse any
interest income that had been accrued. Given this policy, the Company does not measure a credit loss allowance on accrued interest receivable.
Accrued interest receivable is included in accrued investment income on the condensed consolidated balance sheets. Payments received
for mortgage loans on a non-accrual status are recognized when received. The interest income recognized from payments received for mortgage
loans on a non-accrual status was immaterial. Accrual of interest resumes if a mortgage loan is brought current. Interest not accrued
on these loans totaled approximately and as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. 

The
Company measures expected credit losses based on the fair value of the collateral when the Company determines that foreclosure is probable.
When a mortgage loan becomes delinquent, the Company proceeds to foreclose and all expenses for foreclosure are expensed as incurred.
Once foreclosed, the property is classified as real estate held for investment or held for sale. 

To
determine the allowance for credit losses, the Company has segmented its mortgage loans held for investment by loan type. The Company s
loan types are commercial, residential, and residential construction. The inherent risks within the portfolio vary depending upon the
loan type as follows: 

Commercial
 - Underwritten in accordance with the Company s policies to determine the borrower s ability to repay the obligation
as agreed. Commercial loans are made primarily based on the underlying collateral supporting the loan. Accordingly, the repayment of
a commercial loan depends primarily on the collateral and its ability to generate income and secondarily on the borrower s (or
guarantor s) ability to repay. 

Commercial
loans are evaluated for credit loss by analyzing common metrics that are predictors for future credit losses such as debt service coverage
ratio DSCR ), loan to value LTV ), local market conditions, borrower quality, and underlying collateral.
The fair value of the underlying collateral is based on a third-party appraisal of the property at origination of the loan. The fair
value is assessed if the loan becomes 90 days delinquent. The Company uses these metrics to pool similar loans. The allowance for credit
losses is based on estimates, historical experience, probability of loss, value of the underlying collateral, and other factors that
affect the collectability of the loan. The Company applies a future loss factor to the outstanding balance of each group to arrive at
the allowance for credit losses. 

Residential
 These loans are secured by first and second mortgages on single-family dwellings. The borrower s ability to repay is
sensitive to the life events and the general economic condition of the region. Where loan to value exceeds 80 , the loan is generally
guaranteed by private mortgage insurance, the FHA, or VA. 

Residential
loans are evaluated for credit loss by using relevant available information from both internal and external sources. Among other things,
the Company uses its historical delinquency information and considers current and forecasted economic conditions. External sources include
a monthly analysis of its residential portfolio by a third party. The third party uses the Company s current loan data and runs
it through various models to project cash flows and provide a projected life of loan loss. The models consider loan features such as
loan type, loan to value, payment status, age, and current property values. Analyzing the information from the various sources allows
the Company to arrive at the allowance for credit losses.

Residential
construction (including land acquisition and development) These loans are underwritten in accordance with the Company s
underwriting policies, which include a financial analysis of the builders, borrowers (guarantors), construction cost estimates, and independent
appraisal valuations, and factor in estimates of the value of construction projects upon completion. Construction loans generally involve
the disbursement of substantial funds over a short period of time with repayment substantially dependent upon the success of the completed
project and the ability of the borrower to secure long-term financing. 

Additionally,
land acquisition and development loans are underwritten in accordance with the Company s underwriting policies, which include independent
appraisal valuations as well as the estimated value associated with the land upon completion of development into finished lots. These
loans are of a higher risk than other mortgage loans due to their ultimate repayment being sensitive to general economic conditions,
availability of long-term or construction financing, and interest rate sensitivity. 

Residential
construction mortgage loans are evaluated for credit loss by considering historical activity and current housing market trends to arrive
at a per loan basis point allowance that is recognized at loan origination and for subsequent draws. The per loan basis point is reviewed
at least annually or as loan losses or market trends require.

reportable business segments: life insurance, cemetery and mortuary, and mortgage. The Company s life insurance
segment consists of life insurance premiums and operating expenses from the sale of insurance products sold by the Company s independent
agency force and net investment income derived from investing policyholders and segment surplus funds. The Company s cemetery and
mortuary segment consists of revenues and operating expenses from the sale of at-need cemetery and mortuary merchandise and services
at its mortuaries and cemeteries, pre-need sales of cemetery spaces after collection of 10 or more of the purchase price and the net
investment income from investing segment surplus funds. The Company s mortgage segment consists of fee income and expenses from
the origination of residential mortgage loans and interest earned and interest expenses from warehousing loans held for sale. 

Measurement
of Segment Profit or Loss and Segment Assets 

The
accounting policies of the reportable segments are the same as those described in the Significant Accounting Principles of the Form 10-K
for the year ended December 31, 2023. Intersegment revenues are recorded at cost plus an agreed upon intercompany profit, and are eliminated
upon consolidation. 

Factors
Management Used to Identify the Enterprise s Reportable Segments 

The
Company s reportable segments are business units that are managed separately due to the different products provided and the need
to report separately to the various regulatory jurisdictions. The Company regularly reviews the quantitative thresholds and other criteria
to determine when other business segments may need to be reported.

8) Fair Value of Financial Instruments (Continued) 

The
items shown under Level 3 are valued as follows: 

Loans
Held for Sale : The Company elected the fair value option for loans held for sale. The fair value is based on quoted market prices,
when available. When a quoted market price is not readily available, the Company uses the market price from its last sale of similar
assets. Fair value is often difficult to determine in volatile markets and may contain significant unobservable inputs. 

Loan
Commitments and Forward Sale Commitments : The Company s mortgage segment enters loan commitments with potential borrowers
and forward sale commitments to sell loans with third-party investors. The Company also uses a hedging strategy for these transactions.
A loan commitment binds the Company to lend funds to a qualified borrower at a specified interest rate and within a specified period,
generally up to 30 days after issuance of the loan commitment. Loan commitments are defined to be derivatives under GAAP and are recognized
at fair value on the consolidated balance sheets with changes in their fair values recorded in current earnings. 

The
Company estimates the fair value of a loan commitment based on the change in estimated fair value of the underlying mortgage loan, quoted
MBS prices, estimates of the fair value of mortgage servicing rights, and an estimate of the probability that the mortgage loan will
fund within the terms of the commitment. The change in fair value of the underlying mortgage loan is measured from the date the loan
commitment is issued. Following issuance, the value of a mortgage loan commitment can be either positive or negative depending upon the
change in value of the underlying mortgage loans. Fallout rates and other factors from the Company s recent historical data are
used to estimate the quantity and value of mortgage loans that will be funded within the terms of the commitments. 

Impaired
Mortgage Loans Held for Investment : The Company believes that the fair value of these nonperforming loans will approximate the
unpaid principal balance expected to be recovered based on the fair value of the underlying collateral. For residential and commercial
properties, the collateral value is estimated by obtaining an independent appraisal. The appraisal typically considers comparable sales
in the area, property condition, and potential rental income that could be generated (particularly for commercial properties). For residential
construction loans, the collateral is typically incomplete, so the fair value is estimated as the replacement cost using data from a
provider of building cost information to the real estate construction. 

Impaired
Real Estate Held for Investment : The Company believes that in an orderly market, fair value will approximate the replacement
cost of a home and the rental income provides a cash flow stream for investment analysis. The Company believes the highest and best use
of the properties are as income producing assets since it is the Company s intent to hold the properties as rental properties,
matching the income from the investment in rental properties with the funds required for future estimated policy claims. 

It
should be noted that for replacement cost, when determining the fair value of real estate held for investment, the Company uses a provider
of building cost information to the real estate construction industry. For the investment analysis, the Company uses market data based
upon its real estate operation experience and projected the present value of the net rental income over seven years. The Company also
considers area comparable properties and property conditions when determining fair value. 

In
addition to this analysis performed by the Company, the Company depreciates Real Estate Held for Investment. This depreciation reduces
the book value of these properties and lessens the exposure to the Company from further deterioration in real estate values. 

Mortgage
Servicing Rights : The Company initially recognizes Mortgage Servicing Rights MSRs at their estimated fair values
derived from the net cash flows associated with the servicing contracts, where the Company assumes the obligation to service the loan
in the sale transaction.

The
methods, assumptions and significant valuation techniques and inputs used to estimate the fair value of these financial instruments are
summarized as follows: 

Mortgage
Loans Held for Investment : The estimated fair value of the Company s mortgage loans held for investment is determined using
various methods. The Company s mortgage loans are grouped into three categories: Residential, Residential Construction and Commercial.
When estimating the expected future cash flows, it is assumed that all loans will be held to maturity, and any loans that are non-performing
are evaluated individually for impairment. 

Residential
 The estimated fair value is determined through a combination of discounted cash flows (estimating expected future cash flows
of payments and discounting them using current interest rates from single-family mortgages) and considering pricing of similar loans
that were sold recently. 

Residential
Construction These loans are primarily short in maturity. Accordingly, the estimated fair value is determined to be the carrying
value. 

Commercial
 The estimated fair value is determined by estimating expected future cash flows of payments and discounting them using current
interest rates for commercial mortgages. 

Policy
Loans : The carrying amounts reported in the accompanying condensed consolidated balance sheet for these financial instruments
approximate their fair values because they are fully collateralized by the cash surrender value of the underlying insurance policies. 

Insurance
Assignments, Net : These investments are primarily short in maturity, accordingly, the carrying amounts reported in the accompanying
condensed consolidated balance sheet for these financial instruments approximate their fair values.

8) Fair Value of Financial Instruments (Continued) 

Bank
and Other Loans Payable : The carrying amounts reported in the accompanying condensed consolidated balance sheet for warehouse
lines of credit approximate their fair values due to their relatively short-term maturities and variable interest rates. The estimated
fair value for bank loans collateralized by real estate is determined by estimating future cash flows of payments and discounting them
using current market rates. 

Policyholder
Account Balances and Future Policy Benefits-Annuities : Future policy benefit reserves for interest-sensitive insurance products
are computed under a retrospective deposit method and represent policy account balances before applicable surrender charges. Policy benefits
and claims that are charged to expense include benefit claims incurred in the period of more than related policy account balances. Interest
crediting rates for interest-sensitive insurance products ranged from to . The fair values for these investment-type insurance
contracts are estimated based on the present value of liability cash flows. The fair values for the Company s insurance contracts
other than investment-type contracts are not required to be disclosed. However, the fair values of liabilities under all insurance contracts
are taken into consideration in the Company s overall management of interest rate risk, such that the Company s exposure
to changing interest rates is minimized through the matching of investment maturities with amounts due under insurance contracts.

9) Derivative Instruments (Continued) 

Forward
Sale Commitments 

The
Company utilizes forward commitments to economically hedge the price risk associated with its outstanding mortgage loan commitments.
A forward commitment protects the Company from losses on sales of the loans arising from exercise of the loan commitments. Management
expects these types of commitments will experience changes in fair value opposite to changes in fair value of the loan commitments, thereby
reducing earnings volatility related to the recognition in earnings of changes in the values of the commitments. 

The
net changes in fair value of loan commitments and forward sale commitments are shown in current earnings as a component of mortgage fee
income on the consolidated statements of earnings. Mortgage banking derivatives are shown in other assets and other liabilities and accrued
expenses on the condensed consolidated balance sheets.

to on newly issued
policies. The Company has also assumed various reinsurance agreements through acquisition of life companies. The Company is ultimately
liable for these reinsured amounts in the event such reinsurers are unable to pay their portion of the claims. The Company evaluates
the financial condition of reinsurers and monitors the concentration of credit risk. The Company is also a reinsurer of insurance with
other companies. 

Mortgage
Loan Loss Settlements 

Future
loan losses can be extremely difficult to estimate. However, the Company believes that the Company s reserve methodology and its
current practice of property preservation allow it to estimate its potential losses on loans sold. See Note 4 to the condensed consolidated
financial statements for additional information about the Company s loan loss reserve. 

Debt
Covenants for Mortgage Warehouse Lines of Credit 

The
Company, through its subsidiary SecurityNational Mortgage, has two lines of credit for the purpose of funding mortgage loans. 

The
Company s agreement with U.S. Bank allows SecurityNational Mortgage to borrow up to . The agreement and matures on . The
Company is required to comply with covenants for adjusted tangible net worth, unrestricted cash balance, and minimum combined pre-tax
income (excluding any changes in the fair value of mortgage servicing rights) of at least on a rolling twelve months. 

The
Company s agreement with Western Alliance Bank allows SecurityNational Mortgage to borrow up to . The agreement and matures on . The Company is required to comply with covenants for adjusted
tangible net worth, unrestricted cash balance, and minimum combined pre-tax income of at least on a quarterly basis. 

The
agreements for both warehouse lines of credit include cross default provisions where certain events of default under other of SecurityNational
Mortgage s obligations constitute events of default under the warehouse lines of credit. As of September 30, 2024, the Company
was in compliance with the net income covenant of the warehouse lines of credit and its operating cash flow covenant for its standby
letter of credit with its primary bank. The Company has performed an internal analysis of its funding capacities of both internal and
external sources and has determined that there are sufficient funds to continue its current business model. The Company continues to
negotiate other warehouse lines of credit with other lenders.

10) Reinsurance, Commitments and Contingencies (Continued) 

Debt
Covenants for Revolving Lines of Credit and Bank Loans 

The
Company also has debt covenants on its revolving lines of credit and is required to comply with minimum operating cash flow ratios and
minimum net worth for each of its business segments. The Company also has debt covenants for one of its loans on real estate for a minimum
consolidated operating cash flow ratio, minimum liquidity, and consolidated net worth. In addition to these financial debt covenants,
the Company is required to provide segment specific financial statements and building specific financial statements on all bank loans.
As of September 30, 2024, the Company was in compliance with all these debt covenants. 

Other
Contingencies and Commitments 

The
Company has commitments to fund existing construction and land development loans pursuant to the various loan agreements. As of September
30, 2024, the Company s commitments were approximately for these loans, of which had been funded. The
Company advances funds in accordance with the loan agreements once the work has been completed and an independent inspection is made.
The maximum loan commitment ranges between and of appraised value. The Company receives fees and interest for these loans and
the interest rate is generally fixed at to per annum. Maturities range between six and eighteen months. 

The
Company belongs to a captive insurance group the captive group for certain casualty insurance, worker compensation and
general liability programs. The captive group maintains insurance reserves relative to these programs. The level of exposure from catastrophic
events is limited by the purchase of stop-loss and aggregate liability reinsurance coverage. When estimating the insurance liabilities
and related reserves, the captive group considers several factors, which include historical claims experience, demographic factors, severity
factors and valuations provided by independent third-party actuaries. If actual claims or adverse development of loss reserves occurs
and exceed these estimates, additional reserves may be required from the Company and its members. The estimation process contains uncertainty
since captive insurance management must use judgment to estimate the ultimate cost that will be incurred to settle reported claims and
unreported claims for incidents incurred but not reported as of the balance sheet date. 

The
Company is a defendant in various other legal actions arising from the normal conduct of business. The Company believes that none of
the actions, if adversely determined, will have a material effect on the Company s financial position or results of operations.
Based on the Company s assessment and legal counsel s analysis concerning the likelihood of unfavorable outcomes, no amounts
have been accrued for the above claims in the consolidated financial statements. The Company is not a party to any other material legal
proceedings outside the ordinary course of business or to any other legal proceedings, which, if adversely determined, would have a material
adverse effect on its financial condition or results of operations.

The Company s effective tax rate is higher than the U.S. federal statutory rate of due to, among other factors, state income
taxes as offset by certain state income tax benefits, along with certain permanent tax adjustments such as meals and entertainment and
stock-based compensation. The increase in the effective tax rate when compared to the prior year was primarily due to the Company s
state income tax provision. 

Interim
income taxes are based on an estimated annualized effective tax rate applied to the respective quarterly periods, adjusted for discrete
tax items in the period in which they occur. Although the Company believes its tax estimates are reasonable, the Company can make no
assurance that the final tax outcome of these matters will not be different from that which it has reflected in its historical income
tax provisions and accruals.

Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. 

Overview 

The
Company s operations over the last several years generally reflect three strategies which the Company expects to continue: (i)
increased attention to niche insurance products, such as the Company s funeral plan policies and traditional whole
life products; (ii) increased emphasis on the cemetery and mortuary business; and (iii) capitalizing on an improving housing market by
originating mortgage loans. 

Insurance
Operations 

The
Company s life insurance business includes funeral plans and interest-sensitive life insurance, as well as other traditional life,
accident and health insurance products. The Company places specific marketing emphasis on funeral plans through pre-need planning. 

A
funeral plan is a small face value life insurance policy that generally has face coverage of up to 30,000. The Company believes that
funeral plans represent a marketing niche that is less competitive because most insurance companies do not offer similar coverage. The
purpose of the funeral plan policy is to pay the costs and expenses incurred at the time of a person s death. On a per thousand-dollar
cost of insurance basis, these policies can be more expensive to the policyholder than many types of non-burial insurance due to their
low face amount, requiring the fixed cost of the policy administration to be distributed over a smaller policy size, and the simplified
underwriting practices that result in higher mortality costs. 

The
following table shows the condensed financial results of the insurance operations for the three and nine month periods ended September
30, 2024 and 2023. See Note 7 to the condensed consolidated financial statements.

Cemetery
and Mortuary Operations 

The
Company sells mortuary services and products through its nine mortuaries in Utah and three mortuaries in New Mexico. The Company also
sells cemetery products and services through its five cemeteries in Utah, one cemetery in San Diego County, California, and one cemetery
in Santa Fe, New Mexico. At-need product sales and services are recognized as revenue when the services are performed or when the products
are delivered. Pre-need cemetery product sales are deferred until the merchandise is delivered and services performed. Recognition of
revenue for cemetery land sales occurs when 10 of the purchase price is received.

mortgage loans on a retail basis. Mortgage loans originated or refinanced by the SecurityNational Mortgage are funded through loan purchase
agreements with Security National Life, Kilpatrick Life and unaffiliated financial institutions. 

SecurityNational
Mortgage receives fees from borrowers that are involved in mortgage loan originations and refinancings, and secondary fees earned from
third party investors that purchase the mortgage loans. Mortgage loans are generally sold with mortgage servicing rights MSRs released to third-party investors or retained by SecurityNational Mortgage. SecurityNational Mortgage currently retains the mortgage
servicing rights on approximately 0.32 of its loan origination volume. These mortgage loans are serviced by either SecurityNational
Mortgage or an approved third-party sub-servicer. 

Mortgage
rates have followed the US Treasury yields up in response to the increased inflation and the expectation that the Federal Reserve will
continue to raise rates in the near term. As expected, the rapid increase in mortgage rates has resulted in a decrease in loan originations
classified as refinance. Higher mortgage rates have also had a negative effect on loan originations classified as purchases, 
although not as significant as those in the refinance classification. 

For
the nine month periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, SecurityNational Mortgage originated 5,505 loans 1,723,036,000 total volume)
and 5,680 loans 1,708,831,000 total volume), respectively.

Consolidated
Results of Operations 

Three
month period ended September 30, 2024, Compared to Three month period ended September 30, 2023 

Total
revenues increased by 8,032,000, or 10.0 , to 88,274,000 for the three month period ended September 30, 2024, from 80,242,000 for
the comparable period in 2023. Contributing to this increase in total revenues was a 5,288,000 increase in mortgage fee income, a 2,280,000
increase in gains on investments and other assets, a 1,229,000 increase in other revenues, and a 1,104,000 increase in insurance premiums
and other considerations, which were partially offset by a 1,449,000 decrease in net investment income and a 420,000 decrease in net
mortuary and cemetery sales. 

Mortgage
fee income increased by 5,288,000, or 21.2 , to 30,224,000, for the three month period ended September 30, 2024, from 24,936,000 for
the comparable period in 2023. This increase was primarily due to a 3,068,000 increase in the fair value of loans held for sale, a 1,324,000
increase in the fair value of loan commitments, a 539,000 increase in loan fees and interest income net of an increase in the provision
for loan loss reserve, and a 357,000 increase in secondary gains from mortgage loans sold to third-party investors into the secondary
market. 

Insurance
premiums and other considerations increased by 1,104,000, or 3.8 , to 30,011,000 for the three month period ended September 30, 2024,
from 28,907,000 for the comparable period in 2023. This increase was primarily due to an increase of 1,199,000 in renewal premiums,
which was partially offset by a decrease of 95,000 in first year premiums. 

Net
investment income decreased by 1,449,000, or 7.5 , to 17,799,000 for the three month period ended September 30, 2024, from 19,248,000
for the comparable period in 2023. This decrease was primarily attributable to a 2,811,000 decrease in mortgage loan interest and a
 198,000 decrease in real estate income, which were partially offset by a 668,000 increase in insurance assignment income, a 618,000
increase in interest on cash and cash equivalents, a 117,000 decrease in investment expenses, a 59,000 increase in fixed maturity securities
income, a 59,000 increase in other investment income, a 34,000 increase in policy loan interest, and a 5,000 increase in equity securities
income. 

69 

Net
mortuary and cemetery sales decreased by 420,000, or 5.8 , to 6,814,000 for the three month period ended September 30, 2024, from 7,234,000
for the comparable period in 2023. This decrease was primarily due to a 612,000 decrease in cemetery pre-need sales and a 113,000 decrease
in cemetery at-need sales, which were partially offset by a 305,000 increase in mortuary at-need sales. 

Gains
(losses) on investments and other assets increased by 2,280,000 to 1,348,000 in net gains for the three month period ended September
30, 2024, from 932,000 in net losses for the comparable period in 2023. This increase in gains on investments and other assets was primarily
due to a 3,414,000 increase in gains on equity securities, primarily attributable to increases in the fair value of these equity securities,
a 76,000 increase in gains on other assets, and a 35,000 increase in gains on real estate, which were partially offset by a 1,161,000
decrease in gains on mortgage loans held for investment and an 84,000 decrease in gains on fixed maturity securities. 

Other
revenues increased by 1,228,000, or 144.7 , to 2,077,000 for the nine month period ended September 30, 2024, from 849,000 for the
comparable period in 2023. This increase was primarily attributable to a 1,350,000 legal settlement, which was partially offset by a
decrease of 107,000 in other miscellaneous revenues and a decrease of 15,000 in servicing fee revenue due to a decrease in the retention
of mortgage servicing rights. 

Death
benefits, surrenders and other policy benefits, and future policy benefits decreased by an aggregate of 2,268,000 or 8.9 , to 23,354,000
for the three month period ended September 30, 2024, from 25,622,000 for the comparable period in 2023. This decrease was primarily
the result of a 1,108,000 decrease in death benefits, a 888,000 decrease in future policy benefits and a 272,000 decrease in surrender
and other policy benefits. 

Amortization
of deferred policy and pre-need acquisition costs and value of business acquired decreased by 2,193,000, or 49.0 , to 2,287,000 for
the three month period ended September 30, 2024, from 4,480,000 for the comparable period in 2023. This decrease was primarily due to
increased payment consistency from premium-paying products. 

Selling,
general and administrative expenses increased by 2,587,000, or 6.1 , to 45,239,000 for the three month period ended September 30, 2024,
from 42,652,000 for the comparable period in 2023. This increase was primarily the result of a 2,737,000 increase in commissions, a
 1,015,000 increase in personnel expenses, a 132,000 increase in costs related to funding mortgage loans, and a 21,000 increase in
depreciation on property and equipment, which were partially offset by a 933,000 decrease in other expenses, a 298,000 decrease in
rent and rent related expenses, and a 87,000 decrease in advertising expense. 

Interest
expense decreased by 91,000, or 7.9 , to 1,061,000 for the three month period ended September 30, 2024, from 1,152,000 for the comparable
period in 2023. This decrease was primarily due to a decrease of 23,000 in interest expense on mortgage warehouse lines of credit for
loans held for sale and a decrease of 68,000 in interest expense on bank loans. 

Cost
of goods and services sold-mortuaries and cemeteries decreased by 60,000, or 5.1 , to 1,117,000 for the three month period ended September
30, 2024, from 1,177,000 for the comparable period in 2023. This decrease was primarily due to a decrease of 39,000 in cemetery at-need
sales and a decrease of 27,000 in mortuary at-need sales, which were partially offset by an increase of 6,000 in cemetery pre-need
sales. 

In
summary total benefits and expenses were 73,059,000, or 82.8 of total revenues, for the three month period ended September 30, 2024,
as compared to 75,083,000, or 93.6 of total revenues, for the comparable period in 2023. 

70 

Nine
month period ended September 30, 2024, Compared to Nine month period ended September 30, 2023 

Total
revenues increased by 11,664,000, or 4.8 , to 255,253,000 for the nine month period ended September 30, 2024, from 243,589,000 for
the comparable period in 2023. Contributing to this increase in total revenues was a 4,671,000 increase in mortgage fee income, a 4,136,000
increase in insurance premiums and other considerations, a 2,645,000 increase in gains on investments and other assets, a 959,000 increase
in other revenues, and a 658,000 increase in net mortuary and cemetery sales, which were partially offset by a 1,405,000 decrease in
net investment income. 

Mortgage
fee income increased by 4,671,000, or 6.1 , to 81,675,000, for the nine month period ended September 30, 2024, from 77,004,000 for
the comparable period in 2023. This increase was primarily due to a 4,572,000 increase in the fair value of loans held for sale, a 1,807,000
increase in loan fees and interest income net of an increase in the provision for loan loss reserve, and a 1,789,000 increase in the
fair value of loan commitments, which were partially offset by a 3,497,000 decrease in secondary gains from mortgage loans sold to third-party
investors into the secondary market due to the decline in origination activity because of increasing interest rates. 

Insurance
premiums and other considerations increased by 4,136,000, or 4.8 , to 89,824,000 for the nine month period ended September 30, 2024,
from 85,688,000 for the comparable period in 2023. This increase was primarily due to an increase of 2,576,000 in first year premiums
and an increase of 1,560,000 in renewal premiums. 

Net
investment income decreased by 1,405,000, or 2.5 , to 55,790,000 for the nine month period ended September 30, 2024, from 57,195,000
for the comparable period in 2023. This decrease was primarily attributable to a 4,930,000 decrease in mortgage loan interest and a
 1,660,000 decrease in real estate income, which were partially offset by a 2,457,000 increase in interest on cash and cash equivalents,
a 1,401,000 increase in insurance assignment income, a 652,000 increase in fixed maturity securities income, a 375,000 decrease in

in equity securities income. 

Net
mortuary and cemetery sales increased by 658,000, or 3.2 , to 21,532,000 for the nine month period ended September 30, 2024, from 20,874,000
for the comparable period in 2023. This increase was primarily due to a 445,000 increase in mortuary at-need sales and a 344,000 increase
in cemetery pre-need sales, which were partially offset by a 131,000 decrease in cemetery at-need sales. 

Gains

30, 2024, from 5,000 in net losses for the comparable period in 2023. This increase in gains on investments and other assets was primarily
due to a 3,664,000 increase in gains on equity securities mostly attributable to increases in the fair value of these equity securities,
a 163,000 increase in gains on real estate, and a 121,000 increase in gains on fixed maturity securities, which were partially offset
by a 1,161,000 decrease in gains on mortgage loans held for investment and a 142,000 decrease in gains on other assets. 

Other
revenues increased by 959,000, or 33.9 , to 3,792,000 for the nine month period ended September 30, 2024, from 2,833,000 for the comparable
period in 2023. This increase was primarily attributable to a 1,350,000 legal settlement, which was partially offset by a decrease of
 207,000 in other miscellaneous revenues and a decrease of 184,000 in servicing fee revenue due to a decrease in the retention of mortgage
servicing rights. 

Death
benefits, surrenders and other policy benefits, and future policy benefits decreased by an aggregate of 2,438,000 or 3.2 , to 73,956,000
for the nine month period ended September 30, 2024, from 76,394,000 for the comparable period in 2023. This decrease was primarily the

the nine month period ended September 30, 2024, from 13,615,000 for the comparable period in 2023. This decrease was primarily due to
increased payment consistency from premium-paying products. 

Selling,
general and administrative expenses decreased by 2,100,000, or 1.6 , to 128,952,000 for the nine month period ended September 30, 2024,
from 131,052,000 for the comparable period in 2023. This decrease was primarily the result of a 2,831,000 decrease in other expenses,
a 1,207,000 decrease in rent and rent related expenses, a 798,000 decrease in personnel expenses, a 569,000 decrease in costs related
to funding mortgage loans, and a 482,000 decrease in advertising expense, which were partially offset by a 3,761,000 increase in commissions
and a 26,000 increase in depreciation in property and equipment. 

71 

Interest
expense decreased by 858,000, or 21.3 , to 3,162,000 for the nine month period ended September 30, 2024, from 4,020,000 for the comparable
period in 2023. This decrease was primarily due to a decrease of 310,000 in interest expense on mortgage warehouse lines of credit for
loans held for sale and a decrease of 548,000 in interest expense on bank loans. 

Cost
of goods and services sold-mortuaries and cemeteries increased by 12,000, or 0.3 , to 3,627,000 for the three month period ended September
30, 2024, from 3,615,000 for the comparable period in 2023. This increase was primarily due to an increase of 74,000 in cemetery pre-need
sales and an increase of 31,000 in cemetery at-need sales, which were partially offset by a decrease of 93,000 in mortuary at-need
sales. 

In
summary total benefits and expenses were 221,030,000, or 86.6 of total revenues, for the nine month period ended September 30, 2024,
as compared to 228,696,000, or 93.9 of total revenues, for the comparable period in 2023. 

Liquidity
and Capital Resources 

The
Company s life insurance subsidiaries and cemetery and mortuary subsidiaries realize cash flow from premiums, contract payments
and sales on personal services rendered for cemetery and mortuary business, from interest and dividends on invested assets, and from
the proceeds from the sale or maturity of investments. The mortgage subsidiaries realize cash flow from fees generated by originating
and refinancing mortgage loans and fees from mortgage loans held for sale that are sold to investors into the secondary market. It should
be noted that current conditions in the financial markets and economy may affect the realization of these expected cash flows. The Company
considers these sources of cash flow to be adequate to fund future policyholder and cemetery and mortuary liabilities, which generally
are long-term, and adequate to pay current policyholder claims, annuity payments, expenses related to the issuance of new policies, the
maintenance of existing policies, debt service, and to meet current operating expenses. 

During
the nine month periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the Company s operations provided cash of approximately 34,894,000 and
of approximately 18,384,000, respectively. The increase in cash provided by operations was due primarily to the increase in net earnings. 

The
Company expects to pay out liabilities under its funeral plans over the long term given the nature of those plans. Funeral plans are
small face value life insurance policies that payout upon a person s death to cover funeral burial costs; policyholders generally
keep these policies in force until, and do not surrender prior to, death. Because of the long-term nature of these liabilities, the Company
can hold to maturity or for the targeted investment period its corresponding bond, real estate, and mortgage loan investments, thus reducing
the risk of liquidating these long-term investments because of any sudden changes in their fair values. 

The
Company attempts to match the duration of invested assets with its policyholder and cemetery and mortuary liabilities. The Company may
sell investments other than those held to maturity in the portfolio to help in this timing matching. The Company purchases short-term
investments on a temporary basis to meet the expected short-term requirements of the Company s insurance products. The Company s
investment philosophy is intended to provide a rate of return for the expected duration of its cemetery and mortuary policies that will
exceed the accruing of liabilities under those policies regardless of future interest rate movements. 

The
Company s investment policy is also to invest predominantly in fixed maturity securities, real estate, mortgage loans, and warehousing
of mortgage loans. The warehoused mortgage loans are typically held for sale on a short-term basis before selling the loans to investors
in accordance with the requirements and laws governing the Company s life insurance subsidiaries. Bonds owned by the insurance
subsidiaries amounted to 326,914,000 (at estimated fair value) and 362,663,000 (at estimated fair value) as of September 30, 2024 and
December 31, 2023, respectively. This represented 35.4 and 38.7 of the total investments of the Company as of September 30, 2024 and
December 31, 2023, respectively. Generally, all bonds owned by the life insurance subsidiaries are rated by the National Association
of Insurance Commissioners. Under this rating system, there are six categories used for rating bonds. As of September 30, 2024, 2.1 
(or 7,232,000) and as of December 31, 2023, 1.8 (or 6,954,000) of the Company s total bond investments were invested in bonds
in rating categories three through six, which are considered non-investment grade. 

72 

The
Company s life insurance subsidiaries are subject to risk-based capital guidelines established by statutory regulators requiring
minimum capital levels based on the perceived risk of assets, liabilities, disintermediation, and business risk. As of September 30,
2024 and December 31, 2023, the life insurance subsidiaries were in compliance with the regulatory criteria. 

The
Company s total capitalization of stockholders equity, bank and other loans payable was 453,312,000 as of September 30,
2024, as compared to 418,450,000 as of December 31, 2023. This increase was primarily due to an increase of 33,427,000 in stockholders 
equity and an increase of 1,435,000 in bank loans and other loans payable. Stockholders equity as a percent of total capitalization
was 76.4 and 74.8 as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. 

Lapse
rates measure the amount of insurance terminated during a particular period. The Company s lapse rate for life insurance in 2023
was 4.4 as compared to a lapse rate of 4.3 for 2022. The 2024 lapse rate to date has been approximately the same as 2023. 

The
combined statutory capital and surplus of the Company s life insurance subsidiaries was approximately 121,504,000 and 107,385,000
as of September 30, 2024, and December 31, 2023, respectively. The life insurance subsidiaries cannot pay a dividend to their parent
company without the approval of state insurance regulatory authorities.
