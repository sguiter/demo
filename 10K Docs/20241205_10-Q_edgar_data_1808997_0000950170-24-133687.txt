Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Information 
 
 The statements contained in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q that are not historical are forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the Exchange Act. All statements other than statements of historical facts contained or incorporated herein by reference in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, including statements regarding our future operating results, future financial position, business strategy, objectives, goals, plans, prospects, markets, and plans and objectives for future operations, are forward-looking statements. In some cases, you can identify forward-looking statements by terms such as anticipates, believes, estimates, expects, intends, suggests, targets, contemplates, projects, predicts, may, might, plan, would, should, could, may, can, potential, continue, objective, or the negative of those terms, or similar expressions intended to identify forward-looking statements. However, not all forward-looking statements contain these identifying words. Specific forward-looking statements in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q include statements regarding the following: 
 
 our expectation that the unrecognized compensation expense related to unvested restricted stock units, or RSUs, and performance-based restricted stock units, or PSUs, will be recognized over a weighted average remaining contractual term of 1.5 years; 

the condensed consolidated financial statements may not be indicative of our future performance; 

our belief that our future ability to fund our operating needs will depend on our future ability to generate positive cash flow from operations and obtain financing on acceptable terms; our belief that we will meet known or reasonably likely future cash requirements through the combination of cash flows from operating activities, available cash balances, and available borrowings through our existing 75 million credit facility; 

our expectation that our overall cost of debt funding may increase and decrease the overall debt capacity and commercial credit available to us; 

our future capital requirements depend on many factors, including net sales, the timing and extent of spending to support product development efforts, the expansion of sales and marketing activities, the timing of introductions of new products and enhancements to existing products, and any acquisitions or strategic investments that we may determine to make; 

the possibility that our ability to take advantage of unexpected business opportunities or to respond to competitive pressures could be limited or severely constrained if sufficient funds are not available or are not available on acceptable terms; 

our expectation to continue to utilize our cash flows to invest in our business, including research and development for new product initiatives; hire additional employees; fund growth strategies, including any potential acquisitions; repay any indebtedness we may incur over time; and repurchase our common stock if we have authorization to do so; and 

the possibility that increased demand for sourced products in various industries and other transportation disturbances could cause delays at various U.S. ports, which could delay the timing of receipt of our products. 

A number of factors could cause our actual results to differ materially from those indicated by the forward-looking statements. Such factors include, among others, the following: 
 potential disruptions in our suppliers ability to source the raw materials necessary for the production of our products, disruptions and delays in the manufacture of our products, and difficulties encountered by retailers and other components of the distribution channel for our products; 

lower levels of consumer spending in general and specific to our products or product categories; 

our ability to introduce new products that are successful in the marketplace; 

interruptions of our arrangements with third-party contract manufacturers and freight carriers that disrupt our ability to fill our customers orders; 

increases in costs or decreases in availability of finished products, components, and raw materials; 

the potential for increased tariffs on our products, including tariffs that may be imposed by the new presidential administration; 

our ability to maintain or strengthen our brand recognition and reputation; 

our ability to forecast demand for our products accurately; 

our ability to continue to expand our e-commerce business; 

our ability to compete in a highly competitive market; 

our dependence on large customers; 

our ability to attract and retain talent; 

pricing pressures by our customers; 

our ability to collect our accounts receivable; 

the potential for product recalls, product liability, and other claims or lawsuits against us; 

our ability to protect our intellectual property; 

inventory levels, both internally and in the distribution channel, in excess of demand; 

our ability to identify acquisition candidates, to complete acquisitions of potential acquisition candidates, to integrate acquired businesses with our business, to achieve success with acquired companies, and to realize the benefits of acquisitions in a manner consistent with our expectations; 

the performance and security of our information systems; 

our ability to comply with any applicable foreign laws or regulations; 

economic, social, political, legislative, and regulatory factors; 

the potential for increased regulation of firearms and firearms- related products; 

future investments for capital expenditures, liquidity, and anticipated cash needs and availability; 

the potential for impairment charges; 

estimated amortization expense of intangible assets for future periods; 

actions of social or economic activists that could, directly or indirectly, have an adverse effect on our business; 

disruptions caused by social unrest, including related protests or disturbances; 

our assessment of factors relating to the valuation of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in acquisitions, the timing for such evaluations, and the potential adjustment in such evaluations; and 

other factors detailed from time to time in our reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, or the SEC, including information contained herein. 

All forward-looking statements included herein, or in our Annual Report on Form 10-K, are based on information available to us as of their respective dates and speak only as of such dates. Except as required by law, we undertake no obligation to update any forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances after the date of such statements. The forward-looking statements contained in or incorporated by reference into this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, or in our Annual Report on Form 10-K, reflect our views as of the date of these reports about future events and are subject to risks, uncertainties, assumptions, and changes in circumstances that may cause our actual results, performance, or achievements to differ significantly from those expressed or implied in any forward-looking statement. Although we believe that the expectations reflected in the forward-looking statements are reasonable, we cannot guarantee future events, results, performance, or achievements.

 brand lanes, each of which focuses on one of four distinct consumer verticals Adventurer, Harvester, Marksman, and Defender with each of our brands included in one of the brand lanes. Our Adventurer brands include products that help enhance consumers fishing, outdoor cooking, and camping experiences. 

 Our Harvester brands focus on the activities hunters typically engage in, including the activities to prepare for the hunt, the hunt itself, and the activities that follow a hunt, such as meat processing. 

 Our Marksman brands address product needs arising from consumer activities that take place primarily at the shooting range and where firearms are cleaned, maintained, and worked on. 

 Our Defender brands focus on protection and include products that are used by consumers in situations that require self-defense for training and for securing high value or high consequence possessions.

 and , with a discount available in certain cases for early payment. For contracts with discounted terms, we determine the transaction price upon establishment of the contract that contains the final terms of the sale, including the description, quantity, and price of each product purchased. We estimate variable consideration relative to the amount of cash discounts to which customers are likely to be entitled. In some instances, we provide longer payment terms, particularly as it relates to our hunting dating programs, which represent payment terms due in the fall for certain orders of hunting products received in the spring and summer. We do not consider these extended terms to be a significant financing component of the contract because the payment terms are less than one year. We have elected to treat all shipping and handling activities as fulfillment costs and recognize the costs as distribution expenses at the time we recognize the related revenue. Shipping and handling costs billed to customers are included in net sales. We sponsor direct-to-consumer customer loyalty programs. Customers earn rewards from qualifying purchases or activities. We defer revenue for a portion of the transaction price from product sales to customers that earn loyalty points. The amount of revenue we recognize reflects the expected consideration to be received for providing the goods or services to customers, which includes estimates for variable consideration. Variable consideration includes allowances for trade term discounts, sales volume incentives, chargebacks, and product returns. Estimates of variable consideration are determined at contract inception and are constrained to the extent that inclusion of such variable consideration could result in a significant reversal of cumulative revenue in future periods. We apply the portfolio approach as a practical expedient and utilize the expected value method in determining estimates of variable consideration, based on evaluations of specific product and customer circumstances, historical and anticipated trends, and current economic conditions. We have co-op advertising program expense, which we record within advertising expense, in recognition of a distinct service that we receive from our customers at the retail level.

Level 2 Financial assets and liabilities whose values are based on quoted prices in markets in which trading occurs infrequently or whose values are based on quoted prices of instruments with similar attributes in active markets. Level 2 inputs include the following: quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in non-active markets (such as corporate and municipal bonds which trade infrequently); 

 inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for substantially the full term of the asset or liability (such as interest rate and currency swaps); and 

 inputs that are derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the asset or liability (such as certain securities and derivatives). 

 Level 3 Financial assets and liabilities whose values are based on prices or valuation techniques that require inputs that are both unobservable and significant to the overall fair value measurement. These inputs reflect our assumptions about the assumptions a market participant would use in pricing the asset or liability. We do t have any Level 3 financial assets or liabilities as of October 31, 2024 and April 30, 2024.

Due to the loss from operations for the six months ended October 31, 2023, there are common shares added to calculate dilutive earnings per share because the effect would be anti-dilutive. Incentive Stock and Employee Stock Purchase Plans We have a stock incentive plan, or 2020 Incentive Compensation Plan, under which we can grant new awards to our employees and directors. Except in specific circumstances, with one-third or one-fourth of the units vesting on each anniversary of the grant date, respectively. We amortize the aggregate fair value of our RSU grants to compensation expense over the vesting period. Awards that do not vest are forfeited. We grant PSUs to our executive officers and certain other employees from time to time. At the time of grant, we calculate the fair value of our PSUs using the Monte-Carlo simulation.

If the fair market value per share of our common stock on any purchase date is less than the fair market value per share on the start date of a 12-month offering period, then that offering period will automatically terminate and a new 12-month offering period will begin on the next business day. Each offering period will begin on April 1 or October 1, as applicable, immediately following the end of the previous offering period. Payroll deductions will be on an after-tax basis, in an amount of not less than and not more than (or such greater percentage as the committee appointed to administer our ESPP may establish from time to time before the first day of an offering period) of a participant s compensation on each payroll date. The option exercise price per share will equal of the lower of the fair market value on the first day of the offering period or the fair market value on the exercise date. The maximum number of shares that a participant may purchase during any purchase period is the greater of shares, or a total of in shares, based on the fair market value on the first day of the offering period.

During the six months ended October 31, 2024, shares were purchased by our employees under our ESPP. We measure the cost of employee services received in exchange for an award of an equity instrument based on the grant-date fair value of the award. We amortize the fair value of the award over the vesting period of the option. Under ESPP, fair value is determined at the beginning of the purchase period and amortized over the term of each exercise period.

 segment based on several key factors, including the reporting and review process used by the chief operating decision maker, our Chief Executive Officer, who reviews only consolidated financial information and makes decisions to allocate resources based on those financial statements. We analyze revenue streams in various ways, including customer group, brands, product categories, and customer channels. However, this information does not include a full set of discrete financial information. In addition, although we currently sell our products under distinct brands that are organized into brand lanes and include specific product sales that have identified revenue streams, these brand lanes are focused almost entirely on product development and marketing activities and do not qualify as separate reporting units under ASC 280-10-50-1. Other sales and customer focused activities, operating activities, and administrative activities are not divided by brand lane and, therefore, expenses related to each brand lane are not accumulated or reviewed individually. Our business is evaluated based upon a number of financial and operating measures, including sales, gross profit and gross margin, operating expenses, and operating margin. Our business includes our outdoor products and accessories products as well as our electro-optics products, which we develop, source, market, assemble, and distribute from our facility in Columbia, Missouri.

Net income was 3.1 million, or 0.24 per diluted share, for the three months ended October 31, 2024 compared with net income of 77,000, or 0.01 per share, for the comparable quarter last year. The increased net income was primarily related to increased net sales volume and lower promotional product discounts as well as lower operating expenses during the three months ended October 31, 2024 as compared to the three months ended October 31, 2023. 
 
 The following table sets forth certain information regarding net income and the related per share data for the six months ended October 31, 2024 and 2023 (dollars in thousands, except per share data):

Non-GAAP Financial Measure 
 We use GAAP net income as our primary financial measure. We use Adjusted EBITDAS, which is a non-GAAP financial metric, as a supplemental measure of our performance in order to provide investors with an improved understanding of underlying performance trends, and it should be considered in addition to, but not instead of, the financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP. Adjusted EBITDAS is defined as GAAP net income/(loss) before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization, and stock compensation expense. Our Adjusted EBITDAS calculation also excludes certain items we consider non-routine. We believe that Adjusted EBITDAS is useful to understanding our operating results and the ongoing performance of our underlying business, as Adjusted EBITDAS provides information on our ability to meet our capital expenditure and working capital requirements, and is also an indicator of profitability. We believe this reporting provides additional transparency and comparability to our operating results. We believe that the presentation of Adjusted EBITDAS is useful to investors because it is frequently used by analysts, investors, and other interested parties to evaluate companies in our industry. We use Adjusted EBITDAS to supplement GAAP measures of performance to evaluate the effectiveness of our business strategies, to make budgeting decisions, and to neutralize our capitalization structure to compare our performance against that of other peer companies using similar measures, especially companies that are private. We also use Adjusted EBITDAS to supplement GAAP measures of performance to evaluate our performance in connection with compensation decisions. We believe it is useful to investors and analysts to evaluate this non-GAAP measure on the same basis as we use to evaluate our operating results. 
 Adjusted EBITDAS is a non-GAAP measure and may not be comparable to similar measures reported by other companies. In addition, non-GAAP measures have limitations as analytical tools, and you should not consider them in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under GAAP. We address the limitations of non-GAAP measures through the use of various GAAP measures. In the future, we may incur expenses or charges such as those added back to calculate Adjusted EBITDAS. Our presentation of Adjusted EBITDAS should not be construed as an inference that our future results will be unaffected by these items. 
 The following table sets forth our calculation of non-GAAP Adjusted EBITDAS for the three and six months ended October 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively (dollars in thousands):

Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 
 We expect to continue to utilize our cash flows to invest in our business, including research and development for new product initiatives; to hire additional employees; to fund growth strategies, including any potential acquisitions; to make payments on any indebtedness we may incur over time; and to repurchase shares of our common stock if we are authorized to do so.

Operating Activities 
 25 

On an annual basis, operating activities generally represent the principal source of our cash flow. 
 Cash used in operating activities was 12.3 million for the six months ended October 31, 2024 compared with cash used by operating activities of 3.2 million for the six months ended October 31, 2023. Cash used by operating activities for the six months ended October 31, 2024 was primarily impacted by 17.6 million of higher accounts receivable, primarily due to timing of customer shipments in the second half of our second fiscal quarter and 18.3 million of increased inventory. The increase in inventory was a result of planned increase in purchases to prepare for the fall and winter hunting and holiday seasons. The cash usage for the six months ended October 31, 2024 was partially offset by a 10.6 million increase in accounts payable due to the timing of inventory purchases as we built our inventory balances higher during our second fiscal quarter and 3.0 million of increase accrued expenses related to the timing of outbound freight accruals and higher sales volume-related accruals. 
 Investing Activities 
 Cash used in investing activities was 1.6 million during the six months ended October 31, 2024, flat as compared the prior year comparable period. We expect to spend approximately 3.5 million to 4.5 million of capital expenditures in fiscal 2025, a decrease of 1.5 million to 2.5 million from the 6.0 million we spent in fiscal 2024, a year in which we spent 2.9 million on capital expenditures as a result of the lease assignment of the full building at our headquarters in Columbia, Missouri. 
 Financing Activities 
 Cash used in financing activities was 1.6 million for the six months ended October 31, 2024, primarily from 1.4 million used to repurchase 153,497 shares of our common stock. 
 Our future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including net sales, the timing and extent of spending to support product development efforts, the expansion of sales and marketing activities, the timing of introductions of new products and enhancements to existing products, any acquisitions or strategic investments that we may determine to make, and changes in consumer spending, which is sensitive to economic conditions and other factors. Further equity or debt financing may not be available to us on acceptable terms or at all. If sufficient funds are not available or are not available on acceptable terms, our ability to take advantage of unexpected business opportunities or to respond to competitive pressures could be limited or severely constrained. 
 We had 14.2 million of cash equivalents on hand as of October 31, 2024 and had 29.7 million in cash and cash equivalents on hand as of April 30, 2024. 
 Other Matters 
 Critical Accounting Policies 
 The preparation of our condensed consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of net sales and expenses during the reporting periods. Significant accounting policies are summarized in Note 2 of the Notes to the consolidated and combined financial statements in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended April 30, 2024. Our critical accounting policies are described in Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended April 30, 2024, to which there have been no material changes. Actual results could differ from our estimates.
