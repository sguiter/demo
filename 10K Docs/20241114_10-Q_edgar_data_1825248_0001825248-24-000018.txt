 (a) Weighted averages are calculated based on fair value of investments. 
 (b) This asset category contains investment. 
 
 There were no significant changes in valuation approach or technique as of December 31, 2023. 
 Level 3 inputs to the valuation methodology are unobservable and significant to overall fair value measurement. The inputs into the determination of fair value require significant management judgment or estimation. Financial instruments that are included in this category include investments in privately held entities where the fair value is based on unobservable inputs. 
 Increases or decreases in any of the above unobservable inputs in isolation would result in a lower or higher fair value measurement for such assets. 
 The income and market approaches were used in the determination of fair value of certain Level 3 assets as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. The significant unobservable inputs used in the income approach are the discount rate or market yield used to discount the estimated future cash flows expected to be received from the underlying investment, which include both future principal and interest payments. An increase in the discount rate or market yield would result in a decrease in the fair value. Included in the consideration and selection of discount rates is risk of default, rating of the investment, call provisions and comparable company investments. The significant unobservable inputs used in the market approach are based on market comparable transactions and market multiples of publicly traded comparable companies. Increases or decreases in market comparable transactions or market multiples would result in an increase or decrease, respectively, in the fair value.

 Each of the Amended and Restated Investment Advisory Agreement and the Investment Advisory Agreement are discussed further below. 
 Management Fee 
 The Management Fee is payable quarterly in arrears and is calculated based on the average value of the Company s gross assets at the end of the two most recently completed calendar quarters, where gross assets includes the total assets of the Company, including any borrowings for investment purposes. 
 Prior to the Mergers, under the Investment Advisory Agreement, the Management Fee for each quarter was calculated as follows: 
 Prior to a liquidity event, the Management Fee payable under the Investment Advisory Agreement was calculated at an annual rate of of the Company s average gross assets. A 1iquidity event is defined as any of: (1) a merger or another transaction approved by the Board of Directors in which the Company s stockholders will receive cash or shares of a publicly traded company (or a company that becomes publicly traded concurrently with the closing of such transaction), which may include an entity advised by the Adviser or its affiliates, (2) an initial public offering IPO or a listing (an Exchange Listing of the Common Stock on a national securities exchange, or (3) the sale of all or substantially all of the Company s assets either on a complete portfolio basis or individually followed by a liquidation. 
 After a liquidity event, the Management Fee payable under the Investment Advisory Agreement was calculated at an annual rate of of the Company s average gross assets, provided, that the Management Fee will be calculated at an annual rate of of the Company s average gross assets purchased with borrowed funds above x debt-to-equity (equivalent to 1 of debt outstanding for each 1 of equity), and provided further that for a period of months commencing on the date of the closing of a liquidity event, the Adviser will irrevocably waive Management Fees in excess of of the Company s average gross assets. Any fees waived under the Investment Advisory Agreement are not subject to reimbursement to the Adviser. 
 Under the Amended and Restated Investment Advisory Agreement, effective upon the closing of the Mergers on January 24, 2024, (i) the Management Fee increased to an annual rate of of the Company s average gross assets, provided, that the Management Fee will be calculated at an annual rate of of the Company s average gross assets purchased with borrowed funds above x debt-to-equity (equivalent to 1.0 of debt outstanding for each 1.0 of equity). 
 As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, million and million was payable to the Adviser for Management Fees, respectively. 
 For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company incurred million and million, respectively, in Management Fees under the Amended and Restated Investment Advisory Agreement and the Investment Advisory Agreement. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, the Company incurred million and million, respectively, in Management Fees under the Investment Advisory Agreement.

 parts, which are described below. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the Adviser waived all Incentive Fees for the period from January 7, 2021 (commencement of operations) to December 31, 2023. 
 The incentive fee consists of two parts. The first part is referred to as the incentive fee on income and it is calculated and payable quarterly in arrears based on the Company s Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income for the immediately preceding quarter. 
 Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income means interest income, dividend income and any other income (including any other fees, other than fees for providing managerial assistance, such as commitment, origination, structuring, diligence and consulting fees or other fees that the Company receives from portfolio companies) accrued during the calendar quarter, minus the Company s operating expenses for the quarter (including the Management Fee, expenses payable under the Administration Agreement (as defined below) and any interest expense and dividends paid on any issued and outstanding preferred stock, but excluding the incentive fee). Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income includes, in the case of investments with a deferred interest feature (such as original issue discount debt instruments with PIK interest and zero coupon securities), accrued income that the Company has not yet received in cash. Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income does not include any realized capital gains, realized capital losses or unrealized capital appreciation or depreciation. For purposes of computing the Company s Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income, the calculation methodology will look through total return swaps as if the Company owned the referenced assets directly. 
 Prior to the Mergers, under the Investment Advisory Agreement, the incentive fee on income for each quarter was calculated as follows: 
 
 No incentive fee on income in any calendar quarter in which the Company s Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income does not exceed the preferred return rate of , or annualized (the Preferred Return ), on net assets; 
 of Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income, if any, that exceeds the Preferred Return but is less than or equal to in any calendar quarter annualized). This portion of the incentive fee on income is referred to as the catch up and is intended to provide the Adviser with an incentive fee of on all of the Company s Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income when the Company s Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income reaches annualized) in any calendar quarter; and 
 For any quarter in which Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income exceeds annualized), the incentive fee on income equals of the amount of Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income, as the Preferred Return and catch-up will have been achieved. 
 Prior to the Mergers, for any period ending after the closing of a liquidity event, the incentive fee on income for each quarter was calculated as follows:

 annualized) and of the amount of the Company s pre-incentive fee net investment income, if any, that exceeds the catch-up, with the preferred return to investors each quarter remaining the same as under the Investment Advisory Agreement. In addition, Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income does not include any amortization or accretion to interest income resulting solely from merger-related accounting adjustments in connection with the assets acquired in the Mergers. 
 As of September 30, 2024, million was payable to the Adviser for the incentive fee on income. As of December 31, 2023, there was payable to the Adviser for incentive fee on income. 
 For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company incurred million and million in incentive fees on income under the Amended and Restated Investment Advisory Agreement. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, the Company incurred million and million in incentive fees on income under the Investment Advisory Agreement, none of which was payable to the Adviser. 
 The second part of the incentive fee, referred to as the incentive fee on capital gains during operations, is an incentive fee on capital gains earned on cumulative realized capital gains of the Company net of cumulative realized capital losses and unrealized capital depreciation and is determined and payable in arrears as of the end of each calendar year (or upon termination of the Investment Advisory Agreement, if earlier). Prior to the Mergers, and prior to a liquidity event, this fee equaled of the Company s incentive fee capital gains, which equals realized capital gains of the Company on a cumulative basis from the date of the Company s election to be regulated as a BDC, calculated as of the end of each calendar year, computed net of all realized capital losses and unrealized capital depreciation on a cumulative basis, less the aggregate amount of any previously paid incentive fee on capital gains during operations. Following a liquidity event, the incentive fee on capital gains during operations equals of the Company s incentive fee capital gains calculated as described above, on a cumulative basis from the date of the Company s election to be regulated as a BDC. 
 Under the Amended and Restated Investment Advisory Agreement, effective upon the closing of the Mergers on January 24, 2024, the incentive fee on capital gains increased to of our incentive fee capital gains calculated as under the Investment Advisory Agreement for periods ending after the date of the Amended and Restated Investment Advisory Agreement, on a cumulative basis from the date of our election to be regulated as a BDC. In addition, the calculation of realized capital gains, realized capital losses and unrealized capital appreciation or depreciation does not include any such amounts resulting solely from merger-related accounting adjustments in connection with the assets acquired in the Mergers. 
 
 U.S. GAAP requires that the incentive fee accrual be calculated assuming a hypothetical liquidation of the Company based upon investments held at the end of each period. In such a calculation, in order to calculate the accrual for the capital gains incentive fee in accordance with U.S. GAAP for a given period, the Company includes unrealized appreciation in calculating the accrual for the capital gains incentive fee even though such unrealized appreciation is not included in calculating the capital gains incentive fee payable under the Investment Advisory Agreement. There can be no assurance that such unrealized appreciation will be realized in the future. Accordingly, the accrual for the capital gains incentive fee, as calculated and accrued in accordance with U.S. GAAP, does not necessarily represent amounts that will be payable under the Investment Advisory Agreement. 
 For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the Company did not accrue incentive fees on capital gains in accordance with U.S. GAAP.

A TRS is a contract in which one party agrees to make periodic payments to another party based on the change in the market value of the assets underlying the TRS, which may include a specified security, basket of securities or securities indices during the specified period, in return for periodic payments based on a fixed or variable interest rate. The Company pays interest to Nomura for each loan at a rate equal to three-month SOFR plus per annum. On April 24, 2024, the rate was amended to three-month SOFR plus per annum. Upon the termination or repayment of any loan under the TRS, the Company will either receive from Nomura the appreciation in the value of such loan or pay to Nomura any depreciation in the value of such loan. The scheduled termination date for the TRS is February 17, 2025. The Company may terminate the TRS prior to February 17, 2025 upon the occurrence of certain events but in certain circumstances may be required to pay certain termination fees. 
 
 As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, all total return swaps on the Nomura TRS were entered into contemporaneously with the Company s sale of their reference assets. Due to the Company s continuing involvement in these assets, these assets are not derecognized under ASC Topic 860 -- Transfers and Servicing, and are presented on the consolidated schedule of investments. Financing amounts related to these assets are presented as secured borrowings on the consolidated statement of assets and liabilities. Any margin paid to the counterparty under the terms of the TRS agreement is included in the Due from broker on the Company s consolidated statements of assets and liabilities. 
 
 The TRS is subject to the SEC rule related to the use of derivatives, reverse repurchase agreements and certain other transactions by registered investment companies. The rule requires that the Company trade derivatives and other transactions that create future payment or delivery obligations subject to a value-at-risk leverage limit and certain derivatives risk management program and reporting requirements. Generally, these requirements apply unless the Company qualifies as a limited derivatives user, as defined in the rule, in which case certain exceptions to these conditions would apply. The Company may qualify as a limited derivatives user if it adopts and implements written policies and procedures reasonably designed to manage the Company's derivatives risk and the Company's derivatives exposure does not exceed 10 percent of the Company's net assets as calculated in accordance with the rule. 
 
 As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company had secured borrowings outstanding of million and million, respectively. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company recorded interest expense of million and million, respectively in connection with secured borrowings.

The fair values of the Company's debt obligations are determined in accordance with ASC 820, which defines fair value in terms of the price that would be paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date under current market conditions. The fair value of the Company's borrowings is estimated based upon market interest rates for the Company's own borrowings or entities with similar credit risk, adjusted for nonperformance risk, if any. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company's borrowings would be deemed to be Level 3, as defined in Note 3 - Fair Value of Financial Instruments .

 As of December 31, 2023, the Company s domestic subsidiary had a net operating loss and unrealized gain. As a result, the Company had a deferred tax asset of million and a deferred tax liability of ) million. In assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets, management considers whether it is more likely than not that all or some portion of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. The future realization of the tax benefits of existing deductible temporary differences or carryforwards ultimately depend on the existence of sufficient taxable income in the carryback (if permitted under the tax law) and carryforward periods. The Company has concluded future reversal of existing taxable temporary differences is sufficient to support a conclusion that a valuation allowance is not necessary as of December 31, 2023. As a result, valuation allowance was recorded for the deferred tax assets as of December 31, 2023.

 shares of the Company's common stock. As a result of the Mergers, the Company issued an aggregate of million shares of its common stock to FBLC stockholders. 
 
 The Merger was accounted for as an asset acquisition of FBLC by the Company in accordance with the asset acquisition method of accounting as detailed in ASC 805, Business Combinations, with the fair value of total consideration paid, including transaction costs, in conjunction with the Mergers allocated to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their relative fair values as of the date of the Mergers. Generally, under asset acquisition accounting, acquiring assets in groups not only requires ascertaining the cost of the asset (or net assets), but also allocating that cost to the individual assets (or individual assets and liabilities) that make up the group. The cost of the group of assets acquired in an asset acquisition was allocated to the individual assets acquired or liabilities assumed based on their relative fair values of net identifiable assets acquired other than certain non-qualifying assets (for example cash) and does not give rise to goodwill. As a result, the purchase price premium was allocated to the cost basis of the FBLC investments acquired by the Company on a pro-rata basis based on their relative fair values as of the effective time of the Merger. The Company will be the accounting survivor of the Mergers. The purchase premium allocated to the debt investments acquired will amortize over the life of each respective debt investment through interest income, with a corresponding adjustment recorded to unrealized depreciation on such investment acquired through its ultimate disposition. The purchase premium allocated to equity investments acquired will not amortize over the life of such investments through interest income and, assuming no subsequent change to the fair value of the equity investments acquired and disposition of such equity investments at fair value, the Company will recognize a realized loss with a corresponding reversal of the unrealized depreciation on disposition of such equity investments acquired. The Merger constitutes an integrated plan of the type contemplated in Internal Revenue Service Revenue Ruling 2001-46 and will qualify as a tax-free reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code. The Company has carried forward the historical cost basis of FBLC investments for tax purposes. As a result of the Merger, the Company is subject to an annual limit on its use of some of its unrealized capital losses to offset capital gains in future periods. If those losses are realized and the limitation prevents the Company from using any of those losses in a future period, those capital losses will be available to offset capital gains in subsequent periods. Additionally, net operating losses of one of the Company s domestic subsidiaries is subject to an annual limitation. Losses subject to limitation will be available in subsequent periods.

 Overview 
 We are an externally managed, non-diversified, closed-end management investment company that has elected to be regulated as a BDC, and has elected to be treated for U.S. federal income tax purposes, as a RIC under the Code. We are managed by the Adviser. The Adviser is an affiliate of Benefit Street Partners. Our Adviser is a Delaware limited liability company that is registered as an investment adviser under the Advisers Act. Our Adviser oversees the management of our activities and is responsible for making investment decisions with respect to our portfolio. 
 Our investment objective is to generate both current income and capital appreciation through debt and equity investments. We intend to invest primarily in first and second lien senior secured loans, and to a lesser extent, mezzanine loans, unsecured loans and equity of predominantly private U.S. middle market companies. We define middle market companies as those with EBITDA of between 25 million and 100 million annually, although we may invest in larger or smaller companies. We also may purchase interests in loans or corporate bonds through secondary market transactions. We expect that each investment generally will range between approximately 0.5 and 3.0 of our total assets. As of September 30, 2024, 77.2 of our portfolio was invested in senior secured loans. 
 Senior secured loans generally are senior debt instruments that rank ahead of subordinated debt and equity in priority of payments and are generally secured by liens on the operating assets of a borrower which may include inventory, receivables, plant, property and equipment. Mezzanine debt is subordinated to senior loans and is generally unsecured. 
 On December 18, 2020, we completed our Initial Closing of Capital Commitments to purchase shares of our Common Stock to investors in a private placement in reliance on exemptions from the registration requirements of the Securities Act. Since our Initial Closing, we held additional closings and received aggregate Capital Commitments to purchase Common Stock. As of September 30, 2024, investors had made aggregate Capital Commitments to purchase Common Stock of 375.5 million. At each closing of the private placement, each investor will make a Capital Commitment to purchase shares of Common Stock pursuant to a Subscription Agreement entered into with us. Investors will be required to fund drawdowns to purchase shares of Common Stock up to the amount of their respective Capital Commitments on an as-needed basis each time we deliver a notice to the investors. Closings of the private placement of our Common Stock occurred, from time to time, during the Initial Closing Period which our Board of Directors extended such that it ended December 18, 2023. After the Initial Closing Period, we may permit one or more additional closings of the private placement of our Common Stock with the approval of our Board of Directors. 
 
 On August 25, 2021, we filed the Certificate of Designation for the Series A Preferred Stock. On the same day, we entered into the Preferred Subscription Agreements with certain investors, pursuant to which investors made new Preferred Capital Commitments to purchase shares of our Series A Preferred Stock. As of September 30, 2024, total Preferred Capital Commitments of Series A Preferred Stock were 77.5 million. 
 
 On January 24, 2024, we consummated the transactions contemplated by the Agreement and Plan of Merger (the Merger Agreement with Franklin BSP Lending Corporation, a Maryland corporation FBLC ), Franklin BSP Merger Sub, Inc., a Maryland corporation and our direct wholly-owned subsidiary Merger Sub ), and, solely for the limited purposes set forth therein, the Adviser. In connection therewith, Merger Sub merged with and into FBLC (the Merger ), with FBLC continuing as the surviving company and as our wholly-owned subsidiary, followed by FBLC merging with and into us (together with the Merger, the Mergers ), and with us continuing as the surviving company. See Note 17 - Merger with FBLC for further information regarding the Mergers.

 Portfolio and Investment Activity 
 We invest primarily in first and second lien senior secured loans, and to a lesser extent, mezzanine loans, unsecured loans and equity of predominantly private U.S. middle market companies. We define middle market companies as those with EBITDA of between 25 million and 100 million annually, although we may invest in larger or smaller companies. We also may purchase interests in loans or corporate bonds through secondary market transactions. 
 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we made 785.8 million of investments in new portfolio companies and had 532.5 million in aggregate amount of sales and repayments, resulting in net investments of 253.3 million for the period, excluding any impact from the Mergers. The total portfolio of debt investments at fair value consisted of 95.3 bearing variable interest rates and 4.7 bearing fixed interest rates.

 (2) Weighted average current yield for Collateralized Securities is based on the estimation of effective yield to expected maturity for each security as calculated in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification ("ASC") Topic 325-40-35, Beneficial Interests in Securitized Financial Assets (see Note 2 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies ). 
 (3) Weighted average current yield for Equity/Other may be based on actual or annualized income, where applicable. 
 (4) As of September 30, 2024, FBLC Senior Loan Fund, LLC's holdings consisted of 93.1 senior secured debt, of which 91.8 represented senior secured first lien debt. As of September 30, 2024, we held investments in Siena Capital Finance, LLC ("Siena") consisting of subordinated debt and equity, which represented 1.3 and 2.0 of our total portfolio, respectively. As of September 30, 2024, we held investments in Post Road Equipment Finance, LLC Post Road consisting of subordinated debt and equity, which represented 2.6 and 3.1 of our total portfolio, respectively. The respective businesses of Siena and Post Road primarily involve making senior secured asset-based loans to middle market companies and equipment finance transactions secured by mission-critical equipment of middle market companies, respectively. If the underlying investments of FBLC Senior Loan Fund described above were held by us and we were to treat the investments in Siena and Post Road as senior secured first lien investments, given the underlying businesses of those portfolio companies, then our portfolio composition as of September 30, 2024 would be as follows: 
 September 30, 2024 Percentage of Total Portfolio Senior Secured First Lien Debt 92.4 Senior Secured Second Lien Debt 3.4 Senior Secured - Subtotal 95.8 Subordinated Debt 1.1 Collateralized Securities 1.5 Equity/Other 1.6 Total 100.0 
 During the year ended December 31, 2023, we made 77.0 million of investments in new portfolio companies and had 101.7 million in aggregate amount of sales and repayments, resulting in net investments of (24.7) million for the period. The total portfolio of debt investments at fair value consisted of 98.0 bearing variable interest rates and 2.0 bearing fixed interest rates.

If we were to treat the investments in Post Road as senior secured first lien investments, given the underlying business of this portfolio company, then our portfolio composition as of December 31, 2023 would be as follows:

 Portfolio Asset Quality 
 Our Adviser employs an investment rating system to categorize our investments. In addition to various risk management and monitoring tools, our Adviser grades the credit risk of all debt investments on a scale of 1 to 5 no less frequently than quarterly. This system is intended primarily to reflect the underlying risk of a portfolio debt investment relative to the inherent risk at the time the original debt investment was made (i.e., at the time of acquisition), although it may also take into account under certain circumstances the performance of the portfolio company's business, the collateral coverage of the investment and other relevant factors. 
 Loan Rating Summary Description 1 Debt investment exceeding fundamental performance expectations and/or capital gain expected. Trends and risk factors since the time of investment are favorable. 
 2 Performing consistent with expectations and a full return of principal and interest expected. Trends and risk factors are neutral to favorable. All investments are initially rated a 2 . 3 Performing debt investment requiring closer monitoring. Trends and risk factors show some deterioration. 4 Underperforming debt investment. Some loss of interest or dividend expected, but still expecting a positive return on investment. Trends and risk factors are negative. 5 Underperforming debt investment with expected loss of interest and some principal. 
 
 91 

The weighted average risk rating of our investments based on fair value was 2.2 and 2.3 a s of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 , respectively. As of September 30, 2024 we had seven portfolio companies on non-accrual with a total amortized cost of 59.1 million and fair value of 42.9 million, which r epresented 1.5 and 1.1 of t he investment portfolio's total amortized cost and fair value, respectively. As of December 31, 2023 , we had no p ortfolio companies on non-accrual status. The increase of portfolio companies on non-accrual status was partially a result of the Mergers; whereby, we acquired FBLC s assets, including its non-accrual assets. Refer to Note 2 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies for additional details regarding our non-accrual policy. 
 FBLC Senior Loan Fund, LLC 
 On January 24, 2024, as a result of the consummation of the Mergers, we became party to the joint venture formed on January 20, 2021, between FBLC and Cliffwater Corporate Lending Fund CCLF ), FBLC Senior Loan Fund, LLC SLF ). SLF invests primarily in senior secured loans, and to a lesser extent may invest in mezzanine loans, unsecured loans and equity of predominantly private U.S. middle market companies. SLF was formed as a Delaware limited liability company and is not consolidated by us for financial reporting purposes. We provide capital to SLF in the form of LLC equity interests. At formation, FBLC and CCLF owned 87.5 and 12.5 , respectively, of the LLC equity interests of SLF. On July 2, 2024, the Company contributed 100.0 million of additional capital into SLF. As of September 30, 2024, we and CCLF owned 84.0 and 16.0 , respectively, of the LLC equity interests of SLF. Profit and loss are allocated based on each members' ownership percentage of the joint venture's net asset value. SLF has an Administrative and Loan Services Agreement with BSP, our affiliate, pursuant to which BSP provides certain operational and valuation services for SLF's investments; as well as certain agreements with third-party service providers.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 
 
 Investments 
 Our level of investment activity can and does vary substantially from period to period depending on many factors, including the amount of debt and equity capital available to middle market companies, the level of merger and acquisition activity for such companies, the general economic environment, the amount of capital we have available to us and the competitive environment for the type of investments we make. 
 Our investment objective is to generate both current income and capital appreciation through debt and equity investments. We invest primarily in first and second lien senior secured loans, and to a lesser extent, mezzanine loans, unsecured loans and equity of predominantly private U.S. middle market companies. We define middle market companies as those with EBITDA of between 25 million and 100 million annually, although we may invest in larger or smaller companies. We also may purchase interests in loans or corporate bonds through secondary market transactions, which refers to acquisitions from secondary market participants rather than from the portfolio company directly. 
 As a BDC, we are generally required to invest at least 70 of our total assets primarily in securities of private and certain U.S. public companies (other than certain financial institutions), cash, cash equivalents and U.S. government securities and other limited float high quality debt investments that mature in one year or less. 
 
 Revenues 
 We generate revenues primarily in the form of interest income on debt investments we hold, and to a lesser extent, capital gains and distributions, if any, on equity securities that we may acquire in portfolio companies. Some of our investments may provide for deferred interest payments or PIK income. 
 In addition, we may generate revenue in the form of fee income such as structuring fees, origination, closing, amendment fees, commitment, termination, and other upfront fees. We do not expect to receive material fee income as it is not our principal investment strategy. Upon the re-payment of a loan or debt security, any prepayment penalties and unamortized loan origination, structuring, closing, commitment, and other upfront fees are recorded as income. 
 
 Expenses 
 We will bear all out-of-pocket costs and expenses of our operations and transactions, including, but not limited to: 
 expenses incurred by the Adviser and payable to third parties, including agents, consultants and other advisors, in monitoring our financial and legal affairs, news and quotation subscriptions, and market or industry research expenses; 
 the cost of calculating our NAV; the cost of effecting sales and repurchases of shares of our Common Stock and other securities; 
 management and incentive fees payable pursuant to the Investment Advisory Agreement; fees payable to third parties, including agents, consultants and other advisors, relating to, or associated with, making investments, and, if necessary, enforcing its rights, and valuing investments (including third-party valuation firms); 
 expenses related to consummated or unconsummated investments, including dead deal or broken deal expenses; rating agency expenses; fees to arrange our debt financings; 
 distributions on our shares; administration fees payable under the Administration Agreement; 
 the allocated costs incurred by our Administrator in providing managerial assistance to those portfolio companies that request it; transfer agent and custodial fees; fees and expenses associated with marketing efforts (including attendance at investment conferences and similar events); accounting, audit and tax preparation expenses; 
 federal and state registration fees; any exchange listing fees; federal, state, local, and other taxes; 
 
 94 

costs and expenses incurred in relation to compliance with applicable laws and regulations and our operation and administration generally; 
 independent directors fees and expenses; 
 brokerage commissions; costs of proxy statements, stockholders reports and notices; costs of preparing government filings, including periodic and current reports with the SEC; our fidelity bond, directors and officers/errors and omissions liability insurance, and any other insurance premiums; indemnification payments; 
 expenses relating to the development and maintenance of our website, if any; other operations and technology costs; 
 direct costs and expenses of administration, including printing, mailing, copying, telephone, fees of independent accountants and outside legal costs; and 
 all other expenses incurred by us or our Administrator in connection with administering our business, including, but not limited to, payments under the Administration Agreement based upon our allocable portion of our Administrator s overhead in performing its obligations under the Administration Agreement, including rent, travel and the allocable portion of the cost of our Chief Compliance Officer and Chief Financial Officer and their respective staffs, including operations and tax professionals and administrative staff who provide support services in respect of us. 
 Our operating results for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 were as follows (dollars in thousands): 
 For the three months ended September 30, For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 2023 2024 2023 Total investment income 106,184 24,290 307,359 70,558 Expenses, net of incentive fee waiver 60,910 10,171 162,456 30,324 Income tax expense, including excise tax 869 50 2,084 468 Net investment income (loss) 44,405 14,069 142,819 39,766 
 
 Investment Income 
 
 Investment income increased from 24.3 million and 70.6 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively, to 106.2 million and 307.4 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively. The increase is primarily driven by the Mergers with FBLC, which resulted in the acquisition of 2.8 billion of FBLC s investments at fair value on January 24, 2024. As a result of the Mergers, our investment portfolio at amortized cost increased to 3.8 billion as of September 30, 2024 from 769.0 million as of December 31, 2023 . PIK income from investments also increased from 2.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 to 14.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. Fee and other income, included within total investment income, was at 0.1 million and 0.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023. Fee and other income decreased from 1.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 to 0.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, primarily due to a decrease in one-time fees earned on certain investments, including commitment, prepayment fees and accelerated amortization of upfront fees from unscheduled paydowns. 

95 

Operating Expenses 
 The composition of our operating expenses for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 were as follows (dollars in thousands): 
 For the three months ended September 30, For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 2023 2024 2023 Management fees 14,613 1,079 38,931 3,122 Incentive fee on income 8,820 2,109 26,843 5,963 Interest and debt fees 33,166 7,842 84,377 23,445 Professional fees 2,079 493 5,887 1,516 Other general and administrative 1,755 413 4,872 1,325 Administrative services 222 48 692 197 Directors' fees 255 296 854 719 Incentive fee waiver (2,109) (5,963) Expenses, net of incentive fee waiver 60,910 10,171 162,456 30,324 
 Management Fees 
 
 Management fees increased from 1.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023 to 14.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024. Management fees increased from 3.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 to 38.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. The increase in management fees for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 to the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 was driven by an increase in our asset base due to the Mergers with FBLC. Total assets increased from 831.7 million as of December 31, 2023 to 4.0 billion as of September 30, 2024. 
 
 Incentive Fees 
 
 Incentive fees increased from 2.1 million (all of which were waived by the Adviser) for the three months ended September 30, 2023 to 8.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024. Incentive fees increased from 6.0 million (all of which were waived by the Adviser) for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 to 26.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. The increase in incentive fees from the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 to the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 was driven by an increase in pre-incentive fee net investment income due to the Mergers with FBLC and the expiration of the incentive fee waiver. 
 
 Interest and debt fees 
 
 Interest and debt fees increased from 7.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023 to 33.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024. Interest and debt fees increased from 23.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 to 84.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. The increase for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 to the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 is primarily driven by the Mergers with FBLC, which resulted in the acquisition of 1.2 billion of FBLC s debt on January 24, 2024 as well as the issuance of our 2029 Notes (as defined below). The average daily debt outstanding for facility borrowings and unsecured notes for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 was 0.4 billion compared to 1.5 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. The weighted average annualized interest cost of the facility borrowings and unsecured notes for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 were 6.88 and 7.63 , respectively. 

96 

Professional Fees and Other General and Administrative Expenses 
 
 Professional fees and other general and administrative expenses increased from 0.9 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023 to 3.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024. Professional fees and other general and administrative expenses increased from 2.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 to 10.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. The increase in professional fees and other general and administrative expenses from the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 to the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily driven by an increase in costs associated with servicing a larger investment portfolio due to the Mergers with FBLC. 
 
 Net Realized Gain (Loss) and Net Change in Unrealized Appreciation (Depreciation) on Investments 
 Net realized gain (loss) and net change in unrealized appreciation (depreciation) on investments for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 were as follows (dollars in thousands): 
 For the three months ended September 30, For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 2023 2024 2023 Net realized gain (loss) Control Investments (3) (6) Affiliate Investments 195 557 Non-affiliate investments (22,859) (211) (21,685) (341) Total net realized gain (loss) (22,667) (211) (21,134) (341) Net change in unrealized appreciation (depreciation) on investments Control investments (3,588) (2) (14,604) (11) Affiliate Investments 839 (1,477) Non-affiliate investments 12,197 1,150 (14,257) (1,785) Net change in deferred taxes (638) (6) (1,667) (521) Total net change in unrealized appreciation (depreciation) on investments 8,810 1,142 (32,005) (2,317) Net realized and unrealized gain (loss) (13,857) 931 (53,139) (2,658) 
 
 Net Realized Gain (Loss) on Investments 
 
 Realized gains or losses are measured using the specific identification method whereby we measure the gain or loss by the difference between the net proceeds from repayment or sale and the amortized cost basis of the investment, without regard to unrealized appreciation or depreciation previously recognized. 
 
 For the three months ended September 30, 2024, we recorded a net realized loss of (22.7) million. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we recorded a net realized loss of (21.1) million. The net realized loss for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily driven by the restructuring of the first lien debt investments of Pluralsight, LLC in August 2024 which resulted in a realized loss of (19.1) million offset by an unrealized gain of 18.5 million. 
 
 For the three months ended September 30, 2023, we recorded a net realized loss of (0.2) million. For the nine months ended September 30, 2023, we recorded a net realized loss of (0.3) million. The net realized loss for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 was primarily driven by realized losses on senior secured investments. 
 
 Net Change in Unrealized Appreciation (Depreciation) on Investments 
 
 Net change in unrealized appreciation or depreciation is the change in portfolio investment values during the reporting period, including any reversal of previously recorded unrealized appreciation or depreciation, when gains or losses are realized. 

97 

For the three months ended September 30, 2024, we recorded unrealized appreciation of 35.6 million on 133 portfolio company investments, which was offset by 26.2 million of unrealized depreciation on 180 portfolio company investments. The unrealized appreciation primarily resulted from improved performance of certain portfolio companies, the reversal of previously recorded unrealized depreciation, and the Pluralsight, LLC restructure. The unrealized depreciation was primarily due to isolated deterioration in the credit performance of a small number of portfolio companies, and the reversal of previously recorded unrealized appreciation. Additionally, 0.6 million of the net unrealized loss was driven by a change in deferred taxes. The overall net unrealized appreciation on our portfolio was primarily driven by the reversal of previously recorded unrealized depreciation. 
 
 For the three months ended September 30, 2023, we recorded unrealized appreciation of 3.1 million on 45 portfolio company investments which was offset by 1.9 million of unrealized depreciation on 69 portfolio company investments. The unrealized appreciation primarily resulted from improved performance of certain portfolio companies and the reversal of previously recorded unrealized depreciation. The unrealized depreciation was primarily due to isolated deterioration in the credit performance of a small number of portfolio companies. The overall net unrealized appreciation on our portfolio was primarily driven by improved performance of certain portfolio companies. 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we recorded unrealized appreciation of 28.2 million on 145 portfolio company investments, which was offset by 58.5 million of unrealized depreciation on 184 portfolio company investments. The unrealized appreciation primarily resulted from improved performance of certain portfolio companies and the reversal of previously recorded unrealized depreciation. The unrealized depreciation was primarily due to isolated deterioration in the credit performance of a small number of portfolio companies. Additionally, 1.7 million of the net unrealized loss was driven by a change in deferred taxes. The overall net unrealized depreciation on our portfolio was primarily driven by deterioration in the credit performance of certain portfolio companies. 
 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2023, we recorded unrealized appreciation of 4.5 million on 43 portfolio company investments which was offset by 6.3 million of unrealized depreciation on 79 portfolio company investments. The unrealized appreciation primarily resulted from improved performance of certain portfolio companies and the reversal of previously recorded unrealized depreciation in 2022. The unrealized depreciation primarily resulted from isolated deterioration in the credit performance of a small number of portfolio companies and the reversal of unrealized appreciation in 2022. Additionally, 0.5 million of the net unrealized loss was driven by a change in deferred taxes. The overall net unrealized depreciation on our portfolio was primarily driven by deterioration in the credit performance of certain portfolio companies.

Supplemental Information 
 
 On January 24, 2024, we completed our previously announced acquisition of FBLC. Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, Merger Sub was first merged with and into FBLC, with FBLC continuing as the surviving company, and, immediately following the Merger, FBLC was then merged with and into us, with us continuing as the surviving company. In accordance with the terms of the Merger Agreement, at the effective time, each outstanding share of FBLC's common stock was converted into the right to receive 0.4647 shares of our common stock. As a result of the Mergers, we issued an aggregate of 110.0 million shares of our common stock to FBLC stockholders. 
 The Merger was accounted for as an asset acquisition of FBLC by us in accordance with the asset acquisition method of accounting as detailed in ASC 805, Business Combinations, with the fair value of total consideration paid, including transaction costs, in conjunction with the Mergers allocated to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their relative fair values as of the date of the Mergers. The consideration paid to FBLC stockholders was more than the aggregate fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed, which resulted in a purchase price premium. The purchase premium was allocated to the cost basis of the FBLC investments acquired by us on a pro-rata basis based on their relative fair values as of the effective time of the Merger. The purchase premium allocated to the debt investments acquired will amortize over the life of each respective debt investment through interest income, with a corresponding adjustment recorded to unrealized depreciation on such investment acquired through its ultimate disposition. The purchase premium allocated to equity investments acquired will not amortize over the life of such investments through interest income and, assuming no subsequent change to the fair value of the equity investments acquired and disposition of such equity investments at fair value, we will recognize a realized loss with a corresponding reversal of the unrealized depreciation on disposition of such equity investments acquired. Any adjustments to the cost basis of the acquired FBLC investments derived from the accounting treatment of the Mergers will be excluded from the incentive fee calculation. 
 As a supplement to our financial results reported in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America U.S. GAAP ), we have provided, as detailed below, certain non-GAAP financial measures to our operating results that exclude the aforementioned purchase premium and the ongoing amortization thereof, as determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The non-GAAP financial measures include (i) adjusted net investment income after taxes; and (ii) adjusted net realized and unrealized gains (losses). We believe that the adjustment to exclude the full effect of the purchase premium is meaningful because it is a measure that we and investors use to assess our financial condition and results of operations. Although these non-GAAP financial measures are intended to enhance investors understanding of our business and performance, these non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered as an alternative to U.S. GAAP. The aforementioned non-GAAP financial measures may not be comparable to similar non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies.

 Distribution Declarations 
 
 On November 8, 2024, our Board of Directors declared a regular quarterly distribution of 0.29 per share of Common Stock and a special distribution of 0.04 per share of Common Stock, both of which will be paid on or around November 18, 2024 to stockholders of record as of November 8, 2024.

 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 We generate cash primarily from the net proceeds of the purchase of shares of our Common Stock and Series A Preferred Stock via drawdowns on our investors capital commitments, cash flows from interest and fees earned from our investments and principal repayments and proceeds from sales of our investments. As of September 30, 2024, we had issued 134.8 million shares of our Common Stock for net proceeds of 2.0 billion, including shares issued pursuant to the DRIP. We had also issued 77,500 shares of Series A Preferred Stock for gross proceeds of 77.4 million.

We had also issued 77,500 shares of Series A Preferred Stock for gross proceeds of 77.4 million. 
 As of September 30, 2024, we had 153.7 million of cash. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, net cash used in operating activities was 62.2 million. The level of cash flows used in or provided by operating activities is affected by the timing of purchases, redemptions, and sales of portfolio investments. The cash flows used in operating activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily a result of purchases of investments of 785.8 million, offset by sales and repayments of investments of 532.5 million as well as cash received in the Mergers of 58.5 million. As of September 30, 2023, we had 70.0 million of cash. For the nine months ended September 30, 2023, net cash provided by operating activities was 47.0 million. The level of cash flows used in or provided by operating activities is affected by the timing of purchases, redemptions, and sales of portfolio investments. The cash flows provided by operating activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 was primarily a result of purchases of investments of 46.4 million, partially offset by sales and repayments of investments of 71.0 million. 
 
 Net cash provided by financing activities of 160.6 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 primarily related to payments on debt of 509.0 million, payments of financing costs of 4.4 million, common stockholder distributions of 77.4 million, preferred stockholder distributions of 5.6 million, and repurchases of common stock of 43.0 million partially offset by proceeds from debt of 801.7 million and proceeds from issuance of shares of common stock of 0.9 million. Net cash used by financing activities of 3.3 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2023 primarily related to payments on debt of 70.4 million, repayments on short-term borrowings of 89.4 million, common stockholder distributions of 23.3 million, and preferred stockholder distributions of 5.4 million partially offset by proceeds from issuance of shares of common stock of 9.9 million, proceeds from issuance of shares of preferred stock of 41.4 million, proceeds from debt of 32.0 million, and proceeds from short-term borrowings of 68.6 million. 
 
 100 

We also fund a portion of our investments through borrowings from banks. Our primary use of cash will be investments in portfolio companies, payments of our expenses and payment of cash distributions to our stockholders. As of September 30, 2024, we are party to the JPM and Wells Fargo Credit Facilities, which are defined in and described in more detail in Note 5 - Borrowings . We are only allowed to borrow money such that our asset coverage, which, as defined in the 1940 Act, measures the ratio of total assets less total liabilities not represented by senior securities to total borrowings, equals at least 150 after such borrowing, with certain limited exceptions. As of September 30, 2024, our asset coverage ratio was 198 . 
 As of September 30, 2024, we had 400.8 million of availability under the JPM Credit Facility, Wells Fargo Credit Facility, FBLC JPM Credit Facility, and JPM Revolver (subject to borrowing base availability). As of September 30, 2023, we had 56.5 million of availability under the MS Credit Facility (subject to borrowing base availability), and had approximately 217.7 million of uncalled capital commitments to purchase shares of our Common Stock. We expect to have sufficient liquidity for our investing activities and to conduct our operations for the next 12 months. 

Taxation as a RIC 
 We have elected to be treated as a RIC under Subchapter M of the Code. As a RIC, we generally will not be subject to corporate-level U.S. federal income taxes on any income that we distribute as dividends for U.S. federal income tax purposes to our stockholders. To maintain our qualification as a RIC, we must, among other things, meet certain source-of-income and asset diversification requirements. In addition, in order to maintain RIC tax treatment, we must distribute to our stockholders, for each tax year, an amount equal to at least 90 of our investment company taxable income, which is generally our net ordinary income plus the excess, if any, of realized net short-term capital gain over realized net long-term capital loss and determined without regard to any deduction for dividends paid, or the annual distribution requirement. Even if we qualify as a RIC, we generally will be subject to corporate-level U.S. federal income tax on our undistributed taxable income and could be subject to state, local, and foreign taxes. 
 Additionally, in order to avoid the imposition of a U.S. federal excise tax, we are required to distribute, in respect of each calendar year, dividends to our stockholders of an amount at least equal to the sum of 98 of our calendar year net ordinary income (taking into account certain deferrals and elections); 98.2 of our capital gain net income (adjusted for certain ordinary losses) for the one year period ending on December 31 of such calendar year; and any net ordinary income and capital gain net income for preceding calendar years that were not distributed during such calendar years and on which we previously did not incur any U.S. federal income tax. If we fail to qualify as a RIC for any reason and become subject to U.S federal income corporate tax, the resulting corporate taxes could substantially reduce our net assets, the amount of income available for distribution and the amount of our distributions. Such a failure would have a material adverse effect on us and our stockholders. In addition, we could be required to recognize unrealized gains, incur substantial taxes and interest and make substantial distributions in order to re-qualify as a RIC. We cannot assure stockholders that they will receive any distributions. 
 
 Distributions 
 The amount of each distribution is subject to the discretion of our Board of Directors and applicable legal restrictions related to the payment of distributions. We calculate each stockholder s specific distribution amount for the quarter using record and declaration dates. 
 
 The table shows the components of the distributions we have declared and/or paid to common stockholders for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 (dollars in thousands): 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 2023 Distributions declared 100,499 32,458 Distributions paid 100,512 32,478 Portion of distributions paid in cash 77,434 23,268 Portion of distributions paid in DRIP shares 23,078 9,210

The table shows the components of the distributions we have declared and/or paid to preferred stockholders during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 (dollars in thousands): 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 2023 Distributions declared 5,570 5,418 Distributions paid 5,570 5,418 Portion of distributions paid in cash 5,570 5,418 Portion of distributions paid in DRIP shares 
 
 We may fund our cash distributions to stockholders from any sources of funds available to us, including advances from the Adviser that are subject to reimbursement, as well as offering proceeds, borrowings, net investment income from operations, capital gain proceeds from the sale of assets, and non-capital gain proceeds from the sale of assets. We have not established limits on the amount of funds we may use from available sources to make distributions. We may have distributions which could be characterized as a return of capital for tax purposes. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, no portion of our distributions was characterized as return of capital for tax purposes. The specific tax characteristics of our distributions made in respect of our anticipated fiscal year ending December 31, 2024 will be reported to stockholders shortly after the end of the calendar year 2024 as well as in our periodic reports with the SEC. Stockholders should read any written disclosure accompanying a distribution payment carefully and should not assume that the source of any distribution is our ordinary income or gain. Moreover, you should understand that any such distributions were not based on our investment performance and can only be sustained if we achieve positive investment performance in future periods and/or our Adviser continues to make such reimbursements. There can be no assurance that we will achieve the performance necessary to sustain our distributions or that we will be able to pay distributions at all. 
 
 Related Party Transactions and Agreements 
 Investment Advisory Agreement 
 
 We entered into an amendment and restatement of the Investment Advisory Agreement (the Amended and Restated Investment Advisory Agreement ), dated as of January 24, 2024, which was approved by our Board of Directors and our stockholders in connection with the consummation of the Mergers, under which the Adviser, subject to the overall supervision of our Board of Directors manages the day-to-day operations of, and provides investment advisory services to us. Affiliates of the Adviser also provide investment advisory services to other funds that have investment mandates that are similar, in whole and in part, with ours. Affiliates of the Adviser also serve as investment adviser or sub-adviser to private funds and registered open-end funds, and as an investment adviser to a public real estate investment trust. The Adviser has adopted policies designed to manage and mitigate the conflicts of interest associated with the allocation of investment opportunities. In addition, any affiliated fund currently formed or formed in the future and managed by the Adviser or its affiliates may have overlapping investment objectives with our own and, accordingly, may invest in asset classes similar to those targeted by us. However, in certain instances due to regulatory, tax, investment, or other restrictions, certain investment opportunities may not be appropriate for either us or other funds managed by the Adviser or its affiliates. 

102 

Administration Agreement 
 On September 23, 2020, we entered into the Administration Agreement with BSP, pursuant to which BSP provides us with office facilities and administrative services. We reimburse BSP quarterly for all administrative costs and expenses incurred by our Adviser in performing our obligations under the Administration Agreement and annually for overhead expenses incurred in the course of performing our obligations under the Administration Agreement, including rent, travel and the allocable portion of the cost of our Chief Compliance Officer and Chief Financial Officer and their respective staffs, including operations and tax professionals, and administrative staff providing support services in respect of us. The Administration Agreement may be terminated by either party without penalty upon not less than 60 days written notice to the other. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, we incurred 0.8 million and 2.4 million, respectively, in administrative service fees under the administrative agreement, which are included in other general and administrative on the consolidated statements of operations in the accompanying consolidated financial statements. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, we incurred 0.3 million and 0.9 million, respectively, in administrative service fees under the administrative agreement, which are included in other general and administrative on the consolidated statements of operations in the accompanying consolidated financial statements. 
 
 Co-Investment Relief 
 The 1940 Act generally prohibits BDCs from entering into negotiated co-investments with affiliates absent an order from the SEC. The SEC staff has granted the Company exemptive relief that allows it to enter into certain negotiated co-investment transactions alongside with other funds managed by the Adviser or its affiliates Affiliated Funds in a manner consistent with its investment objective, positions, policies, strategies, and restrictions as well as regulatory requirements and other pertinent factors, subject to compliance with certain conditions (the Order ). Pursuant to the Order, the Company is permitted to co-invest with its affiliates if a required majority (as defined in Section 57(o) of the 1940 Act) of its eligible directors make certain conclusions in connection with a co-investment transaction, including that (1) the terms of the transactions, including the consideration to be paid, are reasonable and fair to the Company and the Company s stockholders and do not involve overreaching in respect of the Company or the Company s stockholders on the part of any person concerned, and (2) the transaction is consistent with the interests of the Company s stockholders and is consistent with the Company s investment objective and strategies. 
 
 Borrowings 
 We are only allowed to borrow money such that our asset coverage, which, as defined in the 1940 Act, measures the ratio of total assets less total liabilities not represented by senior securities to total borrowings, equals at least 150 after such borrowing, with certain limited exceptions. As of September 30, 2024, the aggregate principal amount outstanding of the senior securities issued by us was 2.0 billion and our asset coverage was 198 . We are continually exploring forms of debt financing which could include new or expanded credit facilities or the issuance of senior securities that are debt or stock. We may use borrowed funds, known as leverage, to make investments and to attempt to increase returns to our stockholders by reducing our overall cost of capital. We currently have credit facilities with JPMorgan and Wells Fargo. 

JPM Credit Facility 
 
 On October 4, 2023, we refinanced the MS Credit Facility with a 400.0 million credit facility with FBCC Jupiter Funding, LLC, a wholly-owned, consolidated special purpose financing subsidiary of us, as borrower Jupiter Funding ), the Adviser, as portfolio manager, the lenders party thereto, U.S. Bank National Association, as securities intermediary, U.S. Bank Trust Company, National Association as collateral administrator and collateral agent, and JPMorgan Chase Bank, National Association, as administrative agent (the JPM Credit Facility ). The JPM Credit Facility provides for borrowings through October 4, 2026, and any amounts borrowed under the JPM Credit Facility will mature on October 4, 2027. Borrowings under the JPM Credit Facility will bear interest at a benchmark rate, currently SOFR, plus a margin of 2.75 per annum, which is inclusive of an administrative agent fee. Interest is payable quarterly in arrears. Jupiter Funding will be subject to a non-usage fee of 0.75 , which is inclusive of the administrative agent fee, to the extent the commitments available under the JPM Credit Facility have not been borrowed. Jupiter Funding paid an upfront fee and incurred other customary costs and expenses in connection with the JPM Credit Facility. 

103 

Short-Term Borrowings 
 From time to time, we finance the purchase of certain investments through repurchase agreements. In the repurchase agreements, we enter into a trade to sell an investment and contemporaneously enter into a trade to buy the same investment back on a specified date in the future with the same counterparty. Investments sold under repurchase agreements are accounted for as collateralized borrowings as the sale of the investment does not qualify for sale accounting under ASC Topic 860 Transfers and Servicing and remains as an investment on the consolidated statements of assets and liabilities. We use repurchase agreements as a short-term financing alternative. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we had no short-term borrowings outstanding. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, we recorded no interest expense in connection with short-term borrowings. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, we recorded interest expense of 0.4 and 1.7 million, respectively, in connection with short-term borrowings. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we did not have outstanding short term borrowing. For the nine months ended September 30, 2023, we had an average outstanding balance of short-term borrowings of 27.1 million and bore interest at a weighted average rate of 0.02 . 
 Secured Borrowings 
 On August 21, 2023, we entered into a total return swap TRS with Nomura Global Financial Products Inc. Nomura ). A TRS is a contract in which one party agrees to make periodic payments to another party based on the change in the market value of the assets underlying the TRS, which may include a specified security, basket of securities or securities indices during the specified period, in return for periodic payments based on a fixed or variable interest rate. We pay interest to Nomura for each loan at a rate equal to three-month SOFR plus 3.60 per annum. On April 24, 2024, the rate was amended to three-month SOFR plus 2.80 per annum. Upon the termination or repayment of any loan under the TRS, we will either receive from Nomura the appreciation in the value of such loan or pay to Nomura any depreciation in the value of such loan. The scheduled termination date for the TRS is February 17, 2025. We may terminate the TRS prior to February 17, 2025 upon the occurrence of certain events but in certain circumstances may be required to pay certain termination fees. 
 
 As of September 30, 2024, all total return swaps on the Nomura TRS were entered into contemporaneously with our sale of their reference assets. Due to our continuing involvement in these assets, these assets are not derecognized under ASC Topic 860 -- Transfers and Servicing , and are presented on our consolidated schedule of investments. Financing amounts related to these assets are presented as secured borrowings on our consolidated statement of assets and liabilities. Any margin paid to the counterparty under the terms of the TRS agreement is included in the Due from broker on our consolidated statements of assets and liabilities. 
 
 The TRS is subject to the SEC rule related to the use of derivatives, reverse repurchase agreements and certain other transactions by registered investment companies. The rule requires that we trade derivatives and other transactions that create future payment or delivery obligations subject to a value-at-risk leverage limit and certain derivatives risk management program and reporting requirements. Generally, these requirements apply unless we qualify as a limited derivatives user, as defined in the rule, in which case certain exceptions to these conditions would apply. We may qualify as a limited derivatives user if it adopts and implements written policies and procedures reasonably designed to manage our derivatives risk and our derivatives exposure does not exceed 10 percent of our net assets as calculated in accordance with the rule. 
 
 As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we had secured borrowings outstanding of 30.8 million and 33.3 million, respectively. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, we recorded interest expense of 0.5 million and 1.5 million in connection with secured borrowings. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, we recorded interest expense of 0.2 million and 0.2 million in connection with secured borrowings. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we had an average outstanding balance of secured borrowings of 31.3 million and bore interest at a weighted average rate of 6.39 . For the period August 21, 2023 through September 30, 2023, the Company had an average outstanding balance of secured borrowings of 24.1 million and bore interest at a weighted average rate of 8.98 .

Wells Fargo Credit Facility 
 
 On January 24, 2024, as a result of the consummation of the Mergers we became party to a 300.0 million revolving credit facility with us as collateral manager, Funding I, a wholly owned, consolidated special purpose financing subsidiary, as borrower, the lenders party thereto, Wells Fargo, as administrative agent, and U.S. Bank Trust Company, National Association, as collateral agent and collateral custodian (the Wells Fargo Credit Facility ).

The non-usage fee per annum is 0.50 for the first 25 of the unused balance and increases to 2.00 for any remaining unused balance. Pursuant to the Wells Fargo Credit Facility Amendment, the non-usage fee per annum is now 0.50 for the first 70 of the unused balance and increases to 2.00 for any remaining unused balance. 
 Funding I s obligations under the Wells Fargo Credit Facility are secured by a first priority security interest in substantially all of the assets of Funding I, including its portfolio of investments and FBCC s equity interest in Funding I. The obligations of Funding I under the Wells Fargo Credit Facility are non-recourse to FBCC. 
 In connection with the Wells Fargo Credit Facility, FBCC and Funding I have made certain representations and warranties and are required to comply with various covenants and other customary requirements.

FBCC and 57th Street are permitted to submit a commitment increase request to up to 800.0 million. 
 57th Street s obligations under the FBLC JPM Credit Facility are secured by a first priority security interest in substantially all of the assets of 57th Street, including its portfolio of investments and FBCC s equity interest in 57th Street. The obligations of 57th Street under the FBLC JPM Credit Facility are non-recourse to FBCC.

JPM Revolver Facility 
 On January 24, 2024, as a result of the consummation of the Mergers, we became party to a 505.0 million revolving credit facility with JPMorgan, as administrative agent and as collateral agent, N.A., Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corporation, and Wells Fargo Bank, National Association as syndication agents, as well as other Lender parties (the JPM Revolver Facility ).

 2024 Notes 
 On January 24, 2024, as a result of the consummation of the Mergers, we became party to a Purchase Agreement relating to the sale of 100.0 million aggregate principal amount of 4.85 fixed rate notes due December 15, 2024 (the 2024 Notes ). The 2024 Notes are subject to customary indemnification provisions and representations, warranties, and covenants. The net proceeds from the sale of the 2024 Notes were approximately 98.4 million.

The net proceeds from the sale of the Restricted 2026 Notes were approximately 296.0 million. Pursuant to a Registration Statement on Form N-14 (File No. 333-257321), on September 22, 2021, holders of the Restricted 2026 Notes were offered the opportunity to exchange their Restricted 2026 Notes for new registered notes with substantially identical terms (the "Unrestricted 2026 Notes" and, together with the Restricted 2026 Notes, the 2026 Notes), through which holders representing 99.88 of the outstanding principal of the then Restricted 2026 Notes obtained Unrestricted 2026 Notes. The 2026 Notes are subject to customary indemnification provisions and representations, warranties and covenants. The 2026 Notes bear interest at a rate of 3.25 per year payable semi-annually. 
 2029 Notes 
 On April 29, 2024, we entered into a purchase agreement in connection with the issuance and sale of 300.0 million aggregate principal amount of our 7.20 Notes due 2029 (the 2029 Notes ). The net proceeds from the sale of the 2029 Notes were approximately 293.0 million. The 2029 Notes were issued on May 6, 2024, pursuant to a third supplemental indenture.

 (2) As of September 30, 2024, we had no unused borrowing capacity under the Wells Fargo Credit Facility, subject to borrowing base limits. 
 (3) As of September 30, 2024, we had 80.0 million in unused borrowing capacity under the FBLC JPM Credit Facility, subject to borrowing base limits. 
 (4) As of September 30, 2024, we had 220.8 million in unused borrowing capacity under the JPM Revolver Facility, subject to borrowing base limits. 
 
 Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 
 We have no off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures, or capital resources. 
 
 Commitments 
 In the ordinary course of business, we may enter into future funding commitments. As of September 30, 2024, we had unfunded commitments on delayed draw term loans of 222.9 million, unfunded commitments on revolver term loans of 196.0 million, and unfunded commitments on term loans of 1.0 million. As of December 31, 2023, we had unfunded commitments on delayed draw term loans of 34.3 million and unfunded commitments on revolver term loans of 42.2 million. We maintain sufficient cash on hand, unfunded commitments to purchase our Common Stock, and available borrowings to fund such unfunded commitments. Please refer to Note 6 - Commitments and Contingencies in the notes to our consolidated financial statements for further detail of these unfunded commitments. 
 
 Critical Accounting Estimates 
 Our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. On an on-going basis, we will evaluate our estimates, including those related to the matters described below. Actual results could differ from those estimates. 
 While our significant accounting policies are also described in Note 2 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies of our notes to our consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere in this report, we believe the following accounting policies require the most significant judgment in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements. 

107 

Valuation of Portfolio Investments 
 
 We are required to report our investments, including those for which current market values are not readily available, at fair value in accordance with ASC 820, Fair Value Measurements ASC 820 ), which defines fair value as the amount that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the applicable measurement date, and Rule 2a-5 under the 1940 Act. 
 
 Investments for which market quotations are readily available are typically valued at those market quotations. All investments that are not publicly traded or whose market prices are not readily available, as is the case for substantially all of our investments, are valued at fair value as determined in good faith by our Valuation Designee, subject to oversight from our Board of Directors. 
 
 As part of the valuation process, our Valuation Designee takes into account relevant factors in determining the fair value of our investments, including and in combination of: 
 
 the estimated enterprise value of a portfolio company; 
 indicative dealer quotes; 
 the nature and realizable value of any collateral; 
 the portfolio company s ability to make payments based on its earnings and cash flow; 
 the markets in which the portfolio company does business; 
 a comparison of the portfolio company s securities to any similar publicly traded securities; and 
 overall changes in the interest rate environment and the credit markets that may affect the price at which similar investments may be made in the future. 
 Our Valuation Designee, subject to oversight from our Board of Directors, undertakes a multi-step valuation process each quarter in connection with determining the fair value of our investments for which reliable market quotations are not readily available, or are available but deemed not reflective of the fair value of an investment, which includes, among other procedures, the following: 
 Each portfolio company or investment will be valued by our Valuation Designee, with assistance from one or more independent valuation firms engaged by our Board of Directors; 
 The independent valuation firm(s) conduct independent appraisals and make an independent assessment of the value of each investment; and 
 Our Valuation Designee, under the supervision of our Board of Directors determines the fair value of each investment, in good faith, based on the input of independent valuation firms (to the extent applicable) and our Valuation Designee s own analysis. Our Valuation Designee also has established the Valuation Committee to assist our Valuation Designee in carrying out its designated responsibilities, subject to oversight of our Board of Directors. 
 
 Our Valuation Designee, subject to oversight from our Board of Directors, has and will continue to engage independent valuation firms to provide assistance regarding the determination of the fair value of our portfolio securities for which market quotations are not readily available or are readily available but deemed not reflective of the fair value of the investment each quarter, and our Valuation Designee may reasonably rely on that assistance. However, our Valuation Designee, subject to oversight from our Board of Directors, is responsible for the ultimate valuation of the portfolio investments at fair value as determined in good faith pursuant to our valuation policy and a consistently applied valuation process. 
 
 Our accounting policy on the fair value of our investments is critical because the determination of fair value involves subjective judgments and estimates. Accordingly, the notes to our consolidated financial statements express the uncertainty with respect to the possible effect of these valuations, and any change in these valuations, on the consolidated financial statements. 
 See Note 2 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies for a description of other accounting policies and recently issued accounting pronouncements.

ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 
 
 The market risk associated with financial instruments and derivative financial instruments is the risk of loss from adverse changes in market prices or interest rates. We expect our market risk will arise primarily from interest rate risk relating to interest rate fluctuations. Many factors including governmental monetary and tax policies, domestic and international economic and political considerations (including global or regional conflicts) and other factors that are beyond our control contribute to interest rate risk. To meet our short and long-term liquidity requirements, we may borrow funds at a combination of fixed and variable rates. Our interest rate risk management objectives are to limit the impact of interest rate changes in earnings and cash flows and to lower our overall borrowing costs. To achieve these objectives, from time to time, we may enter into interest rate hedge contracts such as swaps, collars and treasury lock agreements, subject to the requirements of the 1940 Act, in order to mitigate our interest rate risk with respect to various debt instruments. While hedging activities may insulate us against adverse changes in interest rates, they may also limit our ability to participate in benefits of lower interest rates with respect to our portfolio of investments with fixed interest rates. During the periods covered by this report, we did not engage in interest rate hedging activities. We would not hold or issue these derivative contracts for trading or speculative purposes. 
 As of September 30, 2024, our debt included variable-rate debt, bearing a weighted average interest rate of SOFR plus 2.33 and a fixed rate debt, bearing a weighted average interest rate of 5.16 with a total carrying value (net of deferred financing costs) of 1.9 billion. The follo wing table quantifies the potential changes in interest income net of interest expense should base interest rates increase or decrease by the amounts below assuming that our current consolidated statement of assets and liabilities was to remain constant and no actions were taken to alter our existing interest rate sensitivity. Interest rate floors, if applicable, are not reflected in the sensitivity analysis below. 
 Change in Base Interest Rates Estimated Change in Interest Income net of Interest Expense (in thousands) (-) 459 Basis Points (83,817) (-) 200 Basis Points (36,505) (-) 100 Basis Points (18,252) (-) 50 Basis Points (9,126) (+) 50 Basis Points 9,126 (+) 100 Basis Points 18,252 (+) 200 Basis Points 36,505 
 
 Because we may borrow money to make investments, our net investment income may be dependent on the difference between the rate at which we borrow funds and the rate at which we invest these funds. In periods of increasing interest rates, our cost of funds would increase, which may reduce our net investment income. As a result, there can be no assurance that a significant change in market interest rates will not have a material adverse effect on our net investment income. 
 
 Valuation Risk 
 
 We have invested, and plan to continue to invest, primarily in illiquid debt and equity securities of private companies. Most of our investments will not have a readily available market price, and our Adviser, as our Valuation Designee under Rule 2a-5, values these investments at fair value as determined in good faith subject to the oversight of our Board of Directors, based on, among other things, the input of the Adviser and independent third-party valuation firms, in accordance with our valuation policy. There is no single standard for determining fair value. As a result, determining fair value requires that judgment be applied to the specific facts and circumstances of each portfolio investment while employing a consistently applied valuation process for the types of investments we make. If we were required to liquidate a portfolio investment in a forced or liquidation sale, we may realize amounts that are different from the amounts presented. 

109 

Inflation and Supply Chain Risk 
 
 Economic activity has continued to accelerate across sectors and regions. Nevertheless, due to global supply chain issues, geopolitical events, including the outbreak of global or regional conflicts (such as those in the Middle East and Eastern Europe) a rise in energy prices and strong consumer demand as economies continue to reopen, inflation has remained elevated in the U.S. and globally. Persistent inflationary pressures could affect the profit margins of our portfolio companies. 
 
 ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 
 Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 In accordance with Rules 13a-15(b) and 15d-15(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act ), we, under the supervision and with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, carried out an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) and Rule 15d-15(e) of the Exchange Act) as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Based on the foregoing, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were (a) designed to ensure that the information we are required to disclose in our reports under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported in an accurate manner and on a timely basis and the information that we are required to disclose in our Exchange Act reports is accumulated and communicated to management to permit timely decisions with respect to required disclosure and (b) operating in an effective manner. Any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives. 
 
 Change in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
 No change occurred in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) of the Exchange Act) during the quarter ended September 30, 2024 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

This indemnity agreement shall be in addition to any liability which the Company may otherwise have. 
 14 

In case any action or proceeding (including any governmental or regulatory investigation or proceeding) shall be brought or asserted against any of the Indemnified Holders with respect to which indemnity may be sought against the Company, such Indemnified Holder (or the Indemnified Holder controlled by such Controlling Person) shall promptly notify the Company in writing provided, however, that the failure to give such notice shall not relieve any of the Company of its obligations pursuant to this Agreement unless and to the extent the Company did not otherwise learn of such action and such failure results in the forfeiture by the Company of substantial rights and defenses. Such Indemnified Holder shall have the right to employ its own counsel in any such action and the reasonable and documented fees and expenses of such counsel shall be paid, as incurred, by the Company (regardless of whether it is ultimately determined that an Indemnified Holder is not entitled to indemnification hereunder). The Company shall not, in connection with any one such action or proceeding or separate but substantially similar or related actions or proceedings in the same jurisdiction arising out of the same general allegations or circumstances, be liable for the reasonable and documented fees and expenses of more than one separate firm of attorneys (in addition to one local counsel for all indemnified parties taken as a whole in each jurisdiction reasonably required and, in the event of an actual conflict, one additional counsel in each relevant jurisdiction for the affected indemnified parties similarly situated taken as a whole) at any time for such Indemnified Holders, which firm shall be designated by the Holders. The Company shall be liable for any settlement of any such action or proceeding effected with the Company s prior written consent, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed, and the Company agrees to indemnify and hold harmless any Indemnified Holder from and against any loss, claim, damage, liability or expense by reason of any settlement of any action effected with the written consent of the Company. The Company shall not, without the prior written consent of each Indemnified Holder, settle or compromise or consent to the entry of judgment in or otherwise seek to terminate any pending or threatened action, claim, litigation or proceeding in respect of which indemnification or contribution may be sought hereunder (whether or not any Indemnified Holder is a party thereto), unless such settlement, compromise, consent or termination (i) includes a complete and unconditional release of each Indemnified Holder from all liability arising out of such action, claim, litigation or proceeding and (ii) does not include a statement as to or an admission of fault, culpability or a failure to act, by or on behalf of any Indemnified Holder. 
 (b) Each Holder of Registrable Notes agrees, severally and not jointly, to indemnify and hold harmless the Company and its directors and officers who sign a Registration Statement, and any Person controlling (within the meaning of Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act) the Company and its officers, directors, partners, employees, representatives and agents, to the same extent as the foregoing indemnity from the Company to each of the Indemnified Holders, but only with respect to claims and actions based on information relating to such Holder furnished in writing by or on behalf of such Holder expressly for use in any Registration Statement. In case any action or proceeding shall be brought against the Company or its directors or officers or any such Controlling Person in respect of which indemnity may be sought against a Holder of Registrable Notes, such Holder shall have the rights and duties given to the Company, and the Company and its directors and officers and such Controlling Person shall have the rights and duties given to each Holder by the preceding paragraph. This indemnity agreement shall be in addition to any liability which Holders may otherwise have. 
 15 

(c) If the indemnification provided for in this Section 8 is unavailable to an indemnified party under Section 8(a) or (b) hereof (other than by reason of exceptions provided in those Sections) in respect of any losses, claims, damages, liabilities, judgments, actions or expenses referred to therein, then each applicable indemnifying party, in lieu of indemnifying such indemnified party, shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a result of such losses, claims, damages, liabilities, judgments, actions or expenses in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Company, on the one hand, and the Holders, on the other hand, from the Initial Placement (which in the case of the Company shall be deemed to be equal to the total gross proceeds to the Company from the Initial Placement), the amount of Additional Interest which did not become payable as a result of the filing of the Registration Statement resulting in such losses, claims, damages, liabilities, judgments, actions or expenses, and such Registration Statement, or if such allocation is not permitted by applicable law, the relative fault of the Company, on the one hand, and the Holders, on the other hand, in connection with the statements or omissions which resulted in such losses, claims, damages, liabilities or expenses, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The relative fault of the Company, on the one hand, and of the Indemnified Holder, on the other hand, shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Company, on the one hand, or the Indemnified Holders, on the other hand, and the parties relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission. The amount paid or payable by a party as a result of the losses, claims, damages, liabilities and expenses referred to above shall be deemed to include, subject to the limitations set forth in the second paragraph of Section 8(a) hereof, any legal or other fees or expenses reasonably incurred by such party in connection with investigating or defending any action or claim. 
 The Company and each Holder of Registrable Notes agrees that it would not be just and equitable if contribution pursuant to this Section 8(c) were determined by pro rata allocation (even if the Holders were treated as one entity for such purpose) or by any other method of allocation which does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to in the immediately preceding paragraph. The amount paid or payable by an indemnified party as a result of the losses, claims, damages, liabilities or expenses referred to in the immediately preceding paragraph shall be deemed to include, subject to the limitations set forth above, any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim. Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section 8, none of the Holders (and its related Indemnified Holders) shall be required to contribute, in the aggregate, any amount in excess of the amount by which the total discount received by such Holder with respect to the Notes exceeds the amount of any damages which such Holder has otherwise been required to pay by reason of such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission. No Person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Securities Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any Person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. The Holders obligations to contribute pursuant to this Section 8(c) are several in proportion to the respective principal amount of Notes held by each of the Holders hereunder and not joint. 
 SECTION 9. Rule 144A. The Company hereby agrees with each Holder, for so long as any Registrable Notes remain outstanding, to make available to any Holder or beneficial owner of Registrable Notes in connection with any sale thereof and any prospective purchaser of such Registrable Notes from such Holder or beneficial owner, the information required by Rule 144A(d)(4) under the Securities Act in order to permit resales of such Registrable Notes pursuant to Rule 144A under the Securities Act, unless the Company is then subject to Section 13 or 15(d) of the Exchange Act. 
 16 

SECTION 10. Participation in Underwritten Registrations. No Holder may participate in any Underwritten Registration hereunder unless such Holder (a) agrees to sell such Holder s Registrable Notes on the basis provided in any underwriting arrangements approved by the Persons entitled hereunder to approve such arrangements and (b) completes and executes all reasonable questionnaires, powers of attorney, indemnities, underwriting agreements, lock-up letters and other documents required under the terms of such underwriting arrangements. 
 SECTION 11. Selection of Underwriters. If requested by the Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Registrable Notes covered by the Shelf Registration Statement, the Holders of Registrable Notes covered by the Shelf Registration Statement who desire to do so may sell such Registrable Notes in an Underwritten Offering. In such Underwritten Offering, the investment banker(s) and managing underwriter(s) that will administer such offering will be selected by the Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Registrable Notes included in such offering provided, however , that such investment banker(s) and managing underwriter(s) must be reasonably satisfactory to the Company. 
 SECTION 12. Miscellaneous. 
 (a) Remedies. The Company hereby agrees that monetary damages would not be adequate compensation for any loss incurred by reason of a breach by it of the provisions of this Agreement and hereby agrees to waive the defense in any action for specific performance that a remedy at law would be adequate.

The Company will not on or after the date of this Agreement enter into any agreement with respect to its securities that is inconsistent with the rights granted to the Holders in this Agreement or otherwise conflicts with the provisions hereof.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, a waiver or consent to departure from the provisions hereof that relates exclusively to the rights of Holders whose securities are being tendered pursuant to the Exchange Offer and that does not affect directly or indirectly the rights of other Holders whose securities are not being tendered pursuant to such Exchange Offer may be given by the Holders of a majority of the outstanding principal amount of Registrable Notes being tendered or registered provided, however, that, with respect to any matter that directly or indirectly affects the rights of the Initial Purchasers hereunder, the Company shall obtain the written consent of the Initial Purchasers with respect to which such amendment, qualification, supplement, waiver, consent or departure is to be effective.
