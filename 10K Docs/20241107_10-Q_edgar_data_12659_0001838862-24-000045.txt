 Our unsecured committed line of credit (CLOC) provides for an unsecured senior revolving credit facility in the aggregate principal amount of billion, which includes a million sublimit for swingline loans and a million sublimit for standby letters of credit. We may request increases in the aggregate principal amount of the revolving credit facility of up to million, subject to obtaining commitments from lenders and meeting certain other conditions. The CLOC will mature on June 11, 2026, unless extended pursuant to the terms of the CLOC, at which time all outstanding amounts thereunder will be due and payable. Our CLOC includes an annual facility fee, which will vary depending on our then current credit ratings. 
 The CLOC is subject to various conditions, triggers, events or occurrences that could result in earlier termination and contains customary representations, warranties, covenants and events of default, including, without limitation: (1) a covenant requiring the Company to maintain a debt-to-EBITDA ratio, as defined by the CLOC agreement, calculated on a consolidated basis of no greater than (a) to 1.00 as of the last day of each fiscal quarter ending on March 31, June 30, and September 30 of each year and (b) to 1.00 as of the last day of each fiscal quarter ending on December 31 of each year; (2) a covenant requiring us to maintain an interest coverage ratio (EBITDA-to-interest expense) calculated on a consolidated basis of not less than to 1.00 as of the last date of any fiscal quarter; and (3) covenants restricting our ability to incur certain additional debt, incur liens, merge or consolidate with other companies, sell or dispose of assets (including equity interests), liquidate or dissolve, engage in certain transactions with affiliates or enter into certain restrictive agreements. The CLOC includes provisions for an equity cure which could potentially allow us to independently cure certain defaults. Proceeds under the CLOC may be used for working capital needs or for other general corporate pu rposes. We were in compliance with these requirements as of September 30, 2024. 

million and million as of September 30, 2024 and June 30, 2024, respectively. The gross unrecognized tax benefits decreased by million during the three months ended September 30, 2024. We believe it is reasonably possible that the balance of unrecognized tax benefits could decrease by approximately million within the next twelve months. The anticipated decrease is due to the expiration of statutes of limitations, anticipated closure of various tax matters currently under examination, and settlements with tax authorities. For such matters where a change in the balance of unrecognized tax benefits is not yet deemed reasonably possible, no estimate has been included.

 Consistent with prior years, our pretax loss for the three months ended September 30, 2024 is expected to be offset by income in our third and fourth quarters due to the established pattern of seasonality in our primary business operations. As such, management has determined that it is more-likely-than-not that realization of tax benefits recorded in our financial statements will occur within our fiscal year. The amount of tax benefit recorded for the three months ended September 30, 2024 reflects management s estimate of the annual effective tax rate applied to year-to-date loss from continuing operations adjusted for the tax impact of discrete items for the periods presented. 
 
 if our software makes an arithmetic error that results in payment of penalties and/or interest to the respective taxing authority that a client would otherwise not have been required to pay. Our liability related to estimated losses under the 100 accuracy guarantee was million and million as of September 30, 2024 and June 30, 2024, respectively. The short-term and long-term portions of this liability are included in deferred revenue and other liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets. 
 Liabilities related to acquisitions for (1) estimated contingent consideration based on expected financial performance of the acquired business and economic conditions at the time of acquisition and (2) estimated accrued compensation related to continued employment of key employees were million and million as of September 30, 2024 and June 30, 2024 respectively, with amounts recorded in deferred revenue and other liabilities. Should actual results differ from our estimates, future payments made will differ from the above estimate and any differences will be recorded in results from continuing operations. 
 We have contractual commitments to fund certain franchises with approved short-term lines of credit for the purpose of meeting their seasonal working capital needs. Our total obligation under these lines of credit was million at September 30, 2024, and net of amounts drawn and outstanding, our remaining commitment to fund totaled million. 
 During the three months ended September 30, 2024, the Company entered into an agreement to purchase federal investment tax credits ITC ), if certain conditions are met. During the three months ended September 30, 2024, we paid million for ITCs. As of September 30, 2024, the Company has a remaining commitment to purchase additional ITCs, estimated to be million if certain conditions set forth in the agreement are satisfied, with the final payment anticipated to occur by June 30, 2025.

 million and million as of September 30, 2024 and June 30, 2024, respectively. 
 Our estimate of the aggregate range of reasonably possible losses includes (1) matters where a liability has been accrued and there is a reasonably possible loss in excess of the amount accrued for that liability, and (2) matters where a liability has not been accrued but we believe a loss is reasonably possible. This aggregate range only represents those losses as to which we are currently able to estimate a reasonably possible loss or range of loss. It does not represent our maximum loss exposure. 
 Matters for which we are not currently able to estimate the reasonably possible loss or range of loss are not included in this range. We are often unable to estimate the possible loss or range of loss until developments in such matters have provided sufficient information to support an assessment of the reasonably possible loss or range of loss, such as precise information about the amount of damages or other remedies being asserted, the defenses to the claims being asserted, discovery from other parties and investigation of factual allegations, rulings by courts or arbitrators on motions or appeals, analyses by experts, or the status or terms of any settlement negotiations. 
 The estimated range of reasonably possible loss is based upon currently available information and is subject to significant judgment and a variety of assumptions, as well as known and unknown uncertainties. The matters underlying the estimated range will change from time to time, and actual results may vary significantly from the current estimate. As of September 30, 2024, we believe the estimate of the aggregate range of reasonably possible losses in excess of amounts accrued, where the range of loss can be estimated, is not material. 
 At the end of each reporting period, we review relevant information with respect to litigation, arbitration and other related loss contingencies and update our accruals, disclosures, and estimates of reasonably possible loss or range of loss based on such reviews. Costs incurred with defending matters are expensed as incurred. Any receivable for insurance recoveries is recorded separately from the corresponding liability, and only if recovery is determined to be probable and reasonably estimable. 
 We believe we have meritorious defenses to the claims asserted in the various matters described in this note, and we intend to defend them vigorously. The amounts claimed in the matters are substantial, however, and there can be no assurances as to their outcomes. In the event of unfavorable outcomes, it could require modifications to our operations; in addition, the amounts that may be required to be paid to discharge or settle the matters could be substantial and could have a material adverse impact on our business and our consolidated financial position, results of operations, and cash flows.

While we cannot provide assurance that we will ultimately prevail in each instance, we believe the amount, if any, we are required to pay to discharge or settle these other matters will not have a material adverse impact on our business and our consolidated financial position, results of operations, and cash flows.

 International tax preparation revenues increased 4.3 million, or 7.1 , primarily due to higher tax return volumes in Australia combined with favorable foreign currency exchange rates. Wave revenues increased 2.5 million, or 10.3 , due to higher accounting, invoicing and receipts subscriptions and small business payments processing volumes.

 FINANCIAL CONDITION 
 These comments should be read in conjunction with the consolidated balance sheets and consolidated statements of cash flows included in Part 1, Item 1 . 
 CAPITAL RESOURCES AND LIQUIDITY 
 OVERVIEW Our primary sources of capital and liquidity include cash from operations (including changes in working capital), draws on our unsecured committed line of credit (CLOC), and issuances of debt. We use our sources of liquidity primarily to fund working capital, service and repay debt, pay dividends, repurchase shares of our common stock, and acquire businesses. 
 Our operations are highly seasonal and substantially all of our revenues and cash flow are generated during the period from February through April in a typical year. Therefore, we normally require the use of cash to fund losses and working capital needs, periodically resulting in a working capital deficit, during the months of May through 
 16 
 Q1 FY2025 Form 10-Q| H R Block, Inc. 

Table of Contents 

 January. We typically have relied on available cash balances from the prior tax season and borrowings to meet liquidity needs. 
 Given the likely availability of a number of liquidity options discussed herein, we believe that, in the absence of any unexpected developments, our existing sources of capital as of September 30, 2024 are sufficient to meet our operating, investing and financing needs. 
 DISCUSSION OF CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF CASH FLOWS The following table summarizes our statements of cash flows for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. See Item 1 for the complete consolidated statements of cash flows for these periods. 
 (in 000s) Three months ended September 30, 2024 2023 Net cash provided by (used in): Operating activities (328,581) (334,989) Investing activities (26,394) (23,890) Financing activities (284,450) (195,198) Effects of exchange rates on cash 3,249 (3,679) Net decrease in cash and cash equivalents, including restricted balances (636,176) (557,756) 
 Operating Activities. Cash used in operations totaled 328.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 335.0 million in the prior year period. The change is primarily due to changes in accrued liabilities compared to the prior year period. 
 Investing Activities. Cash used in investing activities totaled 26.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 23.9 million in the prior year period. The change is primarily due to higher capital expenditures in the current year. 
 Financing Activities. Cash used in financing activities totaled 284.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 195.2 million in the prior year period. The change is primarily due to higher repurchases of common stock in the current year. 
 CASH REQUIREMENTS 
 Dividends and Share Repurchases. Returning capital to shareholders in the form of dividends and the repurchase of outstanding shares is, and has historically been, a significant component of our capital allocation plan. 
 We have consistently paid quarterly dividends. Dividends paid totaled 44.7 million and 43.0 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Although we have historically paid dividends and plan to continue to do so, there can be no assurances that circumstances will not change in the future that could affect our ability or decisions to pay dividends. 
 On August 15, 2024, the Board of Directors approved a 1.5 billion share repurchase program. The repurchase program does not have an expiration date and replaced the previously existing share repurchase program. During the three months ended September 30, 2024, we repurchased 209.6 million of our common stock at an average price of 63.51 per share, excluding excise taxes in connection with such repurchases. In the prior year period, we repurchased 132.0 million of our common stock at an average price of 40.43 per share, excluding excise taxes in connection with such repurchases. Our current share repurchase program has remaining authorization of 1.3 billion and does not have an expiration date. 
 Share repurchases may be effectuated through open market transactions, some of which may be effectuated under SEC Rule 10b5-1. The Company may cancel, suspend, or extend the period for the purchase of shares at any time. Any repurchases will be funded primarily through available cash and cash from operations. Although we may continue to repurchase shares, there is no assurance that we will purchase up to the full Board authorization. 
 Capital Investment. Capital expenditures totaled 18.7 million and 12.9 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Our capital expenditures relate primarily to recurring improvements to 
 H R Block, Inc. |Q1 FY2025 Form 10-Q

Table of Contents 

 retail offices, as well as investments in computers, software and related assets. In addition to our capital expenditures, we also made payments to acquire businesses. We acquired franchisee and competitor businesses totaling 5.9 million and 6.9 million during the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. See Item 1, note 5 for additional information on our acquisitions. 
 FINANCING RESOURCES The CLOC has capacity up to 1.5 billion and is scheduled to expire in June 2026. Proceeds under the CLOC may be used for working capital needs or for other general corporate purposes. We had no outst anding balance under our CLOC and amounts available to borrow were not limited by the debt-to-EBITDA covenant as of September 30, 2024. 
 The following table provides ratings for debt issued by Block Financial LLC (Block Financial) as of September 30, 2024 and June 30, 2024:

 Short-term Long-term Outlook Short-term Long-term Outlook Moody's P-3 Baa3 Stable P-3 Baa3 Stable S P A-2 BBB Stable A-2 BBB Stable 
 Other than described above, there have been no material changes in our borrowings from those reported as of June 30, 2024 in our Annual Report on Form 10-K. 
 CASH AND OTHER ASSETS As of September 30, 2024, we held cash and cash equivalents, excluding restricted amounts, of 415.9 million, including 183.5 million held by our foreign subsidiaries. 
 Foreign Operations. Seasonal borrowing needs of our Canadian operations are typically funded by our U.S. operations. To mitigate foreign currency risk, we sometimes enter into foreign exchange forward contracts. There were no forward contracts outstanding as of September 30, 2024. 
 We do not currently intend to repatriate non-borrowed funds held by our foreign subsidiaries in a manner that would trigger a tax liability. 
 The impact of changes in foreign exchange rates during the period on our international cash balances resulted in an increase of 3.2 million during the three months ended September 30, 2024 and in a decrease of 3.7 million during the three months ended September 30, 2023. 
 CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS AND COMMERCIAL COMMITMENTS The Company entered into an agreement to purchase federal Investment tax credits ITC ). During the three months ended September 30, 2024, we paid 22.9 million for ITCs. As of September 30, 2024, the Company has a remaining commitment to purchase additional ITCs, estimated to be 74.0 million, with the final closing payment anticipated to occur by June 30, 2025. 
 Effective October 18, 2024, we amended our Program Management Agreement (PMA) with Pathward , N.A to extend the term of the PMA for two years until June 30, 2027. There have been no other material changes in our contractual obligations and commercial commitments from those reported in our June 30, 2024 Annual Report on Form 10-K.

 REGULATORY ENVIRONMENT 
 There have been no material changes in our regulatory environment from what was reported in our June 30, 2024 Annual Report on Form 10-K. 
 
 NON-GAAP FINANCIAL INFORMATION 
 Non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered as a substitute for, or superior to, measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). Because these measures are not measures of financial performance under GAAP and are susceptible to varying calculations, they may not be comparable to similarly titled measures for other companies. 
 We consider our non-GAAP financial measures to be performance measures and a useful metric for management and investors to evaluate and compare the ongoing operating performance of our business. We make adjustments for certain non-GAAP financial measures related to amortization of intangibles from acquisitions and goodwill impairments. We may consider whether other significant items that arise in the future should be excluded from our non-GAAP financial measures. 
 We measure the performance of our business using a variety of metrics, including earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) from continuing operations, adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations, adjusted diluted earnings per share from continuing operations, free cash flow and free cash flow yield. We also use EBITDA from continuing operations and pretax income of continuing operations, each subject to permitted adjustments, as performance metrics in incentive compensation calculations for our employees.

 FORWARD-LOOKING INFORMATION 
 This report and other documents filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) may contain forward-looking statements. In addition, our senior management may make forward-looking statements orally to analysts, investors, the media and others. Forward-looking statements can be identified by the fact that they do not relate strictly to historical or current facts. They often include words or variation of words such as "expects," "anticipates," "intends," "plans," "believes," "commits," "seeks," "estimates," "projects," "forecasts," "targets," "would," "will," "should," "could," "may" or other similar expressions. Forward-looking statements provide management's current expectations or predictions of future conditions, events or results. All statements that address operating performance, events or developments that we expect or anticipate will occur in the future are forward-looking statements. They may include estimates of revenues, client trajectory, income, effective tax rate, earnings per share, cost savings, capital expenditures, dividends, share repurchases, liquidity, capital structure, market share, industry volumes or other financial items, descriptions of management's plans or objectives for future operations, services or products, or descriptions of assumptions underlying any of the above. They may also include the expected impact of external events beyond the Company's control, such as outbreaks of infectious disease, severe weather events, natural or manmade disasters, or changes in the regulatory environment in which we operate.

Table of Contents 

 All forward-looking statements speak only as of the date they are made and reflect the Company's good faith beliefs, assumptions and expectations, but they are not guarantees of future performance or events. Furthermore, the Company disclaims any obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statement to reflect changes in underlying assumptions, factors, or expectations, new information, data or methods, future events or other changes, except as required by law. 
 By their nature, forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those suggested by the forward-looking statements. Factors that might cause such differences include, but are not limited to, a variety of economic, competitive, operational and regulatory factors, many of which are beyond the Company's control. In addition, factors that may cause the Company s actual effective tax rate to differ from estimates include the Company s actual results from operations compared to current estimates, future discrete items, changes in interpretations and assumptions the Company has made, future actions of the Company, and increases in applicable tax rates in jurisdictions where the Company operates. Investors should understand that it is not possible to predict or identify all such factors and, consequently, should not consider any such list to be a complete set of all potential risks or uncertainties. 
 Details about risks, uncertainties and assumptions that could affect various aspects of our business are included throughout our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2024 and are also described from time to time in other filings with the SEC. Investors should carefully consider all of these risks, and should pay particular attention to Item 1A, "Risk Factors," and Item 7 under "Critical Accounting Policies" of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2024.
