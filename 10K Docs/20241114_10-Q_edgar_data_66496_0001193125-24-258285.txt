 (the Declaration of Trust), for the purpose of acquiring from Mills Music, Inc. Old Mills) the right to receive payment of a deferred contingent purchase price obligation (the Contingent Portion) payable to Old Mills. The obligation to pay the Contingent Portion arose as the result of the sale by Old Mills of its music and lyric copyright catalogue (the Catalogue) to a newly formed company pursuant to an asset purchase agreement dated December 5, 1964 (the Asset Purchase Agreement). Pursuant to the Asset Purchase Agreement, payment of the Contingent Portion to the Trust continues until the end of the year in which the last copyright in the Catalogue expires and cannot be renewed. 
 The Contingent Portion amounts are currently payable by EMI Mills Music Inc. EMI), the owner of the copyrighted materials contained in the Catalogue. The Trust has been advised that Sony/ATV Music Publishing LLC is the administrator and manager of EMI and the Catalogue. HSBC Bank, USA, N.A. is the Corporate Trustee of the Trust (the Corporate Trustee), and Lee Eastman is the Individual Trustee of the Trust (the Individual Trustee
 and together with the Corporate Trustee, the Trustees). 
 to of gross royalty income from the exploitation of the Catalogue for each quarterly period, less royalty expenses. In addition, the Contingent Portion was guaranteed to be at least a minimum of per quarter (the Minimum Payment Obligation). 
 Beginning with the first quarter of 2010, the Asset Purchase Agreement provides for certain changes with respect to the calculation of the Contingent Portion. One such change is that the Minimum Payment Obligation is no longer in effect. The Trust is also of the view that the Contingent Portion payable to the Trust changed to a fixed 75 of gross royalty income from the exploitation of the Catalogue for each quarterly period, less royalty related expenses (the New Calculation Method). However, EMI has disputed that the New Calculation Method is the correct interpretation of the Asset Purchase Agreement.

As of the date hereof, the Trust has not received the Underpayments, and EMI has expressly disagreed with the Trust. 
 In addition, on October 1, 2020, the Trust engaged Citrin Cooperman Company LLP, an accounting firm specializing in auditing royalty income Citrin), to conduct a special audit of the books and records of EMI administered by Sony/ATV to determine the areas and extent of underpayment, if any, of quarterly Contingent Portion payments payable to the Trust for the periods beginning January 1, 2016 and ended December 31, 2020 (the Audit

Period). Citrin s final report (the Citrin Report) was delivered to the Trustees on April 4, 2022. The Citrin Report identified multiple asserted royalty omissions and expense over-deductions from the Contingent Portion during the Audit Period in addition to the Underpayments. The Trust distributed the Citrin Report to EMI on or about April 13, 2022. EMI has disputed the findings of the Citrin Report. As part of an effort to settle any disagreement regarding the computation or payment of the Contingent Portion, including the Underpayments and the other amounts identified in the Citrin Report, on October 3, 2022, EMI and the Trust executed a Tolling Agreement pursuant to which the parties agreed to suspend, effective as of January 1, 2022, the running of any relevant statute of limitations applicable to any claim relating to the royalty omissions and expense over-deductions identified in the Citrin Report until June 1, 2023. As of May 8, 2024, EMI and the Trust have extended the tolling period through December 31, 2024, subject to either party s right to terminate the tolling period on thirty days prior written notice. 
 The Trust can offer no assurance that it will be able to recover any of the Underpayments or other amounts identified in the Citrin Report, or that it will favorably resolve the dispute relating to the New Calculation Method with respect to future payments of the Contingent Portion.

ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The Copyright Catalogue The Catalogue is estimated to be composed of over 12,000 music titles, of which approximately 1,430 produced royalty income in recent years. Based on the Listing, the majority of the Trust s receipts are derived principally from copyrights established prior to 1960 in the Unites States. The receipts fluctuate based on consumer interest in the nostalgia appeal of older songs and the overall popularity of the songs contained in the Catalogue. The Catalogue also generates royalty income in Canada and other foreign countries in which copyright is claimed. A number of factors create uncertainties with respect to the Catalogue s ability to continue to generate royalty income on a continuing, long-term basis for the Trust. These factors include: (i) the effect that foreign and domestic copyright laws and any changes thereto have or will have on renewal rights (e.g., vesting of renewal term rights), (ii) the length of the term of copyright protection under foreign and domestic copyright laws, (iii) reversionary rights that may effect whether EMI is able to retain its rights to the Copyrighted Songs during certain renewal terms (e.g., statutory termination of transfers or copyright recapture and (iv) ongoing disputes regarding the payment and calculation of the Contingent Portion. The Trust does not own the Catalogue or any copyrights or other intellectual property rights and is not responsible for collecting royalties in connection with the Catalogue. As the current owner and administrator of the Catalogue, EMI is obligated under the Asset Purchase Agreement to use its best efforts to collect all royalties, domestic and foreign, in connection with the Catalogue and to remit a portion of its royalty income to the Trust in accordance with its Contingent Portion payment obligation. The Trust s income is dependent, in part, on EMI s ability to maintain its rights in the Copyrighted Songs through copyright protection. Although Copyrighted Songs may continue to generate royalty revenue after their copyrights have expired, in general as the copyrights for the Copyrighted Songs expire, less royalty income will be generated, and the size of each payment of the Contingent Portion will be reduced accordingly. Based on the Listing, most of the Top 50 Songs obtained copyright registration under the United States Copyright Act of 1909 (the 1909 Act between 1926 and 1960. For copyrighted works subject to the 1909 Act, copyright law generally provides for a possible 95 years of copyright protection, subject to certain factors, including the initial registration date of each copyright and compliance with certain statutory provisions including notice and renewal. The Copyright expiration dates for the Top 50 Songs range between 2018 and 2118, as set forth in the Listing. The Copyrighted Songs are subject to statutory rights of termination of transfers, which may impact whether EMI is able to retain its ownership of the Copyrighted Songs during their respective terms of copyright protection. For copyrights governed by the 1909 Act, this termination right vests at the end of two different renewal terms, which vary for each Copyrighted Song. As the owner of the Catalogue, EMI (and not the Trust) is responsible for administrating the Catalogue and seeking renewals of the Copyrighted Songs. The Asset Purchase Agreement provides that EMI is obligated to use its best efforts to secure renewals. Contingent Portion Payments Payments of the Contingent Portion to the Trust are ordinarily made on a quarterly basis, approximately two to three months after a quarter ends. The Trust distributes the amounts it receives in Contingent Portion payments to the Unit Holders after payment of, or withholdings in connection with, expenses and liabilities of the Trust. The amount of each payment of the Contingent Portion is based on a formula provided in the Asset Purchase Agreement. Prior to the first quarter of 2010, the Contingent Portion was calculated as an amount ranging from 65 to 75 of gross royalty income from the exploitation of the Catalogue for each quarterly period, less royalty expenses. In addition, the Contingent Portion was guaranteed to be at least a minimum of 167,500 per quarter (the Minimum Payment Obligation ).

However, EMI has disputed that the New Calculation Method is the correct interpretation of the Asset Purchase Agreement. As a result of the New Calculation Method not being applied, EMI s payments of the Contingent Portion have been deficient, in the Trust s view, by the following amounts (the Underpayments ):
