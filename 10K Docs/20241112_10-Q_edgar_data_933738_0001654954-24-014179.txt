We disagree with the Plaintiff s claims and expect to petition the court with affirmative defenses. However, litigation is inherently uncertain, and an adverse outcome could have a material impact on our financial condition.

We also provide health insurance to our employees (including vision and dental) which is partially self-funded for these claims. Provisions for expected future payments are accrued based on our experience, and specific stop loss levels provide protection for the Company. We believe we have adequate reserves for the self-funded portion of our insurance policies. We are not aware of any claims that are not covered by these policies or which are likely to materially exceed the Company s insurance limits. 14 Table of Contents Interest expense Interest expense, net Total finance lease expense Operating leases: Operating costs Operating costs Selling, general and administrative expenses SG A Expense Total operating lease expense Total lease expense Supplemental balance sheet information related to leases was as follows (dollars in thousands): Finance leases Property and equipment, net Total ROU Assets: Lease liabilities: Current liabilities Operating leases Current portion of leases Finance leases Current portion of leases Noncurrent Liabilities: Operating leases Long-term leases Finance leases Long-term leases Total lease liabilities The weighted average remaining lease term and weighted average discount rate were as follows: Finance leases Weighted average discount rate Operating leases Finance leases 15 Table of Contents 2025 2026 2027 2028 and thereafter Total lease payments Less: imputed interest Total lease liabilities shares (the Shares of the Company s common stock at an offering price of per Share in a registered direct offering.

Our recurring losses, negative cash flows from operating activities, need for additional financing and the uncertainties surrounding our ability to obtain such financing, raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. We have limited cash on hand and will need additional working capital to fund our planned operations. We are subject to significant risks and uncertainties, including failing to secure additional capital to fund our planned operations or failing to profitably operate the business. We intend to raise funds through various potential sources, such as equity or debt financings; however, we can provide no assurance that such financing will be available on acceptable terms, or at all. If adequate financing is not available or we do not achieve profitability and positive cash flows from operating activities, we may be required to significantly curtail or cease our operations, and our business would be jeopardized. Cash and the availability of cash could be materially restricted if (1) outstanding invoices billed are not collected or are not collected in a timely manner, (2) circumstances prevent the timely internal processing of invoices, (3) we lose one or more of our major customers or our major customers significantly reduce the amount of work requested from us, (4) we are unable to win new projects that we can perform on a profitable basis or (5) we are unable to reverse our use of cash to fund losses. If any such event occurs, we would be forced to consider alternative financing options. Our Board of Directors continues to review strategic transactions, which could include strategic acquisitions, mergers, reverse mergers, the issuance or buyback of public shares, or the purchase or sale of specific assets, in addition to other potential actions aimed at increasing shareholder value. The Company does not intend to disclose or comment on developments related to its review unless and until the Board has approved a specific transaction or otherwise determined that further disclosure is appropriate. There can be no assurance that the Board s strategic review will result in any transaction, or any assurance as to its outcome or timing. per annum to per annum under the Term Loans and (ii) provide that interest will be payable at maturity instead of monthly in arrears under the Term Loans and the Line of Credit. 17 Table of Contents ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Forward-Looking Statements Certain information contained in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, as well as other written and oral statements made or incorporated by reference from time to time by the Company and its representatives in other reports, filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC ), press releases, conferences or otherwise, may be deemed to be forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the Exchange Act ). This information includes, without limitation, statements concerning the Company s future financial position and results of operations, planned capital expenditures, business strategy and other plans for future operations, the future mix of revenues and business, customer retention, project reversals, commitments and contingent liabilities, future demand and industry conditions. Although the Company believes that the expectations reflected in such forward-looking statements are reasonable, it can give no assurance that such expectations will prove to have been correct. We undertake no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. Generally, the words anticipate, believe, estimate, expect, may and similar expressions, identify forward-looking statements, which generally are not historical in nature. Actual results could differ materially from the results described in the forward-looking statements due to the risks and uncertainties set forth under Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, Risk Factors and elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, the specific risk factors identified under Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 30, 2023, and those described from time to time in our future reports filed with the SEC. The following discussion is qualified in its entirety by, and should be read in conjunction with, the Company s financial statements, including the notes thereto, included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 30, 2023. Overview ENGlobal Corporation (which may be referred to as ENGlobal, the Company, we, us or our ), incorporated in the State of Nevada in June 1994, is a leading provider of innovative, delivered project solutions primarily to the energy industry. We deliver these solutions to our clients by combining our vertically-integrated engineering and professional project execution services with our automation and systems integration expertise. We believe our vertically-integrated strategy allows us to differentiate our company from most of our competitors as a full service provider, thereby reducing our clients dependency on and coordination of multiple vendors and improving control over their project cost and schedules. Our strategy and positioning has also allowed the Company to pursue larger scopes of work centered around many different types of modularized engineered systems. We have a long history of delivering project solutions and can provide complete project execution and have focused our business development teams on communicating these offerings to our clients which include (i) Automation, (ii) Engineering, and (iii) Government Services. We have made significant reductions in our overhead structure as part of the internal business reorganization that we started in the first quarter of 2023. These cost reductions were primarily in headcount across all segments to better align the number of administrative staff needed to support our current volume of work and re-organize our corporate structure. We continue to evaluate our headcount and will reduce it as necessary to better align our costs with the volume of the business. Our Board of Directors continues to review strategic transactions, which could include strategic acquisitions, mergers, reverse mergers, the issuance or buyback of public shares, or the purchase or sale of specific assets, in addition to other potential actions aimed at increasing shareholder value. The Company does not intend to disclose or comment on developments related to its review unless and until the Board has approved a specific transaction or otherwise determined that further disclosure is appropriate. There can be no assurance that the Board s strategic review will result in any transaction, or any assurance as to its outcome or timing. 18 Table of Contents Our recurring losses, negative cash flows from operating activities, need for additional financing and the uncertainties surrounding our ability to obtain such financing, raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. We have limited cash on hand and will need additional working capital to fund our planned operations. We are subject to significant risks and uncertainties, including failing to secure additional capital to fund our planned operations or failing to profitably operate the business. We intend to raise funds through various potential sources, such as equity or debt financings; however, we can provide no assurance that such financing will be available on acceptable terms, or at all. If adequate financing is not available or we do not achieve profitability and positive cash flows from operating activities, we may be required to significantly curtail or cease our operations, and our business would be jeopardized. Critical Accounting Policies Update Our critical accounting policies are further disclosed in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements included in our 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K. Goodwill - Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price of acquisitions over the fair value of the net assets acquired and liabilities assumed. Goodwill is not amortized but rather is tested and assessed for impairment annually, or more frequently if certain events or changes in circumstance indicate the carrying amount may exceed fair value. The annual test for goodwill impairment is performed in the fourth quarter of each year. The Company compares its fair value of a reporting unit and the carrying value of the reporting unit to measure goodwill impairment. Fair value was determined by applying discounted cash flows of the operating unit after allocation of certain corporate overhead. Estimating the cash flow of the operating unit requires the use of significant estimates and assumptions, including revenue growth rates, operating margins, discount rates and future market conditions, among others. It is possible that changes in market conditions, economy, facts, circumstances, judgments and assumptions used in estimating the fair value could change, resulting in possible impairment of goodwill in the future. Impairment of Long-Lived Assets - IAS 36 Impairment of Assets applies to a variety of non-financial assets including property, plant and equipment (PPE), right-of-use assets, intangible assets and goodwill, investment properties carried at cost and investments in associates and joint ventures. If these assets (other than goodwill) have been impaired in previous periods, then a company needs to consider whether there have been changes in circumstances since the last impairment test that indicate that an impairment loss may have decreased or may no longer exist, which includes a significant change in the extent or manner in which an asset is or is expected to be used. During 2023, we determined that the carrying value of the ROU assets related to our fabrication and field services businesses was no longer recoverable and wrote the balance down to its estimated fair value. The resulting impairment loss of 1.8 million was reflected within selling, general, and administrative expenses of the Commercial segment on the Consolidated Statement of Operations in the our 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K. During the third quarter of 2024, we identified circumstances that indicated a significant change had occurred in the assumptions management used to impair the asset. The reevaluation resulted in a 0.5 million reduction in the estimated impairment loss, elimination of the right-of-use asset balance, and reclassification of the liability from a right-of-use lease liability to a contingency. The contingency is based on a lawsuit pending in the County Court of Waller County, Texas, where the Plaintiff is seeking monetary damages of 1.3 million for a breach of lease cause of action. Results of Operations In the course of providing our time-and-material services, we routinely provide materials and equipment and may provide construction management services on a subcontractor basis. Generally, these materials, equipment and subcontractor costs are passed through to our clients and reimbursed, along with small handling fees, which in general are at margins lower than those of our normal core business. In accordance with industry practice and generally accepted accounting principles, all such costs and fees are included in revenue. The material purchases and the use of subcontractor services can vary significantly from quarter to quarter; therefore, changes in revenue and gross profit, SG A expense and operating income as a percentage of revenue may not be indicative of the Company s core business trends. Segment operating SG A expense includes management and staff compensation, office costs such as rents and utilities, depreciation, amortization, travel, and other expenses generally unrelated to specific client contracts, but directly related to the support of a segment s operations.

Our 2024 revenue for the Commercial segment decreased primarily due to our decision to stop self-performing fabrication, construction and field services, partially offset by projects awarded in 2024. Revenue for the Government Services segment decreased primarily due to large projects that were completed in 2023. Revenue decreased 14.0 million to 18.4 million from 32.4 million, or a decrease of 43.3 , for the nine months ended September 28, 2024 as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Our 2024 revenue for the Commercial segment decreased primarily due to our decision to stop self-performing fabrication, construction and field services, partially offset by projects awarded in 2024. Revenue for the Government Services segment decreased primarily due to large projects that were completed in 2023. Gross Profit (Loss) Gross profit (loss) margin decreased 11.0 to 8.4 from 19.4 for the three months ended September 28, 2024 as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease in gross profit (loss) margin is primarily attributable to the inefficient use of personnel and equipment to complete projects where we were unable to secure additional change orders to cover costs of completion, partially offset by a change order awarded to our Government Services group to cover excess material purchases on a large project. Gross profit (loss) margin increased 10.3 to 9.2 from (1.1) for the nine months ended September 28, 2024 as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in gross profit (loss) margin is primarily attributable to the reduction of indirect costs of 2.6 million and the decision to stop self-performing fabrication, construction and field services. Selling, General and Administrative Expense SG A expenses decreased 1.6 million for the three months ended September 28, 2024 as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023 due to a 1.1 million decrease in facility expense primarily as a result of the termination of our leases related to self-performed fabrication, construction and field services, a 0.2 million decrease in salaries and burden, a 0.1 million decrease in computer software and hardware expense, a 0.1 million decrease in legal expense, and a 0.1 million decrease in accounting fees. SG A expenses decreased by 6.1 million for the nine months ended September 28, 2024 as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023 due to a 2.2 million bad debt reserve recorded during the 2023 period with no comparable occurrence in 2024, a 1.3 million decrease in facility expense for closed locations related to our self-performed fabrication, construction and field services, a 1.2 million decrease in salaries and burden, a 0.3 million decrease in computer software and hardware expense, a 0.2 million decrease in legal expense, a 0.2 million decrease in accounting fees, a 0.1 decrease in depreciation expense, and a 0.1 million decrease in early payment fees. Other Income (Expense), Net Other income, net of expense, was 3 thousand for the three months ended September 28, 2024 and September 30, 2023. Other income, net of expense, increased 179 thousand for the nine months ended September 28, 2024 as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Interest Expense, net Interest expense is incurred primarily in connection with our Credit Agreement, our Amended Credit Agreement, and our finance leases. Our interest expense increased to 62 thousand for the three months ended September 28, 2024 from 27 thousand for the three months ended September 30, 2023. Our interest expense increased to 166 thousand for the nine months ended September 28, 2024 from 158 thousand for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Tax Expense Tax expense is incurred primarily for our state franchise taxes. We recorded income tax expense of 22 thousand for the three months ended September 28, 2024 and September 30, 2023. We recorded income tax expense of 66 thousand for the nine months ended September 28, 2024 and September 30, 2023. 22 Table of Contents Net Income (Loss) Net loss for the three months ended September 28, 2024 was 0.5 million, or a 0.2 million decrease from a net loss of 0.7 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023, primarily as a result of the inefficient use of personnel and equipment to complete projects and the decision to stop self- performing fabrication, construction and field services, and a decrease in selling, general, and administrative expenses of 1.6 million. Net loss for the nine months ended September 28, 2024 was 3.1 million, or a 8.3 million decrease from net loss of 11.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, primarily as a result of the decision to stop self- performing fabrication, construction and field services, and a decrease in selling, general, and administrative expenses of 6.1 million. Liquidity and Capital Resources Overview The Company defines liquidity as our ability to pay liabilities as they become due, fund business operations and meet monetary contractual obligations. Our primary sources of liquidity are cash on hand, internally generated funds, and borrowings under the Amended Credit Agreement. We had cash of approximately 1.2 million at September 28, 2024 and 0.6 million at December 30, 2023. Our working capital (deficit) as of September 28, 2024 was 6.1) million versus 2.2) million as of December 30, 2023. On June 15, 2023, we entered into a Credit Agreement (the Credit Agreement with Alliance 2000, Ltd., a Texas limited partnership Alliance ), pursuant to which Alliance agreed, subject to certain terms and conditions, to extend up to two term loans in the aggregate principal amount of 1,250,000 to us. During the one-year term of the term loans, the Company made interest-only payments on a quarterly basis. The term loans carried an annual interest rate of 8.5 and had an origination fee of 0.5 , payable upon maturity. On April 24, 2024, the Company entered into the Amended Credit Agreement with Alliance pursuant to which the parties amended and restated the Credit Agreement to, among other things, (i) modify the existing term loans in the aggregate original principal amount of 1,200,000 to (a) extend the maturity date to July 2, 2025, and (b) reduce the applicable interest rate from 8.5 to 8.0 per annum, and (ii) provide a revolving credit facility of up to the lesser of (a) the Borrowing Base (as defined below) and (b) 1,000,000. The borrowing base (the Borrowing Base is an amount equal to up to 95 of Eligible Receivables (as defined in the Amended Credit Agreement) as determined by Alliance from time to time, less any reserves established by Alliance in its sole discretion from time to time. As of September 28, 2024 and the date of the filing of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, we do not have available funds to borrow under the revolving credit facility. On November 11, 2024, we entered into an amendment to the Amended Credit Agreement to (i) increase the interest rate from 8.0 per annum to 12.0 per annum under the term loans and (ii) provide that interest will be payable at maturity instead of monthly in arrears under the term loans and the revolving credit facility. On February 1, 2023, we entered into a securities purchase agreement (the RDO Purchase Agreement providing for the sale and issuance by the Company to a single institutional investor of 496,375 shares (the Shares of the Company s common stock, at an offering price of 6.80 per Share in a registered direct offering. Concurrently with the sale of the Shares and pursuant to the RDO Purchase Agreement, the Company also sold and issued in a private placement, for no additional consideration to the investor, warrants to purchase up to 496,375 shares of the Company s common stock (the Warrants ). The gross proceeds to the Company from the offerings were approximately 3.4 million before deducting the placement agent s fees and related offering expenses, and excluding the proceeds, if any, from the exercise of the Warrants. The Company used the net proceeds of the offering for working capital and general corporate purposes. We have had to extend the payment terms for our suppliers beyond our standard terms. In some cases, we have signed an agreement stipulating scheduled payment dates and amounts to provide assurance to the supplier that the balance will be paid in full. The payment terms for these arrangements are between a few weeks and 12 months depending on various factors such as amount, age, and how critical they are to our on-going operations. As of September 28, 2024, approximately 1.0 million of our trade payables have a payment schedule agreement. 23 Table of Contents Our recurring losses, negative cash flows from operating activities, need for additional financing and the uncertainties surrounding our ability to obtain such financing, raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. We have limited cash on hand and will need additional working capital to fund our planned operations. We are subject to significant risks and uncertainties, including failing to secure additional capital to fund our planned operations or failing to profitably operate the business. We intend to raise funds through various potential sources, such as equity or debt financings; however, we can provide no assurance that such financing will be available on acceptable terms, or at all. If adequate financing is not available or we do not achieve profitability and positive cash flows from operating activities, we may be required to significantly curtail or cease our operations, and our business would be jeopardized. Cash and the availability of cash could be materially restricted if (1) outstanding invoices billed are not collected or are not collected in a timely manner, (2) circumstances prevent the timely internal processing of invoices, (3) we lose one or more of our major customers or our major customers significantly reduce the amount of work requested from us, (4) we are unable to win new projects that we can perform on a profitable basis or (5) we are unable to reverse our use of cash to fund losses. If any such event occurs, we would be forced to consider alternative financing options. Our Board of Directors continues to review strategic transactions, which could include strategic acquisitions, mergers, reverse mergers, the issuance or buyback of public shares, or the purchase or sale of specific assets, in addition to other potential actions aimed at increasing shareholder value. The Company does not intend to disclose or comment on developments related to its review unless and until the Board has approved a specific transaction or otherwise determined that further disclosure is appropriate. There can be no assurance that the Board s strategic review will result in any transaction, or any assurance as to its outcome or timing. Cash Flows from Operating Activities Operating activities used 0.6 million of cash for the nine months ended September 28, 2024. The primary drivers of our cash used in operations for the nine months ended September 28, 2024 were our operating loss of 3.1 million, 1.4 million from the reclassification of ROU liabilities for closed facilities, an increase in contract assets net of contract liabilities of 1.2 million, 0.9 million from the adjustment to ROU asset impairment, and an increase in accrued compensation and benefits of 0.2 million, partially offset by cash provided from a decrease in trade receivables of 2.6 million, an increase of other current liabilities of 1.3 million, a decrease in other current assets of 0.9 million, an increase in trade payables of 0.6 million, depreciation and amortization of 0.5 million, share-based compensation of 0.2 million, and income taxes payable of 0.1 million. Operating activities used 3.8 million of cash for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The primary drivers of our cash used in operations for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 were our operating loss of 11.4 million and a decrease of other current liabilities of 0.9 million, partially offset by cash provided by a decrease in other current assets of 2.8 million, an increase in trade payables of 2.6 million, a decrease in contract assets net of contract liabilities of 1.1 million, 1.2 million from other components of working capital, an increase in accrued compensation and benefits of 0.6 million, and a decrease in trade receivables of 0.1 million. Cash Flows from Investing Activities Investing activities provided cash of 0.4 million for the three months ended September 28, 2024 from the sale of personal property and equipment Investing activities used cash of 0.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 primarily for the purchase of personal property and equipment. Cash Flows from Financing Activities Financing activities provided 0.8 million of cash for the nine months ended September 28, 2024 primarily due to proceeds received from the Amended Credit Agreement partially offset by payments made on finance leases. Financing activities provided 2.1 million of cash for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 primarily due to proceeds received from the issuance of common stock under the RDO Purchase Agreement, net of issuance costs, and the Amended Credit Agreement entered into during the second quarter of 2023, partially offset by cash used for payments for our finance leases and payments under the Loan and Security Agreement with Pacific Western Bank dba Pacific Western Business Finance (the Revolving Credit Facility ). The Revolving Credit Facility was repaid during the second quarter of 2023. 24 Table of Contents Contractual Obligations The Company is obligated to make future cash payments under the Amended Credit Agreement, operating leases, finance leases, and other liabilities. Amounts below are undiscounted and may differ from balances reflected on the financial statements. The table below sets forth certain information about our contractual obligations as of September 28, 2024 (in thousands): Payment Due by Fiscal Period 2024 2025 2026 2027 2028 and thereafter Operating and finance leases 311 1,006 520 446 438 Amended Credit Agreement 2,304 Other liabilities (1) Total 311 1,006 2,824 446 438 (1) Other liabilities includes short-term notes payable. 25 Table of Contents ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK Not applicable. ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures The Company s disclosure controls and procedures are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the Company in reports filed or submitted under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act ), is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms. The Company s disclosure controls and procedures are also designed to ensure such information is accumulated and communicated to management, including the principal executive and principal financial officers, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures. There are inherent limitations to the effectiveness of any system of disclosure controls and procedures, including the possibility of human error and the circumvention or overriding of controls and procedures. Accordingly, even effective disclosure controls and procedures can only provide reasonable assurance that control objectives are attained. The Company s management, including its Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, evaluated the effectiveness of the Company s disclosure controls and procedures as of September 28, 2024, as required by Rule 13a-15 of the Exchange Act. Based upon this evaluation, the Company s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that, as of September 28, 2024, the disclosure controls and procedures were not effective because of the material weaknesses in the Company s internal control over financial reporting described below. Material Weaknesses in Internal Control over Financial Reporting Management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act. A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the Company s annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. In connection with the preparation of the Company s 2023 Annual Report, the Company s management, including its Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, evaluated the effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting as of December 30, 2023, and identified the material weaknesses described below that continue to exist as of September 28, 2024. Specifically, (i) the Company did not have sufficient resources in place with the appropriate training and knowledge of internal control over financial reporting in order to ensure the operating effectiveness; (ii) the Company did not perform an adequate continuous risk assessment over financial reporting to identify and analyze risks of financial misstatement due to errors, and implement necessary changes to internal controls impacted by changes in the business, organizational structure and reduction in personnel over the last twelve months; and (iii) the Company did not have an effective information and communication process that ensured variances and anomalies were communicated to the appropriate personnel on a timely basis in order to investigate and take corrective action to prevent the error. Accordingly, the Company did not follow established appropriate control activities through policies and procedures to mitigate risk to the achievement of the Company s financial reporting objectives, as follows: The Company s management review controls did not operate effectively, including the completeness and accuracy of the data used in the operation of the control, to ensure change orders and contract values were properly entered into the accounting system; and The Company s reconciliation controls did not operate effectively to timely record on-line payments, other electronic bank transactions, and unprocessed credit card payments to suppliers. 26 Table of Contents These material weaknesses resulted in several material and immaterial misstatements that were corrected prior to the issuance of the consolidated financial statements. The Company believes that, notwithstanding the material weaknesses mentioned above, the unaudited consolidated financial statements contained in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated balance sheets, statements of operations, stockholders equity (deficit), and cash flows of the Company and its subsidiaries in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States as of the dates and for the periods stated in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Remediation Plan and Status The Company has implemented the following plan of action and will continue to evaluate and adjust remediation actions as needed to ensure the elements of the remediation plan remain appropriate and are sustainable. The elements of the remediation plan include: The Company did not have effective controls over the accuracy of change orders to ensure they were properly entered into the accounting system and the associated contract values were accurately reported in the accounting system as of December 30, 2023. As of September 28, 2024, we have taken the following actions to remediate the material weakness. o Communicated and trained those in charge of updating contract values in the proper procedure for entering change orders in the accounting system for lump sum contracts. o Communicated to those involved in the monthly forecasting process the importance of communicating to the accounting department any deviation from the expected contract value. o Educated the personnel responsible for setting up projects and entering changes to contract values in the accounting system on how the data they input is used to calculate and recognize revenue on lump sum projects. o Changed the system procedure for calculating revenue from task level to project level on lump sum contracts. o Developed a monthly report to identify contract value changes and assign the responsibility of confirming changes to contract values are valid change orders to another person that is not responsible for entering change orders. The Company did not follow established control procedures to (i) timely record on-line payments and other electronic bank transactions, and (ii) reconcile unprocessed credit card payments to suppliers as of December 30, 2023. As of September 28, 2024, we have taken the following actions to remediate the material weakness. o Discontinued the supplier credit card program. o Changed when the Company records on-line payments from a month-end process to an interim process, i.e., as they are made. o Re-assigned the responsibility of confirming that all on-line payments have been recorded in the accounts payable subledger at month-end to the accounts payable clerk. o Re-assigned the preparer and approver roles for the bank reconciliations to provide more oversight by the Chief Financial Officer. o Established a more structured review process to ensure the timely recording of all reconciling items. The Company believes that the actions listed above have provided the appropriate remediation of the material weaknesses identified as of December 30, 2023. Due to the nature of the remediation process and the need for sufficient time after implementation to evaluate and test the design and effectiveness of the controls, no assurance can be made as to when the remediation actions have been operating effectively for a sufficient period of time. The material weakness will be considered fully remediated when the Company concludes that the controls have been operating for a sufficient amount of time and the design and effectiveness of the controls are validated by management. Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting Except as described above in Remediation Plan and Status , there have been no changes in the Company s internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended September 28, 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company s internal control over financial reporting. 27 Table of Contents PART II OTHER INFORMATION ITEM 1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS From time to time, ENGlobal or one or more of its subsidiaries may be involved in various legal proceedings or may be subject to claims that arise in the ordinary course of business alleging, among other things, claims of breach of contract or negligence in connection with the performance or delivery of goods and/or services. The outcome of any such claims or proceedings cannot be predicted with certainty. Except as described in Note 8 Commitments and Contingencies to our unaudited consolidated financial statements contained in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, as of the date of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, no legal proceedings are pending against us that we believe individually or collectively could have a materially adverse effect upon our financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows. ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS In addition to the other information set forth in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, you should carefully consider the factors discussed in Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 30, 2023, which outline factors that could materially affect our business, financial condition or future results, and the additional risk factors below. You should be aware that the occurrence of any of the events described in these risk factors and elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations and that upon the occurrence of any of these events, the trading price of our common stock could decline. These factors, among others, raise substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern within one year after the issuance date of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern exists. Our unaudited financial statements for the period ended September 28, 2024 were prepared on the assumption that we would continue as a going concern. Those financial statements expressed a substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. Those financial statements did not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty. Our recurring losses, negative cash flows from operating activities, need for additional financing and the uncertainties surrounding our ability to obtain such financing, raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. We have limited cash on hand and will need additional working capital to fund our planned operations. We are subject to significant risks and uncertainties, including failing to secure additional capital to fund our planned operations or failing to profitably operate the business. We intend to raise funds through various potential sources, such as equity or debt financings; however, we can provide no assurance that such financing will be available on acceptable terms, or at all. If adequate financing is not available or we do not achieve profitability and positive cash flows from operating activities, we may be required to significantly curtail or cease our operations, and our business would be jeopardized. Our ability to continue as a going concern is also subject to, among other factors, our ability to collect receivables from our clients when due and to invoice our customers in a timely manner. Under the typical payment terms of our fixed-price contracts, the customer pays us progress payments. These progress payments are based on quantifiable measures of performance or on the achievement of specified events or milestones. If these events or milestones are delayed, it will negatively impact the timing of our cash receipts, which affects our ability to pay our employees and suppliers. If we are not able collect our receivables when due from our clients, our cash flow will be negatively impacted which could lead to us not being able to meet our current obligations. Our inability to borrow any amounts under our Amended Credit Agreement, which matures on July 2, 2025, will limit our ability to finance operations or engage in other business activities, which could have a material impact on our financial condition. As of September 28, 2024, we have outstanding borrowings of 2.3 million under the Amended Credit Agreement, which matures on July 2, 2025. The terms of the Amended Credit Agreement provide for a revolving credit facility of up to the lesser of (a) the borrowing base and (b) 1,000,000, with the borrowing base being in an amount equal to up to 95 of Eligible Receivables (as defined in the Amended Credit Agreement) as determined by the lender from time to time, less any reserves established by the lender in its sole discretion from time to time. As of September 28, 2024 and the date of the filing of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, we do not have any borrowing capacity under the revolving credit. Our inability to borrow any amounts under the Amended Credit Agreement will limit our ability to finance operations or engage in other business activities, which could have a material impact on our financial condition. 28 Table of Contents Our backlog is subject to unexpected adjustments and cancellations and is, therefore, an uncertain indicator of our future revenue or earnings. As of September 28, 2024, our backlog was approximately 6.9 million. We expect a majority of this backlog to be completed within the next 12 months. We cannot assure investors that the revenue projected in our backlog will be realized or, if realized, will result in profits. Projects currently in our backlog may be canceled or may remain in our backlog for an extended period of time prior to project execution and, once project execution begins, it may occur unevenly over the current and multiple future periods. In addition, project terminations, suspensions or reductions in scope occur from time to time with respect to contracts reflected in our backlog, reducing the revenue and profit we actually receive from contracts reflected in our backlog. Future project cancellations and scope adjustments could further reduce the dollar amount of our backlog in addition to the revenue and profits that we actually earn. The potential for cancellations and adjustments to our backlog are exacerbated by economic conditions, particularly in our chosen area of concentration, the energy industry. The markets for oil and natural gas have been volatile which can exacerbate the potential for cancellations and adjustments to our backlog from our clients in the oil and natural gas industry. We are not currently in compliance with Nasdaq s continued listing requirements. If we are unable to comply with Nasdaq s continued listing requirements, our common stock could be delisted, which could negatively affect the price of our common stock and liquidity and reduce our ability to raise capital. Our common stock is currently listed on Nasdaq. Nasdaq has established certain quantitative criteria and qualitative standards that companies must meet to remain listed for trading on this market. On November 27, 2023, we received written notice from Nasdaq indicating that we are not in compliance with Listing Rule 5550(b) for continued listing due to our failure to maintain a minimum of 2,500,000 in stockholders equity. Nasdaq also determined that we did not meet the alternatives of market value of listed securities or net income from continuing operations for continued listing. The Company subsequently submitted a plan to regain compliance and based on such submission, Nasdaq granted the Company an extension of time until May 27, 2024 to regain compliance with Listing Rule 5550(b). On May 30, 2024, the Company received written notice from Nasdaq notifying the Company that the Nasdaq staff had determined that the Company did not meet the terms of the extension. The Company requested an appeal of this determination before a Nasdaq Hearings Panel (the Panel ). At the Panel hearing, which was held on July 25, 2024, the Company presented a strategic plan to regain compliance with the applicable Nasdaq listing requirements. The Panel granted an extension until November 26, 2024 for the Company to regain compliance with the applicable Nasdaq listing requirements. The Panel, however, reserved the right to reconsider the terms of the extension based on any event, condition or circumstance that exists or develops that would, in the opinion of the Panel, make continued listing of the Company s common stock on Nasdaq inadvisable or unwarranted. While the Company s common stock will continue to trade on Nasdaq during the extension, there can be no assurance that the Company will be able to regain compliance with the applicable Nasdaq listing requirements. Any delisting of the Company s common stock from Nasdaq, including as a result of its inability to regain compliance with Listing Rule 5550(b), could adversely affect the Company s ability to attract new investors, reduce the liquidity of its outstanding shares of common stock, reduce its ability to raise additional capital, reduce the price at which its common stock trades, result in negative publicity and increase the transaction costs inherent in trading such shares with overall negative effects for the Company s stockholders. The Company cannot assure its investors that its common stock, if delisted from Nasdaq, will be listed on another national securities exchange or quoted on an over-the-counter quotation system. In addition, delisting of the Company s common stock could deter broker-dealers from making a market in or otherwise seeking or generating interest in the Company s common stock and might deter certain institutions and persons from investing in the Company s securities at all. For these reasons and others, delisting could adversely affect the Company s business, financial condition and liquidity. 29 Table of Contents ITEM 2.
