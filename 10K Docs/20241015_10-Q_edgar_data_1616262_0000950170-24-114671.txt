Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements 
 This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q (this Quarterly Report contains statements of our expectations, intentions, plans and beliefs that constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Securities Act"), and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act ), and are intended to come within the safe harbor protection provided by those sections. These forward-looking statements involve various risks and uncertainties. These statements, other than statements of historical fact, included in this Quarterly Report are forward-looking statements. Many of the forward-looking statements contained in this document may be identified by the use of forward-looking words such as will, intend, believe, expect, anticipate, should, plan, estimate, potential, may, would, could, continue, likely, might, seek, outlook, explore, or the negative of these terms or other similar expressions. However, the absence of these words or similar expressions does not mean that a statement is not forward-looking. All statements that address operating performance, events or developments that we expect or anticipate will occur in the future including statements expressing general views about future operating results are forward-looking statements. Management believes these forward-looking statements are reasonable as and when made. However, caution should be taken not to place undue reliance on any such forward-looking statements because such statements speak only as of the date of this Quarterly Report. We undertake no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events, or otherwise, except as required by law. In addition, forward-looking statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially from historical experience and our present expectations or projections. These risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to: inflationary impacts, the outcome of legal proceedings, changes in the confectionery business environment, seasonality, consumer interest in our products, consumer and retail trends, costs and availability of raw materials, competition, and the success of our co-branding strategy and the effect of government regulations. For a detailed discussion of the risks and uncertainties that may cause our actual results to differ from the forward-looking statements contained herein, please see Part II, Item 1A. Risk Factors and the risks described elsewhere in this Quarterly Report and the section entitled Risk Factors contained in Part I, Item 1A. of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended February 29, 2024, filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission SEC on June 13, 2024, as updated by this Quarterly Report.

 million and used cash in operating activities of million . Additionally, the Company was not in compliance with the requirement under a credit agreement, as amended (the Credit Agreement ), with Wells Fargo Bank N.A. (the Lender to maintain a ratio of total current assets to total current liabilities of at least to 1. The Company's current ratio as of August 31, 2024 was to 1. The Credit Agreement was set to expire on , and was repaid on September 30, 2024 (see Note 8). These factors raise substantial doubts about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern within one year after the date that these condensed consolidated financial statements are issued. The accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that might be necessary if the Company is unable to continue as a going concern. The Company s ability to continue as a going concern is dependent on its ability to continue to implement its business plan. The Company is exploring various means of strengthening its liquidity position and ensuring compliance with its debt financing covenants, which may include the obtaining of waivers from our lender. The Company continues to explore supplemental liquidity sources. During the next twelve months, the Company intends to further reduce overhead costs, improve manufacturing efficiencies, and increase profits and gross margins by better aligning its costs with the delivery and sale to its franchising system and Specialty Market customers. In addition, the Company intends to benefit from its historically busy season of holiday product sales while also increasing sales through its e-commerce distribution channel on a year-round basis. There are no assurances that the Company will be successful in implementing its business plan.

The Company recorded an impairment charge of million during the six months ended August 31, 2024, as the carrying value of the machinery was in excess of the fair value less costs to sell.

Gift Cards The Company s franchisees sell gift cards, which do not have expiration dates or non-usage fees. The proceeds from the sale of gift cards by the franchisees are accumulated by the Company and paid out to the franchisees upon customer redemption.

The Company recognizes breakage from gift cards when the gift card is redeemed by the customer or the Company determines the likelihood of the gift card being redeemed by the customer is remote gift card breakage ). The determination of the gift card breakage rate is based upon Company-specific historical redemption patterns. The Company did not recognize any gift card breakage during the three months ended August 31, 2024 or six months ended August 31, 2024. Durango Product Sales of Confectionary Items, Retail Sales and Royalty and Marketing Fees Confectionary items sold to the Company s franchisees, others and its Company-owned stores sales are recognized at the time of the underlying sale, based on the terms of the sale and when ownership of the inventory is transferred, and are presented net of sales taxes and discounts.

 shares of common stock reserved for issuance under warrants and shares underlying unvested restricted stock units and stock options were excluded from the computation of diluted earnings per share because their effect would have been anti-dilutive.

 million and million , respectively. The lease liability reflects the present value of the Company s estimated future minimum lease payments over the life of its leases. This includes known escalations and renewal option periods reasonably assured of being exercised. Typically, renewal options are considered reasonably assured of being exercised if the sales performance of the location remains strong. Therefore, the right of use asset and lease liability include an assumption on renewal options that have not yet been exercised by the Company and are not currently a future obligation. The Company has separated non-lease components from lease components in the recognition of the Asset and Liability except in instances where such costs were not practical to separate. To the extent that occupancy costs, such as site maintenance, are included in the asset and liability, the impact is immaterial. For franchised locations, the related occupancy costs including property taxes, insurance and site maintenance are generally required to be paid by the franchisees as part of the franchise arrangement. In addition, the Company is the lessee under non-store related leases such as storage facilities and trucking equipment. For leases where the implicit rate is not readily determinable, the Company uses an incremental borrowing rate to calculate the lease liability that represents an estimate of the interest rate the Company would incur to borrow on a collateralized basis over the term of a lease. The weighted average discount rate used for operating leases was as of August 31, 2024. The total estimated future minimum lease payments are million as of August 31, 2024.

 for chocolate, certain nuts, and other raw material inputs. These contracts permit the Company to purchase the specified commodity at a fixed price on an as-needed basis during the term of the contract. Because prices for these products may fluctuate, the Company may benefit if prices rise during the terms of these contracts, but it may be required to pay above-market prices if prices fall and it is unable to renegotiate the terms of the contract. The Company has designated these contracts as normal under the normal purchase and sale exception under the accounting standards for derivatives. These contracts are not entered into for speculative purposes. Litigation From time to time, the Company is involved in litigation relating to claims arising out of its operations.

 Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements 
 In addition to historical information, the following discussion contains certain forward-looking information. See "Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements" in this Quarterly Report for certain information concerning forward-looking statements. 
 Overview 
 Rocky Mountain Chocolate Factory, Inc., a Delaware corporation, and its subsidiaries (including its operating subsidiary with the same name, Rocky Mountain Chocolate Factory, Inc., a Colorado corporation RMCF (referred to as the Company, we, us, or our is an international franchisor, confectionery producer and retail operator. Founded in 1981, we are headquartered in Durango, Colorado and produce an extensive line of premium chocolate products and other confectionery products. Our revenues and profitability are derived principally from our franchised/licensed system of retail stores that feature chocolate and other confectionery products including gourmet caramel apples. We also sell our confectionery products in select locations outside of our system of retail stores and license the use of our brand with certain consumer products. As of August 31, 2024, there was 2 Company-owned, 114 licensee-owned and 147 franchised Rocky Mountain Chocolate Factory stores operating in 36 states and the Philippines. 
 On May 1, 2023, subsequent to the end of ("fiscal year") FY 2023, the Company completed the sale of substantially all of the assets of its wholly-owned subsidiary and frozen yogurt business, U-Swirl International, Inc. The aggregate sale price of U-Swirl was 2.75 million, consisting of (i) 1.75 million in cash and (ii) 1.0 million evidenced by a three-year secured promissory note. The business divestiture of the U-Swirl segment was preceded by a separate sale of the Company s three owned U-Swirl locations on February 24, 2023. The consolidated financial statements present the historical financial results of the former U-Swirl segment as discontinued operations for all periods presented. See Note 15 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part I, Item 1 "Financial Statements", of this Quarterly Report for information on this divestiture. 
 With the sale of U-Swirl, we continue to focus on our confectionery franchise business to further enhance our competitive position and operating margin, simplify our business model, and deliver sustainable value to our stockholders. 
 On August 5, 2024, the Company entered into a securities purchase agreement with certain investors, including Steven L. Craig, an existing director of the Company (the Investors ), pursuant to which, among other things, the Investors agreed to subscribe for and purchase, and the Company agreed to issue and sell to the Investors in a private placement, an aggregate of 1,250,000 of shares of the Company s common stock at a price per share equal to 1.75, for total proceeds of approximately 2.2 million. On September 5, 2024, the Company filed a Form S-1 registering the shares sold in the private placement. The Form S-1 was declared effective by the SEC on October 9, 2024 . 
 On September 30, 2024, the Company repaid the amount owed under its credit agreement with Wells Fargo Bank N.A. and entered into a new credit agreement (the New Credit Agreement with RMC Credit Facility, LLC RMC ). Pursuant to the New Credit Agreement, the Company received an advance in the principal amount of 6.0 million, which advance is evidenced by a promissory note (the Note ). The Note will mature on September 30, 2027 (the Maturity Date ), and interest will accrue at a rate of 12 per annum and is payable monthly in arrears. All outstanding principal and interest will be due on the Maturity Date. RMC is a special purpose investment entity affiliated with Steven L.

Current Trends Affecting Our Business and Outlook 
 As a result of recent macroeconomic inflationary trends and disruptions to the global supply chain, we have experienced elevated raw material, labor, and freight costs. We continue to experience, although at a decelerating pace, labor and logistics challenges, which have contributed to lower factory, retail and e-commerce sales. In addition, we could experience additional lost sale opportunities if our products are not available for purchase as a result of continued disruptions in our supply chain relating to an inability to obtain ingredients or packaging, or if we or our franchisees experience delays in stocking our products. 
 We are subject to seasonal fluctuations in sales because of key holidays and the location of our franchisees, which have traditionally been located in high traffic areas such as resorts or tourist locations, and the nature of the products we sell, which are seasonal. Historically, the strongest sales of our products have occurred during key holidays and summer vacation seasons. Additionally, quarterly results have been, and in the future are likely to be, affected by the timing of new store openings and the sales of new franchise locations. Because of the seasonality of our business and the impact of new store openings and sales of new franchises, results for any quarter are not necessarily indicative of results that may be achieved in other quarters or for a full fiscal year. 
 The most important factors for continued growth in our earnings are our ability to increase the sales of premium chocolate products produced in our Durango production facility, and the support of our franchisees in increasing the frequency of customer visits and the average value of each customer transaction, along with ongoing e-commerce revenue growth, and new franchised store growth. 
 Our ability to successfully achieve expansion of our franchise systems depends on many factors not within our control including the availability of suitable sites for new store locations and the availability of qualified franchisees to support our expansion plans. 
 Efforts to reverse the decline in same store pounds purchased from our production facility by franchised stores and to increase total Durango production depend on many factors, including new store openings, competition, the receptivity of our franchise system to our product introductions and promotional programs.

Table of Contents 

The decrease in Durango product and retail sales of 2.0 , or 0.1 million for the three months ended August 31, 2024 compared to the three months ended August 31, 2023 was primarily due to decreased year-over-year franchisee demand for products purchased from the Durango production facility, in part impacted by a June 1, 2024 price increase to the franchise network, and in part as a result of lower total store count. 
 Royalties, Marketing Fees and Franchise Fees 
 Royalty and marketing fees decreased 0.1 million during the three months ended August 31, 2024 compared to the three months ended August 31, 2023, primarily due to a decrease in stores year over year that are subject to royalty fees. The decrease in franchise fee revenue of 3 thousand during the three months ended August 31, 2024 compared to the three months ended August 31, 2023 was not material.

Non-GAAP Measures 
 In addition to the results provided in accordance with GAAP, we provide certain non-GAAP measures, which present results on an adjusted basis. These are supplemental measures of performance that are not required by or presented in accordance with GAAP. Adjusted gross margin is a non-GAAP measure. Adjusted gross margin is equal to the sum of our total gross margin plus depreciation and amortization calculated in accordance with GAAP. We believe adjusted gross margin is helpful in understanding our past performance as a supplement to gross margin, and other performance measures calculated in conformity with GAAP. We believe that adjusted gross margin is useful to investors because they provide a measure of operating performance and our ability to generate cash that is unaffected by non-cash

accounting measures. Additionally, we use adjusted gross margin rather than gross margin to make incremental pricing decisions. Adjusted gross margin has limitations as analytical tools because they exclude the impact of depreciation and amortization expense and you should not consider it in isolation or as a substitute for any measure reported under GAAP. Our use of capital assets makes depreciation and amortization expense a necessary element of our costs and our ability to generate income. Due to these limitations, we use adjusted gross margin as measures of performance only in conjunction with GAAP measures of performance such as gross margin. 
 Cost of Sales and Gross Margin 
 Total gross margin percentage increased to 11.5 for the three months ended August 31, 2024 compared to a gross margin of 7.7 during the three months ended August 31, 2023, due primarily to an increase in selling prices and operational efficiencies. 
 Franchise Costs 
 The increase in franchise costs for the three months ended August 31, 2024 compared to the three months ended August 31, 2023 was due primarily to investments made in our franchise development team designed to increase franchised store locations as we continue to build our franchise network and identify new sites and franchisees. As a percentage of total royalty and marketing fees and franchise fee revenue, franchise costs increased to 65.1 for the three months ended August 31, 2024 from 39.8 for the three months ended August 31, 2023. 
 Sales and Marketing 
 The decrease in sales and marketing costs during the three months ended August 31, 2024 compared to the three months ended August 31, 2023 was due in part due to operational efficiencies and cost cutting measures and in part due to timing of anticipated expenses. 
 General and Administrative 
 The decrease in general and administrative costs during the three months ended August 31, 2024 compared to the three months ended August 31, 2023, was due primarily to a decrease in legal and third-party fees. As a percentage of total revenues, general and administrative expenses decreased to 25.4 during the three months ended August 31, 2024, compared to 25.7 during the three months ended August 31, 2023. 
 Retail Operating Expenses 
 Retail operating expenses increased 19.8 during the three months ended August 31, 2024 compared to the three months ended August 31, 2023. This increase is primarily the result of the addition of the Corpus Christi location and the acceleration of expenses on a year-over-year basis. 
 Depreciation and Amortization 
 Depreciation and amortization, exclusive of depreciation and amortization included in cost of sales was 38 thousand during the three months ended August 31, 2024, an increase of 18.8 from 32 thousand during the three months ended August 31, 2023. Depreciation and amortization included in cost of sales increased 3.8 from 0.2 million during the three months ended August 31, 2023 to 0.2 million during the three months ended August 31, 2024. This increase was the result of investment in production equipment. 
 Total Other Income (Expense) 
 Total other income was 192 thousand during the three months ended August 31, 2024, compared to other income of 12 thousand during for the three months ended August 31, 2023. A net gain on the disposal of assets for 0.2 million during the three months ended August 31, 2024 is included in total other income relating to sale of equipment of 0.5 million offset by loss on the factoring of the U-Swirl promissory note of 0.3 million. In addition, there was interest income of 7 thousand for the three months ended August 31, 2024 compared to 18 thousand for the three months ended August 31, 2023, and interest expense of 63 thousand for the three months ended August 31, 2024 compared to 6 thousand during for the three months ended August 31, 2023.

Durango Product and Retail Sales 
 The increase in Durango product and retail sales of 1.6 , or 0.2 million for the six months ended August 31, 2024 compared to the six months ended August 31, 2023 was primarily due to improved year-over-year franchisee demand, a June 1, 2024 price increase to the network of stores, and lower year-over-year store count. 
 Royalties, Marketing Fees and Franchise Fees 
 Royalty and marketing fees decreased 0.4 million during the six months ended August 31, 2024 compared to the six months ended August 31, 2023, primarily due to a decrease in stores year over year that are subject to royalty fees. The increase in franchise fee revenue of 22 thousand during the six months ended August 31, 2024 compared to the six months ended August 31, 2023 was primarily the result of an increase in store ownership transfer fees received in the current year.

 Cost of Sales and Gross Margin

This increase was the result of investment in production equipment. 
 Other Income (Expense) 
 Other income was 164 thousand during the six months ended August 31, 2024, compared to other income of 25 thousand during for the six months ended August 31, 2023. This was primarily due to a net gain on the disposal of assets for 0.2 million during the six months ended August 31, 2024 relating to gain on sale of equipment of 0.5 million offset by loss on the factoring of the U-Swirl promissory note of 0.3 million. In addition, there was interest income of 14 thousand for the six months ended August 31, 2024 compared to 38 thousand for the six months ended August 31, 2023, and interest expense of 98 thousand for the six months ended August 31, 2024 compared to 13 thousand during for the six months ended August 31, 2023. 
 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 As of August 31, 2024, working capital was 2.1 million compared with 1.5 million as of February 29, 2024. The increase in working capital was due primarily to the sale of our non-strategic operating assets, additional inventory on hand to support upcoming holidays sales, and assets held for sale. In addition, the Company drew down 2.2 million on its line of credit and received 2.2 million from the issuance of common stock. These proceeds were used in part to build up our inventory in advance of the upcoming holiday sales. 
 Cash and cash equivalent balances decreased from 2.1 million as of February 29, 2024 to 1.0 million as of August 31, 2024 primarily as a result of cash used by operating activities during our seasonally slow selling periods, and a time in our annual business cycle in which we build inventory to meet elevated demand during our subsequent seasonally high selling periods. Our current ratio was 1.24 to 1.0 on August 31, 2024 compared to 1.19 to 1.0 on February 29, 2024. We monitor current and anticipated future levels of cash and cash equivalents in relation to anticipated operating, financing and investing requirements necessary to implement our long-term business plan. 
 During the six months ended August 31, 2024, we had a consolidated net loss of 2.4 million. Operating activities used cash of 5.7 million, with the principal adjustment to reconcile net income to net cash used in operating activities being depreciation and amortization of 0.5 million and a gain on sale of assets of 0.2 million. Changes in operating assets and liabilities resulted in a net cash outflow of 5.7 million from cash used in the normal course of business. During the six months ended August 31, 2023, we had a consolidated net loss of 1.8 million. Operating activities used cash of 1.0 million, with the principal adjustment to reconcile net income to net cash used in operating activities being depreciation and amortization of 0.4 million, and stock compensation expense of 0.3 million. 
 During the six months ended August 31, 2024, cash flows from investing activities was 0.2 million, primarily due to the purchases of property and equipment of 1.5 million, offset by proceeds from sale of assets of 1.6 million. In comparison, investing activities provided for cash of 0.2 million during the six months ended August 31, 2023, primarily due cash flows from discontinued operations of 1.4 million, partially offset by purchases of property and equipment of 1.3 million.

There were 4.4 million cash flows from financing activities during the six months ended August 31, 2024 compared to no cash flows from financing activities during the six months ended August 31, 2023. The Company received 2.2 million on its revolving line of credit during the six months ended August 31, 2024 as discussed further below, in addition to proceeds of 2.2 million from the issuance and sale of common stock. 
 The conditions above raise substantial doubt regarding our ability to continue as a going concern for a period of at least one year from the date of issuance of these financial statements. In addition, our independent registered public accounting firm, in their report on the Company s February 29, 2024 audited financial statements, raised substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. 
 Revolving Line of Credit and New Credit Agreement 
 Pursuant to a credit agreement, as amended (the Credit Agreement ), with Wells Fargo Bank N.A. (the Lender ), we have a 4.0 million credit line for general corporate and working capital purposes, of which 0.6 million was available for borrowing (subject to certain borrowing-based limitations) as of August 31, 2024 (the Credit Line ). The Credit Line is secured by substantially all of our assets, except retail store assets. Interest on borrowings is at the Secured Overnight Financing Rate plus 2.37 (7.69 at August 31, 2024 and 7.69 at February 29, 2024). Additionally, the Credit Line is subject to various financial ratio and leverage covenants. Per the Credit Agreement, the maturity date is September 30, 2024. 
 As of August 31, 2024 we were not in compliance with the requirement under the Credit Agreement to maintain a ratio of total current assets to total current liabilities of at least 1.5 to 1. Our current ratio as of August 31, 2024 was 1.24 to 1. The Company repaid this agreement on September 30, 2024 as discussed below and terminated the Credit Agreement. 
 
 On September 30, 2024, the Company entered into a new credit agreement (the New Credit Agreement with RMC Credit Facility, LLC ("RMC"). Pursuant to the New Credit Agreement, the Company received an advance in the principal amount of 6.0 million, which advance is evidenced by a promissory note (the Note ). The Note will mature on September 30, 2027 (the Maturity Date ), and interest will accrue at a rate of 12 per annum and is payable monthly in arrears. All outstanding principal and interest will be due on the Maturity Date. The New Credit Agreement is collateralized by the Company s Durango real estate property and the related inventory and property, plant and equipment located on that property, as well as the Company s accounts receivable and cash accounts. 
 
 In connection with the New Credit Agreement and the Note, the Company entered into a Deed of Trust with RMC and the Public Trustee of La Plata County, Colorado with respect to the Company s property in Durango, Colorado. RMC is a special purpose investment entity affiliated with Steven L. Craig, one of the members of Parent s board of directors. 
 
 The proceeds of the New Credit Agreement were and will be used as follows: (i) 3.5 million was used to repay the Credit Agreement and (ii) the remaining balance will be used for continued capital investment and working capital needs. The New Credit Agreement contains customary events of default, including nonpayment of principal and interest when due, failure to comply with covenants, and a change of control of the Company, as well as customary affirmative and negative covenants, including, without limitation, certain reporting obligations and certain limitations on liens, encumbrances, and indebtedness. The New Credit Agreement also limits our capital expenditures to 3.5 million per year and contains two financial covenants measured quarterly: a maximum ratio of total liabilities to total net worth and a minimum current ratio. 
 The Company will continue to explore additional means of strengthening its liquidity position and ensuring compliance with its debt financing covenants, which may include the obtaining of waivers from our lenders. 
 
 On August 5, 2024, the Company entered into a securities purchase agreement with certain investors, including Steven L. Craig, an existing director of the Company (the Investors ), pursuant to which, among other things, the Investors agreed to subscribe for and purchase, and the Company agreed to issue and sell to the Investors in a private placement, an aggregate of 1,250,000 of shares of the Company s common stock at a price per share equal to 1.75, for total proceeds of approximately 2.2 million. On September 5, 2024, the Company filed a Form S-1 registering the shares sold in the private placement. The Form S-1 was declared effective by the SEC on October 9, 2024.

Significant Accounting Policies 
 The preparation of consolidated financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with GAAP and the Company s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and operating results require the Company s management to make judgments, assumptions and estimates that affect the amounts reported. Note 1, Nature of Operations and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report and in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended February 29, 2024 describe the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of the Company s consolidated financial statements. There have been no material changes to the Company s significant accounting policies disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended February 29, 2024. 
 Off Balance Sheet Arrangements 
 As of August 31, 2024, except for the purchase obligations as described below, we had no material off-balance sheet arrangements or obligations. 
 As of August 31, 2024, we had purchase obligations of approximately 2.5 million. These purchase obligations primarily consist of contractual obligations for future purchases of commodities for use in our manufacturing. 
 Impact of Inflation 
 Inflationary factors such as increases in the costs of ingredients and labor directly affect the Company's operations. Most of the Company's leases provide for cost-of-living adjustments and require it to pay taxes, insurance and maintenance expenses, all of which are subject to inflation. Additionally, the Company s future lease cost for new facilities may include potentially escalating costs of real estate and construction. There is no assurance that the Company will be able to pass on increased costs to its customers. 
 Depreciation expense is based on the historical cost to the Company of its fixed assets and is therefore potentially less than it would be if it were based on the current replacement cost. While property and equipment acquired in prior years will ultimately have to be replaced at higher prices, it is expected that replacement will be a gradual process over many years. 
 Seasonality 
 We are subject to seasonal fluctuations in sales, which cause fluctuations in quarterly results of operations. Historically, the strongest sales of our products have occurred during key holidays and the summer vacation season. In addition, quarterly results have been, and in the future are likely to be, affected by the timing of new store openings and sales of franchises. Because of the seasonality of our business and the impact of new store openings and sales of franchises, results for any quarter are not necessarily indicative of results that may be achieved in other quarters or for a full fiscal year. 
 Item 3. Qua ntitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk 
 As a smaller reporting company, we are not required to provide the information required by this Item. 
 Item 4. Contr ols and Procedures 
 Disclosure Controls and Procedures and Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
 Disclosure Controls and Procedures The Company maintains disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act), that are designed to ensure that material information relating to the Company is made known to the officers who certify the Company s financial reports and to other members of senior management and the Board of Directors. These disclosure controls and procedures are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the Company s reports that are filed or submitted under the Exchange Act, are recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that 
 31 

Table of Contents 

information required to be disclosed in the reports that the Company files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive and principal financial officer, or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 
 Management, under the supervision and with the participation of our Interim Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, has conducted an evaluation of the Company s disclosure controls and procedures. Based on that evaluation, our Interim Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that the Company s disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of August 31, 2024. 
 Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) that occurred during the quarter ended August 31, 2024, that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

PART II. OTH ER INFORMATION 
 
 Item 1. Le gal Proceedings 
 We are not aware of any pending legal actions that would, if determined adversely to us, have a material adverse effect on our business and operations. 
 We may, from time to time, become involved in disputes and proceedings arising in the ordinary course of business. In addition, as a public company, we are also potentially susceptible to litigation, such as asserting violations of securities laws. Any such claims, with or without merit, if not resolved, could be time-consuming and result in costly litigation. There can be no assurance that an adverse result in any future proceeding would not have a potentially material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition. 
 Item 1A. Ri sk Factors 
 
 In addition to the other information set forth in this Quarterly Report, you should carefully consider the factors discussed in Part 1, Item 1A. "Risk Factors" in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended February 29, 2024, filed with the SEC on June 13, 2024. Except as set forth below, there have been no material changes in our risk factors from those disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended February 29, 2024. 
 
 Our ability to use our net operating loss carryforwards and certain other tax attributes may be limited. 
 
 As of February 29, 2024, we had U.S. federal net operating loss NOL carryforwards of 14.5 million and various state NOLs, which we may use to reduce future taxable income. We have established a valuation allowance against the carrying value of these deferred tax assets. There is also a risk that due to regulatory changes, such as suspensions on the use of NOLs, or other unforeseen reasons, our existing NOLs could expire or otherwise be unavailable to offset future taxable income. 
 
 In addition, under Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the Code a corporation that undergoes an ownership change i.e. , a more-than 50 ownership change by one or more stockholders or groups of stockholders who own at least 5 of a company s stock over a three-year testing period) is subject to limitations on its ability to utilize its NOLs to offset future taxable income. Furthermore, our ability to utilize NOLs of companies that we have acquired or may acquire in the future may be subject to limitations. Changes in our stock ownership, some of which are outside of our control, could also result in limitations under Section 382 of the Code. Our NOLs may also be limited under similar provisions of state law. For these reasons, we may not be able to realize a tax benefit from the use of our NOLs. 
 
 The sale of shares of our common stock acquired by purchasers in private placement transactions could cause the price of our common stock to decline. 
 
 We have registered for sale by investors in a private placement transaction (the Selling Stockholders up to 1,250,000 shares of our common stock. Depending on a variety of factors, including market liquidity of our common stock, the sale of shares by the Selling Stockholders may cause the trading price of our common stock to decline. 
 
 Our need for future financing may result in the issuance of additional securities, which will cause investors to experience dilution. 
 
 Our cash requirements may vary from those now planned, depending upon numerous factors. Accordingly, we may need to obtain additional funding in connection with our continuing operations. There are no other commitments by any person for future financing. Our securities may be offered to other investors at a price lower than the price per share offered to current stockholders, or upon terms which may be deemed more favorable than those offered to current stockholders. In addition, the issuance of securities in any future financing may dilute an investor s equity ownership and have the effect of depressing the market price for our securities. Moreover, we may issue securities from time to time to procure qualified personnel or for other business reasons. The issuance of any such securities, which is at the discretion of our board of directors, may further dilute the equity ownership of our stockholders. 
 33 

Table of Contents 

We have additional securities available for issuance, which, if issued, could adversely affect the rights of the holders of our common stock. 
 
 Our Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation authorizes the issuance of 46,000,000 shares of common stock and 250,000 shares of preferred stock. In certain circumstances, our common stock, as well as the awards available for issuance under our equity incentive plans, can be issued by our board of directors without stockholder approval. Any future issuances of such stock would further dilute the percentage ownership of us held by holders of preferred stock and common stock. In addition, the issuance of certain securities, including pursuant to the terms of our stockholder rights plan, may be used as an anti-takeover device without further action on the part of our stockholders, and may adversely affect the holders of the common stock. 
 
 Future sales of shares of common stock could cause the market price for our common stock to decline. 
 
 We cannot predict the effect, if any, that market sales of shares of our common stock or the availability of shares of common stock for sale will have on the market price of our common stock prevailing from time to time. Sales of substantial amounts of shares of common stock in the public market, or the perception that those sales will occur, could cause the market price of our common stock to decline or be depressed. 
 
 Our Credit Agreement imposes operating and financial restrictions on us. 
 On September 30, 2024, we entered into a credit agreement with RMC Credit Facility, LLC (the Credit Agreement ), which is secured by certain personal property and real property of the Company. The Credit Agreement contains covenants that limit the ability of the Company to: 
 incur and guarantee additional debt; 

incur liens; 

make acquisitions and other investments; 

dispose of assets; or 

make capital expenditures in any fiscal year in excess of 3.5 million. 

Further, the Credit Agreement contains financial covenants that require compliance with a maximum ratio of total liabilities to total net worth and a minimum current ratio, in each case tested at the end of each fiscal quarter. These covenants may adversely affect our ability to finance our operations, meet or otherwise address our capital needs, pursue business opportunities or react to market conditions, or otherwise restrict our activities or business plans. We cannot assure you that we will be able to comply with any such restrictive covenants. A breach of any of these covenants could result in an event of default under the Credit Agreement. In the event that we are unable to comply with these covenants in the future, we would seek an amendment or waiver of the covenants. We cannot assure you that any such waiver or amendment would be granted. If an event of default occurs, the lender may elect to accelerate our obligations under the Credit Agreement. We might not be able to repay our debt or borrow sufficient funds to refinance it on terms that are acceptable to us or at all. 
 Servicing our debt under Credit Agreement may require a significant amount of cash, and we may not have sufficient cash flow from our business to pay all of our indebtedness. 
 As of September 30, 2024, we had 6.0 million principal amount outstanding under our Credit Agreement. Our ability to make scheduled payments of the principal of, to pay interest on or to refinance our indebtedness under the Credit Agreement depends on our future performance, which is subject to economic, financial, competitive, and other factors beyond our control. Our business may not generate cash flow from operations in the future sufficient to service our debt and make necessary capital expenditures. If we are unable to generate such cash flow, we may be required to adopt one or more alternatives, such as selling assets, restructuring debt, or obtaining additional debt financing or equity capital on terms that may be onerous or highly dilutive. Our ability to refinance any future indebtedness will 
 34 

Table of Contents 

depend on the capital markets and our financial condition at such time. We may not be able to engage in any of these activities or engage in these activities on desirable terms, which could result in a default on our debt obligations. Additionally, the Credit Agreement contains, and any of our future debt agreements may also contain, restrictive covenants that may prohibit us from adopting some or any of these alternatives. For example, the Credit Agreement contains negative covenants that restrict the Company s ability to incur indebtedness, create liens, make investments, dispose of assets and make certain capital expenditures. Our failure to comply with these covenants could result in an event of default under our indebtedness which, if not cured or waived, could result in the acceleration of our debt under the Credit Agreement. 
 In addition, our indebtedness, combined with our other financial obligations and contractual commitments, could have other important consequences. For example, it could: 
 require a portion of our cash flows to be dedicated to debt service payments instead of other purposes, thereby reducing the amount of cash flows available for working capital and capital expenditures, and for other general corporate purposes; 

make us more vulnerable to adverse changes in general U.S. and worldwide economic, industry, and competitive conditions and adverse changes in government regulations; 

limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and industry; and 

place us at a disadvantage compared to our competitors who have less debt. 

Any of these factors could harm our business, results of operations, and financial condition. In addition, if we incur additional indebtedness, the risks related to our business and our ability to service or repay our indebtedness would increase. 
 Item 2. Un registered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds 
 
 On August 5, 2024, the Company entered into a securities purchase agreement with certain investors, including Steven L. Craig, an existing director of the Company (the Investors ), pursuant to which, among other things, the Investors agreed to subscribe for and purchase, and the Company agreed to issue and sell to the Investors, an aggregate of 1,250,000 of shares of the Company s common stock at a price per share equal to 1.75, for total proceeds of approximately 2.2 million. The net proceeds raised were used for working capital and general corporate purposes. 
 
 The securities issued and sold to the Investors were not registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the Securities Act ), and were issued and sold in reliance on the exemption from registration requirements thereof provided by Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act and Rule 506 of Regulation D as promulgated by the SEC under the Securities Act. 
 
 Item 3. Defa ults Upon Senior Securities 
 
 None. 
 Item 4. Min e Safety Disclosures 
 Not Applicable.
