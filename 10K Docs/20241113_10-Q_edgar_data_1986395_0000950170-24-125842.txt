per share common shares ). The decision to elect the fair value option is determined on an instrument-by-instrument basis and must be applied to an entire instrument and is irrevocable once elected. Assets and liabilities measured at fair value pursuant to this guidance are required to be reported separately on the Company s condensed consolidated balance sheet from those instruments using another accounting method. The Company s fair value option elections will be made in accordance with the guidance in Accounting Standards Codification ASC 825, Financial Instruments ASC 825 that allows entities to make an irrevocable election of fair value as the initial and subsequent measurement attribute for certain eligible financial assets and liabilities. In the cases of loans and securities investments for which the fair value option is elected, loan origination fees and costs related to the origination or acquisition of the instrument should be immediately recognized in earnings on the condensed consolidated statements of operations within Other revenue. In the cases of debt facilities for which the fair value option is elected, financing fees related to the debt should be immediately recognized as an expense on the condensed consolidated statements of operations within Financing fees. Unrealized gains and losses on assets and liabilities for which the fair value option has been elected are also reported in earnings without deferral. This is because under the fair value option, a lender reports the instrument at its exit price (i.e., the price that would be received to sell the instrument in an orderly transaction), which reflects the market s assessment of the instrument s cash flows and risks and does not include any entity-specific costs or fees.

As of September 30, 2024 , Class D or Class T shares have been issued. Share Repurchase Plan The board of trustees has adopted a share repurchase plan, which commenced during the quarterly repurchase period ending March 31, 2024, which was the first full calendar quarter following the initial closing of the continuous private offering. Pursuant to the share repurchase plan, shareholders may request on a quarterly basis that the Company repurchase all or any portion of their shares. The Company is not obligated to repurchase any shares and may choose to repurchase only some, or even none, of the shares that have been requested to be repurchased in any particular quarter in its discretion. Repurchases will be made at the transaction price in effect on the repurchase date, except that shares that have not been outstanding for at least one year will be repurchased at of the transaction price (an Early Repurchase Deduction ). The holding period is measured from the first calendar day of the month the shares were issued to the subscription closing date immediately following the prospective repurchase date. The Early Repurchase Deduction will not apply to shares acquired through the distribution reinvestment plan DRIP ). The aggregate NAV of total repurchases of Class T shares, Class S shares, Class D shares, and Class I shares (including repurchases at certain non-U.S. investor access funds primarily created to hold our shares) under the share repurchase plan will be limited to no more than of the aggregate NAV per calendar quarter (measured using the aggregate NAV as of the end of the immediately preceding month). Shares issued to the Advisor pursuant to the Advisory Agreement (as defined below) are not subject to the share repurchase plan, including the quarterly volume limitation and the Early Repurchase Deduction. In the event that the Company determines to repurchase some but not all of the shares submitted for repurchase during any calendar quarter under the share repurchase plan, shares repurchased at the end of the calendar quarter will be repurchased on a pro rata basis. All unsatisfied repurchase requests must be resubmitted after the start of the next calendar quarter, or upon the recommencement of the share repurchase plan, as applicable.

 days from the date such Inactivity began (meaning, for the sake of clarity, that one Key Person s responsibilities may remain unfilled for longer than 90 days) (a Key Person Triggering Event ), then the Early Repurchase Deduction is waived with respect to shares that have been purchased in the preceding the expiration of business days after the disclosure by the Company of the occurrence of such Key Person Triggering Event Disclosure Date as set forth herein. If the Disclosure Date is (x) at least one (1) business day prior to the date upon which the transaction price is made available during a quarter-ending month, the Early Repurchase Deduction shall be waived through the first repurchase date or (y) on or following the date upon which the transaction price is made available during a quarter-ending month, the Early Repurchase Deduction shall be waived through the next two (2) repurchase dates. The waiver of the Early Repurchase Deduction set forth in this paragraph will not apply to shares acquired through the DRIP. Under the share repurchase plan, our board of trustees may amend, suspend or terminate the share repurchase plan at any time if it deems such action to be in our best interest. As a result, share repurchases may not be available each quarter. We may fund repurchase requests from sources other than cash flow from operations, including, without limitation, the sale of or repayment under our assets, borrowings or offering proceeds, and we have no limits on the amounts we may pay from such sources. Should repurchase requests, in the Company s judgment, place an undue burden on our liquidity, adversely affect our operations or risk having an adverse impact on the Company as a whole, or should we otherwise determine that investing our liquid assets in real estate or other investments rather than repurchasing our shares is in the best interests of the Company as a whole, then the Company may choose to repurchase fewer shares than have been requested to be repurchased, or none at all. Further, the board of trustees may make exceptions to, modify or suspend the share repurchase plan if it deems in its reasonable judgment such action to be in the Company s best interest. For the three months and nine months ended September 30, 2024 , the Company received repurchase requests. Distributions

of NAV per annum for the outstanding Class T shares, Class S shares, Class D shares, and Class I shares, payable monthly in arrears. The Company does not pay the Advisor the Management Fee with respect to the Class E shares. In calculating the Management Fee, we will use our NAV before giving effect to accruals for the Management Fee, Performance Fee, shareholder servicing fees or distributions payable on our common shares. The Management Fee may be paid, at the Advisor s election, in cash, Class I shares or Class E shares, or any combination thereof. To the extent that the Advisor elects to receive any portion of the Management Fee in Class I shares or Class E shares, we may repurchase such Class I shares or Class E shares from the Advisor at a later date. Our Class I shares or Class E shares obtained by the Advisor will not be subject to our share repurchase plan, including the repurchase limits and any Early Repurchase Deduction. The Advisor agreed to waive its Management Fee for the first three months following the initial closing of our continuous private offering (the period through February 29, 2024), and accordingly, management fee was earned during the year ended December 31, 2023. During the three and nine month periods ended September 30, 2024 , Management Fees earned by the Advisor were million and million , respectively. The Advisor may be entitled to receive a performance fee (the Performance Fee which is accrued monthly and payable quarterly (or part thereof that the Advisory Agreement is in effect) in arrears. The Performance Fee will be an amount, not less than zero, equal to (i) of the cumulative Core Earnings (as defined in the Advisory Agreement) for the immediately preceding four calendar quarters (each such period, a 4-Quarter Performance Measurement Period ), subject to a hurdle rate, expressed as an annual rate of return on average adjusted capital, equal to (the Annual Hurdle Rate ), minus (ii) the sum of any performance fees paid to the Advisor with respect to the first three calendar quarters in the applicable 4-Quarter Performance Measurement Period. For purposes of the Performance Fee, adjusted capital means cumulative net proceeds generated from sales of our Class T shares, Class S shares, Class D shares and Class I shares (including proceeds from the DRIP) reduced for distributions from dispositions of our investments paid to Class T, Class S, Class D and Class I shareholders and amounts paid to Class T, Class S, Class D and Class I shareholders for share repurchases pursuant to our share repurchase plan. The Advisor will not earn a Performance Fee for any calendar quarter until our Core Earnings for the applicable 4-Quarter Performance Measurement Period exceeds the Annual Hurdle Rate. Once our Core Earnings exceed the Annual Hurdle Rate, the Advisor is entitled to a catch-up fee equal to the amount of Core Earnings in excess of the Annual Hurdle Rate until our Core Earnings for the applicable 4-Quarter Performance Measurement Period exceed a percentage of average adjusted 

 17

 (or 1 minus 0.125) for the applicable 4-Quarter Performance Measurement Period. Thereafter, the Advisor is entitled to receive of our Core Earnings. Proportional calculation methodologies to be applied prior to the completion of four full calendar quarters are defined in the Advisory Agreement. The Performance Fee may be paid, at the Advisor s election, in cash, Class I shares or Class E shares, or any combination thereof. The Company does not pay the Advisor a Performance Fee on Class E shares. To the extent that the Advisor elects to receive any portion of the Performance Fee in Class I shares or Class E shares, we may repurchase such Class I shares or Class E shares from the Advisor at a later date. Our Class I shares or Class E shares obtained by the Advisor will not be subject to our share repurchase plan, including the repurchase limits and any Early Repurchase Deduction. During the three and nine month periods ended September 30, 2024, the Advisor earned Performance Fees of million and million , respectively.

It em 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 
 
 References herein to Starwood Credit Real Estate Income Trust Company, we, us, or our refer to Starwood Credit Real Estate Income Trust and its subsidiaries unless the context specifically requires otherwise. 
 
 The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the condensed consolidated financial statements and notes thereto appearing elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. 
 Forward-Looking Statements 
 
 Some of the statements in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q constitute forward-looking statements because they relate to future events or our future performance or financial condition. The forward-looking statements contained in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q may include statements as to: 
 our future operating results; 

our business prospects and the prospects of the assets in which we may invest; 

the impact of the investments that we expect to make; 

our ability to raise sufficient capital to execute our investment and lending strategies; 

our ability to source adequate investment and lending opportunities to efficiently deploy capital; 

our current and expected financing arrangements; 

the effect of global and national economic and market conditions generally upon our operating results, including, but not limited to, changes with respect to inflation, interest rate changes and supply chain disruptions, and changes in government rules, regulations and fiscal policies; 

the adequacy of our cash resources, financing sources and working capital; 

the timing and amount of cash flows and distributions, if any, from our investments; 

our contractual arrangements and relationships with third parties; 

actual and potential conflicts of interest with the Advisor (as defined below) or any of its affiliates; 

the dependence of our future success on the general economy and its effect on the assets in which we may invest; 

our use of financial leverage; 

the ability of the Advisor to locate suitable investments for us and to monitor and administer our investments; 

the ability of the Advisor or its affiliates to attract and retain highly talented professionals; 

our ability to structure investments in a tax-efficient manner and the effect of changes to tax legislation and our tax position; and 

the tax status of the assets in which we may invest. 

In addition, words such as anticipate, believe, expect and intend indicate a forward-looking statement, although not all forward-looking statements include these words. The forward-looking statements contained in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results could differ materially from those implied or expressed in the forward-looking statements for any reason, including the factors set forth in Item 1A. Risk Factors section of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 and elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Other factors that could cause actual results to differ materially include: 
 changes in the economy, particularly those affecting the real estate industry; 

risks associated with possible disruption in our operations or the economy generally due to terrorism, natural disasters, epidemics or other events having a broad impact on the economy; 

adverse conditions in the areas where our investments or the properties underlying such investments are located and local real estate conditions; 

our portfolio may be concentrated in certain industries and geographies, and, as a consequence, our aggregate return may be substantially affected by adverse economic or business conditions affecting that particular type of asset or geography; 

limitations on our business and our ability to satisfy requirements to maintain our exclusion from registration under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the Investment Company Act ), or to maintain our qualification as a REIT (as defined below) for U.S. federal income tax purposes; 

since there is no public trading market for our common shares, repurchase of common shares by us will likely be the only way to dispose of your shares. Our share repurchase plan provides shareholders with the opportunity to request that we repurchase their shares on a quarterly basis, but we are not obligated to repurchase any shares and may choose to repurchase only some, or even none, of the 

21 

shares that have been requested to be repurchased in any particular quarter in our discretion. In addition, repurchases will be subject to available liquidity and other significant restrictions. Further, our board of trustees may make exceptions to, modify and suspend our share repurchase plan if, in its reasonable judgment, it deems such action to be in our best interest. As a result, our common shares should be considered as having only limited liquidity and at times may be illiquid; 

distributions are not guaranteed and may be funded from sources other than cash flow from operations, including, without limitation, borrowings, offering proceeds, the sale of our assets, and repayments of our real estate debt investments, and we have no limits on the amounts we may fund from such sources; 

the purchase and repurchase prices for our common shares are generally based on our prior month s net asset value NAV and are not based on any public trading market; and 

future changes in laws or regulations and conditions in our operating areas. 

Although we believe the assumptions underlying the forward-looking statements, are reasonable, any of the assumptions could be inaccurate, and, as a result, the forward-looking statements based on those assumptions also could be inaccurate. In light of the these and other uncertainties, the inclusion of a projection or forward-looking statement in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q should not be regarded as a representation by us that our plans and objectives will be achieved. These forward-looking statements apply only as of the date of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Moreover, we assume no duty and do not undertake to update the forward-looking statements. 
 Overview 
 
 We are a Maryland statutory trust formed on June 28, 2023 and we have elected to be taxed as a real estate investment trust REIT for U.S. federal income tax purposes, commencing with our taxable year ended December 31, 2023. We are externally managed by our investment advisor, Starwood Credit Advisors, L.L.C. Advisor ), an indirect, wholly-owned subsidiary of Starwood Capital Group Holdings L.P. Starwood Holdings and together any entity that is controlled by, controls or is under common control with Starwood Holdings, and any of their respective predecessor entities, Starwood Capital or the Sponsor ). Starwood Capital is a private investment firm with a primary focus on global real estate. Since its inception in 1991, Starwood Capital has raised over 80 billion of capital and currently has approximately 115 billion of assets under management. 
 Our investment objectives are to invest primarily in debt on high quality assets that will enable us to: 
 provide current income in the form of regular, stable cash distributions to achieve an attractive distribution yield; 

preserve and protect invested capital, by focusing on high quality real assets with current cash-flow and/or limited business plan risk; 

reduce downside risk through conservative loan-to-value ratios against high quality real assets with meaningful borrower equity or implied equity; and 

provide an investment alternative for shareholders seeking to allocate a portion of their long-term investment portfolios to commercial real estate CRE debt with lower volatility than publicly traded securities and compelling risk-adjusted returns compared to fixed income alternatives. 

Our investment strategy is to originate, acquire, finance and manage a portfolio of primarily CRE debt investments, focused on senior secured, floating-rate CRE loans diversified across both geography and asset class. Our CRE loans are expected to be primarily secured by properties located in U.S., European and Australian markets and include multifamily, industrial and select other CRE asset classes, such as student housing, self-storage, life science and data center assets. To a lesser extent, we may invest in (1) other real asset lending strategies, including infrastructure loans, and (2) other real-estate related debt and equity securities, including commercial mortgage-backed securities CMBS and collateralized loan obligations CLOs ). 
 Our board of trustees has ultimate oversight and policy-making authority over us, including responsibility for governance, financial controls, compliance and disclosure. Pursuant to the Advisory Agreement, we delegated to the Advisor the authority to source, evaluate and monitor our investment opportunities and make decisions related to the acquisition, management, financing and disposition of our assets, in accordance with our investment objectives, guidelines, policies and limitations, subject to oversight by our board of trustees. 
 We are structured as a non-listed, perpetual-life REIT, and therefore our securities are not listed on a national securities exchange and, as of the date of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, there is no plan to list our securities on a national securities exchange. We are organized as a holding company and conduct our business primarily through our various subsidiaries. We have elected to be taxed as a REIT under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended for U.S. federal income tax purposes and generally will not be subject to U.S. federal income taxes on our taxable income to the extent we annually distribute all of our REIT taxable income to shareholders and maintain our qualification as a REIT. 
 We are conducting a continuous, blind pool private offering of our common shares in reliance on an exemption from the registration requirements of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the Securities Act ), to investors that are (i) accredited investors (as defined in Regulation D under the Securities Act) and (ii) in the case of common shares sold outside the United States, to persons that are not U.S. persons (as defined in Regulation S under the Securities Act), which commenced on October 31, 2023. The Company intends to use the net proceeds primarily to make investments in commercial real estate debt and real estate-related securities consistent with our investment guidelines and for other general corporate purposes. We intend to sell our common shares in our continuous, blind pool private offering on a monthly basis. 
 22 

We are not aware of any material trends or uncertainties, favorable or unfavorable, other than national economic conditions affecting real estate generally, that may be reasonably anticipated to have a material impact on either capital resources or the revenues or income to be derived from our real estate debt investments or real estate-related securities, other than those referred to in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.

During the three months ended September 30, 2024, total revenue were 16.0 million, and consisted of interest income of 12.6 million and other revenue of 3.4 million (predominantly origination fees). During the three months ended June 30, 2024, total revenues were 10.3 million, and consisted of interest income of 8.2 million and other revenue of 2.1 million (predominantly origination fees). The 5.7 million quarter over quarter increase in total revenues was primarily attributable to (i) the increase of the number of our loan investments, including the three newly-originated interest bearing loans during the third quarter with a total unpaid principal balance of 335.0 million and (ii) revenues related to earned interest for the entire calendar quarter on the loans originated during the prior quarter. 

Interest expense was 7.8 million and 4.7 million for the three month periods ended September 30, 2024 and June 30, 2024, respectively. The 3.1 million quarter over quarter increase in interest expense was due to the larger debt balances outstanding required to finance the expanded loan investment portfolio, as discussed in the preceding paragraph. 

Financing fees expense was 0.9 million and 2.9 million for the three month periods ended September 30, 2024 and June 30, 2024, respectively. The 2.0) million quarter over quarter decrease in financing fees expense was due to the relatively high level of financing fees incurred during the second calendar quarter when two new debt funding facilities (the Morgan Stanley International Repurchase Agreement and the Wells Fargo Repurchase Agreement) were established and the Citibank Repurchase Agreement was expanded and amended. In contrast, during the third calendar quarter of 2024, only one new debt funding facility (Morgan Stanley US Repurchase Agreement) was established. In addition to the legal and other fees incurred in establishing these facilities, additional facility commitment fees were incurred and paid upon the execution of the relevant documents for each new facility based on the full funding capacity of the respective facilities. 

During the three months ended September 30, 2024 and June 30, 2024, professional fees were approximately 0.7 million and 0.8 million, respectively. During the three months ended September 30, 2024, professional fees were primarily related to operating costs incurred during the period. 0.5 million of these costs have been advanced by the Advisor and paid on behalf of the Company. Pursuant to the Advisory Agreement, the Advisor may advance certain operating expenses on behalf of the Company through December 1, 2024, the first anniversary of the initial closing of the continuous private offering. Pursuant to the Amendment (as defined below), the Company will reimburse the outstanding balance of such advances to the Advisor ratably in 60 monthly installments commencing on January 1, 2026. 

The Company pays the Advisor a management fee (the Management Fee and a performance fee (the Performance Fee pursuant to the terms of the Advisory Agreement. During the three month periods ended September 30, 2024 and June 30, 2024, Management Fees were 0.5 million and 0.4 million, respectively, as the Company continued to raise additional equity capital each month pursuant to its continuous private offering. Performance Fees during the three month period ended September 30, 2024, were 0.6 million. There were no Performance Fees incurred during the three month period ended June 30, 2024. Performance Fees during 2024, are based on the cumulative (year-to-date) Core Earnings as a percentage of average adjusted capital. For the first nine months of 2024, the Core Earnings as a percentage of average adjusted capital was in excess of the 5 annual hurdle rate, resulting in total Performance Fees of 0.7 million through September 30, 2024. Due to the adverse impact of the relatively high level of commitment fee expenses incurred during the three months ended June 30, 2024, related to the establishment of the MS-International Facility and the WF Facility, as well as expanding the capacity and extending the term of the Citibank Facility, cumulative (year-to-date) Core Earnings as a percentage of 

24 

average adjusted capital was less than the 5 and therefore, zero Performance Fee expense was accrued during the three month period ending June 30, 2024. 

During the three months ended September 30, 2024 and June 30, 2024, general and administrative expenses were 0.1 million and 0.1 million, respectively. 

During the three months ended September 30, 2024, net loss from operations and financing was approximately (2.0) million and was primarily related to (2.7) million of unrealized losses on loan receivables arising from the receipt of origination fees on the new loan investments during the period, partially offset by net gain on foreign currency translation and derivative valuation.

 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 Liquidity is a measure of our ability to meet our cash requirements, including ongoing commitments to repay borrowings, fund and maintain our assets and operations, make new investments where appropriate, pay distributions to our shareholders and other general business needs. We closely monitor our liquidity position and believe that we have sufficient current liquidity and access to additional liquidity to meet our financial obligations for at least the next 12 months. 
 Starwood Capital has agreed, from time to time, to purchase from the Company an aggregate amount of not less than 150.0 million in Class E shares, at a price per share equal to the Company s most recently determined NAV of its Class E shares (the Initial Capitalization ). Starwood Capital has agreed to hold all of the Class E shares it receives in connection with the Initial Capitalization until, (i) with respect to the Class E shares issued in respect of the initial 125.0 million of its commitment, the earlier of (a) the first date that the Company's NAV reaches 1.0 billion and (b) the second anniversary of the initial closing of our continuous private offering (December 1, 2025), (ii) with respect to the Class E shares issued in respect of Starwood Capital s commitment in excess of 125.0 million, but not greater than 150.0 million, at least the second anniversary of the initial closing of our private offering (December 1, 2025) and (iii) with respect to any remaining Class E shares (representing purchases exceeding 150.0 million), at any time following the initial closing of our continuous private offering (December 1, 2023) (such date, the Applicable Liquidity Date ). As of September 30, 2024, Starwood Capital has purchased 31.5 million in our Class E shares. 
 We expect to generate cash primarily from (i) the net proceeds of our continuous private offering, (ii) cash flows from our operations, (iii) existing borrowing facilities and any financing arrangements we may enter into in the future and (iv) any future offerings of our equity or debt securities. 
 Our primary uses of cash will be for (i) origination or acquisition of commercial mortgage loans and other commercial debt investments, CMBS and other commercial real estate-related debt investments, (ii) the cost of operations (including the Management Fee and Performance Fee), (iii) debt service of any borrowings, (iv) periodic repurchases, including under our share repurchase plan (as described herein), and (v) cash distributions to the holders of our shares to the extent declared by our board of trustees. 
 The Company will seek to enter into additional bank debt, credit facility, and / or other financing arrangements on at least customary and market terms; however, such incurrence will be subject to prevailing market conditions, the Company s liquidity requirements, contractual and regulatory restrictions and other factors. As of September 30, 2024, the Company has established multiple loan repurchase facilities. The Company has pledged various loans as collateral and based on the value of the loans pledged as collateral and the maximum advanced rates attributed to each loan by the lender, is permitted to borrow as much as 28.0 million. As of September 30, 2024, the Company has 616.2 million in outstanding debt. Refer to Note 3- Investment in Loans Receivable and Note 4 - Loans Payable for further information.

 NAV and NAV Per Share Calculation 
 
 For the purposes of the monthly NAV computations, our board of trustees, including a majority of our independent trustees, adopted valuation guidelines that contain a comprehensive set of methodologies used by the Advisor and our Independent Valuation Advisor. These guidelines are designed to produce a fair and accurate estimate of the price that would be received for our investments in an arm s-length transaction between a willing buyer and a willing seller in possession of all material information about our investments. Periodically, our board of trustees, including a majority of our independent trustees, reviews the appropriateness of our valuation procedures. From time to time, our board of trustees, including a majority of our independent trustees, may adopt changes to the valuation guidelines if it (1) determines that such changes are likely to result in a more accurate reflection of NAV or a more efficient or less costly procedure for the determination of NAV without having a material adverse effect on the accuracy of such determination or (2) otherwise reasonably believes a change is appropriate for the determination of NAV. Refer to Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Conditions and Results of Operations on our Annual Report on Form 10-K for further information on the valuation methods used for the purposes of determining the valuations of our assets and liabilities, calculating related unrealized gains and losses and our monthly NAV. 
 
 With regard to the NAV calculations, the same fair values of assets and liabilities determined by the application of the methods cited above are generally used in monthly NAV calculations. To calculate our NAV for purposes of establishing a purchase and repurchase price for our common shares, we have adopted a model that calculates the fair values of our assets and liabilities in accordance with our valuation guidelines. Because these fair value calculations involve significant professional judgment in the application of both observable and unobservable inputs, the calculated fair value of our assets may differ from their actual realizable value or future fair value. While we believe our NAV calculation methodologies are consistent with standard industry practices, there is no rule or regulation that requires we calculate NAV in a certain way. As a result, other REITs may use different methodologies or assumptions to determine NAV. In addition, NAV is not a measure used under GAAP and the valuations of and certain adjustments made to our assets and liabilities used in the determination of NAV differ from GAAP. Shareholders should not consider NAV to be equivalent to shareholders' equity or any other GAAP measure. The calculation of our NAV is intended to be a calculation of the fair value of our assets less our outstanding liabilities as described below and will likely differ from the book value of our equity reflected in our financial statements. Each report prepared by the Independent Valuation Advisor is addressed solely to us. The Independent Valuation Advisor s reports are not addressed to the public and may not be relied upon by any other person to establish value of the facilities that will be used in calculating NAV. Our board of trustees has delegated to the Advisor the responsibility for monitoring significant events that may materially affect the values of our facilities for determining whether the existing valuations should be re-evaluated prior to the next scheduled monthly valuation in light of such significant events. 
 
 Each share class has an undivided interest in our assets and liabilities, other than class-specific shareholder servicing fees, distributions payable, the Management Fee and the Performance Fee. In accordance with the valuation guidelines, our fund administrator calculates our NAV per share for each class as of the last calendar day of each month, including the estimated fair value of (1) real estate debt and other investments owned by us and (2) any other assets and liabilities. Because shareholder servicing fees, distributions payable, the Management Fee and the Performance Fee allocable to a specific class of shares are only included in the NAV calculation for that class, the NAV per share for our classes of shares may differ. 
 
 The monthly NAV for each class of shares is based on the net asset values of our investments, the addition of any other assets (such as cash on hand), and the deduction of any other liabilities (including distributions payable, accrued Management Fees, accrued Performance Fees and the deduction of any shareholder servicing fees specifically applicable to such class of shares). At the end of each month, before taking into consideration repurchases or class-specific expense accruals for that month, any change in our aggregate NAV (whether an increase or decrease) is allocated among each class of shares based on each class s relative percentage of the previous aggregate NAV plus issuances of shares that were effective on the first calendar day of such month. The NAV calculation is available generally within 15 calendar days after the end of the applicable month. Changes in monthly NAV includes, without limitation, accruals of our net portfolio income, interest expense, the Management Fee, the Performance Fee, distributions, unrealized/realized gains and losses on assets, any applicable organization and offering expenses and any expense reimbursements. Changes in monthly NAV also include material non-recurring events occurring during the month. On an ongoing basis, the Advisor adjusts the accruals to reflect actual operating results and the outstanding receivable, payable and other account balances resulting from the accumulation of monthly accruals for which financial information is available. The operating expenses and organizational and offering expenses which are advanced by the Advisor to be reimbursed by us will not be included in such calculations until reimbursed to the Advisor. 
 
 For purposes of calculating our NAV, the organization expenses, offering costs and certain operating expenses paid by the Advisor through the first anniversary of the initial closing of our private offering are not deducted as an expense until reimbursed by the Company (however such expenses may be amortized in order to mitigate these effects). Commencing on January 1, 2026, we will reimburse the Advisor for any organization expenses, offering costs and operating expenses that it incurs on behalf of us as and when incurred (or promptly thereafter). 
 
 28 

Following the aggregation of the net asset values of our investments, the addition of any other assets (such as cash on hand) and the deduction of any other liabilities, our fund administrator incorporates any class-specific adjustments to NAV, including additional issuances and repurchases of shares and accruals of class-specific distributions, Management Fees, Performance Fees and shareholder servicing fees. The declaration of distributions will reduce the NAV for each class of shares in amounts equal to the accrued liabilities to pay any such distributions to the shareholders of record of each class. NAV per share for each class of shares is calculated by dividing such class s NAV at the end of each month by the number of shares outstanding for that class at the end of such month.

(1) Other assets represents accrued interest receivable and unamortized debt facility costs. In accordance with the fair value option under U.S. GAAP, direct costs incurred in the establishment of debt facilities are expensed at the time the facilities are established. For purposes of NAV, these costs are capitalized and amortized over the initial term of the debt facility, therefore included in the above amount. 
 (2) Under U.S. GAAP, we accrued an estimate of the full cost of the shareholder servicing fees over the life of each share as an offering cost at the time of sale of each Class T, Class S and Class D share. For purposes of NAV, the shareholder servicing fees are recognized as a reduction of NAV on a monthly basis.

(1) This represents the unamortized amount of organization expenses and offering costs advanced by the Advisor. The Advisor had agreed to advance organization and offering expenses on behalf of the Company (including legal, accounting, and other expenses attributable to the organization, but excluding upfront selling commissions, dealer manager fees and shareholder servicing fees) through the first anniversary of the date of the initial closing of the continuous private offering. Pursuant to the Amendment, the Company will reimburse the Advisor for all such advanced expenses ratably over the 60 months commencing on January 1, 2026. Organization and offering expenses incurred after the first anniversary of the initial closing of our private offering will be paid by the Company as incurred. 
 (2) This represents the unamortized amount of operating expenses advanced by the Advisor. The Advisor has agreed to advance certain of the Company s operating expenses through the first anniversary of the initial closing of the continuous private offering (December 1, 2024). Pursuant to the Amendment, the Company will reimburse the Advisor for such advanced expenses ratably over the 60 months commencing on January 1, 2026. Operating expenses incurred after the first anniversary of the initial closing of our private offering will be paid by the Company and deducted as an expense for NAV as incurred. 
 (3) Under U.S. GAAP, an estimate of the full cost of the shareholder servicing fees over the life of each share is accrued as an offering cost at the time of sale of the Class T, Class S and Class D shares. For purposes of NAV, we recognize the shareholder servicing fee as a reduction of NAV on a monthly basis. 
 (4) In accordance with the fair value option under U.S. GAAP, direct costs incurred in the establishment of debt facilities are expensed at the time the facilities are established. For purposes of NAV, these costs are capitalized and amortized over the initial term of the debt facility.

Distributions 
 
 Any distributions we make will be at the discretion of our board of trustees, considering factors such as our earnings, cash flow, capital needs and general financial condition. As a result, our distribution rates and payment frequency may vary from time to time. Shareholders are not entitled to receive a distribution on shares that are repurchased prior to the applicable time of the record date. 
 
 Our board of trustees discretion as to the payment of distributions will be directed, in substantial part, by its determination to cause us to comply with the REIT requirements. To maintain our qualification as a REIT, we generally are required to make aggregate annual distributions to our shareholders of at least 90 of our REIT taxable income, determined without regard to the distributions-paid deduction and excluding net capital gains. 
 
 Beginning December 29, 2023, we have declared monthly distributions for each class of common shares then-outstanding, which are generally paid three days after month-end. Each class of our common stock received the same gross distribution per share, which was 0.1292 per share for each of the nine months ended September 30, 2024. The net distribution rates per share vary for each class based on the applicable shareholder servicing fee, which is deducted from the gross distribution per share and paid to the Dealer Manager. The table below details the net distribution for each of our share classes for the nine months ended September 30, 2024:

Critical Accounting Estimates 
 Our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our condensed consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of the financial statements in accordance with GAAP involves significant judgments and assumptions and requires estimates about matters that are inherently uncertain. There have been no material changes to our Critical Accounting Estimates, including significant accounting policies that we believe are the most affect by our judgment, estimates and assumptions, which are described in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023.

 Subsequent Events 
 Deferral of Reimbursement to Advisor and Temporary Waiver of Management Fees 
 
 On October 16, 2024, the Board of Trustees approved Amendment No. 1 to the Advisory Agreement Amendment ), which amends the provisions of the Advisory Agreement related to the waiver of the management fee and reimbursement by the Company to the Advisory of the Company s organization and offering expenses and certain of the Company s operating expenses advanced by the Advisor (the Advanced Expenses ). Pursuant to the Amendment, the Advisor agreed to (i) be reimbursed by the Company for the Advanced Expenses in 60 equal monthly installments commencing January 1, 2026, (ii) an additional waiver of its management fee beginning on January 1, 2025 and continuing until the earlier of (x) July 1, 2026 and (y) the six months following the month in which the Company s cumulative gross proceeds generated from sales of Class T shares, Class S shares, Class D shares and Class I shares (excluding proceeds from (i) Distribution Reinvestment Plan and (ii) any investment from Strategic Investors (as defined in the Amendment)) exceeds 300,000,000 (measured from and including subscriptions in January 2025).

Item 3. Qu antitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk 
 The primary components of our market risk are expected to relate to interest rates, credit spreads, credit, credit market values, liquidity and foreign currency exchange rates. While we do not seek to avoid risk completely, we believe that risk can be quantified from historical experience, and we seek to actively manage that risk, to earn sufficient compensation to justify taking those risks and to maintain capital levels consistent with the risks we undertake. 
 Interest Rate Risk 
 Interest rate risk is highly sensitive to many factors, including governmental, monetary and tax policies, domestic and international economic and political considerations, and other factors beyond our control. Our interest income, net of interest expense net interest income is expected to be exposed to interest rate volatility primarily as a result of the floating rate nature of the investments we plan to hold and the financing we plan to place on them. Additionally, we may use company-level facilities featuring floating interest rates for liquidity and working capital purposes. Furthermore, we may make investments in fixed and floating rate debt securities and the value of our positions may increase or decrease depending on interest rate movements. Finally, interest rate changes may impact the demand for loans and the availability of financing needed to expand our investment portfolio. 
 A rise in the general level of interest rates can be expected to lead to higher debt service payment requirements relative to any variable rate investments we hold and to declines in the value of any fixed rate investments we may hold. Rising interest rates carry default risk to our borrowers, because cash flows from underlying properties may fall below the debt service payments due to us on the investments, triggering borrower liquidity covenants. Therefore, we expect to protect property cash flows by requiring borrowers to purchase interest rate caps, which provides a hedge against rising interest rates, whereby the borrower will receive excess cash if interest rates exceed predetermined strike prices. Furthermore, rising interest rates also cause our overall cost of borrowing to increase, partially or fully, offsetting any increase in elevated debt service payments received on our variable rate investments. In general, we will seek to match the interest rate characteristics of our investments with the interest rate characteristics of any related financing obligations. In instances where the interest rate characteristics of an investment and the related financing obligation are not matched, we may mitigate such interest rate risk through the utilization of interest rate derivatives of the same duration. Given our target leverage ratios, an increase in interest rates may result in an increase in our net investment income and the amount of the Performance Fee payable to the Advisor. 
 A decline in interest rates can be expected to lead to lower debt service payments received from any variable rate investments we may hold, decreases in the interest income earned on any floating rate investments we hold, and increases in the value of any fixed rate investments we hold. To mitigate the impact of reduced earnings as a result of declining interest rates, we expect to structure interest rate floors into loans where the borrower will be required to pay minimum interest payments should interest rates fall below a predetermined rate. Additionally, reduced interest rates also cause our overall cost of borrowings to decrease. Because our borrowings do not typically feature interest rate floors, but our variable rate investments feature minimum interest payments due to us, declining interest rates may result in an increase to the Company s net interest income and an increase in the amount of the Performance Fee payable to the Advisor. 
 The net interest income sensitivity analysis table presented below shows the estimated impact over a twelve-month period of an instantaneous parallel shift in the yield curve, up and down by 100 basis points, on our net interest income, assuming no changes in the composition of our commercial real estate loan investment portfolio and our outstanding borrowings in effect as of September 30, 2024. 
 The estimated impacted on net interest income is as follows (dollar amounts in thousands):

4.79 

-1.00 

(439) 
 
 -3.60 

Credit Spread Risk 
 Credit spread risk is the risk that interest rate spreads between two different financial instruments will change. In general, U.S. fixed-rate commercial mortgage loans and CMBS are priced based on a spread to U.S. Treasury securities or interest rate swaps. We will generally expect to benefit if credit spreads narrow during the time that we hold a portfolio of mortgage loans, CMBS and/or CLO investments, and we may experience losses if credit spreads widen during the time that we hold a portfolio of mortgage loans, CMBS and/or CLO investments. We will actively monitor our exposure to changes in credit spreads and we may enter into credit total return swaps or take positions in other credit-related derivative instruments to moderate our exposure to losses associated with a widening of credit spreads. 
 Credit Risk 
 We are exposed to credit risk in our investments with respect to a borrower s ability to make required debt service payments to us and repay the unpaid principal balance in accordance with the terms of the loan agreement. We expect to manage this risk by conducting a credit analysis prior to making an investment and by actively monitoring our portfolio and the underlying credit quality, including subordination and diversification, of our investments on an ongoing basis. In addition, we intend to re-evaluate the credit risk inherent in our investments on a regular basis taking into consideration a number of fundamental macro-economic factors such as gross domestic product, unemployment, interest rates, capital markets activity, retail sales, store closing/openings, corporate earnings, housing inventory, affordability and regional home price trends. 
 32 

We are exposed to credit risk with respect to the tenants that occupy properties that serve as collateral to our investments. To mitigate this risk, we seek to avoid large single tenant exposures and we undertake a credit evaluation of major tenants prior to making a loan. This analysis includes extensive due diligence of a potential tenant s creditworthiness and business, as well as an assessment of the strategic importance of the property to the tenant s core business operations. 
 Finally, we may be exposed to counterparty credit risk under the terms of a derivative contract. If the fair value of a derivative contract is positive, the counterparty will owe us, which creates credit risk for us. If the fair value of a derivative contract is negative, we will owe the counterparty and, therefore, do not have credit risk. We may seek to mitigate the credit risk associated with derivative instruments by entering into transactions with high-quality counterparties. 
 Market Value Risks 
 We may also be exposed to market value risk with respect to the fair value of our investments, including debt securities, and borrowings due to changes in market conditions, including credit spreads, interest rates, property cash flows, and commercial property values that serve as collateral. We seek to manage our exposure to market risk by originating or acquiring investments secured by different property types located in diverse, but liquid markets with stable credit ratings. The fair value of our investments may fluctuate, therefore the amount we will realize upon any repayment, sale, or an alternative liquidation event is unknown. 
 Commercial property values are subject to volatility and may be adversely affected by a number of factors, including national, regional and local economic conditions; local real estate conditions; changes or continued weakness in specific industry segments; construction quality, age and design; demographic factors; and retroactive changes to building or similar codes and/or tax and legal considerations. Changes in commercial property values are difficult to predict with accuracy. We model a range of valuation scenarios and the resulting impacts on our investments. 
 Liquidity Risk 
 Market disruptions may lead to a significant decline in transaction activity in all or a significant portion of the asset classes in which we intend to invest and may at the same time lead to a significant contraction in short-term and long-term debt and equity funding sources. A decline in liquidity of real estate and real estate-related investments, as well as a lack of availability of observable transaction data and inputs, may make it more difficult to sell our investments or determine their fair values. As a result, we may be unable to sell investments, or only be able to sell investments at a price that may be materially different from the fair values presented. Also, in such conditions, there is no guarantee that the Company s borrowing arrangements or other arrangements for obtaining leverage will continue to be available or, if available, will be available on terms and conditions acceptable to us. In addition, a decline in market value of our assets may have particular adverse consequences in instances where we borrowed money based on the fair value of our assets. A decrease in the market value of our assets may result in the lender requiring us to post additional collateral or otherwise sell assets at a time when it may not be in our best interest to do so. 
 Foreign Currency Risk 
 Our loans and investments that are denominated in a foreign currency are also subject to risks related to fluctuations in exchange rates. Over the term of our investments, we generally expect to mitigate this exposure by matching the currency of our foreign currency assets to the currency of the borrowings that finance those assets. In addition, we expect to typically enter into a series of foreign currency forward contracts to fix the U.S. dollar amount of foreign currency-denominated cash flows (interest income, principal payments and net sales proceeds after the repayment of debt) we expect to receive from our foreign currency denominated investments. 
 Although we expect to substantially reduce our exposure to changes in net investment income and portfolio value related to changes in foreign exchange rates, our currency hedging strategies may not eliminate all of our currency risk due to, among other things, uncertainties in the timing and/or amounts of payments received on the related investments, and/or unequal, inaccurate, or unavailable hedges to perfectly offset changes in future exchange rates. Additionally, we may be required under certain circumstances to collateralize our currency hedges for the benefit of the hedge counterparty, which could adversely affect our liquidity. 
 Consistent with our strategy of hedging foreign currency exposure on certain investments, we typically enter into a series of forwards to fix the U.S. dollar value of foreign currency denominated cash flows (interest income and principal payments) we expect to receive from our foreign currency denominated investments. Accordingly, the notional values and expiration dates of our foreign currency hedges approximate the amounts and timing of future payments we expect to receive on the related investments.

 Share Repurchase Plan 
 
 On November 10, 2023, our board of trustees adopted a share repurchase plan, whereby shareholders may request on a quarterly basis that we repurchase all or any portion of their shares. We commenced our share repurchase plan with the calendar quarter ended March 31, 2024, which was the first full calendar quarter following the initial closing of the continuous private offering. We may choose to repurchase all, some or none of the shares that have been requested to be repurchased at the end of any particular calendar quarter, in our discretion, subject to any limitations in the share repurchase plan. 
 
 Under our share repurchase plan, to the extent we choose to repurchase shares in any particular calendar quarter, we will only repurchase shares following the close of business as of the last calendar day of that calendar quarter (each such date, a Repurchase Date ). Shares are repurchased at a price equal to the transaction price on the applicable Repurchase Date, except that shares that have not been outstanding for at least one year will be repurchased at 95 of the transaction price. This Early Repurchase Deduction does not apply to shares acquired through the DRIP. 
 
 The aggregate NAV of total repurchases of Class T, Class S, Class D, Class I and Class E common shares (including repurchases at certain non-U.S. investor access funds primarily created to hold our shares and excluding any Early Repurchase Deduction) under our share repurchase plan is limited to no more than 5 of the aggregate NAV per calendar quarter (measured using the aggregate NAV as of the end of the immediately preceding month). Shares issued to the Advisor pursuant to the Advisory Agreement will not be subject to these repurchase limitations. 
 
 In the event that we determine to repurchase some but not all of the shares submitted for repurchase during any calendar quarter under our share repurchase plan, shares repurchased at the end of the calendar quarter will be repurchased on a pro rata basis. All unsatisfied repurchase requests must be resubmitted after the start of the next calendar quarter, or upon the recommencement of the share repurchase plan, as applicable. 
 
 35 

Under our share repurchase plan, our board of trustees may amend, suspend or terminate our share repurchase plan at any time if it deems such action to be in our best interest. As a result, share repurchases may not be available each calendar quarter. We may fund repurchase requests from sources other than cash flow from operations, including, without limitation, the sale of or repayment under our assets, borrowings or offering proceeds, and we have no limits on the amounts we may pay from such sources. Should repurchase requests, in our judgment, place an undue burden on our liquidity, adversely affect our operations or risk having an adverse impact on the Company as a whole, or should we otherwise determine that investing our liquid assets in real estate or other investments rather than repurchasing our shares is in the best interests of the Company as a whole, then we may choose to repurchase fewer shares than have been requested to be repurchased, or none at all. Further, our board of trustees may make exceptions to, modify or suspend our share repurchase plan if it deems in its reasonable judgment such action to be in our best interest. 
 
 During the quarter ended September 30, 2024, no common shares were repurchased pursuant to the Company s share repurchase plan.

 Ite m 5. Other Information 
 On November 8, 2024, Marc A. Fox notified the Company of his resignation as Chief Financial Officer of the Company, effective November 22, 2024. Mr. Fox s resignation was not due to any disagreement with the Company, the Advisor, or any of their affiliates. 
 
 On November 12, 2024, the Board of Trustees of the Company elected Joseph Nieto to serve as the Company s interim Chief Financial Officer, effective November 22, 2024. The appointment of Mr. Nieto was not made pursuant to any arrangement or understanding between him and any other person. There are no family relationships between Mr. Nieto and any director or executive officer of the Company and there are no transactions between Mr. Nieto and the Company that would be required to be reported under Item 404(a) of Regulation S-K. 
 
 Biographical information for Mr. Nieto is set forth below. 
 
 Joseph Nieto , 55, has served as our interim Chief Financial Officer since November 2024. Mr. Nieto has also served as a Managing Director for Starwood Capital and as the Global Business Controller of Starwood Real Estate Income Trust, Inc. since January 2020 and was the Operational Controller of Starwood Real Estate Income Trust, Inc. from November 2017 to January 2020. Prior to joining Starwood Capital in November 2017, Mr. Nieto held various senior financial roles with GE Capital across Energy Financial Services, Commercial Real Estate and Capital Headquarters spanning 13 years. Before joining GE Capital, Mr. Nieto held other various Senior Controller roles, where he was responsible for operational accounting, finance, controls and technical accounting. Mr. Nieto began his career at a boutique accounting firm in New York, where he was an audit manager. Mr. Nieto received a B.S. in accounting and an M.B.A in financial management from Pace University. He is also a certified public accountant (inactive). 
 
 In connection with Mr. Nieto s appointment as an executive officer, the Company will enter into an indemnification agreement (the Indemnification Agreement with Mr. Nieto (the Indemnitee ). The Company previously entered into substantially identical indemnification agreements with its other trustees and officers. The Indemnification Agreement provides that, subject to certain limitations set forth therein, the Company will indemnify the Indemnitee to the fullest extent permitted by Maryland law and the Company s Declaration of Trust, for amounts incurred as a result of the Indemnitee s service in his role as an executive officer of the Company or in other roles as the Company may require from time to time. The Indemnification Agreement further provides that, subject to the limitations set forth therein, the Company will advance all reasonable expenses to the Indemnitee in connection with proceedings covered by the Indemnification Agreement. 
 
 Subject to certain limitations set forth therein, the Indemnification Agreement places limitations on the indemnification of the Indemnitee to the extent the Indemnitee is found to have acted in bad faith or with active and deliberate dishonesty and such actions were material to the matter that caused the loss to the Company. The Indemnification Agreement also provides that, except for a proceeding brought by the Indemnitee and certain proceedings involving separate defenses, counterclaims or other conflicts of interest, the Company has the right to defend the Indemnitee in any proceeding which may give rise to indemnification under the Indemnification Agreement. 
 
 The description of the Indemnification Agreement in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q is a summary and is qualified in its entirety by the full terms of the Indemnification Agreement, a form of which is filed as Exhibit 10.4 to the Company s Registration Statement on Form 10, Commission File No. 000-56577, filed on September 29, 2023.
