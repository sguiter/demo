 Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows.

 A Statement of Cash Flows is presented when a certain percentage of the Fund s investments is classified as Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy. Information on financial transactions that have been settled through the receipt and disbursement of cash is presented in the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows. The cash amount shown in the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows is the amount included in the Fund s Consolidated Statements of Assets and Liabilities and represents the cash on hand at the Fund s custodian and does not include any short-term investments. 

 Federal income taxes.

 The Fund has elected and intends to qualify as a regulated investment company by complying with the applicable provisions of the Internal Revenue Code and will not be subject to federal income tax on taxable income that is distributed to shareholders. Therefore, no federal income tax provision is required. 

 Due to certain Internal Revenue Code rules, future realized gain/loss may be offset by built in gains acquired from when the entity was a partnership. 

As of December 31, 2023, the Fund had no uncertain tax positions that would require financial statement recognition, derecognition or disclosure. The Fund s federal tax returns once filed are subject to examination by the Internal Revenue Service for a period of three years. 

Distribution of income and gains.

 Distributions to shareholders from net investment income and net realized gains, if any, are recorded on the ex-date.
 The Fund generally declares and pays dividends quarterly. Capital gain distributions, if any, are typically distributed annually. 

 Such distributions, on a tax basis, are determined in conformity with income tax regulations, which may differ from US GAAP. Distributions in excess of tax basis earnings and profits, if any, are reported in the Fund s consolidated financial statements as a return of capital. The final determination of tax characteristics of the Fund s distribution will occur at the end of the year and will subsequently be reported to shareholders. 

Capital accounts within the consolidated financial statements are adjusted for permanent book-tax
 differences. These adjustments have no impact on net assets or the results of operations. Temporary book-tax
 differences, if any, will reverse in a subsequent period. Book-tax
 differences are primarily attributable to partnership tracking.

ITEM 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations The information in this section contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties, including, but not limited to, those set forth in Part I Item 1A. Risk Factors of our annual report for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023 on Form 10-K. You should read the following discussion in conjunction with the Part I, Item 1 of this Form 10-Q Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited) and related notes thereto and other financial information appearing elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. This discussion also should be read in conjunction with the Forward-Looking Statements in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. The following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is intended to provide a better understanding of our consolidated financial statements, including a brief discussion of our business, key factors that impacted our performance and a summary of our operating results. Historical results and percentage relationships among any amounts in the consolidated financial statements are not necessarily indicative of trends in operating results for any future periods. Overview We are an externally managed, diversified closed-end management investment company that has elected to be regulated as a BDC under the 1940 Act. Formed as a Delaware statutory trust on February 8, 2023, we are externally managed by the Advisor, which manages our day-to-day operations and provides us with investment advisory and administrative services pursuant to the terms of the Investment Advisory Agreement, and the Service Agreement with the Fund and the Service Level Agreement between the Advisor and JHIM. The Advisor is registered as investment advisor with the SEC. We have elected to be treated as a regulated investment company (RIC) Advisor for U.S. federal income tax purposes, and intend to continue to qualify annually thereafter, as a RIC under Subchapter M of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the Code). The Advisor oversees (subject to the oversight of the Board) the management of our operations and is responsible for making investment decisions with respect to our portfolio pursuant to the terms of the Investment Advisory Agreement. Under the Investment Advisory Agreement, we have agreed to pay the Advisor an annual management fee as well as an incentive fee based on our investment performance. Pursuant to the Service Agreement, the Advisor is responsible for providing, at the expense of the Fund, certain treasury, valuation and portfolio and cash management services to the Fund. Pursuant to the Service Level Agreement, JHIM provides certain financial, accounting and administrative services such as legal, tax, accounting, financial reporting and performance, compliance and service provider oversight services. Pursuant to the Service Agreement, the Advisor shall determine, subject to Board approval, the expenses to be reimbursed by the Fund, including an overhead allocation. The payments under the Service Agreement are not intended to provide a profit to the Advisor. Instead, the Advisor provides the services under the Service Agreement because it also provides advisory services under the Investment Advisory Agreement. The reimbursement shall be calculated and paid monthly in arrears. Similarly, under the Service Level Agreement, the Advisor pays JHIM compensation on an at-cost basis, and JHIM does not earn any profit. We expect to conduct the continuous private offering of our Common Shares (the Private Offering) in reliance on exemptions from the registration requirements of the Securities Act, including the exemption provided by Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act and Regulation D promulgated thereunder, Regulation S under the Securities Act and other exemptions from the registration requirements of the Securities Act. We are initially offering one class of our Common Shares the Class NAV shares and may offer additional classes of our Common Shares in the future. We and the Advisor may apply for the Multi- Class Exemptive Relief from the SEC that, if granted, would permit us to issue multiple classes of shares of our Common Shares with varying sales loads, contingent deferred sales charges, and/or asset-based service and/or distribution fees, the details for which will be finalized at a later date in our discretion. We have not yet applied for the Multi-Class Exemptive Relief, and there is no assurance that such relief would be granted. We commenced operations concurrent with the initial closing on the Seed Contribution and, prior to the BDC Election Date, we have conducted our investment activities and operations pursuant to the exclusion from the definition of an investment company in Section 3(c)(7) of the 1940 Act. Following the BDC Election Date, we commenced holding monthly closings for the Private Offering, in connection with which we issued Common Shares to investors for immediate cash investment. If there are no purchases for the Private Offering for a particular month, a closing will not be held for that month. Our investment objectives are to maximize the total return to our shareholders in the form of current income and, to a lesser extent, capital appreciation. The Fund invests primarily in the debt of private middle-market U.S. companies with a focus on directly originated first and second lien loans (including delayed draw term loans and revolving credit facilities) typically created by a club of lenders, as well as related equity investments in companies in which loans have been made by the Fund to middle-market companies. The club of lenders is generally a small group of investment firms. Investments Our level of investment activity can and is expected to vary substantially from period to period depending on many factors, including the amount of debt available to middle-market companies, the general economic environment and the competitive environment for the type of investments we make. As a BDC, we must not acquire any assets other than qualifying assets specified in the 1940 Act unless, at the time the acquisition is made, at least 70 of our total assets are qualifying assets (with certain limited exceptions). Qualifying assets include investments in eligible portfolio companies. Under the relevant SEC rules, the term eligible portfolio company includes all private companies, companies whose securities are not listed on a national securities exchange, and certain public companies that have listed their securities on a national securities exchange and have a market capitalization of less than 25 million.

Revenues We plan to principally generate revenues in the form of interest income and, to a lesser extent, capital appreciation on the debt investments we hold, as well as dividends and other distributions on the equity or other securities we hold.

The Fund indirectly bears the cost related to the SPV, including cost, related to borrowings from the JPM Funding Facility, such as interest expense and other fees. Certain fees may be waived or reimbursed by the Advisor. Pursuant to a Service Agreement, the Advisor is responsible for providing, at the expense of the Fund, certain treasury, valuation and portfolio and cash management services to the Fund. Pursuant to the Service Level Agreement, JHIM provides certain financial, accounting and administrative services such as legal, tax, accounting, financial reporting and performance, compliance and service provider oversight services. Pursuant to the Service Agreement, the Advisor shall determine, subject to Board approval, the expenses to be reimbursed by the Fund, including an overhead allocation.

The reimbursement shall be calculated and paid monthly in arrears. Similarly, under the Service Level Agreement, the Advisor pays JHIM compensation on an at-cost basis, and JHIM does not earn any profit. In addition, we have contracted with SS C Technologies, Inc.

The Advisor has agreed to advance all of our organization and offering expenses on our behalf (including legal, accounting, printing, mailing, subscription processing and filing fees and expenses and other offering expenses, including costs associated with technology integration between the Fund s systems and those of our participating brokers, reasonable bona fide due diligence expenses of participating brokers supported by detailed and itemized invoices, costs in connection with preparing sales materials and other marketing expenses, design and website expenses, fees to attend retail seminars sponsored by participating brokers and costs, expenses and reimbursements for travel (provided that the Fund shall not be required to bear the cost of private airfare in excess of comparable first- class/business rates on a commercial airline, if available), meals, accommodations, entertainment and other similar expenses related to meetings or events with prospective investors, brokers, registered investment advisors or financial or other advisors, but excluding the shareholder servicing and/or distribution fee) through a date determined by the Advisor in its discretion. From time to time, the Advisor or its affiliates may pay third-party providers of goods or services. We will reimburse the Advisor or such affiliates thereof for any such amounts paid on our behalf. From time to time, the Advisor may defer or waive fees and/or rights to be reimbursed for expenses. All of the foregoing expenses will ultimately be borne by our shareholders. Portfolio and Investment Activity As of September 30, 2024, the Fund had investments, excluding cash equivalents, in 44 portfolio companies across 7 sectors and 18 industries. Based on fair value as of September 30, 2024, 135.5 of the Fund s net assets was invested in debt bearing a floating interest rate, all of which had an interest rate floor denoted in Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR). The weighted average interest rate floor across the Fund s portfolio was approximately 1.0 as of September 30, 2024. These floors allow the Fund to mitigate (to a degree) any impact of spread widening on the valuation of the Fund s investments. As of September 30, 2024, the Fund s estimated weighted average total yield of investments in debt securities was 10.4 . Weighted average yields are based on interest rates as of September 30, 2024.

For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, total investment income was driven by the Fund s deployment of capital and invested balance of investments. The size of the Fund s investment portfolio at fair value was approximately 128.5 million as of September 30, 2024 and, as of such date, all of the Fund s debt investments were income-producing. Interest income on the Fund s debt investments is dependent on the composition and credit quality of the portfolio. Generally, the Fund expects the portfolio to generate predictable quarterly interest income based on the terms stated in each loan s credit agreement. As of September 30, 2024, all of the Fund s debt investments were performing and current on their interest payments. Our expenses for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 were as follows:

Interest and credit facility expenses include interest expense, amortized deferred financing cost, unused commitment fee and utilization fee related to the JPM Funding Facility. During the three months ended September 30, 2024, legal fees related to establishing the JPM Funding Facility were capitalized and are being amortized over the life of the facility, and therefore, professional fees have been adjusted accordingly. Other expenses include insurance, valuation, subscriptions and other costs. Organization and offering costs include expenses incurred in the Fund s initial formation and the Fund s offering of Common Shares. Expense reductions include contractual management fee waivers. Income Taxes, Including Excise Taxes The Fund has elected and intends to continue to qualify as a RIC under Subchapter M of the Code. As a RIC, the Fund generally will not have to pay corporate-level U.S. federal income taxes on any income and net capital gain that it distributes to shareholders as dividends. To qualify as a RIC, the Fund must, among other things, meet certain source-of-income and asset diversification requirements. In addition, in order to be eligible for pass-through tax treatment as a RIC, the Fund must distribute to the Fund s shareholders, for each taxable year, at least the sum of 90 of the Fund s investment company taxable income, which is generally net ordinary income plus the excess of realized net short term capital gains over realized net long-term capital losses and 90 of its net exempt interest income, if any, or the Annual Distribution Requirement. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Fund did not incur any excise tax. Financial Condition, Liquidity and Capital Resources We generate cash primarily from the net proceeds from the Private Offering and from cash flows from interest and fees earned from our investments and principal repayments and proceeds from sales of our investments. We may also fund a portion of our investments through borrowings from banks and issuances of senior securities, including before we have fully invested the proceeds of the Private Offering. Our primary use of cash will be investments in portfolio companies, payments of our expenses, payment of cash distributions to our shareholders and repurchases of our Common Shares under our share repurchase program. Equity For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we held three closings of our continuous Private Offering. As a result, the total Class NAV shares issued, and proceeds received related to such closings were as follows:

 Credit Facilities We utilize leverage to finance our investments. The amount of leverage that we employ will be subject to the restrictions of the 1940 Act and the supervision of our Board. At the time of any proposed borrowing, the amount of leverage we employ will also depend on our Advisor s assessment of market and other factors. We have established one or more credit facilities and may enter into other financing arrangements to facilitate investments and the timely payment of our expenses. It is anticipated that any such credit facilities will bear interest at floating rates at to-be-determined spreads over a specified reference rate. We cannot assure shareholders that we will be able to enter into a credit facility on favorable terms or at all. In connection with a credit facility or other borrowings, lenders may require us to pledge assets, commitments and/or drawdowns (and the ability to enforce the payment thereof) and may ask to comply with positive or negative covenants that could have an effect on our operations.

JPM Funding Facility On March 26, 2024, Manulife Private Credit Fund SPV, LLC, a wholly owned consolidated subsidiary of the Fund, entered into a Loan and Security Agreement (the JPM Funding Facility), as borrower (the Borrower), with the Fund, as the parent and portfolio manager, The Bank of New York Mellon Trust Company, National Association, as collateral agent, collateral administrator and securities intermediary, and JPMorgan Chase Bank, National Association, as administrative agent, that provides a secured credit facility of up to 150 million with a reinvestment period ending March 26, 2027 and a final maturity date of March 26, 2029. The JPM Funding Facility also provides for a feature that allows the Borrower, subject to certain conditions, to increase the overall size of the JPM Funding Facility to a maximum of 500 million. In addition, on March 26, 2024, the Fund, as seller, and the Borrower, as purchaser, entered into a Sale and Contribution Agreement, pursuant to which Borrower will either purchase certain corporate loans or receive contributions of cash or such corporate loans (collectively, the Loans), from time to time, originated by the Fund or its affiliates. The obligations of the Borrower under the JPM Funding Facility are secured by substantially all assets held by the Borrower, including the Loans. Borrowings under the JPM Funding Facility will bear interest at Term SOFR or an alternate base rate, in each case plus an applicable margin equal to 2.70 , subject to increases for default rate interest from time to time pursuant to the terms of the JPM Funding Facility. In addition, the Borrower will pay, among other fees, an upfront fee, an administrative agency fee and a commitment fee on the undrawn balance of 0.55 per annum (or, during the March 26, 2024 to March 27, 2025 ramp-up period, 0.30 per annum) on the average daily unused facility amount. Under the JPM Funding Facility, the Fund and the Borrower, as applicable, have made customary representations and warranties regarding their businesses, among other things, and are required to comply with various covenants, reporting requirements and other customary requirements for similar credit facilities. The JPM Funding Facility includes usual and customary events of default for such facilities of this nature. Proceeds from the JPM Funding Facility must be used for the purposes permitted in the JPM Funding Facility, including purchasing of loans or other portfolio investments. As of September 30, 2024, the Fund had outstanding borrowings of 15,000,000 at an average interest rate of 7.60 , which is reflected in the Credit facility payable on the Consolidated Statements of Assets and Liabilities. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, the average daily outstanding borrowings for the JPM Funding Facility amounted to 5,197,183 and 4,386,905 and the weighted average interest rate was 7.78 and 7.89 , respectively. JH Funding Revolving Promissory Note Agreement On July 17, 2023, we entered into revolving promissory note agreement with JH Funding. The aggregate outstanding borrowings under the agreement with JH Funding for the Fund would not exceed 30 million. There were no upfront fees or commitment fees paid by the Fund in connection with the agreement. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Fund did not have any borrowings outstanding under the agreement with JH Funding. The agreement terminated upon the effective date of the JPM Funding Facility on March 26, 2024. For further details, see Note 5 Borrowings under Item 1. Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited) in the accompanying unaudited consolidated financial statements. Contractual Obligations, Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements and Other Liquidity Considerations We have entered into certain contracts under which we may have material future commitments. We have entered into each of the Investment Advisory Agreement and the Service Agreement with the Advisor to provide us with investment advisory services and administrative services. Payments for investment advisory services under the Investment Advisory Agreement and reimbursements made under the Service Agreement are described in Part I Item 1. Business Management Agreements of our December 31, 2023 Form 10-K. The Advisor is responsible for payments under the Service Level Agreement. If any of our contractual obligations are terminated, our costs may increase under any new agreements that we enter into as replacements. We would also likely incur expenses in locating alternative parties to provide the services we expect to receive under our Investment Advisory Agreement and our Service Agreement, and the Service Level Agreement between the Advisor and JHIM. We may become a party to financial instruments with off-balance sheet risk in the normal course of our business to meet the financial needs of our portfolio companies. These instruments may include commitments to extend credit and involve, to varying degrees, elements of liquidity and credit risk in excess of the amount recognized in the balance sheet.

Distributions and Dividend Reinvestment Plan Distributions The Fund intends to make quarterly distributions of net investment income. Any distributions we make will be at the discretion of our Board, who will consider, among other things, our earnings, cash flow, capital needs and general financial condition, as well as our desire to comply with the RIC requirements, which generally require us to make aggregate annual distributions to our shareholders of at least 90 of our net investment income. As a result, distributions to shareholders cannot be assured, and the amount of each quarterly distribution is likely to vary. Distributions to shareholders from net investment income and net realized gains, if any, are recorded on the ex-date. The Fund generally declares and pays dividends at least quarterly. Capital gain distributions, if any, are typically distributed annually. The following table summarizes the distributions declared on our common shares for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024

 Dividend Reinvestment Plan Pursuant to the Dividend Reinvestment Plan (DRP) established by the Fund, each shareholder will automatically be a participant under the DRP and have all income distributions, whether dividend distributions or capital gains distributions, automatically reinvested in additional Common Shares. Election not to participate in the DRP and to receive all income distributions, whether dividend distributions or capital gains distributions, in cash may be made by notice to a shareholder s intermediary (who should be directed to inform the Fund). A shareholder is free to change this election at any time. If, however, a shareholder elects to change its election within 95 days prior to a distribution, the request will be effective only with respect to distributions after the 95-day period. A shareholder whose Common Shares are registered in the name of a nominee (such as an intermediary) must contact the nominee regarding its status under the DRP, including whether such nominee will participate on such shareholder s behalf as such nominee will be required to make any such election. Generally, for U.S. federal income tax purposes, shareholders receiving Common Shares under the DRP will be treated as having received a distribution equal to amount payable to them in cash as a distribution had the shareholder not participated in the DRP. Common Shares will be issued pursuant to the DRP at their NAV determined on the next valuation date following the ex-dividend date (the last date of a dividend period on which an investor can purchase Common Shares and still be entitled to receive the dividend). There is no sales load or other charge for reinvestment. A request for change of participation/non-participation status in the DRP must be received by the Fund within the above timeframe to be effective for that dividend or capital gain distribution. The Fund may terminate the DRP at any time upon written notice to the participants in the DRP. The Fund may amend the DRP at any time upon 30 days written notice to the participants. Any expenses of the DRP will be borne by the Fund. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, no Common Shares were issued pursuant to the DRP.

Critical Accounting Policies and Use of Estimates Our consolidated financial statements are prepared in conformity with US GAAP, which requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. Management utilizes available information, which includes our history, industry standards and the current economic environment, among other factors, in forming the estimates and judgments, giving due consideration to materiality. Actual results may differ from these estimates. In addition, other companies may utilize different estimates, which may impact the comparability of our results of operations to those of companies in similar businesses. Understanding our accounting policies and the extent to which we use management judgment and estimates in applying these policies is integral to understanding our financial statements. We describe our most significant accounting policies in the notes to our unaudited consolidated financial statements. ITEM 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk We are subject to financial market risks, including changes in interest rates. A rise in the general level of interest rates can be expected to lead to higher interest rates applicable to the variable rate investments we may hold and to declines in the value of any fixed rate investments we may hold. A rise in interest rates would also be expected to lead to higher cost on our floating rate borrowings. We expect that our long-term investments will be financed primarily with equity and debt. If deemed prudent, we may use interest rate risk management techniques in an effort to minimize our exposure to interest rate fluctuations. These techniques may include various interest rate hedging activities to the extent permitted by the 1940 Act. Adverse developments resulting from changes in interest rates or hedging transactions could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. We plan to invest primarily in illiquid debt securities of private companies. Most of our investments will not have a readily available market price, and we will value these investments at fair value as determined in good faith pursuant to procedures adopted by the Advisor and overseen by the Board in accordance with the Advisor s valuation policy. There is no single standard for determining fair value in good faith. As a result, determining fair value requires that judgment be applied to the specific facts and circumstances of each portfolio investment while employing a consistently applied valuation process for the types of investments we make. See Part I Item 1. Business Determination of Net Asset Value. of our December 31, 2023 Form 10-K. From time to time, we may make investments that are denominated in a foreign currency that are subject to the effects of exchange rate movements between the foreign currency of each such investment and the U.S. dollar, which may affect future fair values and cash flows, as well as amounts translated into U.S. dollars for inclusion in our consolidated financial statements. We may use derivative instruments from time to time, including foreign currency forward contracts and cross currency swaps, to manage the impact of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. In addition, we may have the ability to borrow in foreign currencies under any credit facilities or enter into other financing arrangements, which provides a natural hedge with regard to changes in exchange rates between the foreign currencies and U.S. dollar and reduces our exposure to foreign exchange rate differences. We expect to typically be a net receiver of these foreign currencies as related for our international investment positions, and, as a result, our investments denominated in foreign currencies, to the extent not hedged, are expected to benefit from a weaker U.S. dollar and are adversely affected by a stronger U.S. dollar. See Part I Item 1. Business Determination of Net Asset Value. of our December 31, 2023 Form 10-K. As of September 30, 2024, approximately 117.8 million (principal amount) of our debt portfolio investments (funded positions) bore interest at variable rates, which are generally SOFR-based (or based on an equivalent applicable currency rate), and many of which are subject to certain floors. Based on our September 30, 2024 Consolidated Statements of Assets and Liabilities, the following table shows the annual impact on net income of hypothetical base rate changes in interest rates on our debt investments and borrowings (considering interest rate floors for variable rate instruments) assuming no changes in our investment and borrowing structure:
