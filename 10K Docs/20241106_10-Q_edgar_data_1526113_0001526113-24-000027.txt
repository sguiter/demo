 properties consisting of primarily necessity-based retail single-tenant and multi-tenant properties located in the U.S. Until September 12, 2023, the Company was managed by Global Net Lease Advisors, LLC Advisor ), who managed the Company s day-to-day business with the assistance of our property manager, Global Net Lease Properties, LLC Property Manager ), who managed and leased our properties to third parties. Prior to September 12, 2023, the former Advisor and the Property Manager were under common control with AR Global Investments, LLC AR Global ), and these related parties had historically received compensation and fees for various services provided to the Company. On September 12, 2023, the Company internalized its advisory and property management functions as well as the advisory and property management functions of RTL as a result of the Internalization Merger (as defined in Note 3 The Mergers in the quarter ended September 30, 2023. 
 As of September 30, 2024, the Company owned properties consisting of million rentable square feet, which were leased, with a weighted-average remaining lease term of years. Based on the percentage of annualized rental income on a straight-line basis as of September 30, 2024, approximately of the Company s properties were located in the U.S. and Canada and approximately were located in Europe. In addition, as of September 30, 2024, the Company s portfolio was comprised of Industrial Distribution properties, Multi-Tenant Retail properties, Single-Tenant Retail properties and Office properties. These represent the Company s reportable segments and the percentages are calculated using annualized straight-line rent converted from local currency into the U.S. Dollar USD as of September 30, 2024. The straight-line rent includes amounts for tenant concessions. 
 Substantially all of our business is conducted through Global Net Lease Operating Partnership, L.P. (the OP ), a Delaware limited partnership, and The Necessity Retail REIT Operating Partnership, L.P. RTL OP, and together with the OP, the OPs and each of their wholly-owned subsidiaries.

years. Because many of the Company s leases provide for rental increases at specified intervals, straight-line basis accounting requires the Company to record a receivable for, and include in revenue from tenants, unbilled rent receivables that the Company will only receive if the tenant makes all rent payments required through the expiration of the initial term of the lease. 
 For new leases after acquisition of a property, the commencement date is considered to be the date the lease is executed and the tenant has access to the space. The Company defers the revenue related to lease payments received from tenants in advance of their due dates. When the Company acquires a property, the acquisition date is considered to be the commencement date for purposes of this calculation for all leases in place at the time of acquisition. In the Company s Industrial Distribution, Single-Tenant Retail and Office segments, in addition to base rent, the Company s lease agreements generally require tenants to pay for their property operating expenses or reimburse the Company for property operating expenses that the Company incurs (primarily insurance costs and real estate taxes). However, some limited property operating expenses that are not the responsibility of the tenant are absorbed by the Company. In the Company s Multi-Tenant Retail segment, the Company owns, manages and leases multi-tenant properties where the Company generally pays for the property operating expenses for those properties and most of the Company s tenants are required to pay their pro rata share of property operating expenses. Under ASC 842, the Company has elected to report combined lease and non-lease components in a single line Revenue from tenants. For expenses paid directly by the tenant, under ASC 842, the Company has reflected them on a net basis.

 t impaired as of December 31, 2023. The goodwill impairment test is applied to each of the Company s reporting units. For purposes of this assessment, a reporting unit is an operating segment. 
 There were material changes to this assessment as of September 30, 2024. We will continue to assess for triggering events. Should any triggering event occur, we would evaluate the carrying value of our goodwill by segment through an impairment test. If impairment is warranted, the charge would be recorded through the consolidated income statement as a reduction to earnings.

The consideration transferred by the Company in the Mergers establishes a new accounting basis for the assets acquired, liabilities assumed and any non-controlling interests, measured at their respective fair value as of the Acquisition Date.

 The Company provided a provisional allocation of the fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed in the Mergers in the Company s Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September 30, 2023.

 (3) The net increase in prepaid expenses and other assets was due to the receipt of new information, subsequent to the initial provisional estimates, primarily related to receivables that had previously been deemed uncollectible as of the Acquisition Date. 
 (4) The net increase in goodwill from the initial provisional valuation reflects the net impact of all measurement period adjustments to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed. 
 
 Goodwill 
 Goodwill is calculated as the excess of the consideration transferred over the net assets recognized and represents the future economic benefits arising from other assets acquired that could not be individually identified and separately recognized. Specifically, the goodwill recorded as part of the Mergers includes the expected synergies and other benefits that we believe will result from the Internalization Merger and any intangible assets that do not qualify for separate recognition. Goodwill is not amortized and the Company has allocated the goodwill to its segments.

 Acquired Intangible Lease Assets 
 The Company allocates a portion of the fair value of real estate acquired to identified intangible assets and liabilities, consisting of the value of origination costs (tenant improvements, leasing commissions, and legal and marketing costs), the value of above-market and below-market leases, and the value of tenant relationships, if applicable, based in each case on their relative fair values. The Company periodically assesses whether there are any indicators that the value of the intangible assets may be impaired by performing a net present value analysis of future cash flows, discounted for the inherent risk associated with each investment. The Company did record any impairment charges on its acquired intangible assets during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024. The Company recorded impairment charges of approximately million on its in-place lease intangible assets and million on its above-market lease intangible assets during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023. These impairments were recorded in connection with the properties that were impaired in the quarter ended September 30, 2023 (as described below).

The Company recorded aggregate impairment charges for these properties, including the impairments to intangible assets noted above, of million in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023. The impairment charge for the property in the U.K. was based on a calculation of the estimated fair value of the property.

 Assets Held for Sale 
 When assets are identified by management as held for sale, the Company stops recognizing depreciation and amortization expense on the identified assets and estimates the sales price, net of costs to sell, of those assets. If the carrying amount of the assets classified as held for sale exceeds the estimated net sales price, the Company records an impairment charge equal to the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the Company s estimate of the net sales price of the assets.

 Credit Agreement Terms 
 The Revolving Credit Facility requires payments of interest only prior to maturity. Borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility bear interest at a variable rate per annum based on an applicable margin that varies based on the ratio of consolidated total indebtedness to consolidated total asset value of the Company and its subsidiaries plus either (i) the Base Rate (as defined in the Credit Agreement) or (ii) the applicable Benchmark Rate (as defined in the Credit Agreement) for the currency being borrowed. The applicable interest rate margin is based on a range from to per annum with respect to Base Rate borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility and to per annum with respect to Benchmark Rate borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility. For Benchmark Rate Loans denominated in Dollars that bear interest calculated by reference to Term SOFR, there is an additional spread adjustment depending on the length of the interest period. In addition, (i) if the Company achieves an investment grade credit rating from at least two rating agencies, the OP can elect for the spread to be based on the credit rating of the Company, and (ii) the floor on the applicable Benchmark is . As of September 30, 2024, the Revolving Credit Facility had a weighted-average effective interest rate of after giving effect to interest rate swaps in place. 
 The Revolving Credit Facility matures on October 8, 2026, subject to the Company s option, subject to customary conditions, to extend the maturity date by up to additional terms. Borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility may be prepaid at any time, in whole or in part, without premium or penalty, subject to customary breakage costs associated with borrowings for the applicable Benchmark Rate. 
 The Revolving Credit Facility requires the Company through the OP to pay an unused fee per annum of of the unused balance of the Revolving Credit Facility if the unused balance exceeds or is equal to of the total commitment or a fee per annum of of the unused balance of the Revolving Credit Facility if the unused balance is less than of the total commitment. From and after the time the Company obtains an investment grade credit rating, the unused fee will be

 , decreasing as the Company s credit rating increases. 
 The Revolving Credit Facility is supported by a pool of eligible unencumbered properties that are owned by the subsidiaries of the OP that serve as guarantors. The availability of borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility continues to be based on the value of a pool of eligible unencumbered real estate assets owned by the Company or its subsidiaries and compliance with various ratios related to those assets. As of September 30, 2024, approximately million was available for future borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility. Any future borrowings may, at the option of the Company, be denominated in USD, EUR, CAD, GBP, Norwegian Krone, Swedish Krona and Swiss Francs provided that the total principal amount of non-USD loans cannot exceed the sum of the total revolving commitments minus million. Amounts borrowed may not, however, be converted to, or repaid in, another currency once borrowed. 
 The Credit Facility contains events of default relating to customary matters, including, among other things, payment defaults, covenant defaults, breaches of representations and warranties, events of default under other material indebtedness, material judgments, bankruptcy events and change of control events, such as certain changes to the composition of the board of directors (the Board and management. Upon the occurrence of an event of default, a majority of the lenders have the right to accelerate the payment on any outstanding borrowings and other obligations. 
 The Company, through the OP, may reduce the amount committed under the Revolving Credit Facility and repay outstanding borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility, in whole or in part, at any time without premium or penalty, other than customary breakage costs payable on index borrowings. Upon an event of a default, lenders have the right to terminate their obligations under the Revolving Credit Facility agreement and to accelerate the payment on any unpaid principal amount of all outstanding loans. The Credit Agreement contains various customary operating covenants, including covenants restricting, among other things, restricted payments (including dividends and share repurchases (see additional information below), the incurrence of liens, the types of investments the Company may make, fundamental changes, agreements with affiliates and changes in nature of business. The Credit Agreement also contains financial maintenance covenants with respect to maximum leverage, minimum fixed charge coverage, maximum secured leverage, maximum secured recourse debt, minimum tangible net worth, maximum unencumbered leverage and unencumbered debt service coverage. As of September 30, 2024, the Company was in compliance with all covenants under the Credit Agreement. 
 Under the terms of the Credit Agreement, the Company may not pay distributions, including cash dividends payable with respect to Common Stock, the Company s Series A Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock, par value per share Series A Preferred Stock ), its Series B Cumulative Redeemable Perpetual Preferred Stock par value per share Series B Preferred Stock ), its Series D Preferred Stock, its Series E Preferred Stock, or any other class or series of stock the Company may issue in the future, or redeem or otherwise repurchase shares of Common Stock, Series A Preferred Stock, Series B Preferred Stock, Series D Preferred Stock, Series E Preferred Stock, or any other class or series of stock the Company may issue in the future that exceed of the Company s Adjusted FFO, as defined in the Credit Agreement (which is different from AFFO disclosed in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q) for any period of four consecutive fiscal quarters, except in limited circumstances, including that for one fiscal quarter in each calendar year, the Company may pay cash dividends and other distributions, and make redemptions and other repurchases in an aggregate amount equal to no more than of its Adjusted FFO. However, notwithstanding the preceding sentence, the Company is permitted to make restricted payments (including the making of distributions and share repurchases) in an amount required to be paid by the Company in order for it to (x) maintain its REIT status for federal and state income tax purposes and (y) avoid the payment of federal and state income or excise tax. During a payment or bankruptcy event of default, restricted payments by the Company will only be permitted up to the minimum amount needed to maintain the Company s status as a REIT for federal and state income tax purposes. From and after the time the Company obtains and continues to maintain an investment grade rating, the limitation on distributions discussed above will not be applicable. The Company last used the exception to pay dividends that were between of Adjusted FFO and of Adjusted FFO during the quarter ended on June 30, 2020, and may use this exception in the future. 
 The Company s ability to comply with the restrictions on the payment of distributions in the Credit Agreement depends on its ability to generate sufficient cash flows that in the applicable periods exceed the level of Adjusted FFO required by these restrictions. If the Company is not able to generate the necessary level of Adjusted FFO, the Company will have to reduce the amount of dividends paid on the common and the preferred stock or consider other actions. Alternatively, the Company could elect to pay a portion of its dividends on the Common Stock in additional shares of Common Stock if approved by the Board. 
 The Company and certain subsidiaries of the OP acting as guarantors (the Guarantors have guaranteed, and any wholly owned eligible direct or indirect subsidiary of the OP that directly or indirectly owns or leases a real estate asset added to the pool of eligible unencumbered properties required to be maintained under the Credit Agreement is required to guarantee, the OP s obligations under the Revolving Credit Facility.

Real Estate Investments Measured at Fair Value on a Non-Recurring Basis 
 The Company recorded impairments for real estate investments during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 (see Note 4 Real Estate Investments, Net for additional information on impairment charges recorded by the Company). The impairments were all based on the estimated selling prices of the impaired properties. The carrying value of these impaired real estate investments on the consolidated balance sheet represents their estimated fair value at the time of impairment. 
 In addition, the Company recorded impairments for real estate investments during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 (see Note 4 Real Estate Investments, Net for additional information on impairment charges recorded by the Company). The fair values were based on a calculation of the estimated fair value, which was driven by an assumed land value of million per acre, for one property, and the others were based on the estimated selling prices of the assets. 
 Impaired real estate investments which are held for use are generally classified in Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy.

 Cash Flow Hedges of Interest Rate Risk 
 The Company s objectives in using interest rate derivatives are to add stability to interest expense and to manage its exposure to interest rate movements. To accomplish this objective, the Company primarily uses interest rate swaps. Interest rate swaps designated as cash flow hedges involve the receipt of variable-rate amounts from a counterparty in exchange for the Company making fixed-rate payments over the life of the agreements without exchange of the underlying notional amount. 
 All of the changes in the fair value of derivatives designated and that qualify as cash flow hedges are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income AOCI and are subsequently reclassified into earnings in the period that the hedged forecasted transaction impacts earnings. During the three months ended September 30, 2024, such derivatives were used to hedge the variable cash flows associated with variable-rate debt. 
 Amounts reported in AOCI related to derivatives are reclassified to interest expense as interest payments are made on the Company s variable-rate debt. During the next 12 months ending September 30, 2025, the Company estimates that million will be reclassified from other comprehensive income as an increase to interest expense.

 Net Investment Hedges 
 The Company is exposed to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates on property investments in foreign countries which pay rental income, incur property related expenses and borrow in currencies other than its functional currency, the USD. For derivatives designated as net investment hedges, all of the changes in the fair value of the derivatives, including the ineffective portion of the change in fair value of the derivatives, if any, are reported in AOCI (outside of earnings) as part of the cumulative translation adjustment. Amounts are reclassified out of AOCI into earnings when the hedged net investment is either sold or substantially liquidated. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 the Company did not have foreign currency derivatives that were designated as net investment hedges used to hedge its net investments in foreign operations and during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and the year ended December 31, 2023, the Company did not use foreign currency derivatives that were designated as net investment hedges. 
 Foreign Denominated Debt Designated as Net Investment Hedges 
 All foreign currency denominated borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility are designated as net investment hedges. As such, the designated portion of changes in value due to currency fluctuations are reported in AOCI (outside of earnings) as part of the cumulative translation adjustment. The remeasurement gains and losses attributable to the undesignated portion of the foreign currency denominated debt are recognized directly in earnings. Amounts are reclassified out of AOCI into earnings when the hedged net investment is either sold or substantially liquidated, or if the Company should no longer possess a controlling interest. The Company records adjustments to earnings for currency impacts related to undesignated excess positions, if any. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company recorded gains of million due to currency changes on the undesignated excess foreign currency advances over the related net investments. The Company did record any similar gains or losses during the three months ended September 30, 2024. There were undesignated excess positions at any time during the year ended December 31, 2023. 
 Non-designated Derivatives 
 The Company is exposed to fluctuations in the exchange rates of its functional currency, the USD, against the GBP and the EUR. The Company has used and may continue to use foreign currency derivatives, including options, currency forward and cross currency swap agreements, to manage its exposure to fluctuations in GBP-USD and EUR-USD exchange rates. While these derivatives are economically hedging the fluctuations in foreign currencies, they do not meet the strict hedge accounting requirements to be classified as hedging instruments. Changes in the fair value of derivatives not designated as hedges under qualifying hedging relationships are recorded directly in net income (loss). The Company recorded gains of million and

 In addition to the above derivative arrangements, the Company also uses non-derivative financial instruments to hedge its exposure to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations as part of its risk management program, including foreign denominated debt issued and outstanding with third parties to protect the value of its net investments in foreign subsidiaries against exchange rate fluctuations. The Company has drawn, and expects to continue to draw, foreign currency advances under the Revolving Credit Facility to fund certain investments in the respective local currency which creates a natural hedge against the original equity invested in the real estate investments, removing the need for the final cross currency swaps. 
 Credit-risk-related Contingent Features 
 The Company has agreements with each of its derivative counterparties that contain a provision where if the Company either defaults or is capable of being declared in default on any of its indebtedness, then the Company could also be declared in default on its derivative obligations. 
 As of September 30, 2024, the Company did not have any counterparties where the net derivative fair value held by that counterparty was in a net liability position including accrued interest but excluding any adjustment for nonperformance. As of September 30, 2024, the Company had not posted any collateral related to these agreements and was not in breach of any agreement provisions. If the Company had breached any of these provisions, it could have been required to settle its obligations under the agreements at their aggregate termination value.

This oversight fee was no longer applicable to of the Company s properties which became subject to separate property management agreements with the Property Manager in connection with certain mortgage loans entered into by the Company in October 2017, April 2019 and September 2019 on otherwise nearly identical terms to the primary property and management leasing agreement, which remained applicable to all other properties.

Costs and expenses that are the responsibility of the Company under the property management and leasing agreements included, without limitation, reasonable wages and salaries and other employee-related expenses of all on-site and off-site employees of the Property Manager who were engaged in the operation, management, maintenance and leasing of the properties and other out-of-pocket expenses which are directly related to the operation, management, maintenance and leasing of specific properties, but may not include the Property Manager s general overhead and administrative expenses.

In addition, these reimbursements were subject to the limitation that the Company will not reimburse the former Advisor for any amount by which the Company s operating expenses (including the asset management fee) at the end of the four preceding fiscal quarters exceeds the greater of (a) of average invested assets and (b) of net income, unless the excess amount was otherwise

 Multi-Year Outperformance Agreement With the Former Advisor 
 2021 OPP General Description 
 On May 3, 2021, the Company s independent directors, acting as a group, authorized an award of GNL LTIP Units under the 2021 OPP , and, on June 3, 2021, the Company, the OP and the Advisor entered into the 2021 OPP. 
 Based on a maximum award value of million and , the closing price of Common Stock on June 2, 2021 (the 2021 Initial Share Price ), the former Advisor was granted a total of GNL LTIP Units pursuant to the 2021 OPP. These GNL LTIP Units were eligible to be earned and become vested based on the Company s TSR, including both share price appreciation and reinvestment of Common Stock dividends, compared to the 2021 Initial Share Price over a performance period commencing on June 3, 2021 and ending on the earliest of (i) June 3, 2024, (ii) the effective date of any Change of Control as defined in the Advisor Plan and (iii) the effective date of any termination of the former Advisor s service as the Company s advisor. As noted above and described below, the end date of the performance period was modified to September 11, 2023, the day prior to the Acquisition Date, in connection with the Internalization Merger Agreement. 
 Under accounting rules, the total fair value of the GNL LTIP Units granted under the 2021 OPP of million was fixed as of June 3, 2021 and was not required to be remeasured in subsequent periods (see Note 2 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies for a description of accounting rules related to non-employee equity awards). The fair value of the GNL LTIP Units that were granted were being recorded evenly over the requisite service period which was originally approximately years from May 3, 2021, the date that the Company s independent directors approved the award of GNL LTIP Units under the 2021 OPP. However, due to the modification noted below that changed the timing of the final measurement for determining whether the award is vested and earned, all of the remaining unrecognized compensation expense was accelerated and recorded in the quarter ended September 30, 2023 (through September 11, 2023). 
 Modification of the 2021 OPP 
 In connection with the Internalization Merger Agreement, the parties agreed to modify the terms of the existing 2021 OPP to accelerate timing for determining whether the award is vested and earned, which changed the end date of the performance period (as described in more detail below) to September 11, 2023, the day prior to the Acquisition Date of the Mergers. Accordingly, on September 11, 2023, the compensation committee of the Board reviewed and approved the final calculation determining that of the GNL LTIP Units subject to the 2021 OPP had been earned and became vested and Common Stock was issued for the vested GNL LTIP Units. The remaining GNL LTIP Units were automatically forfeited, without the payment of any consideration. In addition: 
 Due to the modification noted above that changed the timing of the final measurement for determining whether the award is vested and earned, all of the remaining unrecognized compensation expense was accelerated and recorded in the quarter ended September 30, 2023 (through September 11, 2023). During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, the Company recorded total compensation expense related to the GNL LTIP Units of million and million, respectively. 
 In September 2023, the Company paid a million priority catch-up distribution to the former Advisor in respect of the GNL LTIP Units that were earned under the 2021 OPP. In total, the Company paid million and million of distributions related to the GNL LTIP Units during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively.

 reportable segments consistent with its current management internal financial reporting purposes: (1) Industrial Distribution (2) Multi-Tenant Retail (3) Single-Tenant Retail and (4) Office. The Company will evaluate performance and make resource allocations based on its business segments. The Company is reporting its business segments using the management approach model for segment reporting, whereby the Company determines its reportable business segments based on the way the chief operating decision maker organizes business segments within the Company for making operating decisions and assessing financial performance. The Company s chief operating decision maker receives and reviews financial information based on the Company's segments. The Company evaluates business segment performance based upon net operating income, which is defined as total revenues from tenants, less property operating costs. The segments are managed separately due to the property type and the accounting policies are consistent across each segment. See below for a description of net operating income. 
 Net Operating Income 
 The Company evaluates the performance of the combined properties in each segment based on total revenues from tenants, less property operating costs. As such, this excludes all other items of expense and income included in the financial statements in calculating net income (loss). The Company uses net operating income at the segment level to assess and compare property level performance and to make decisions concerning the operation of the properties. The Company believes that the net operating income of each segment is useful as a performance measure because, when compared across periods, the net operating income of each segment reflects the impact on operations from trends in occupancy rates, rental rates, operating expenses and acquisition activity on an unleveraged basis, providing perspective not immediately apparent from net income (loss).

 Overview 
 We are a real estate investment trust REIT for United States U.S. federal income tax purposes that focuses on acquiring and managing a global portfolio of income producing net lease assets across the U.S., and Western and Northern Europe. Historically, we focused on acquiring and managing a globally diversified portfolio of strategically-located commercial real estate properties, which consisted primarily of mission-critical, single tenant net-lease assets. As a result of acquiring RTL in the quarter ended September 30, 2023, as further discussed below, we acquired a diversified portfolio of 989 properties consisting of primarily necessity-based retail single-tenant and multi-tenant properties located in the U.S. Until September 12, 2023, we were managed by Global Net Lease Advisors, LLC Advisor ), who managed our day-to-day business with the assistance of our property manager, Global Net Lease Properties, LLC Property Manager ), who managed and leased our properties to third parties. Prior to September 12, 2023, the former Advisor and the Property Manager were under common control with AR Global Investments, LLC AR Global ), and these related parties had historically received compensation and fees for various services provided to us. On September 12, 2023, we also internalized our advisory and property management functions as well as the advisory and property management functions of RTL as a result of the Internalization Merger (defined below) in the quarter ended September 30, 2023. 
 As of September 30, 2024, we owned 1,223 properties consisting of 61.9 million rentable square feet, which were 96 leased, with a weighted-average remaining lease term of 6.3 years. Based on the percentage of annualized rental income on a straight-line basis as of September 30, 2024, approximately 80 of our properties were located in the U.S. and Canada and approximately 20 were located in Europe. In addition, as of September 30, 2024, our portfolio was comprised of 33 Industrial Distribution properties, 27 Multi-Tenant retail properties, 22 Single Tenant retail properties and 18 Office properties. These represent our four reportable segments and the percentages are calculated using annualized straight-line rent converted from local currency into the U.S. Dollar USD as of September 30, 2024. The straight-line rent includes amounts for tenant concessions. 
 Our portfolio is leased to primarily Investment Grade rated tenants in well established markets in the U.S. and Europe. A total of 60.5 of our rental income on an annualized straight-line basis for leases in place as of September 30, 2024 was derived from Investment Grade rated tenants, comprised of 31.8 leased to tenants with an actual investment grade rating and 28.7 leased to tenants with an implied investment grade rating. For our purposes, Investment Grade includes both actual investment grade ratings of the tenant or guarantor, if available, or implied investment grade. Implied investment grade may include actual ratings of the tenant parent, guarantor parent (regardless of whether or not the parent has guaranteed the tenant s obligation under the lease) or tenants that are identified as investment grade by using a proprietary Moody s analytical tool, which generates an implied rating by measuring an entity s probability of default. Ratings information is as of September 30, 2024. 
 The Acquisition of The Necessity Retail REIT and the Internalization Merger 
 On September 12, 2023 (the Acquisition Date ), the REIT Merger (as defined below) and the Internalization Merger (as defined below) were both consummated (collectively, the Mergers ). The REIT Merger and Internalization Merger were all conditioned upon each other and accordingly are considered related and treated as a single transaction for accounting and reporting purposes (see Note 3 The Mergers to our consolidated financial statements in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for additional information).

RTL OP ), with RTL OP continuing as the surviving entity (the OP Merger and collectively, with the REIT Merger, the REIT Mergers ). 
 On the Acquisition Date, pursuant to the REIT Merger Agreement, each issued and outstanding share of RTL s (i) Class A Common Stock, par value 0.01 per share (the RTL Class A Common Stock ), was converted into 0.670 shares (the Exchange Ratio of GNL s Common Stock, par value 0.01 per share Common Stock ), (ii) 7.50 Series A Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock, par value 0.01 per share RTL Series A Preferred Stock ), was automatically converted into one share of newly created 7.50 Series D Cumulative Redeemable Perpetual Preferred Stock, par value 0.01 per share (the Series D Preferred Stock ), and (iii) 7.375 Series C Cumulative Redeemable Perpetual Preferred Stock, par value 0.01 per share RTL Series C Preferred Stock ), was automatically converted into one share of newly created 7.375 Series E Cumulative Redeemable Perpetual Preferred Stock, par value 0.01 per share (the Series E Preferred Stock ).

 Results of Operations 
 We operates in four reportable segments consistent with our current management internal financial reporting purposes: (1) Industrial Distribution, (2) Multi-Tenant Retail, (3) Single-Tenant Retail and (4) Office (see Note 15 Segment Reporting to our consolidated financial statements included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, for additional details on our reportable segments). 
 In our Industrial Distribution, Single-Tenant Retail and Office segments, we own, manage and lease single-tenant properties where in addition to base rent, our tenants are required to pay for their property operating expenses or reimburse us for property operating expenses that we incur (primarily property insurance and real estate taxes). However, some limited property operating expenses that are not the responsibility of the tenant are absorbed by us. The main exceptions are properties leased to the Government Services Administration, which do not require the tenant to reimburse the costs. 
 In our Multi-Tenant Retail segment, we own, manage and lease multi-tenant properties where we generally pay for the property operating expenses for those properties and most of our tenants are required to pay their pro rata share of property operating expenses. 
 As more fully discussed in Note 3 The Mergers, to our consolidated financial statements included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, during the quarter ended September 30, 2023 we completed the Mergers which will affect comparable results from operations until the properties acquired have been held for all periods presented. As a result, comparisons of our period to period financial information as set forth herein may not be meaningful. The historical financial information included herein as of any date, or for any periods, prior to September 12, 2023 represents our financial information, prior to the Mergers, on a stand-alone basis. 
 
 Comparison of the Three Months Ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 
 Net Loss Attributable to Common Stockholders 
 Net loss attributable to common stockholders was 76.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to 142.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The change in net loss attributable to common stockholders is discussed in detail for each line item of the consolidated statements of operations in the sections that follow. 
 Revenue from Tenants 
 Consolidated revenue from tenants includes only 18 days of revenue attributable to properties acquired from RTL on the Acquisition Date in the September 30, 2023 period. Consolidated revenue from tenants, detailed by reportable segment, is as follows: 
 Three Months Ended September 30, (In thousands) 2024 2023 Revenue From Tenants: Industrial Distribution 59,654 53,767 Multi-Tenant Retail 62,380 13,387 Single-Tenant Retail 38,378 12,212 Office 36,152 38,802 Total Consolidated Revenue From Tenants 196,564 118,168 
 Industrial Distribution 
 Revenue from tenants in our Industrial Distribution segment was 59.7 million and 53.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The majority of the increase in revenue from tenants was driven by a full quarterly period of revenue in the third quarter of 2024 attributable to properties acquired from RTL on the Acquisition Date, the increase from a full quarterly period of revenue in 2024 from other properties acquired since January 1, 2023, with minimal impact from the year-over-year change in average exchange rates during the three months ended September 30, 2024, when compared to the same period last year. 
 Multi-Tenant Retail 
 Revenue from tenants in our Multi-Tenant Retail segment was 62.4 million and 13.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The majority of the increase in revenue from tenants was driven by a full quarterly period of revenue in the third quarter of 2024 attributable to properties acquired from RTL on the Acquisition Date.

Table of Contents 

 Single-Tenant Retail 
 Revenue from tenants in our Single-Tenant Retail segment was 38.4 million and 12.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The increase in the third quarter of 2024 was primarily due to a full quarterly period of revenue in the third quarter of 2024 attributable to properties acquired from RTL on the Acquisition Date, with minimal impact from the year-over-year change in average exchange rates during the three months ended September 30, 2024, when compared to the same period last year. 
 Office 
 Revenue from tenants in our Office segment was 36.2 million and 38.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The decrease in the third quarter of 2024 was primarily driven by disposals, partially offset by a full quarterly period of revenue in the third quarter of 2024 attributable to properties acquired from RTL on the Acquisition Date. The year-over-year change in foreign exchange rates had a minimal impact. 
 Property Operating Expenses 
 Consolidated property operating expenses includes only 18 days of expenses attributable to properties acquired from RTL on the Acquisition Date in the September 30, 2023 period. Consolidated property operating expenses, detailed by reportable segment, is as follows: 
 Three Months Ended September 30, (In thousands) 2024 2023 Property Operating Expenses: Industrial Distribution 5,494 3,436 Multi-Tenant Retail 20,170 4,457 Single-Tenant Retail 2,868 737 Office 4,983 4,993 Total Consolidated Property Operating Expenses 33,515 13,623 
 Industrial Distribution 
 Property operating expenses in our Industrial Distribution segment were 5.5 million and 3.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The increase was primarily due to the timing of our reimbursable costs as well as an increase resulting from a full quarterly period of expenses in the third quarter of 2024 from properties acquired from RTL on the Acquisition Date, with minimal impact from the year-over-year change in average foreign exchange rates during the three months ended September 30, 2024, when compared to the same period last year. 
 Multi-Tenant Retail 
 Property operating expenses in our Multi-Tenant Retail were 20.2 million and 4.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The majority of the increase in property operating expenses was driven by a full quarterly period of expenses in the third quarter of 2024 attributable to properties acquired from RTL on the Acquisition Date. 
 Single-Tenant Retail 
 Property operating expenses in our Single-Tenant Retail were 2.9 million and 0.7 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The increase in the third quarter of 2024 was primarily a result of a full quarterly period of expenses in the third quarter of 2024 from properties acquired from RTL on the Acquisition Date, with minimal impact from the year-over-year change in average foreign exchange rates during the three months ended September 30, 2024, when compared to the same period last year. 
 Office 
 Property operating expenses in our Office segment remained consistent at 5.0 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. 
 Operating Fees to Related Parties 
 Due to the completion of the Internalization Merger (see below) there were no operating fees paid to related parties in the three months ended September 30, 2024. Operating fees paid to related parties were 8.7 million in the three months ended September 30, 2023. The decline in the quarter ended September 30, 2024 was primarily due to the closing of the Internalization Merger on the Acquisition Date. For additional information, see Note 12 Related Party Transaction s to our consolidated financial statements included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. 
 52 

Table of Contents 

 Upon the closing of the Mergers, we no longer pay asset management fees to the Advisor or property management fees to the Property Manager and we internalized our management functions. While we no longer pay the costs of the various fees and expense reimbursements previously paid to the former Advisor and the Property Manager, after the Internalization Merger, our expenses now include the compensation (including equity-based compensation) and benefits of our officers, employees, and consultants, as well as overhead expenses, previously paid by those entities in managing our business and operations and are being recorded in general and administrative expenses from the Acquisition Date forward. 
 Impairment Charges 
 During the three months ended September 30, 2024, the Company determined that 21 of its properties located in the U.S. (19 of which were acquired in the REIT Merger) had an estimated fair value that was lower than the carrying value of the properties, based on the estimated selling price of such properties, and as a result, the Company recorded an impairment charge of approximately 38.6 million. 
 During the three months ended September 30, 2023, we determined that the fair values of four of our properties (one in the U.K. and three in the U.S.) were lower than their carrying values. These properties were all owned by us prior to the REIT Merger. As a result, we recorded aggregate impairment charges for these properties, including impairments to intangible assets, totaling 65.7 million in three months ended September 30, 2023. The impairment charge for the property in the U.K. was based on a calculation of the estimated fair value of the property. The impairment charges for the properties in the U.S., which the Company has signed non-binding letters of intent to sell, were based on the estimated selling prices of the assets. 
 Merger, Transaction and Other Costs 
 We recognized 1.9 million and 43.8 million of merger, transaction and other costs during the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The decrease was due to higher advisory, legal and other professional costs incurred in the prior year period that were directly related to the Mergers. 
 Settlement Costs 
 We recognized settlement costs in the three months ended September 30, 2023 of 14.6 million, which related to non-cash equity expense for Common Stock issued to Blackwells Capital LLC Blackwells Capital ), an affiliate of Blackwells Onshore I LLC Blackwells Onshore and, together with Blackwells Capital, Blackwells ), and certain others involved with Blackwells proxy solicitation (collectively and, together with Blackwells, the Blackwells/Related Parties under the Cooperation Agreement (as defined in Note 10 Stockholders Equity ). 
 General and Administrative Expenses 
 General and administrative expenses were 12.6 million and 7.0 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, primarily consisting of employee compensation/payroll expenses, professional fees including audit and taxation services, board member compensation and directors and officers liability insurance. The overall increase in general and administrative expenses was primarily due to a full quarter of expenses in the third quarter of 2024 from the internalization of our management functions (as discussed above), such as employee compensation/payroll expenses. 
 Equity-Based Compensation 
 During the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, we recognized equity-based compensation expense of 2.3 million and 10.4 million, respectively. Equity-based compensation in the quarter ended September 30, 2024 consisted of (i) amortization of restricted shares of Common Stock Restricted Shares granted to employees of the former Advisor or its affiliates who were involved in providing services to us prior to the Internalization; (ii) amortization of restricted stock units in respect of shares of Common Stock RSUs granted to our employees (after the Internalization) and our independent directors and; (iii) amortization expense related to performance stock units PSUs which were issued in October of 2023. Equity-based compensation for the quarter ended September 30, 2023 included amortization expense for Restricted Shares, RSUs and expense related to our multi-year outperformance agreement entered into with the former Advisor in June 2021 (the 2021 OPP ), which expired on September 11, 2023. The decrease in the third quarter of 2024 as compared to the prior year quarter was due to higher compensation expense recorded in the third quarter of 2023 as a result of an accelerated amortization expense due to a modification to the 2021 OPP (for additional information, see Note 13 Equity-Based Compensation to our consolidated financial statements in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q). 
 Depreciation and Amortization 
 Depreciation and amortization expense was 85.4 million and 49.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The increase in the quarter ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the same quarter last year was due to additional depreciation and amortization expense recorded as a result of the impact of the REIT Merger. In addition, the increase was partially due to the impact of the year-over-year change in average foreign exchange rates during the three months ended September 30, 2024, when compared to the same period last year.

 Loss on Dispositions of Real Estate Assets 
 During the three months ended September 30, 2024 we sold 20 properties, 13 of which were acquired in the REIT Merger, and recorded a net loss of 4.3 million during the three months ended September 30, 2024. During the three months ended September 30, 2023, we sold two properties in the U.S., which were acquired in the REIT Merger, and recorded a net loss of 0.7 million. 
 Interest Expense 
 Interest expense was 77.1 million and 41.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The increase was due to higher non-cash amortization expense due to the amortization of discounts recorded on debt acquired in the REIT Merger. The amount of our total gross debt outstanding was 5.0 billion as of September 30, 2024, as compared to from 5.3 billion as of September 30, 2023. The weighted-average effective interest rate of our total debt was 4.7 as of September 30, 2023 and 4.8 as of September 30, 2024. 
 The increase in interest expense was also impacted by the year-over-year change in average foreign exchange rates during the three months ended September 30, 2024, when compared to the same period last year. As of September 30, 2024, approximately 11.0 of our total debt outstanding was denominated in EUR, 9.0 of our total debt outstanding was denominated in GBP and 1.0 was denominated in Canadian Dollars CAD ). As of September 30, 2023, approximately 10 of our total debt outstanding was denominated in EUR, 8 of our total debt outstanding was denominated in GBP and 1 was denominated in CAD. 
 We view a combination of secured and unsecured financing as an efficient and accretive means to acquire properties and manage working capital. As of September 30, 2024, approximately 48 of our total debt outstanding was secured and 52 was unsecured, the latter including amounts outstanding under our Revolving Credit Facility and Senior Notes. The availability of borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility is based on the value of a pool of eligible unencumbered real estate assets owned by us and compliance with various ratios related to those assets. Our interest expense in future periods will vary based on interest rates, the level of future borrowings, which will depend on refinancing needs and acquisition activity, and changes in currency exchange rates. 
 Loss on Extinguishment of Debt 
 The loss on extinguishment of debt of 0.3 million in the quarter ended September 30, 2024. There was no loss on extinguishment of debt recorded in the quarter ended September 30, 2023. 
 (Loss) Gain on Derivative Instruments 
 The loss of 4.7 million on derivative instruments for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and the gain of 3.2 million on derivative instruments for the three months ended September 30, 2023, reflect the marked-to-market impact from foreign currency and interest rate derivative instruments used to hedge the investment portfolio from currency and interest rate movements, and was mainly driven by exchange rate changes in the GBP and EUR compared to the USD. For the three months ended September 30, 2024, the loss on derivative instruments consisted of unrealized losses of 4.4 million and realized losses of 0.3 million. For the three months ended September 30, 2023, the gain on derivative instruments consisted of unrealized gains of 1.9 million and realized gains of 1.3 million. The overall gains (or losses) on derivative instruments directly impact our results of operations since they are recorded on the gain on derivative instruments line item in our consolidated results of operations. However, only the realized gains or losses are included in AFFO (as defined below). 
 As a result of our foreign investments in Europe, and, to a lesser extent, our investments in Canada, we are subject to risk from the effects of exch ange rate movements in the EUR, GBP and, to a lesser extent, CAD against the USD, which may affect costs and cash flows in our functional currency, the USD. We generally manage foreign currency exchange rate movements by matching our debt service obligation to the lender and the tenant s rental obligation to us in the same currency. This reduces our overall exposure to currency fluctuations. In addition, we may use currency hedging to further reduce the exposure to our net cash flow. We are generally a net receiver of these currencies (we receive more cash than we pay out), and therefore our results of operations of our foreign properties benefit from a weaker USD, and are adversely affected by a stronger USD, relative to the foreign currency. Conversely, realized gains from derivatives would generally be lower from a weaker USD, and higher from a stronger USD. We maintain our hedging approach by consistently entering into new foreign exchange forwards for three year periods. Interest rate increases could increase the interest expense on our floating rate debt or any new debt and we are constantly evaluating the use of hedging strategies to mitigate this risk. 
 See Note 9 Derivatives and Hedging Activities to our consolidated financial statements in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for additional information on our hedging program.

 Unrealized Income on Undesignated Foreign Currency Advances and Other Hedge Ineffectiveness 
 We did not record any inco me or loss on undesignated foreign currency advances and other hedge ineffectiveness during the quarters ended September 30, 2024 or September 30, 2023. 
 Income Tax Expense 
 Although as a REIT we generally do not pay U.S. federal income taxes on the amount of REIT taxable income that is distributed to shareholders, we recognize income tax benefit (expense) domestically for state taxes and local income taxes incurred, if any, and also in foreign jurisdictions in which we own properties. In addition, we perform an analysis of potential deferred tax or future tax benefit and expense as a result of book and tax differences and timing differences in taxes across jurisdictions. Income tax expense was 1.3 million and 2.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. 
 Preferred Stock Dividends 
 Preferred stock dividends were 10.9 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 6.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The amounts in both periods represent the dividends that are attributable to holders of Series A Preferred Stock, Series B Preferred Stock, Series D Preferred Stock and Series E Preferred Stock. 
 
 Comparison of the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 
 As more fully discussed in Note 1 Organization to our consolidated financial statements included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, during the quarter ended September 30, 2023 we completed the Mergers which will affect comparable results from operations until the properties acquired have been held for all periods presented. As a result, comparisons of our period to period financial information as set forth herein may not be meaningful. The historical financial information included herein as of any date, or for any periods, prior to September 12, 2023, represents our financial information, prior to the Mergers, on a stand-alone basis. 
 Net Loss Attributable to Common Stockholders 
 Net loss attributable to common stockholders was 157.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to net loss of 179.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The change in net loss attributable to common stockholders is discussed in detail for each line item of the consolidated statements of operations in the sections that follow. 
 Revenue from Tenants 
 Consolidated revenue from tenants includes only 18 days of revenue attributable to properties acquired from RTL on the Acquisition Date in the September 30, 2023 period. Consolidated revenue from tenants, detailed by reportable segment, is as follows: 
 Nine Months Ended September 30, (In thousands) 2024 2023 Revenue From Tenants: Industrial Distribution 183,084 157,879 Multi-Tenant Retail 196,149 13,387 Single-Tenant Retail 118,112 20,471 Office 108,550 116,607 Total Consolidated Revenue From Tenants 605,895 308,344 
 Industrial Distribution 
 Revenue from tenants in our Industrial Distribution segment was 183.1 million and 157.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The increase in revenue from tenants was primarily driven by a full period of revenue in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 attributable to properties acquired from RTL on the Acquisition Date and the increase from a full period of revenue in 2024 from other properties acquired since January 1, 2023, with minimal impact from the year-over-year change in average foreign exchange rates during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, when compared to the same period last year.

 Multi-Tenant Retail 
 Revenue from tenants in our Multi-Tenant Retail segment was 196.1 million and 13.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The majority of the increase in revenue from tenants was driven by a full period of revenue in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 attributable to properties acquired from RTL on the Acquisition Date. 
 Single-Tenant Retail 
 Revenue from tenants in our Single-Tenant Retail segment was 118.1 million and 20.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The increase was primarily due to a full period of revenue in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 attributable to properties acquired from RTL on the Acquisition Date, with minimal impact from the year-over-year change in average foreign exchange rates during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, when compared to the same period last year. 
 Office 
 Revenue from tenants in our Office segment was 108.6 million and 116.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The decrease as presented in the table above was primarily driven by disposals, partially offset by a full period of revenue in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 attributable to properties acquired from RTL on the Acquisition Date, with minimal impact from the year-over-year change in foreign exchange rates during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, when compared to the same period last year. 
 Property Operating Expenses 
 Consolidated property operating expenses includes only 18 days of expenses attributable to properties acquired from RTL on the Acquisition Date in the September 30, 2023 period. Consolidated property operating expenses, detailed by reportable segment, is as follows: 
 Nine Months Ended September 30, (In thousands) 2024 2023 Property Operating Expenses: Industrial Distribution 15,126 10,050 Multi-Tenant Retail 65,638 4,457 Single-Tenant Retail 11,414 1,053 Office 14,700 15,242 Total Consolidated Property Operating Expenses 106,878 30,802 
 Industrial Distribution 
 Property operating expenses in our Industrial Distribution segment were 15.1 million and 10.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The increase was primarily due to the timing of our reimbursable costs and a full period of expenses in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 attributable to properties acquired from RTL on the Acquisition Date, with minimal impact from the year-over-year change in average foreign exchange rates during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, when compared to the same period last year. 
 Multi-Tenant Retail 
 Property operating expenses in our Multi-Tenant Retail were 65.6 million and 4.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The majority of the increase in property operating expenses was driven by a full period of expenses in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 attributable to properties acquired from RTL on the Acquisition Date. 
 Single-Tenant Retail 
 Property operating expenses in our Single-Tenant Retail were 11.4 million and 1.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The increase was primarily due to an increase in property operating expenses resulting from a full period of expenses in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 attributable to properties acquired from RTL on the Acquisition Date and a full period of property operating expenses from other properties acquired since January 1,

 2023, with minimal impact from the year-over-year change in average foreign exchange rates, when compared to the same period last year. 
 Office 
 Property operating expenses in our Office segment were 14.7 million and 15.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The decrease was primarily due to the timing of our reimbursable expenses, with minimal impact from the year-over-year change in average foreign exchange rates. 
 Operating Fees to Related Parties 
 Due to the completion of the Internalization Merger (see below) there were no operating fees paid to related parties in the nine months ended September 30, 2024. Operating fees paid to related parties were 28.9 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decline in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily due to the closing of the Internalization Merger on the Acquisition Date. For additional information, see Note 12 Related Party Transactions to our consolidated financial statements included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. 
 Upon the closing of the Mergers, we no longer pay asset management fees to the Advisor or property management fees to the Property Manager and we internalized our management functions. While we no longer pay the costs of the various fees and expense reimbursements previously paid to the Advisor and the Property Manager, after the Internalization Merger, our expenses now include the compensation and benefits of our officers, employees, and consultants, as well as overhead expenses, previously paid by those entities in managing our business and operations and are being recorded in general and administrative expenses from the Acquisition Date forward. 
 Impairment Charges 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we determined that the fair values of 33 of our properties located in the U.S. (28 of which were acquired in the REIT Merger) had an estimated fair value that was lower than the carrying value of the properties, based on the estimated selling price of such properties, and as a result, we recorded an impairment charge of approximately 70.3 million. The majority of the impairment charges in the first nine months of 2024 were due to legacy GNL properties. 
 During the three months ended September 30, 2023, we determined that the fair values of four of our properties (one in the U.K. and three in the U.S.) were lower than their carrying values. These properties were all owned by us prior to the REIT Merger. As a result, we recorded aggregate impairment charges for these properties, including impairments to intangible assets, totaling 65.7 million in three and nine months ended September 30, 2023. The impairment charge for the property in the U.K. was based on a calculation of the estimated fair value of the property. The impairment charges for the properties in the U.S., which the Company has signed non-binding letters of intent to sell, were based on the estimated selling prices of the assets. 
 Merger, Transaction and Other Costs 
 We recognized 4.2 million and 50.1 million of merger, transaction and other costs during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The decrease was due to higher advisory, legal and other professional costs incurred in the prior year period that were directly related to the Mergers. 
 Settlement Costs 
 We recognized settlement costs of 29.7 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2023, which related to the cash reimbursement of approximately 8.8 million of expenses to the Blackwells/Related Parties and non-cash equity expense recorded in the nine months ended September 30, 2023 of approximately 20.9 million for Common Stock that was ultimately issued to Blackwells under the Cooperation Agreement (as defined in Note 10 Stockholders Equity to our consolidated financial statements in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q ). 
 General and Administrative Expenses 
 General and administrative expenses were 44.0 million and 23.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and primarily consist of employee compensation/payroll expenses, professional fees including audit and taxation services, board member compensation and directors and officers liability insurance. The overall increase in general and administrative expenses was primarily due to a full period of expenses in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from the internalization of our management functions (as discussed above). 
 Equity-Based Compensation 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, we recognized equity-based compensation expense of 6.6 million and 16.2 million, respectively. Equity-based compensation in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 consisted of (i) amortization of Restricted Shares granted to employees of the former Advisor or its affiliates who were involved in providing services to us prior to the Internalization; (ii) amortization of RSUs granted to our employees (after the Internalization) and our independent directors and; (iii) amortization expense related to PSUs which were issued in October of 2023. Equity-based compensation for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 included amortization expense for Restricted Shares, RSUs and expense related to the 2021 OPP, which expired on September 11, 2023. The decrease in the nine months 
 57 

Table of Contents 

 ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the prior year quarter was due to higher compensation expense recorded in the third quarter of 2023 as a result of an accelerated amortization expense due to a modification to the 2021 OPP (for additional information, see Note 13 Equity-Based Compensation to our consolidated financial statements in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q). 
 Depreciation and Amortization 
 Depreciation and amortization expense was 266.9 million and 123.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The increase in the first nine months of 2024 compared to the first nine months of 2023 was due to additional depreciation and amortization expense recorded for a full period in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as a result of the impact of the REIT Merger and the year-over-year change in average foreign exchange rates during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, when compared to the same period last year. 
 Gain (Loss) on Dispositions of Real Estate Investments 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we sold 75 properties, 64 which were acquired in the REIT Merger, and recorded a net gain of 35.7 million. During the nine months ended September 30, 2023, we sold two properties, which were acquired in the REIT Merger, and recorded a net loss of 0.7 million 
 Interest Expense 
 Interest expense was 249.7 million and 95.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The increase was due to higher non-cash amortization expense due to the amortization of discounts recorded on debt acquired in the REIT Merger. The net amount of our total gross debt outstanding was 5.3 billion as of September 30, 2023 as compared to 5.0 billion as of September 30, 2024. The weighted-average effective interest rate of our total debt was 4.7 as of September 30, 2023 and 4.8 as of September 30, 2024. 
 The increase in interest expense was also impacted by the year-over-year change in average foreign exchange rates during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, when compared to the same period last year. As of September 30, 2024, approximately 11.0 of our total debt outstanding was denominated in EUR, 9.0 of our total debt outstanding was denominated in GBP and 1.0 was denominated in CAD. As of September 30, 2023, approximately 10 of our total debt outstanding was denominated in EUR, 8 of our total debt outstanding was denominated in GBP and 1 was denominated in CAD. 
 We view a combination of secured and unsecured financing as an efficient and accretive means to acquire properties and manage working capital. As of September 30, 2024, approximately 48 of our total debt outstanding was secured and 52 was unsecured, including amounts outstanding under our Revolving Credit Facility and Senior Notes. The availability of borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility is based on the value of a pool of eligible unencumbered real estate assets owned by us and compliance with various ratios related to those assets. Our interest expense in future periods will vary based on interest rates as well as our level of future borrowings, which will depend on refinancing needs and acquisition activity. 
 Loss on Extinguishment of Debt 
 The loss on extinguishment of debt of 13.5 million and 0.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, was primarily due to cash payments made during the second quarter of 2023 upon repaying certain mortgage loans, primarily related to the fee required to be paid upon repayment of the mortgage loan that encumbered our McLaren properties in the U.K. This mortgage loan was assumed as part of our acquisition of the McLaren properties in 2021 and included the fee noted above in the terms of the mortgage. 
 (Loss) Gain on Derivative Instruments 
 The loss on derivative instruments of 2.6 million and gain of 0.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, reflect the marked-to-market impact from foreign currency and interest rate derivative instruments used to hedge the investment portfolio from currency and interest rate movements, and was mainly driven by currency rate changes in the GBP and EUR compared to the USD. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the lossn on derivative instruments consisted of unrealized losses of 2.9 million and realized gains of 0.3 million . For the nine months ended September 30, 2023, the gain on derivative instruments was 0.8 million, which consisted of unrealized losses of 2.3 million and realized gains of 3.1 million. The overall gain (or loss) on derivative instruments directly impact our results of operations since they are recorded on the gain on derivative instruments line item in our consolidated results of operations. However, only the realized gains are included in AFFO (as defined below). 
 We recorded a gain of 1.3 million on undesignated foreign currency advances and other hedge ineffectiveness, related to the accelerated reclassification of amounts in other comprehensive income to earnings as a result of certain hedged forecasted transactions becoming probable not to occur, for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. We did not record any gains or losses on undesignated foreign currency adva nces and other hedge ineffectiveness for the nine months ended September 30, 2023.

Table of Contents 

 As a result of our foreign investments in Europe, and, to a lesser extent, our investments in Canada, we are subject to risk from the effects of exchange rate movements in the EUR, GBP and, to a lesser extent, CAD, which may affect costs and cash flows in our functional currency, the USD. We generally manage foreign currency exchange rate movements by matching our debt service obligation to the lender and the tenant s rental obligation to us in the same currency. This reduces our overall exposure to currency fluctuations. In addition, we may use currency hedging to further reduce the exposure to our net cash flow. We are generally a net receiver of these currencies (we receive more cash than we pay out), and therefore our results of operations of our foreign properties benefit from a weaker USD, and are adversely affected by a stronger USD, relative to the foreign currency. 
 Income Tax Expense 
 Although as a REIT we generally do not pay U.S. federal income taxes on the amount of REIT taxable income that is distributed to shareholders, we recognize income tax (expense) benefit domestically for state taxes and local income taxes incurred, if any, and also in foreign jurisdictions in which we own properties. In addition, we perform an analysis of potential deferred tax or future tax benefit and expense as a result of book and tax differences and timing differences in taxes across jurisdictions. Income tax expense was 3.5 million and 9.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 respectively. 
 Preferred Stock Dividends 
 Preferred stock dividends were 32.8 million and 16.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The amounts in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 represent the dividends that are attributable to holders of Series A Preferred Stock, Series B Preferred Stock, Series D Preferred Stock and Series E Preferred Stock. 
 
 Cash Flows from Operating Activities 
 The level of cash flows provided by operating activities is driven by, among other things, rental income received, operating fees paid to related parties for asset and property management services (prior to the internalization of our advisory and property management functions) and interest payments on outstanding borrowings. 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, net cash provided by operating activities was 224.7 million. Cash flows provided by operating activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 reflect net loss of 125.1 million, adjusted for non-cash items of 411.3 million (primarily depreciation, amortization of intangibles, amortization of deferred financing costs, amortization of mortgage discounts, amortization of above- and below-market lease assets and liabilities, amortization of right of use assets, amortization of lease incentives and commissions, bad debt expense, unbilled straight-line rent (including the effect of adjustments due to rent deferrals), equity-based compensation, unrealized gains on foreign currency transactions, derivatives and other non-cash items). In addition, operating cash flow was impacted by lease incentive and commission payments of 0.8 million and a net decrease of 25.1 million in working capital items due to an increase in prepaid expenses and other assets of 14.0 million, a decrease in accounts payable and accrued expenses of 9.8 million and a decrease in prepaid rent of 1.4 million. 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2023, net cash provided by operating activities was 88.0 million. Cash flows provided by operating activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2023 reflect net loss of 163.3 million, adjusted for non-cash items of 241.1 million (primarily depreciation, amortization of intangibles, amortization of deferred financing costs, amortization of mortgage discounts, amortization of above- and below-market lease assets and liabilities, amortization of right of use assets, amortization of lease incentives and commissions, bad debt expense, unbilled straight-line rent (including the effect of adjustments due to rent deferrals), equity-based compensation, unrealized gains on foreign currency transactions, derivatives and other non-cash items). In addition, operating cash flow was impacted by lease incentive and commission payments of 2.8 million and an increase of 11.8 million in working capital items due to an increase in prepaid expenses and other assets of 4.1 million, an increase in accounts payable and accrued expenses of 7.6 million and an increase in prepaid rent of 0.2 million. 
 Cash Flows from Investing Activities 
 Net cash provided by investing activities durin g the nine months ended September 30, 2024 of 515.3 million consisted of net proceeds from dispositions of 547.6 million, partially offset by capital expenditures of 32.8 million. 
 Net cash used in investing activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2023 of 553.8 million consisted of property acquisitions of 81.4 million and capital expenditures of 29.6 million, partially offset by net cash used to complete Mergers of 450.8 million. 
 Cash Flows from Financing Activities 
 Net cash used in financing activities of 730.3 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was a result of net payments of principal on mortgage notes payable of 275.2 million, net paydowns of borrowings under our Revolving Credit Facility of 192.4 million, dividends paid to common stockholders of 208.7 million, dividends paid to holders of our Series A Preferred Stock of 9.2 million, dividends paid to holders of our Series B Preferred Stock of 6.1 million, dividends paid to holders of our Series D Preferred Stock of 11.2 million, dividends paid to holders of our Series E Preferred Stock of

Table of Contents 

 6.4 million, payments for early extinguishment of debt charges of 13.1 million and cash paid for financing costs of 7.6 million. 
 Net cash provided by financing activities of 537.0 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2023 was a result of net proceeds from borrowings under our Revolving Credit Facility of 949.9 million, partially offset by net payments of mortgage notes payable of 261.1 million (for additional information on Revolving Credit Facility activity, see the Liquidity and Capital Resources section below), dividends paid to common stockholders of 125.3 million, dividends paid to holders of our Series A Preferred Stock of 9.2 million, dividends paid to holders of our Series B Preferred Stock of 6.1 million, cash paid for financing costs of 6.8 million and distributions to non-controlling interest holders of 3.2 million. 
 
 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 Our principal future needs for cash and cash equivalents include the purchase of additional properties or other investments, payment of related acquisition costs, improvement costs, operating and administrative expenses, repayment of certain debt obligations, which includes our continuing debt service obligations and dividends to holders of our Common Stock and Preferred Stock, as well as to any future class or series of preferred stock we may issue. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we had cash and cash equivalents of 127.2 million and 121.6 million, respectively. See discussion above for how our cash flows from various sources impacted our cash. 
 Management expects that cash generated from operations, supplemented by our existing cash will be sufficient to fund, in the near term and long term, the payment of quarterly dividends to our common stockholders and holders of our Preferred Stock, as well as anticipated capital expenditures. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, cash generated from operations covered 93 of our dividends paid. In addition, we plan on managing our leverage by using proceeds from strategic or opportunistic dispositions to reduce our debt pursuant to our previously announced 2024 strategic disposition plan, and we currently have entered into purchase and sale agreements PSAs and non-binding letters of intent LOIs totaling an aggregate of 371.4 million. The PSAs and LOIs are subject to conditions and there can be no assurance we will be able to complete these dispositions on their contemplated terms, or at all. 
 Our other sources of capital, which we have used and may use in the future, include proceeds received from our Revolving Credit Facility, proceeds from secured or unsecured financings (which may include note issuances), proceeds from our offerings of equity securities (including Common Stock and Preferred Stock), proceeds from any future sales of properties and undistributed cash flows from operations, if any. 
 Acquisitions, Dispositions and Pending Transactions 
 We are in the business of acquiring real estate properties and leasing the properties to tenants. Generally, we fund our acquisitions through a combination of cash and cash equivalents, proceeds from offerings of equity securities, borrowings under our Revolving Credit Facility and proceeds from mortgage or other debt secured by the acquired or other assets at the time of acquisition or at some later point. In addition, to the extent we dispose of properties, we have used and may continue to use the net proceeds from the dispositions (after repayment of any mortgage debt, if any) for future acquisitions or other general corporate purposes. 
 Acquisitions and Dispositions Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 
 During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, we sold 20 and 75 properties, respectively, 13 and 64 of which were acquired in the REIT Merger, respectively. The properties sold in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 were sold for an aggregate contract price of 247.3 million and 568.7 million, respectively. 
 We did not acquire any properties during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024. 
 Acquisitions and Dispositions Subsequent to September 30, 2024 and Pending Transactions 
 Subsequent to September 30, 2024, we disposed of 12 properties for an aggregate price of 10.0 million. In addition, we have signed definitive PSAs to dispose of 94 properties for a contract purchase price of 241.0 million and we have signed non-binding LOIs to dispose of 23 properties for an aggregate sale price of 130.5 million. 
 Equity Offerings 
 Common Stock 
 We have an at the market equity offering program (the Common Stock ATM Program pursuant to which we may sell shares of Common Stock, from time to time through our sales agents. In November 2022, we filed a new shelf registration statement and prospectus supplement covering the Common Stock ATM Program having an aggregate offering amount of up to 285.0 million, prior to the expiration of our previous registration statement, which had an aggregate offering amount of up to 500.0 million 285.0 million was sold under our previous registration statement). During the three months ended September 30, 2024, we did not sell any shares of Common Stock through the Common Stock ATM Program. 
 Preferred Stock

Table of Contents 

 We have an at the market equity offering program for our Series B Preferred Stock (the Series B Preferred Stock ATM Program pursuant to which we may sell shares of Series B Preferred Stock, from time to time through our sales agents. In November 2022, we filed a new shelf registration statement and prospectus supplement covering the Series B Preferred Stock ATM Program having an aggregate offering amount of up to 170.0 million, prior to the expiration of our previous registration statement, which had an aggregate offering amount of up to 200.0 million. During the three months ended September 30, 2024, we did not sell any shares of Series B Preferred Stock through the Series B Preferred Stock ATM Program. 
 The timing differences between when we raise equity proceeds or receive proceeds from dispositions and when we invest those proceeds in acquisitions or other investments that increase our operating cash flows have affected, and may continue to affect, our results of operations. 
 Borrowings 
 As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we had total gross debt outstanding of 5.0 billion, and 5.4 million, respectively, bearing interest at weighted-average interest rates per annum equal to 4.8 and 4.8 , respectively. 
 As of September 30, 2024, 91 of our total debt outstanding either bore interest at fixed rates, or was swapped to a fixed rate, which bore interest at a weighted average interest rate of 4.7 per annum. As of September 30, 2024, 9 of our total debt outstanding was variable-rate debt, which bore interest at a weighted average interest rate of 6.3 per annum. The total gross carrying value of unencumbered assets as of September 30, 2024 was 4.67 billion, of which approximately 4.64 billion was included in the unencumbered asset pool comprising the borrowing base under the Revolving Credit Facility and therefore is not currently available to serve as collateral for future borrowings. 
 Our debt leverage ratio was 64.0 and 65.0 (total debt as a percentage of total purchase price of real estate investments, based on the exchange rate at the time of purchase) as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. As of September 30, 2024, the weighted-average maturity of our indebtedness was 3.2 years. We believe we have the ability to service our debt obligations as they come due. 
 As noted above, we plan on managing our leverage by using proceeds from strategic or opportunistic dispositions to reduce our debt, and we currently have entered into PSAs and LOIs totaling an aggregate of 371.4 million. 
 Senior Notes 
 In connection with the REIT Merger, we assumed and became a guarantor under RTL s 500.0 million aggregate principal, 4.50 Senior Notes due 2028 (the 4.50 Senior Notes ), pursuant to a supplemental indenture governing the 4.50 Senior Notes. Both the 4.50 Senior Notes and the 3.75 Senior Notes do not require any principal payments prior to maturity. As of September 30, 2024, the carrying amount of the outstanding Senior Notes on our balance sheets totaled 900.9 million which is net of 99.1 million of deferred financing costs and discounts, and as of December 31, 2023 the carrying amount of the outstanding Senior Notes on our balance sheets totaled 886.0 million, which is net of 114.0 million of deferred financing costs. See Note 7 Senior Notes, Net to our consolidated financial statements included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for further discussion on the Senior Notes and related covenants. 
 Mortgage Notes Payable 
 As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we had secured mortgage notes payable of 2.3 billion and 2.5 billion, respectively, net of mortgage discounts and deferred financing costs. All of our current mortgage loans require payment of interest-only with the principal due at maturity. We have 0.3 million of principal payments due on our mortgages during the remainder of 2024. Other significant activity related to our mortgage notes payable was as follows (see Note 5 Mortgage Notes Payable, Net for additional information): 
 In April 2024, we repaid our mortgage loan that encumbered our McLaren properties in the United Kingdom, which had a balance of 127.5 million as of March 31, 2024, using borrowings under the GBP portion of our Revolving Credit Facility. 
 On April 5, 2024, we entered into a commercial mortgage-backed security Loan Agreement CMBS Loan II with (i) Bank of Montreal, (ii) Soci t G n rale Financial Corporation, (iii) Barclays Capital Real Estate Inc. and (iv) KeyBank National Association (each individually, a Lender, and collectively, the Lenders ), in the aggregate amount of 237.0 million. CMBS Loan II is secured by, among other things, first priority mortgages on 20 industrial properties that we own across the United States. CMBS Loan II has a 5-year term, is interest-only (payable monthly) at a fixed rate of 5.74 per year and matures on April 6, 2029. CMBS Loan II contains certain covenants, including, certain obligations to reserve funds and requires us to maintain a net worth of 150.0 million and liquid assets having a market value of at least 10.0 million. We used the net proceeds to pay down draws on the USD portion of the Revolving Credit Facility (as noted below). 
 In June 2024, we repaid our mortgage loan that encumbered our properties in The Netherlands and Luxembourg, which had a balance of 116.3 million as of March 31, 2024, using borrowings under the EUR portion of our Revolving Credit Facility.

 In June 2024, we repaid approximately 139.0 million of our Column Financial Mortgage Notes using net proceeds from the disposition of certain properties. 
 Credit Facility 
 As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, outstanding borrowings under our Revolving Credit Facility were 1.6 billion and 1.7 billion, respectively. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we made net additional paydowns of 192.4 million on the Revolving Credit Facility. As of September 30, 2024, approximately 125.4 million was available for future borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility. 
 In April 2024, we completed the CMBS Loan II financing and used the net proceeds to pay down draws on the USD portion of the Revolving Credit Facility. Also in April 2024, we repaid our mortgage loan that encumbered its McLaren properties in the United Kingdom (as noted above) using borrowings under the GBP portion of the Revolving Credit Facility. 
 The Credit Agreement requires payments of interest only prior to maturity. Borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility bear interest at a variable rate per annum based on an applicable margin that varies based on the ratio of consolidated total indebtedness to consolidated total asset value of us and our subsidiaries plus either (i) the Base Rate (as defined in the Credit Agreement) or (ii) the applicable Benchmark Rate (as defined in the Credit Facility) for the currency being borrowed. The applicable interest rate margin is based on a range from 0.30 to 0.90 per annum with respect to Base Rate borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility and 1.30 to 1.90 per annum with respect to Benchmark Rate borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility. These spreads reflect a reduction from the previous spreads. For Benchmark Rate Loans denominated in Dollars that bear interest calculated by reference to Term SOFR, there is an additional spread adjustment depending on the length of the interest period. In addition, (i) if we achieve an investment grade credit rating from at least two rating agencies, the OP can elect for the spread to be based on our credit rating, and (ii) the floor on the applicable Benchmark is 0 . As of September 30, 2024, the Revolving Credit Facility had a weighted-average effective interest rate of 5.8 after giving effect to interest rate swaps in place. 
 The Revolving Credit Facility matures on October 8, 2026, subject to our option, subject to customary conditions, to extend the maturity date by up to two additional six-month terms. Borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility may be prepaid at any time, in whole or in part, without premium or penalty, subject to customary breakage costs associated with borrowings for the applicable Benchmark Rate. 
 The Revolving Credit Facility requires us through the OP to pay an unused fee per annum of 0.25 of the unused balance of the Revolving Credit Facility if the unused balance exceeds or is equal to 50 of the total commitment or a fee per annum of 0.15 of the unused balance of the Revolving Credit Facility if the unused balance is less than 50 of the total commitment. From and after the time we obtain an investment grade credit rating, the unused fee will be replaced with a facility fee based on the total commitment under the Revolving Credit Facility multiplied by 0.30 , decreasing as our credit rating increases. 
 The availability of borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility is based on the value of a pool of eligible unencumbered real estate assets owned by us and compliance with various ratios related to those assets. Also, we have a 7.4 million letter of credit held by lenders which were put in place to cure cash trap sweep events under one of our mortgages (see Covenants Multi-Tenant Mortgage Loan III section below for additional information on this letter of credit). These letters of credit reduce the availability for future borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility. 
 Any future borrowings may, at our option be denominated in USD, EUR, CAD, GBP Norwegian Krone, Swedish Krona and Swiss Francs, provided that the total principal amount of non-USD loans cannot exceed the sum of the total revolving commitments minus 100.0 million. Amounts borrowed may not, however, be converted to, or repaid in, another currency once borrowed. 
 
 Covenants 
 As of September 30, 2024, we were in compliance with the covenants under the Indenture governing the 3.75 Senior Notes, the indenture governing the 4.50 Senior Notes and the Credit Agreement (see Note 6 Revolving Credit Facility and Note 7 Senior Notes, Net to our consolidated financial statements included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for further discussion on the Revolving Credit Facility and Senior Notes and the related covenants). 
 As of September 30, 2024, we were in compliance with all property-level debt covenants with the exception of four property-level debt instruments. For those four property-level debt instruments, we either (a) implemented a cure to the underlying noncompliance trigger by providing a letter of credit, or (b) permitted excess net cash flow after debt service from the impacted properties to become restricted, in each case in accordance with the terms of the applicable debt instrument. Each letter of credit, for so long as it is outstanding, represents a dollar-for-dollar reduction to availability for future borrowings under our Revolving Credit Facility. While the restricted cash cannot not be used for general corporate purposes, it is available to fund operations of the underlying assets. These matters did not have a material impact on our ability to operate the impacted assets.

 Non-GAAP Financial Measures 
 This section discusses the non-GAAP financial measures we use to evaluate our performance including Funds from Operations FFO ), Core Funds from Operations Core FFO and Adjusted Funds from Operations AFFO ). A description of these non-GAAP measures and reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP measure, which is net income, is provided below. 
 Use of Non-GAAP Measures 
 FFO, Core FFO, and AFFO should not be construed to be more relevant or accurate than the current GAAP methodology in calculating net income or in its applicability in evaluating our operating performance. The method utilized to evaluate the value and performance of real estate under GAAP should be construed as a more relevant measure of operational performance and considered more prominently than the non-GAAP FFO, Core FFO and AFFO measures. Other REITs may not define FFO in accordance with the current NAREIT (as defined below) definition (as we do), or may interpret the current NAREIT definition differently than we do, or may calculate Core FFO or AFFO differently than we do. Consequently, our presentation of FFO, Core FFO and AFFO may not be comparable to other similarly-titled measures presented by other REITs. 
 We consider FFO, Core FFO and AFFO useful indicators of our performance. Because FFO, Core FFO and AFFO calculations exclude such factors as depreciation and amortization of real estate assets and gain or loss from sales of operating real estate assets (which can vary among owners of identical assets in similar conditions based on historical cost accounting and useful-life estimates), FFO, Core FFO and AFFO presentations facilitate comparisons of operating performance between periods and between other REITs. 
 As a result, we believe that the use of FFO, Core FFO and AFFO, together with the required GAAP presentations, provide a more complete understanding of our operating performance including relative to our peers and a more informed and appropriate basis on which to make decisions involving operating, financing, and investing activities. However, FFO, Core FFO and AFFO are not indicative of cash available to fund ongoing cash needs, including the ability to make cash distributions. Investors are cautioned that FFO, Core FFO and AFFO should only be used to assess the sustainability of our operating performance excluding these activities, as they exclude certain costs that have a negative effect on our operating performance during the periods in which these costs are incurred. 
 Funds from Operations, Core Funds from Operations and Adjusted Funds from Operations 
 Funds from Operations 
 Due to certain unique operating characteristics of real estate companies, as discussed below, the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts NAREIT ), an industry trade group, has promulgated a measure known as FFO, which we believe to be an appropriate supplemental measure to reflect the operating performance of a REIT. FFO is not equivalent to net income or loss as determined under GAAP. 
 We calculate FFO, a non-GAAP measure, consistent with the standards established over time by the Board of Governors of NAREIT, as restated in a White Paper approved by the Board of Governors of NAREIT effective in December 2018 (the White Paper ). The White Paper defines FFO as net income or loss computed in accordance with GAAP, excluding depreciation and amortization related to real estate, gain and loss from the sale of certain real estate assets, gain and loss from change in control and impairment write-downs of certain real estate assets and investments in entities when the impairment is directly attributable to decreases in the value of depreciable real estate held by the entity. Our FFO calculation complies with NAREIT s definition. 
 The historical accounting convention used for real estate assets requires straight-line depreciation of buildings and improvements, and straight-line amortization of intangibles, which implies that the value of a real estate asset diminishes predictably over time. We believe that, because real estate values historically rise and fall with market conditions, including inflation, interest rates, unemployment and consumer spending, presentations of operating results for a REIT using historical accounting for depreciation and certain other items may be less informative. Historical accounting for real estate involves the use of GAAP. Any other method of accounting for real estate such as the fair value method cannot be construed to be any more accurate or relevant than the comparable methodologies of real estate valuation found in GAAP. Nevertheless, we believe that the use of FFO, which excludes the impact of real estate related depreciation and amortization, among other things, provides a more complete understanding of our performance to investors and to management, and, when compared year over year, reflects the impact on our operations from trends in occupancy rates, rental rates, operating costs, general and administrative expenses, and interest costs, which may not be immediately apparent from net income. 
 Core Funds from Operations 
 In calculating Core FFO, we start with FFO, then we exclude certain non-core items such as merger, transaction and other costs, settlement costs related to the Blackwells/Related Parties litigation (recorded in the second and third quarters of 2023), as well as certain other costs that are considered to be non-core, such as debt extinguishment costs. The purchase of properties, and the corresponding expenses associated with that process, is a key operational feature of our core business plan to generate 
 63 

Table of Contents 

 operational income and cash flows in order to make dividend payments to stockholders. In evaluating investments in real estate, we differentiate the costs to acquire the investment from the subsequent operations of the investment. We also add back non-cash write-offs of deferred financing costs and prepayment penalties incurred with the early extinguishment of debt which are included in net income but are considered financing cash flows when paid in the statement of cash flows. We consider these write-offs and prepayment penalties to be capital transactions and not indicative of operations. By excluding expensed acquisition, transaction and other costs as well as non-core costs, we believe Core FFO provides useful supplemental information that is comparable for each type of real estate investment and is consistent with management s analysis of the investing and operating performance of our properties. 
 Adjusted Funds from Operations 
 In calculating AFFO, we start with Core FFO, then we exclude certain income or expense items from AFFO that we consider more reflective of investing activities, other non-cash income and expense items and the income and expense effects of other activities or items, including items that were paid in cash that are not a fundamental attribute of our business plan or were one time or non-recurring items. These items include early extinguishment of debt and other items excluded in Core FFO as well as unrealized gain and loss, which may not ultimately be realized, such as gain or loss on derivative instruments, gain or loss on foreign currency transactions, and gain or loss on investments. In addition, by excluding non-cash income and expense items such as amortization of above-market and below-market leases intangibles, amortization of deferred financing costs, straight-line rent and equity-based compensation from AFFO, we believe we provide useful information regarding income and expense items which have a direct impact on our ongoing operating performance. We also exclude revenue attributable to the reimbursement by third parties of financing costs that we originally incurred because these revenues are not, in our view, related to operating performance. We also include the realized gain or loss on foreign currency exchange contracts for AFFO as such items are part of our ongoing operations and affect our current operating performance. 
 In calculating AFFO, we also exclude certain expenses which under GAAP are treated as operating expenses in determining operating net income. All paid and accrued acquisition, transaction and other costs (including prepayment penalties for debt extinguishments and merger related expenses) and certain other expenses, including expenses incurred for our 2023 proxy contest and related Blackwells/Related Parties litigation, expenses related to our European tax restructuring and transition costs related to the Mergers, negatively impact our operating performance during the period in which expenses are incurred or properties are acquired and will also have negative effects on returns to investors, but are not reflective of on-going performance. Further, under GAAP, certain contemplated non-cash fair value and other non-cash adjustments are considered operating non-cash adjustments to net income. In addition, as discussed above, we view gain and loss from fair value adjustments as items which are unrealized and may not ultimately be realized and not reflective of ongoing operations and are therefore typically adjusted for when assessing operating performance. Excluding income and expense items detailed above from our calculation of AFFO provides information consistent with management s analysis of our operating performance. Additionally, fair value adjustments, which are based on the impact of current market fluctuations and underlying assessments of general market conditions, but can also result from operational factors such as rental and occupancy rates, may not be directly related or attributable to our current operating performance. By excluding such changes that may reflect anticipated and unrealized gain or loss, we believe AFFO provides useful supplemental information. By providing AFFO, we believe we are presenting useful information that can be used to, among other things, assess our performance without the impact of transactions or other items that are not related to our portfolio of properties. AFFO presented by us may not be comparable to AFFO reported by other REITs that define AFFO differently. Furthermore, we believe that in order to facilitate a clear understanding of our operating results, AFFO should be examined in conjunction with net income (loss) calculated in accordance with GAAP as presented in our consolidated financial statements. AFFO should not be considered as an alternative to net income (loss) as an indication of our performance or to cash flows as a measure of our liquidity or ability to make distributions.

 _________ 
 (1) For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, these costs primarily consist of advisory, legal and other professional costs that were directly related to the REIT Merger and Internalization Merger. 
 (2) In the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, we recognized these settlement costs which include one-half of the reasonable, documented, out-of pocket expenses (including legal fees) incurred by the Blackwells/Related Parties in connection with the proxy contest and related litigation as well as expense for Common Stock issued to the Blackwells/Related Parties. 
 (3) For AFFO purposes, we adjust for unrealized gains and losses. For the three months ended September 30, 2024, the loss on derivative instruments was 4.7 million, which consisted of unrealized losses of 4.4 million and realized losses of 0.3 million. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the loss on derivative instruments was 2.6 million, which consisted of unrealized losses of 2.9 million and realized gains of 0.3 million. For the three months ended September 30, 2023, the gain on derivative instruments was 3.2 million, which consisted of unrealized gains of 1.9 million and realized gains of 1.3 million. For the nine months ended September 30, 2023, the gain on derivative instruments was 0.8 million, which consisted of unrealized losses of 2.3 million and realized gains of 3.1 million. 
 (4) Amounts relate to general and administrative expenses incurred for our 2023 proxy contest and related Blackwells/Related Parties litigation (as described herein). We do not consider these expenses to be part of our normal operating performance and have, accordingly, increased its AFFO for these amounts. 
 (5) Amounts relate to costs incurred related to the tax restructuring of our European entities. We do not consider these expenses to be part of our normal operating performance and have, accordingly, increased AFFO for these amounts. 
 (6) Amounts include costs related to (i) compensation incurred for our former Co-Chief Executive Officer who retired effective March 31, 2024; (ii) a transition service agreement with the former Advisor; and (iii) insurance premiums related to expiring directors and officers insurance of former RTL directors. We do not consider these expenses to be part of our normal operating performance and have, accordingly, increased AFFO for this amount. 
 (7) Represents a forfeited deposit from a potential buyer of one of our properties, which is recorded in other income in our consolidated statement of operations. We do not consider this income to be part of our normal operating performance and have, accordingly, decreased AFFO for this amount.

Dividends 
 The amount of dividends payable to our common stockholders is determined by our Board and is dependent on a number of factors, including funds available for dividends, our financial condition, provisions in our Credit Agreement or other agreements that may restrict our ability to pay dividends, capital expenditure requirements, as applicable, requirements of Maryland law and annual distribution requirements needed to maintain our status as a REIT. 
 On February 26, 2024, the Board approved a dividend policy that reduced our Common Stock dividend rate to an annual rate of 1.10 per share, or 0.275 per share on a quarterly basis. The new Common Stock dividend rate became effective with the Common Stock Dividend declared and paid in April 2024. The reduction of the dividend rate is expected to yield benefits to us, including increasing the amount of cash that may be used to lower leverage. 
 During each of the three months ended March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we paid dividends on our Common Stock at an annual rate of 1.42 per share, or 0.354 per share on a quarterly basis. During the first, second and third quarters of 2023, we paid dividends on our Common Stock at an annual rate of 1.60 per share or 0.40 per share on a quarterly basis. 
 Dividends authorized by the Board and declared by us are paid on a quarterly basis in arrears during the first month following the end of each fiscal quarter (unless otherwise specified) to common stockholders of record on the record date for such payment. Dividends accrue on our preferred stock as follows: 
 Dividends on our Series A Preferred Stock accrue in an amount equal to 0.453125 per share per quarter to Series A Preferred Stockholders, which is equivalent to 7.25 of the 25.00 liquidation preference per share of Series A Preferred Stock per annum. 
 Dividends on our Series B Preferred Stock accrue in an amount equal to 0.4296875 per share per quarter to Series B Preferred Stockholders, which is equivalent to 6.875 of the 25.00 liquidation preference per share of Series B Preferred Stock per annum. 
 Dividends on our Series D Preferred Stock accrue in an amount equal to 0.46875 per share per quarter to Series D Preferred Stockholders, which is equivalent to the rate of 7.50 of the 25.00 liquidation preference per share per annum. 
 Dividends on our Series E Preferred Stock accrue in an amount equal to 0.4609375 per share per quarter to Series E Preferred Stockholders, which is equivalent to the rate of 7.375 of the 25.00 liquidation preference per share per annum. 
 Dividends on the Series A Preferred Stock, Series B Preferred Stock, Series D Preferred Stock and Series E Preferred Stock are payable quarterly in arrears on the 15th day of January, April, July and October of each year (or, if not on a business day, on the next succeeding business day) to holders of record on the close of business on the record date set by our Board. Any accrued and unpaid dividends payable with respect to the Series A Preferred Stock and Series B Preferred Stock become part of the liquidation preference thereof. 
 Pursuant to the Credit Agreement, we may not pay distributions, including cash dividends on, or redeem or repurchase Common Stock, Series A Preferred Stock, Series B Preferred Stock, Series D Preferred Stock, Series E Preferred Stock, or any other class or series of stock we may issue in the future, that exceed 100 of our Adjusted FFO as defined in the Credit Facility (which is different from AFFO disclosed in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q) for any period of four consecutive fiscal quarters, except in limited circumstances, including that for one fiscal quarter in each calendar year, we may pay cash dividends and other distributions and redeem or repurchase an aggregate amount equal to no more than 105 of our Adjusted FFO. We last used the exception to pay dividends that were between 100 of Adjusted FFO and 105 of Adjusted FFO during the quarter ended on June 30, 2020, and may use this exception in the future. In the past, the lenders under our Revolving Credit Facility have consented to increase the maximum amount of our Adjusted FFO we may use to pay cash dividends and other distributions and make redemptions and other repurchases in certain periods, but there can be no assurance that they will do so again in the future.

 Foreign Currency Translation 
 Our reporting currency is the USD. The functional currency of our foreign investments is the applicable local currency for each foreign location in which we invest. Assets and liabilities in these foreign locations (including intercompany balances for which settlement is not anticipated in the foreseeable future) are translated at the spot rate in effect at the applicable reporting date. The amounts reported in the consolidated statements of operations are translated at the average exchange rates in effect during the applicable period. The resulting unrealized cumulative translation adjustment is recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income in the consolidated statements of changes in equity. We are exposed to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates on property investments in foreign countries which pay rental income, incur property related expenses and borrow in currencies other than our functional currency, the USD. We have used and may continue to use foreign currency derivatives including options, currency forward and cross currency swap agreements to manage our exposure to fluctuations in foreign GBP-USD and EUR-USD exchange rates see Note 9 Derivatives and Hedging Activities to the consolidated financial statements in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for further discussion). 
 
 Election as a REIT 
 We elected to be taxed as a REIT under Sections 856 through 860 of the Code, effective for our taxable year ended December 31, 2013. We believe that, commencing with such taxable year, we have been organized and have operated in a manner so that we qualify for taxation as a REIT under the Code. We intend to continue to operate in such a manner to qualify for taxation as a REIT, but can provide no assurances that we will operate in a manner so as to remain qualified as a REIT. To continue to qualify for taxation as a REIT, we must distribute annually at least 90 of our REIT taxable income (which does not equal net income as calculated in accordance with GAAP), determined without regard for the deduction for dividends paid and excluding net capital gains, and must comply with a number of other organizational and operational requirements. If we

 continue to qualify for taxation as a REIT, we generally will not be subject to federal corporate income tax on the portion of our REIT taxable income that we distribute to our stockholders. Even if we qualify for taxation as a REIT, we may be subject to certain state and local taxes on our income and properties, as well as federal income and excise taxes on our undistributed income. 
 In addition, our international assets and operations, including those owned through direct or indirect subsidiaries that are disregarded entities for U.S. federal income tax purposes, continue to be subject to taxation in the foreign jurisdictions where those assets are held or those operations are conducted. 
 
 Inflation 
 We may be adversely impacted by inflation on the leases that do not contain indexed escalation provisions, or those leases which have escalations at rates which do not exceed or approximate current inflation rates. As of September 30, 2024, the increase to the 12-month CPI for all items, as published by the Bureau of Labor Statistics, was 2.4 . To help mitigate the adverse impact of inflation, approximately 80.0 of our leases with our tenants contain rent escalation provisions that increase the cash rent that is due under these leases over time by an average cumulative increase of 1.3 per year. These provisions generally increase rental rates during the terms of the leases either at fixed rates or indexed escalations (based on the Consumer Price Index or other measures). As of September 30, 2024, based on straight-line rent, approximately 60.0 , are fixed-rate with increases averaging 1.7 , 15.3 are based on the Consumer Price Index, subject to certain caps, 4.6 are based on other measures, and 20.0 do not contain any escalation provisions. 
 In addition, we may be required to pay costs for maintenance and operation of properties which may adversely impact our results of operations due to potential increases in costs and operating expenses resulting from inflation. However, our net leases require the tenant to pay its allocable share of operating expenses, which may include common area maintenance costs, real estate taxes and insurance. This may reduce our exposure to increases in costs and operating expenses resulting from inflation. As the costs of general goods and services continue to rise, we may be adversely impacted by increases in general and administrative costs due to overall inflation. 
 
 Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk. 
 There has been no material change in our exposure to market risk during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. For a discussion of our exposure to market risk, refer to Item 7A, Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk, contained in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023. 
 
 Item 4. Controls and Procedures. 
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 In accordance with Rules 13a-15(b) and 15d-15(b) of the Exchange Act, we, under the supervision and with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, carried out an evaluation of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) and Rule 15d-15(e) of the Exchange Act) as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer determined that our disclosure controls and procedures are effective. 
 Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
 During the quarter ended September 30, 2024, there were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) of the Exchange Act) that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
