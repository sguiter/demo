Price ). The shares are traded on NYSE American. Simultaneous with the closing of the IPO, the Company acquired Fat Shark Holdings
Ltd. Fat Shark and Rotor Riot, LLC Rotor Riot from Red Cat Holdings, Inc. Red Cat (See
Note 3). 

. The Company s cash balance may at times exceed these limits. At September 30, 2024 and December
31, 2023, the Company had approximately million and million, respectively, in excess of federally insured limits. The Company
continually monitors its position with, and the credit quality of the financial institutions with which it invests. 

allowance for doubtful
accounts has been established. 

and during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 prior
to the IPO, respectively and the deferred offering costs were as of December 31, 2023. Deferred offering costs consist of primarily
legal, advisory, and consulting fees incurred in connection with the formation and preparation of the IPO. After consummation of the IPO,
total deferred offering costs of were recorded as a reduction to additional paid-in capital generated as a result of the offering. 

. 

and a right-of-use asset for the
same amount related to the lease in Orlando, FL. 

The Company determines if a contract is a lease
or contains a lease at inception. Operating lease liabilities are measured, on each reporting date, based on the present value of the
future minimum lease payments over the remaining lease term. The Company's leases do not provide an implicit rate. Therefore, the Company
used an effective discount rate of based on its last debt financings. Operating lease assets are measured by adjusting the lease
liability for lease incentives, initial direct costs incurred and asset impairments. Lease expense for minimum lease payments is recognized
on a straight-line basis over the lease term with the operating lease asset reduced by the amount of the expense. Lease terms may include
options to extend or terminate a lease when they are reasonably certain to occur. 

The fair value hierarchy gives the highest priority
to quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1) and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs (Level
3). The inputs used to measure fair value may fall into different levels of the fair value hierarchy. In such cases, the level in the
fair value hierarchy within which the fair value measurement in its entirety falls has been determined based on the lowest level input
that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety. The Company's assessment of the significance of a particular input
to the fair value measurement in its entirety requires judgment and considers factors specific to the asset or liability. 

The guidance establishes three levels of the fair
value hierarchy as follows: 

Level 1 : Inputs are unadjusted,
quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities at the measurement date; 

 Level 2 : Inputs are observable,
unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for similar assets or liabilities, unadjusted quoted prices for identical or similar assets
or liabilities in markets that are not active, or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for
substantially the full term of the related assets or liabilities; and 

 Level 3 : Unobservable inputs
that are significant to the measurement of the fair value of the assets or liabilities that are supported by little or no market data. 

The following table details the fair value measurements
of the Company s financial liabilities as of September 30, 2024:

For issued or modified warrants that meet all
of the criteria for equity classification, the warrants are required to be recorded as a component of equity at the time of issuance.
For issued or modified warrants that do not meet all the criteria for equity classification, the warrants are required to be recorded
as liabilities at their initial fair value on the date of issuance, and each balance sheet date thereafter. Changes in the estimated fair
value of the warrants classified as liabilities are recognized as a non-cash gain or loss in the consolidated statements of operations
and comprehensive loss. 

.0 million in cash and a cash deposit
of million made in 2022, (ii) issuance of a .0 million 18 month promissory note to Red Cat (see Note 8 Convertible Note 
for further details), and (iii) the issuance of shares of the Company s common stock, which represented approximately
48.66 of the outstanding common stock of the Company on February 16, 2024, after the effect of the issued shares (collectively the Consideration
Paid ). The Company valued the Red Cat common stock at per share which represents the IPO price of the Company s common
stock on February 15, 2024. Accordingly, the value of the Consideration Paid is equal to . 

The acquisitions met the definition of a business
combination under ASC 805, Business Combinations, and therefore the assets acquired, and liabilities assumed are accounted for at fair
value. The Company has not completed its evaluation of the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed of Fat Shark and Rotor
Riot for the purpose of its 2024 fiscal year financial reporting and as such has not fully determined the unallocated purchase price between
goodwill and other intangible assets. Such amounts are subject to adjustment during the one-year measurement period. 

The following represents the fair value allocation of Fat Shark and
Rotor Riot Purchase Price: 

Accounts receivable (approximates contractual value) 

Inventories (on hand and prepaid) 

Other current assets 

Right of use asset operating 

Other long-term assets 

Goodwill and intangible assets (unallocated purchase price) 

Total assets 

Accounts payable and accrued liabilities 

Customer deposits 

Operating lease liability current and long-term 

Total liabilities 

Total purchase price 

Initial goodwill and intangible assets relate
to Fat Shark and Rotor Riot being FPV market leaders and their well-known and established brands within the industry. Combining these
entities and their existing customer base along with Unusual Machines strategy of extending to B2B sales of drone components will
provide a strategic advantage. The Company will evaluate the amount of goodwill and intangibles that are expected to be deductible for
tax purposes once the unallocated purchase price is finalized. 

The results of Fat Shark and Rotor Riot have been
included in the Consolidated Financial Statements from the date of acquisition. The table below presents the results as reported by the
Company and unaudited pro forma results of the Company, assuming that the acquisition of Fat Shark and Rotor Riot at the beginning of
each period are as follows. The unaudited pro forma results are not necessarily indicative of what actually would have occurred had the

.0 million. In July 2024, the Company finalized its working capital adjustment with Red Cat which increased
the overall purchase price by an additional .0 million. In accordance with ASC 470, Debt, the additional .0 million was treated as
a modification that was not treated as a debt extinguishment and expenses related to the debt were expensed as incurred. The additional
 .0 million was added to the existing Note and was reflected as an adjustment to the opening purchase price and was included in the opening
balance sheet as of February 16, 2024 as an increase to goodwill and intangible assets. Accordingly, the Note was amended to increase
the principal amount of the Note to 4 .0 million. 

Subsequently and in July 2024, in conjunction
with a private sale of Red Cat s common stock and its promissory note to two accredited investors Investors ), the
Company issued new notes to the Investors (the July Notes and cancelled the original Note. The July Notes contained per annum interest. In addition, the maturity date of the July Notes was extended to , subject to certain conditions. 

On August 21, 2024, the Company entered into two
exchange agreements with the Investors, under which the Investors exchanged their respective July Notes for new Convertible Notes
(the August Notes ). 
The July Notes were cancelled as a part of the exchange agreement. In accordance with ASC 470, since the August Notes were considered
a greater than 10 change from the July Notes and a substantive conversion option was added to the August Notes, this exchange was treated
as a debt extinguishment. 

The August Notes bear interest at 
annually with interest payable monthly and the principal due on November 30, 2025. The August Notes are convertible into common
stock at a fixed per
share, except in the Event of Default as defined in the August Notes, which the conversion price for an Event of Default Conversion
is calculated at a 10 discount of the average three-day volume-weighted average price prior to the conversion date. The Company
recognized a loss on debt extinguishment of during
the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 related to the August Notes. The loss on extinguishment related to the August
Notes include fair
value related to the warrant liability issued, fair
value related to the optional conversion feature derivative liability of the remaining principal balance, and cash
fees paid for legal costs related to the August Notes. The Company used the binomial option pricing method for calculating the
derivative fair value related to the warrants and optional conversion feature (see Note 9 Derivative Liabilities).

obligations including a fundamental transaction provision that may require a cash payment to the holder upon a triggering event, that

 shares of common stock issued to the underwriters as partial compensation for services rendered in connection with the IPO, which

warrants using a Black-Scholes valuation model but has not completed this workflow. Any change to the fair value of the warrants would
have no change to the Company s financial statements since the value of the warrants would only impact the offering costs 
and thus entry would be to adjust Additional Paid-In Capital Common Stock and Additional Paid-In Capital
 Warrants . The warrants are exercisable for common stock at a price of per share (125 of the IPO Price) at any time
beginning on August 15, 2024 through and including February 16, 2029, the expiration date.

The Company engaged a new, an independent and
registered accounting firm, to re-audit the Company s previously issued financial statements. During the Company s re-audits,
it was noted that certain transactions were not recorded in the correct period, stock compensation expense of 600,000 related to the
March 7, 2023 common stock issuance was not recorded and deferred offering costs were classified as an operating activity rather than
a financing activity. Expenses totaling 10,993 were originally recorded in 2023 but related to 2022 expenses. 

With this restatement, the transactions previously
recorded in the incorrect period have been updated to the correct period, classifications on the statements of cash flow have been corrected
and the stock compensation previously not recorded has been properly recorded.

Series C preferred shares. In addition, the increase in general and administrative expenses related to closing the initial public
offering (the IPO and the increased operations and sales and marketing expenses we incurred since the acquisition
from Fat Shark and Rotor Riot. This was partially offset by generating gross margin related to the revenue and cost of goods sold
from sales for Fat Shark and Rotor Riot. In the fourth quarter of 2024 we expect to complete our valuation and
identification of any intangible assets related to the acquisitions of Fat Shark and Rotor Riot. For any identified intangibles, we will
begin to amortize during the fourth quarter which will result in a non-cash charge going forward. However, and until we complete our valuation
on intangibles, the amount is uncertain, and the future amortization may or may not be material. After the identification and valuation
of intangibles is complete, we will complete our impairment analysis on goodwill and the identified intangibles during the fourth quarter.

that our goodwill impairment could be material. 

Cash Flow Analysis 

Prior to the closing
of our IPO and the acquisitions of Fat Shark and Rotor Riot, we did not have any cash inflows from operations and all cash outflows related
to our activities related to our IPO. Our future cash flows from operating activities will be significantly impacted by revenues received,
our investment in sales and marketing to drive growth, and general and administrative expenses related to operating a public company.
Our ability to meet future liquidity needs will be driven by our operating performance and the extent of continued investment in our
operations. Failure to generate sufficient revenues and related cash flows could have a material adverse effect on our ability to meet
our liquidity needs and achieve our business objectives. 

Operating Activities 

Net cash used in operating activities was 2,718,513
during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to net cash used in operating activities of 1,382,538 during the nine months
ended September 30, 2023, representing an increase of 1,335,975 or 97 . This increase in net cash used primarily resulted from our increase
in net loss of 2,895,614 and an increase in prepaid expenses of 319,532, accounts receivable of 73,109, other assets of 62,850, offset
by a decrease in inventory of 337,562, an increase in accounts payable and accrued expenses of 681,414, other liabilities of 153,020
and non-cash expenses of 1,378,790. 

Investing Activities 

Net cash used in investing activities was 852,801
during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to net cash used in investing activities of 3,164 during the nine months ended
September 30, 2023, representing an increase of 849,637. This increase in net cash used related to the 1,000,000 we paid to purchase
Fat Shark and Rotor Riot, offset by 147,199 in cash acquired as compared to 3,164 used for purchase of computer equipment during 2023. 

Financing Activities 

Net cash provided by financing activities totaled
 4,362,313 during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to net cash used in financing activities of 376,702 during the
nine months ended September 30, 2023, resulting in an increase in net cash provided by financing activities of 4,739,015. The increase
primarily relates to proceeds received from our IPO of 5,000,000, offset by change in deferred offering costs and other IPO related
expenses of 260,985.

Liquidity and Capital
Resources 

As of September 30, 2024, we had current assets
totaling 4,517,325 primarily consisting of cash balances of 1,685,772, inventory of 1,453,042 and prepaid deposits for inventory of
 1,140,511. Our current liabilities as of September 30, 2024 totaled 2,018,255, primarily consisting of accounts payable and accrued
expenses of 1,032,637 and customer deposits and other current liabilities of 985,618. Our net working capital as of September 30, 2024
was 2,499,070. 

On October 29, 2024, we completed a private placement
offering for the sale of 1,286,184 shares of common stock at a price of 1.52 per share for aggregate gross proceeds of 1.95 million
before deducting fees to the placement agent and other expenses payable by us in connection with the private placement. We retained approximately
 1.7 million in net proceeds. 

As of November 13, 2024, we have approximately
 2.4 million in cash. We believe that the net proceeds from our 2024 financings and revenues, October 2024 private placement and existing
cash balances will be sufficient to fund our current operating plans through at least the next 12 months. We have based these estimates,
however, on assumptions that may prove to be wrong, and we could spend our available financial resources much faster than we currently
expect and need to raise additional funds sooner than we anticipate. We do not anticipate any significant cost increases post the Fat
Shark and Rotor Riot acquisitions and with consideration of the combined companies net low and cash position, we expect we will
have sufficient working capital to support our operations for at least 12 months. 

As described in Note 8 of our financial statements,
we issued the August Notes following our agreement with Red Cat on the Working Capital Adjustment. Once the August Notes mature in November
2025, we will need to either (a) raise additional capital, (b) refinance the August Notes, (c) seek an extension of the maturity date
of the Notes, or (d) explore the conversion or exchange of the New Notes into equity, which will result in dilution to our shareholders,
if the August Notes have not been converted or paid in full prior to the maturity date. If we are unable to raise capital or explore such
other options when needed or on acceptable terms, we may default under the obligation pursuant to the New Notes, or be forced to delay,
reduce or eliminate certain operational efforts. 

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 

Our financial statements and accompanying notes
have been prepared in accordance with GAAP applied on a consistent basis. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with
GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure
of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during
the reporting periods. 

We regularly evaluate the accounting policies
and estimates that we use to prepare our financial statements. A complete summary of these policies is included in the notes to our financial
statements. In general, management s estimates are based on historical experience, on information from third party professionals,
and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the facts and circumstances. Actual results could differ from
those estimates made by management. 

Fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in business
combination 

The Fat Shark and Rotor Riot acquisitions are
accounted for as a business combination under ASC 805. We recognized the assets acquired and liabilities assumed at fair value as of
the date of acquisition. We have not yet completed our evaluation of the fair value for determining the unallocated purchase price between
goodwill and other intangible assets. Such amounts are subject to adjustment during the one-year measurement period. The fair value will
be determined based on assumptions used in valuations and estimates determined by management, which are subjective. 

33 

Impairment of goodwill and long-lived assets 

Goodwill represents the future economic benefit
arising from other assets acquired in an acquisition that are not individually identified and separately recognized. Goodwill represents
costs in excess of fair values assigned to the underlying identifiable net assets of acquired businesses. Intangible assets from acquired
business are recognized at fair value on the acquisition date. We are continuing our evaluation of the fair value of the assets acquired
and liabilities assumed from the Fat Shark and Rotor Riot acquisition, and we have not yet determined the unallocated purchase price
between goodwill and other intangible assets. Goodwill is tested for impairment at least annually at the reporting unit level or whenever
events or changes in circumstances indicate that goodwill might be impaired. 

Valuation of Inventory 

Our policy for valuation of inventory requires
us to evaluate the net realizable value of our inventory using various reference measures including current product selling prices, as
well as evaluating for excess quantities and obsolescence. We may be required to record inventory write-downs if actual inventory values
are less favorable than those estimates by management. 

Stock Based Compensation 

Certain employees and directors have received
grants of restricted common shares in our company. Other employees received grants of stock options in our Company. These awards are accounted
for in accordance with guidance prescribed for accounting for equity-based compensation. Based on this guidance and the terms of the awards,
the awards are equity classified. 

The fair value of restricted stock awards is based
on the fair value of the Company s common stock on the date of grant and expensed over the vesting period. 

The fair value of each stock option award is determined
using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model which values options based on the stock price at the grant date, the expected life of the
option, the estimated volatility of the stock, and the risk-free interest rate over the expected life of the option. The expected volatility
was determined considering comparable companies historical stock prices as a peer group for the fiscal year the grant occurred and prior
fiscal years for a period equal to the expected life of the option. The risk-free interest rate was the rate available from the St. Louis
Federal Reserve Bank with a term equal to the expected life of the option. The expected life of the option was estimated based on a mid-point
method calculation. 

In addition, the Company issued shares of our
common stock in 2023 to consultants for services performed. Prior to our IPO in February 2024, we were a private company with no active
public market for our common stock. Therefore, we have periodically determined the overall value of our company and the estimated per
share fair value of our common equity at their various dates and valuations based on a per share valuation using the private funding
transactions as an estimate. These values and estimates are subjective. 

Warrant Classification and Fair Value 

The Company classifies warrants issued for the
purchase of shares of its common stock as either equity or liability instruments based on an assessment of the specific terms and conditions
of each respective contract. The assessment considers whether the warrants are freestanding financial instruments or embedded in a host
instrument, whether the warrants meet the definition of a liability pursuant to ASC 480, whether the warrants meet the definition of
a derivative under ASC 815, and whether the warrants meet all of the requirements for equity classification under ASC 815. This assessment,
which requires the use of professional judgment, is conducted at the time of warrant issuance and as of each subsequent quarterly period
end date while the warrants are outstanding. 

For issued or modified warrants that meet all
of the criteria for equity classification, the warrants are required to be recorded as a component of equity at the time of issuance.
For issued or modified warrants that do not meet all the criteria for equity classification, the warrants are required to be recorded
as liabilities at their fair value. The fair value of the warrant liability is determined using the binomial option pricing model the
binomial option pricing model which values the liability on the stock price at the grant date, the estimate volatility of the stock, the
expected term until exercise, the risk-free interest rate over the expected term, certain estimates and probabilities of different outcomes. 

34 

Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements

The Company has implemented all new accounting pronouncements that
are in effect. These pronouncements did not have any material impact on the financial statements unless otherwise disclosed, and the
Company does not believe that there are any other new accounting pronouncements that have been issued that might have a material impact
on its financial position or results of operations. 

Item 3. 
 Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about
 Market Risk 

We are a smaller reporting company as
defined by Rule 12b-2 of the Exchange Act and are not required to provide the information required under this item. 

Item 4. 
 Controls and Procedures 

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

We carried out an evaluation, under the supervision
and with the participation of our management, including our Principal Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer, of the effectiveness
of our disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the Exchange
Act as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based on that evaluation, our Principal Executive Officer and Principal
Financial Officer have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures as of September 30, 2024, were not effective to ensure that
information required to be disclosed by us in reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized,
and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms because of a material weakness in the Company s
internal control over financial reporting. Specifically, the Company did not maintain effective controls, segregation of duties, and
procedures to support the identification of, accounting for, and the evaluation and disclosure of certain transactions, as limited individuals,
either the Principal Executive Officer or Principal Financial Officer, initiates all transactions and they also review, evaluate, and
approve these same transactions. 

Changes in Internal Control Over Financial
Reporting 

During the nine months ended September 30, 2024,
we have: 

Continued to strengthen our internal policies,
 processes, and reviews, including drafting of related documentation thereof; 

Engaged outside consultants to ensure that
 appropriate level of knowledge and experience is applied based on the risk and complexity of the transactions and tasks under review;

Hired additional accounting staff to provide
 additional segregation of duties within accounting functions; 

Started internal control documentation along
 with the engagement of outside consultants to assist in the design, implementation, and documentation of internal controls to address
 relevant risks; 

Implemented the initial phase of an ERP
 and financial accounting system and added additional systematic internal controls and timely recording of transactions. We will continue
 to build out and expand the functionality of our ERP system and build in additional automation and controls. 

The process of implementing an effective financial
reporting system is a continuous effort that requires us to anticipate and react to changes in our business and the economic and regulatory
environments and to expend significant resources to maintain a financial reporting system that is adequate to satisfy our reporting obligations.
As we continue to evaluate and take actions to improve our internal control over financial reporting, we may take additional actions
to address control deficiencies or modify certain of the remediation measures described above. 

While progress has been made to enhance our internal
control over financial reporting, we are still in the process of implementing these processes, procedures and controls. Additional time
is required to complete implementation and to assess and ensure the sustainability of these procedures. There have been no changes in
our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) of the Exchange Act) during the nine months
ended September 30, 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial
reporting, other than the activities described above.

PART II OTHER INFORMATION 

Item 1. 
 Legal Proceedings 

From time to time, we may become involved in

Item 2. 
 Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use

Use of Proceeds 

On February 13, 2024, the SEC declared effective
our registration statement on Form S-1 (File No. 333-270519), as amended, filed in connection with our IPO. On February 16, 2024, we
closed our IPO in which we sold 1,250,000 shares of our common stock, par value 0.01 per share (the Shares at a public
offering price of 4.00 per share, resulting in net proceeds of 4.5 million after deducting offering costs, underwriting discounts,
and other commissions. We incurred and paid additional direct offering costs prior to the close of the IPO of 0.1 million during the
nine months ended September 30, 2024, and 0.5 million during the year ended December 31, 2023. We used 1.0 million of proceeds to pay
for the acquisition of Fat Shark and Rotor Riot. 

There has been no material change in the planned
use of proceeds from our IPO from that described in the prospectus dated February 16, 2024, filed with the SEC pursuant to Rule 424(b)(1)
under the Securities Act. As described in such prospectus, we have used IPO proceeds to pay 1.0 million to Red Cat related to the business
combination and acquisition of Fat Shark and Rotor Riot and the remaining amount will be used for working capital and general corporate
purposes. 

The Company shall use the net proceeds from the
sale of the securities issued in the October 2024 private placement for general corporate purposes (which for the avoidance of doubt
may include acquisitions, in the Company s discretion), including working capital.
