the trading price of Registrant as of the date of the Merger. Due to the change in control, the accounting acquirer in the merger is BioRegenx,
Inc., a private Nevada Corporation pursuant to Financial Accounting Standards Board s Accounting Standard Codification (ASC) Topic
805. This acquired company is accounted for as an acquisition and the activities of the acquired company are included in the consolidated
financial statements starting with the acquisition. Assets and liabilities are reported at the purchase price allocated to the relative
fair market value. The financial information reported before the merger date is that of the accounting acquirer, with adjustments to capital
accounts and share amounts to reflect the surviving company s legal capital structure. The name of the publicly traded company was

The Consolidated Financial Statements

As a result, management has concluded that there is substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going
concern. Our independent registered public accounting firm, in its report on our consolidated financial statements for the year
ended December 31, 2023, has also expressed substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. The accompanying
consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification of recorded
assets, or the amounts and classification of liabilities that might be necessary in the event the company cannot continue as a going
concern. 

The continuation of the Company as a
going concern is dependent upon its ability to obtain necessary debt or equity financing to continue operations until it begins generating
positive cash flow. No assurance can be given that any future financing will be available or, if available, that it will be on terms that
are satisfactory to the Company. Even if the Company is able to obtain additional financing, it may contain undue restrictions on our
operations, in the case of debt financing or cause substantial dilution for our stockholders, in case of equity financing.

a fair value of 9,990 were paid to each lender. The amounts recorded are net of discounts of 19,376 each consisting of the original
discount and fair value of shares issued. 

(E) EIDL Notes 

The principal amount of economic injury disaster
loans (EIDL) issued under the Small Business Administration s COVID-19 recovery program was 550,000 and 350,000 at March 31, 2024
and December 31, 2023, respectively. At March 31,2024, the long term balance of the EIDL loans was 150,000 and the current balance for
delinquent loans was 400,000. The total balance is comprised of three notes made by subsidiaries of the Company, secured by the assets
of the Company. One of which was acquired in the merger with Findit, inc. and is in charge off status at the SBA. The Findit EIDL loan
and the other 200,000 subsidiary loan are in default and shown as current liabilities. Each loan has a 30-year term and an interest rate
of 3.75 per annum. The SBA granted a total of thirty months payment deferment period under the EIDL program for Covid-19 related loans,
both EIDL loans qualified for and used the full deferment period. Interest continued to accrue during the deferment period and the deferred
amounts will be paid as a balloon payment at the end of the 30 year amortization period. Current payments are being applied against interest
accrued. The notes maturity dates are May 17, 2050 for a 150,000 note, July 12, 2051 for a 200,000 subsidiary note and July 17, 2050
for the Findit EIDL loan. 

(F) The other loan does not have stated terms.

Going Concern 

The accompanying consolidated financial statements
have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, which contemplates the
continuation of the Company as a going concern. 

The Company has generated recurring losses from
operations and cash flow deficits from its operations since inception and has had to raise funds through equity offerings or borrowings
to continue operating. These factors raise substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. As reflected
in the accompanying financial statements, during the quarter ended March 31, 2024, the Company incurred a net loss of ,3,152,458, used
cash in operations of 104,250 and had a working capital deficit of 2,899,223 as of that date. In addition, 522,500 of notes
payable were in default. At March 31, 2024, the Company had cash on hand in the amount of 114,158. As a result, management has concluded
that there is substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. Our independent registered public accounting
firm, in its report on our consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2023, has also expressed substantial doubt
about our ability to continue as a going concern. The accompanying consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments relating
to the recoverability and classification of recorded assets, or the amounts and classification of liabilities that might be necessary
in the event the company cannot continue as a going concern. 

The continuation of the Company as a going concern
is dependent upon its ability to obtain necessary debt or equity financing to continue operations until it begins generating positive
cash flow. No assurance can be given that any future financing will be available or, if available, that it will be on terms that are satisfactory
to the Company. Even if the Company is able to obtain additional financing, it may contain undue restrictions on our operations, in the
case of debt financing or cause substantial dilution for our stockholders, in case of equity financing. 

Significant changes in the number of
employees 

We currently have a total of ten employees. We
are dependent upon our officers for our future business development. As our operations expand, we anticipate the need to hire additional
employees, consultants and professionals; however, the exact number is not quantifiable at this time. 

33 

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 

As of March 31, 2024, and as of the date of
this Quarterly Report, we do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future
effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures
or capital resources that are material to investors. 

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 

Revenue Recognition: The Company recognizes revenue
related to product sales when (I) persuasive evidence of the arrangement exists, (ii) shipment has occurred, (iii) the fee is fixed or
determinable, and (iv) collectability is reasonably assured. 

Recent Pronouncements 

The Company's management has evaluated all the
recently issued accounting pronouncements through the filing date of these financial statements and does not believe that any of these
pronouncements will have a material impact on the Company's current financial position and results of operations. 

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market
Risk 

Not required for smaller reporting company. 

Item 4. Controls and Procedures 

Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

Disclosure controls and procedures are designed
to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized
and reported, within the time period specified in the SEC s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated
to management, including the CEO and CFO, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures. Our management necessarily
applied its judgment in assessing the costs and benefits of such controls and procedures, which, by their nature, can provide only reasonable
assurance regarding management s control objectives. 

Our management, with the participation of our
CEO, evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of the period ended March 31,
2024. Based upon this evaluation, our CEO concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective because of the identification
material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting as described below. 

Management s Report on Internal
Control Over Financial Reporting 

Our management is responsible for establishing
and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Exchange Rule 13a-15(f). Our internal control
over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance to our management and board of directors regarding
the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of the financial statements for external purposes in accordance with U.S. GAAP. 

Our internal control over financial reporting
includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly
reflect the transactions and dispositions of our assets; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary
to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP and our receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance
with authorizations of our management and directors; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of
unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of our assets that could have a material effect on our financial statements. 

Because of its inherent limitations, internal
control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. All internal control systems, no matter how well designed, have
inherent limitations, including the possibility of human error and the circumvention of overriding controls. Accordingly, even effective
internal control over financial reporting can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation. Also,
projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of
changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. 

34 

Our management assessed the effectiveness of our
internal control over financial reporting as of March 31, 2024. In making this assessment, it used the criteria set forth by the Committee
of Sponsoring Organizations of the Tread way Commission COSO in Internal Control-Integrated Framework (2013). Based on
this evaluation, management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was not effective as of March 31, 2024. Our management
concluded we have the following material weaknesses . A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of control deficiencies,
in internal control over financial reporting such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of our annual or
interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. 

Ineffective Control Environment. The Company did not maintain
an effective control environment, which is the foundation necessary for effective internal control over financial reporting. Specifically,
the Company (i) did not maintain a functioning independent audit committee; (ii) did not have its Board of Directors review and approve
significant transactions; (iii) had an insufficient number of personnel appropriately qualified to perform control design, execution and
monitoring activities; (iv) had an insufficient number of personnel with an appropriate level of U.S. GAAP knowledge and experience and
ongoing training in the application of U.S. GAAP and SEC disclosure requirements commensurate with the Company s financial reporting
requirements; (v) had inadequate segregation of duties consistent with control objectives; and (vi) lack of written documentation of the
Company s key internal control policies and procedures over financial reporting. The Company is required under Section 404 of the
Sarbanes-Oxley Act to have written documentation of key internal controls over financial reporting. The Company did not formally document
policies and controls to enable management and other personnel to understand and carry out their internal control responsibilities including
the lack of closing checklists, budget-to-actual analyses, balance sheet variation analysis, and pro-forma financial statements. Additionally,
the Company did not have an adequate process in place to complete its testing and assessment of the design and operating effectiveness
of internal control over financial reporting in a timely manner; 

Ineffective controls over financial statement close and reporting
process. The Company did not maintain effective controls over its financial statement close and reporting process. Specifically,
the Company: (i) had insufficient preparation and review procedures for disclosures accompanying the Company s financial statements;
and (ii) did not provide reasonable assurance that accounts were complete and accurate and agreed to detailed support and that reconciliations
of accounts were properly performed, reviewed and approved; and 

Insufficient segregation of duties in our finance and accounting
functions due to limited personnel. We do not have sufficient segregation of duties within accounting functions. During the period
ended March 31, 2024, we had limited personnel that performed nearly all aspects of our financial reporting process, including, but not
limited to, access to the underlying accounting records and systems, the ability to post and record journal entries and responsibility
for the preparation of the financial statements. Due to the fact that these duties were often performed by the same person, this creates
a lack of review over the financial reporting process that would likely result in a failure to detect errors in spreadsheets, calculations,
or assumptions used to compile the financial statements and related disclosures as filed with the SEC. These control deficiencies could
result in a material misstatement to our interim or annual financial statements that would not be prevented or detected. 

As of the date of this report, our remediation efforts continue related
to each of the material weaknesses that we have identified in our internal control over financial reporting, and additional time and resources
will be required in order to fully address these material weaknesses. We have not been able to complete all actions necessary and test
the remediated controls in a manner that would enable us to conclude that such controls are effective. We are committed to implementing
the necessary controls to remediate the material weaknesses described below as our resources permit. These material weaknesses will not
be considered remediated until (1) the new processes are designed, appropriately controlled and implemented for a sufficient period of
time and (2) we have sufficient evidence that the new processes and related controls are operating effectively. 

We do not expect that our disclosure controls
and procedures will prevent all errors and all instances of fraud. Disclosure controls and procedures, no matter how well conceived and
operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the disclosure controls and procedures are met.
Further, the design of disclosure controls and procedures must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits
must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all disclosure controls and procedures, no evaluation
of disclosure controls and procedures can provide absolute assurance that we have detected all our control deficiencies and instances
of fraud, if any. The design of disclosure controls and procedures also is based partly on certain assumptions about the likelihood of
future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions. 

Changes in Internal Control Over Financial
Reporting 

During the quarter ended March 31, 2024, there
were no changes in our internal controls over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act)
that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 

35 

PART II - OTHER INFORMATION 

Item 1. Legal Proceedings 

We are not currently involved in any pending
legal proceeding or litigation and, to the best of our knowledge, no governmental authority is contemplating any proceeding to which
we are a party or to which any of our properties is subject, which would reasonably be likely to have a material adverse effect on us. 

We are involved in disputes with certain parties,
including parties that are former officers and board members and vendors associated with their activities. Such disputes arise from time
to time in the ordinary course of conducting business. While assurance cannot be given as to the outcome of these disputes, management
does not currently believe that any of these matters, individually or in the aggregate are estimable or probable and is therefore unable
to represent whether they would have a material adverse effect on the Company s financial condition, liquidity or results of operations.

with a fair value of 19,351 issued under the offer. The offer was closed in January 2024. For accounting purposes, the Company considered
the fair value of the shares and options issued in the aggregate amount of 22,200 as a reduction to deferred revenue and reduced returns
reserves by 19,351 at March 31, 2024.
