 Our fixed-income investments consist of predominantly investment grade corporate debt securities and government and agency securities. The corporate debt and government and agency securities that we invest in are generally deemed to be low risk based on their credit ratings from major rating agencies. 
 
 The longer the duration of these securities, the more susceptible they are to changes in market interest rates and bond yields. As interest rates increase, securities purchased at a lower yield show a mark-to-market unrealized loss. The unrealized losses are primarily due to changes in credit spreads and interest rates. We regularly review investment securities for other-than-temporary impairment using both qualitative and quantitative criteria. Investments classified as available-for-sale debt securities are carried at fair value with changes reflected in other comprehensive income. Where there is an intention or a requirement to sell an impaired available-for-sale debt security, the entire impairment is recognized in earnings with a corresponding adjustment to the amortized cost basis of the security. From time to time, we sell available-for-sale debt securities in an unrealized loss position and recognize an immaterial loss.

 in Adevinta valued at billion at the close of the transfer. In the fourth quarter of 2021, we completed the sale of approximately million of our voting shares in Adevinta to Permira, inclusive of the option exercised by Permira to purchase additional voting shares, for total cash consideration of approximately billion, which reduced our ownership in Adevinta to . 
 
 At the initial recognition of this equity investment in Adevinta, we elected the fair value option where subsequent changes in fair value are recognized in Gain (loss) on equity investments and warrant, net in the condensed consolidated statement of income. The investment was reported within the Current assets section in our condensed consolidated balance sheet and was classified within Level 1 in the fair value hierarchy. Refer to Note 7 Fair Value Measurement of Assets and Liabilities for more information. The fair value of the investment was million as of December 31, 2023. 
 
 On May 29, 2024, we completed the previously announced sale of (1) million Adevinta shares to Aurelia BidCo 1 Norway AS in exchange for approximately billion in cash and (2) million Adevinta shares to Aurelia Netherlands TopCo B.V. Aurelia in exchange for the issuance of million shares of the new entity, Aurelia (collectively, the Transactions valued at billion and representing approximately ownership of the outstanding equity of Aurelia as of the date of the Transactions. The equity investment in Aurelia is accounted for under the measurement alternative as we are not able to exercise significant influence based on the governance structure defined in the terms of the Transaction Completion Agreement and the Aurelia Shareholder Agreement. Refer to "Equity investments without readily determinable fair values below for additional information. 
 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, an unrealized loss of million and a realized gain on sale of million were recorded in Gain (loss) on equity investments and warrant, net on our condensed consolidated statement of income related to the sale of the investment in Adevinta. 
 
 In connection with the Transactions, during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 we reduced Deferred tax liabilities by million and increased Income taxes payable by million on our condensed consolidated balance sheet related to the taxable gain on disposition of Adevinta shares. 
 
 For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, unrealized gains of million and million, respectively, were recorded in Gain (loss) on equity investments and warrant, net on our condensed consolidated statement of income related to the change in fair value of the investment in Adevinta. 
 
 Other equity investments under the fair value option 
 
 Equity investment in Gmarket 
 
 In 2021, we completed the sale of of the outstanding equity interests of eBay Korea to Emart. Upon completion of the sale, we retained of the outstanding equity interest of the new entity, Gmarket, over whom we are able to exercise significant influence based on the terms of the securities purchase agreement, including through our board representation. Our equity investment in Gmarket was valued at million as of the transaction close date. 
 
 At the initial recognition of this equity investment, we elected the fair value option where subsequent changes in fair value are recognized in Gain (loss) on equity investments and warrant, net in the condensed consolidated statement of income. The investment is reported within Long-term investments in our condensed consolidated balance sheet and is classified within Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy as the valuation reflects management s estimate of assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the equity investment. We believe the fair value option election creates more transparency of the current value in the equity investment in Gmarket. Refer to Note 7 Fair Value Measurement of Assets and Liabilities for more information.

 million and unrealized losses of million, respectively, related to the change in fair value of the investment were recorded in Gain (loss) on equity investments and warrant, net on our condensed consolidated statement of income compared to million and million of unrealized losses recorded during the same periods in 2023. The fair value of the investment was million and million as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. 
 
 Other investments 
 
 Certain other individually immaterial equity investments aggregating to million as of September 30, 2024 and million as of December 31, 2023 are measured at fair value using the net asset value per share (or its equivalent) practical expedient, and have not been classified in the fair value hierarchy. Refer to Note 7 Fair Value Measurement of Assets and Liabilities for more information. 
 
 Equity investments without readily determinable fair values 
 
 Equity investments without readily determinable fair values are non-marketable equity securities, which are investments in privately-held companies for which we do not exercise significant influence and are accounted for under the measurement alternative. Under the measurement alternative, the carrying value is measured at cost minus impairment, if any, plus or minus changes resulting from observable price changes in orderly transactions for the identical or a similar investment of the same issuer. Changes in value and impairments of equity investments without readily determinable fair values are recognized in Gain (loss) on equity investments and warrant, net in our condensed consolidated statement of income. Equity investments without readily determinable fair values are presented within Long-term investments in our condensed consolidated balance sheet. 
 
 Equity investment in Aurelia 
 
 As discussed in the Equity Investment in Adevinta section above, our equity investment in Aurelia is accounted for under the measurement alternative as we are not able to exercise significant influence over Aurelia. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, upward or downward adjustments to the carrying value of our equity investment in Aurelia were recorded. The carrying value of the investment was billion as of September 30, 2024. 
 
 In connection with the Transactions discussed above, we also granted Aurelia UK Feederco Limited a option to purchase Aurelia shares (the "Aurelia Option"), which, if exercised, would reduce our ownership in Aurelia to approximately of the outstanding equity of Aurelia. The Aurelia Option is reported within the Current liabilities section in our condensed consolidated balance sheet and is classified within Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy as the valuation reflects management s estimate of assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the equity investment. The Aurelia Option was valued at million as of September 30, 2024. Refer to Note 7 Fair Value Measurement of Assets and Liabilities for more information. 
 
 Other equity investments without readily determinable fair values 
 
 For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, we recorded additions of million and million compared to additions during the same periods in 2023. The change in value of our other equity method investments without readily determinable fair values for each of the three and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was immaterial both individually and in the aggregate. 
 
 Other equity method investments 
 
 We account for certain other individually immaterial equity investments through which we exercise significant influence but do not have control over the investee under the equity method. Our consolidated results of operations include, as a component of Interest income and other, net , our share of the net income or loss of the equity investments. Equity method investments are presented within Long-term investments in our condensed consolidated balance sheet. Our share of the net income or loss of equity method investments for each of the three and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was immaterial both individually and in the aggregate.

The objective of the foreign exchange contracts is to ensure that ultimately the U.S. dollar-equivalent cash flows are not adversely affected by changes in the applicable U.S. dollar/foreign currency exchange rate. We evaluate the effectiveness of our foreign exchange contracts designated as cash flow or net investment hedges on a quarterly basis. 
 
 Cash Flow Hedges 
 
 For derivative instruments that are designated as cash flow hedges, the derivative s gain or loss is initially reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income AOCI and subsequently reclassified into earnings in the same period the forecasted hedged transaction affects earnings. Derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges must be de-designated as hedges when it is probable the forecasted hedged transaction will not occur in the initially identified time period or within a subsequent two-month time period. Unrealized gains and losses in AOCI associated with such derivative instruments are immediately reclassified into earnings. As of September 30, 2024, we have estimated that approximately million of net derivative losses related to our foreign exchange cash flow hedges and million of net derivative gains related to our interest rate cash flow hedges included in AOCI will be reclassified into earnings within the next 12 months. We classify cash flows related to our cash flow hedges as operating activities in our condensed consolidated statement of cash flows. 
 
 Non-Designated Hedges 
 
 Our derivatives not designated as hedging instruments consist of foreign currency forward contracts that we primarily use to hedge monetary assets or liabilities, including intercompany balances and equity investments denominated in non-functional currencies. The gains and losses on our derivatives not designated as hedging instruments are recorded in Interest income and other, net , which are offset by the foreign currency gains and losses on the related assets and liabilities that are also recorded in Interest income and other, net . We classify cash flows related to our non-designated hedging instruments in the same line item as the cash flows of the related assets or liabilities, which is generally within operating activities in our condensed consolidated statement of cash flows. Cash flows related to the settlement of non-designated hedging instruments related to equity investments are classified within investing activities in our condensed consolidated statement of cash flows. 
 
 Warrant 
 
 We entered into a warrant agreement in conjunction with a commercial agreement with Adyen N.V. Adyen that, subject to meeting certain conditions, entitles us to acquire a fixed number of shares up to of Adyen s fully diluted issued and outstanding share capital at a specific date. The warrant has a term of and vests in a series of tranches, at a specified price per share (fixed for the first tranches) upon meeting processing volume milestone targets on a calendar year basis. When or if a relevant milestone is reached, the warrant becomes exercisable with respect to the corresponding tranche of warrant shares up until the warrant expiration date of January 31, 2025. The maximum number of tranches that can vest in one calendar year is . 
 
 The warrant is accounted for as a derivative under ASC Topic 815, Derivatives and Hedging . We report the warrant at fair value within Other current assets in our condensed consolidated balance sheet and changes in the fair value of the warrant are recognized in Gain (loss) on equity investments and warrant, net in our condensed consolidated statement of income. The day-one value attributable to the other side of the warrant, which was recorded as a deferred credit, is reported within Other liabilities in our condensed consolidated balance sheet and is amortized over the life of the commercial arrangement. See Note 7 Fair Value Measurement of Assets and Liabilities for information about the fair value measurement of the warrant.

Our financial assets and liabilities are valued using market prices on both active markets (Level 1), less active markets (Level 2) and little or no market activity (Level 3). Level 1 instrument valuations are obtained from real-time quotes for transactions in active exchange markets involving identical assets. Level 2 instrument valuations are obtained from readily available pricing sources for comparable instruments, identical instruments in less active markets, or models using market observable inputs. Level 3 instrument valuations typically reflect management s estimate of assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability. We did not have any transfers of financial instruments between valuation levels during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 
 
 Other financial instruments, including accounts receivable, funds receivable, accounts payable and funds payable, are carried at cost, which approximates their fair value because of the short-term nature of these instruments.

 Fair value measurement of Aurelia Option 
 
 In connection with the Transactions discussed in Note 5 Investments , we granted Aurelia UK Feederco Limited the Aurelia Option, which, if exercised, would reduce our ownership in Aurelia to approximately of the outstanding equity of Aurelia. The Aurelia Option is valued using a Black-Scholes model where key inputs and assumptions used in the valuation include risk-free interest rates, the common stock price as of September 30, 2024, equity volatility, exercise price, and details specific to the Aurelia Option. The Aurelia Option is reported within the Current liabilities section in our condensed consolidated balance sheet and is classified within Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy as the valuation reflects management s estimate of assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the equity investment.

 ITEM 2: MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 
 
 You should read the following Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in conjunction with the condensed consolidated financial statements and the related notes included in this report. This section of this Form 10-Q generally discusses items relating to the three and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 and comparisons between the respective periods. 

OVERVIEW 
 
 Unless otherwise expressly stated or the context otherwise requires, when we refer to we, our, us, eBay or the Company in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, we mean eBay Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries. 
 
 Business 
 
 eBay Inc. is a global commerce leader that connects people and builds communities to create economic opportunity for all. Our technology empowers millions of buyers and sellers in more than 190 markets around the world, providing everyone the opportunity to grow and thrive. Our Marketplace platforms, including our online marketplace located at www.ebay.com and its localized counterparts, our off-platform businesses in Japan and the United States, and our suite of mobile apps, together, create one of the world's largest and most vibrant marketplaces for discovering great value and unique selection. 
 
 In 2023 and through the third quarter of 2024, we experienced dynamic discretionary spending trends resulting from geopolitical events, inflationary pressure, foreign exchange rate volatility, elevated interest rates and lower consumer confidence. These trends are uncertain in duration and are expected to continue. In addition, our operating and financial results may continue to fluctuate as a result of changes in the legal and regulatory landscape and our response to those developments. 
 
 FX-Neutral Presentation 
 
 We present foreign exchange neutral FX-Neutral net revenues to supplement our results of operations presented in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles GAAP and to enhance investors understanding of our global business performance by excluding the positive or negative year-over-year impact of foreign currency movements on reported net revenues. We define FX-Neutral net revenues as GAAP net revenues minus the exchange rate effect, which we calculate by applying prior period foreign currency exchange rates to current year transactional currency amounts, excluding hedging activity. We believe presenting FX-Neutral net revenues provides useful information to both management and investors by isolating the effects of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations that may not be indicative of our core operating results. In addition, because we have historically reported certain FX-Neutral results to investors, we believe that the inclusion of these FX-Neutral measures provides consistency in our financial reporting. FX-Neutral net revenues are non-GAAP financial measures that are not based on any comprehensive set of accounting rules or principles and may be calculated differently than other FX-Neutral, constant currency or similarly titled measures used by other companies. FX-Neutral net revenues are not presented as an alternative to GAAP net revenues and should only be used to evaluate our results of operations in conjunction with GAAP net revenues.

 Quarter Highlights 
 
 Net revenues increased 3 to 2,576 million during the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023.

Operating margin increased to 23.1 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 18.2 for the same period in 2023. 
 
 We recorded 199 million of aggregate gains in gain (loss) on equity investments and warrant, net on our condensed consolidated statement of income during the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 1,212 million of aggregate gains recorded during the same period in 2023. 
 
 We generated cash flow from continuing operating activities of 755 million during the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 862 million in the same period in 2023. 
 
 During the three months ended September 30, 2024, we made cash payments of 755 million related to the purchase of common stock and 131 million in dividends. 
 
 In October 2024, our Board of Directors (our Board declared a quarterly cash dividend of 0.27 per share of common stock to be paid on December 13, 2024 to stockholders of record as of November 29, 2024. 
 
 In August 2024, we repaid the 750 million aggregate principal amount of our previously outstanding 3.450 senior notes on the date of maturity. As of September 30, 2024, we had 450 million of commercial paper notes outstanding with a weighted average interest rate of 5.09 per annum, and a weighted average remaining term of 114 days. 
 
 On October 15, 2024, we met the processing volume milestone target to vest the second tranche of the Adyen warrant. Upon vesting of the second tranche, we exercised the option to purchase approximately 404 thousand shares of Adyen valued at 630 million on the settlement date of October 30, 2024 in exchange for 108 million in cash.

 Three Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 Change 2024 2023 Change U.S. 1,302 1,259 3 3,897 3,785 3 Percentage of net revenues 51 50 51 50 International 1,274 1,241 3 3,807 3,765 1 Percentage of net revenues 49 50 49 50 Total net revenues (1)(2) 
 2,576 2,500 3 7,704 7,550 2 
 (1) Net revenues included 11 million and 31 million of hedging losses during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, compared to 2 million and 45 million of hedging gains during the same periods in 2023. 
 (2) Foreign currency movements relative to the U.S. dollar had unfavorable impacts of 6 million and 3 million on net revenues during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, compared to a favorable impact of 43 million and an unfavorable impact of 11 million during the same periods in 2023. The effect of foreign currency exchange rate movements during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same periods in 2023 was primarily attributable to the strengthening of the U.S. dollar against the euro and other major currencies. 
 
 Our commerce platforms operate globally, resulting in certain revenues that are denominated in foreign currencies, primarily the British pound and euro. Year-over-year appreciation or depreciation of the U.S. dollar may have a material impact to our financial results. We experienced elevated foreign currency volatility which we expect to continue throughout 2024. Through our hedging programs, we actively monitor foreign currency volatility and attempt to mitigate significant risk. As shown in the table above, we generate approximately half of our net revenues internationally. Therefore, we are subject to the risks related to conducting business in foreign countries as discussed in Part I Item 1A: Risk Factors of the 2023 Form 10-K. 
 
 Key Operating Metrics 
 
 Gross Merchandise Volume GMV and take rate are significant factors that we believe affect our net revenues. 
 
 GMV consists of the total value of all paid transactions between users on our platforms during the applicable period inclusive of shipping fees and taxes. Despite GMV s divergence from revenue, we still believe that GMV provides a useful measure of the overall volume of paid transactions that flow through our platforms in a given period. 
 
 FX-Neutral GMV is defined as GMV minus the exchange rate effect, which we calculate by applying prior period foreign currency exchange rates to current year transactional currency amounts. 
 
 Take rate is defined as net revenues divided by GMV and represents net revenues as a percentage of overall volume on our platforms. We believe that take rate provides a useful measure of our ability to monetize volume through marketplace services on our platforms in a given period. We use take rate to identify key revenue drivers on our marketplace.

 The following table presents net revenues and our key operating metrics of GMV and take rate for the periods indicated. The following table also presents a reconciliation of FX-Neutral net revenues and FX-Neutral GMV (each as defined above) to our reported net revenues and GMV for the periods indicated (in millions, except percentages):

 (1) Net revenues included 11 million and 31 million of hedging losses during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, compared to 2 million and 45 million of hedging gains during the same periods in 2023. 

During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, the increase in net revenues was primarily due to higher GMV and the expansion of promoted listings products, eBay International Shipping and financial services offered to buyers and sellers within our payments platform. Net revenues and GMV increased despite the impact of dynamic discretionary spending trends resulting from geopolitical events, inflationary pressure, foreign exchange rate volatility, elevated interest rates and lower consumer confidence. 
 
 Cost of Net Revenues 
 
 Cost of net revenues represents costs associated with customer support, site operations and payment processing. Significant components of these costs primarily consist of employee compensation (including stock-based compensation), contractor costs, facilities costs, depreciation of equipment and amortization expense, bank transaction fees, credit card interchange and assessment fees, authentication costs, shipping costs and digital services tax. The following table presents cost of net revenues for the periods indicated (in millions, except percentages):

 depreciation expense due to the change in our estimate of the useful lives for our servers and networking equipment. 
 
 The increase in cost of net revenues during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023 was primarily due to a 50 million increase related to indirect tax matters, a 41 million increase in cost of promoted listings products, a 30 million increase related to eBay International Shipping and an 11 million disposition of data center equipment, partially offset by a 57 million decrease in depreciation expense due to the change in our estimate of the useful lives for our servers and networking equipment and a 36 million decrease in payment processing costs driven by rate improvements. 

Operating Expenses 
 
 The following table presents operating expenses for the periods indicated (in millions, except percentages):

 (2) Foreign currency movements relative to the U.S. dollar had an unfavorable impact of 1 million and a favorable impact of 2 million on operating expenses during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, compared to an unfavorable impact of 8 million and a favorable impact of 33 million during the same periods in 2023. 
 
 Sales and Marketing 
 
 Sales and marketing expenses primarily consist of advertising and marketing program costs (both online and offline), employee compensation (including stock-based compensation), certain user coupons and rewards, contractor costs, facilities costs and depreciation on equipment. Online marketing expenses represent traffic acquisition costs in various channels such as paid search, affiliates marketing and display advertising. Offline advertising primarily includes brand campaigns and buyer/seller communications. 
 
 The increase in sales and marketing expenses during the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023 was primarily due to a 31 million increase in online and offline marketing program costs inclusive of user coupons, partially offset by an 11 million decrease in employee-related costs. 
 
 The increase in sales and marketing expenses during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023 was primarily due to a 118 million increase in online and offline marketing program costs inclusive of user coupons, partially offset by a 48 million decrease in employee-related costs. 
 
 Product Development 
 
 Product development expenses primarily consist of employee compensation (including stock-based compensation), contractor costs, facilities costs and depreciation on equipment. Product development expenses are net of required capitalization of major platform and other product development efforts, including the development and maintenance of our technology platform. Our top technology priorities include improving seller tools and buyer experiences across our platforms powered by intelligent computing at scale.

Table of Contents 

 The decrease in product development expenses during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same periods in 2023 was primarily due to a decrease in employee-related costs. While employee costs are decreasing, we continue to invest in strategic areas such as browsing experience, search optimization and providing relevant recommendations to enhance the experience for our customers around the world. 
 
 Capitalized internal use and platform development costs were 27 million and 84 million during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, compared to 28 million and 86 million during the same periods in 2023. These costs are primarily reflected as a cost of net revenues when amortized in future periods. 
 
 General and Administrative 
 
 General and administrative expenses primarily consist of employee compensation (including stock-based compensation), contractor costs, facilities costs, depreciation of equipment, legal expenses, restructuring, insurance premiums and professional fees. Our legal expenses, including those related to various ongoing legal proceedings, may fluctuate substantially from period to period. 
 
 The decrease in general and administrative expenses during the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023 was primarily due to a 50 million legal accrual release during the third quarter of 2024 compared to a 50 million increase in the legal accrual recorded during the third quarter of 2023, partially offset by a 10 million contribution to the eBay Foundation during the third quarter of 2024. See Note 10 Commitments and Contingencies to the condensed consolidated financial statements included in this report for additional details regarding our legal matters. 
 
 The decrease in general and administrative expenses during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023 was primarily due to a 50 million legal accrual release during the third quarter of 2024 compared to a 50 million increase in the legal accrual recorded during the third quarter of 2023 and a 52 million decrease in one-time restructuring costs. See Note 10 Commitments and Contingencies and Note 15 Restructuring to the condensed consolidated financial statements included in this report for additional details regarding our legal matters and the restructuring, respectively. 
 
 Provision for Transaction Losses 
 
 Provision for transaction losses primarily consists of transaction loss expense associated with our buyer protection programs, losses from our managed payments services, fraud and bad debt expense. We expect our provision for transaction losses to fluctuate depending on many factors, including changes to our protection programs and the impact of regulatory changes. 
 
 The increase in provision for transaction losses during each of the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023 was primarily due to a prior year recovery that did not reoccur in the current periods.

 Gain (loss) on equity investments and warrant, net 
 
 Gain (loss) on equity investments and warrant, net primarily consists of gains and losses related to our various types of equity investments, including our equity investments in Adevinta ASA Adevinta and Gmarket Global LLC Gmarket ), and gains and losses due to changes in fair value of the warrant received from Adyen N.V. Adyen and the Aurelia Option (as defined in Note 5 Investments ).

 The change in gain (loss) on equity investments and warrant, net during the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023 was primarily driven by the change in the fair value of our equity investments and the warrant as well as the change in fair value of the Aurelia Option. 
 
 The change in gain (loss) on equity investments and warrant, net during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023 was primarily driven by the change in the fair value of our equity investments and the warrant as well as the realized gain from the sale of shares in Adevinta and the related fair value of the Aurelia Option. See Note 5 Investments to the condensed consolidated financial statements included in this report for more information on the Adevinta Transactions and the Aurelia Option. 
 
 Interest Expense, Interest Income and Other, Net 
 
 Interest expense primarily consists of interest charges on amounts borrowed, commitment fees on unborrowed amounts under our credit agreement and interest expense on our outstanding debt securities and commercial paper, if any. Interest income and other, net primarily consists of interest earned on cash, cash equivalents and investments, gains and losses on foreign exchange transactions and transaction costs on acquisitions. The following table presents interest expense and interest income and other, net for the periods indicated (in millions, except percentages):

 Interest expense decreased during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, primarily due to a lower average notional amount of outstanding debt compared to the same periods in 2023. 
 
 Interest income increased during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same periods in 2023, primarily due to higher yields on interest bearing instruments. 

Income Tax Provision 
 
 The following table presents provision for income taxes for the periods indicated (in millions, except percentages): 
 Three Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 2024 2023 Income tax provision 
 161 355 360 629 Effective tax rate 20.2 21.4 21.7 23.5 
 
 The decrease in our effective tax rate for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same periods in 2023 was primarily due to the excess tax benefits on stock-based compensation. 
 
 In addition, the decrease in our effective tax rate for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023 was also due to the non-recurring increase in reserves for uncertain tax positions in 2023. 
 
 We are regularly under examination by tax authorities both domestically and internationally. We believe that adequate amounts have been reserved for any adjustments that may ultimately result from these examinations, although there are inherent uncertainties in these examinations. Due to the ongoing tax examinations, it is generally impractical to determine the amount and timing of these adjustments. However, we expect several tax examinations to close within the next 12 months. See Note 13 Income Taxes to the condensed consolidated financial statements included in this report for more information on estimated settlements within the next 12 months.

 (4) Net increase in cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash (121) 737 
 
 Continuing Operating Activities 
 
 Our operating cash flows arise primarily from cash received from our customers on our platforms offset by cash payments for sales and marketing, employee compensation and payment processing expenses. 
 
 Cash provided by continuing operating activities of 1.7 billion in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to cash provided by continuing operating activities of 2.3 billion in the nine months ended September 30, 2023 was primarily attributable to working capital movements and changes in non-cash items during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023. 
 
 Continuing Investing Activities 
 
 Cash provided by continuing investing activities of 951 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily attributable to proceeds of 10.4 billion from the maturities and sales of investments and proceeds of 2.4 billion from the sale of our equity investment in Adevinta, partially offset by cash paid for investments of 11.5 billion and property and equipment of 341 million. 
 
 The largely offsetting effects of purchases of investments and maturities and sale of investments results from the management of our investments. As our immediate cash needs change, purchase and sale activity will fluctuate. 
 
 Continuing Financing Activities 
 
 Cash used in continuing financing activities of 2.8 billion in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily attributable to cash paid to repurchase 2.2 billion of common stock, repayment of the 750 million aggregate principal amount of our previously outstanding 3.450 senior notes and 405 million paid in cash dividends, partially offset by borrowings under our commercial paper program of 441 million. 
 
 The positive effect of exchange rate movements on cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash was due to the weakening of the U.S. dollar against other currencies during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the 2023 year-end rate.

 Liquidity and Capital Resource Requirements 
 
 As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we had assets classified as cash and cash equivalents as well as short-term and long-term non-equity investments, in an aggregate amount of 5.8 billion and 5.1 billion, respectively. These amounts do not include cash held on behalf of customers related to marketplace activity of 679 million and 481 million, respectively, which are recorded separately within customer accounts and funds receivable with a corresponding liability within customer accounts and funds payable in our condensed consolidated balance sheet. These amounts also do not include restricted cash held for purposes of safeguarding customer funds of 104 million and 27 million, respectively. We believe these assets together with cash expected to be generated from operations, borrowings available under our credit agreement and commercial paper program, and our access to capital markets, will be sufficient to satisfy our material cash requirements over the next 12 months and for the foreseeable future. 
 
 However, geopolitical events, inflationary pressure, foreign exchange rate volatility, elevated interest rates and global economic uncertainty have caused material disruptions in both U.S. and international financial markets and economies and are uncertain in duration. The impact of these events has increased, and may continue to increase, our borrowing costs and other costs of capital and otherwise adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and liquidity. The future impact of these events cannot be predicted with certainty and we cannot assure that we will have access to external financing at times and on terms we consider acceptable, or at all, or that we will not experience other liquidity issues going forward. 
 
 We have certain fixed contractual obligations and commitments that include future estimated payments for general operating purposes. Changes in our business needs, contractual cancellation provisions, fluctuating interest rates, and other factors may result in actual payments differing from the estimates. We cannot provide certainty regarding the timing and amounts of these payments. The following sections summarizes our fixed contractual obligations and commitments. 
 
 Senior Notes 
 
 On August 1, 2024, we repaid the 750 million aggregate principal amount of our previously outstanding 3.450 senior notes on the date of maturity. 
 
 In January 2023, we repaid the 1.2 billion aggregate principal amount of the floating rate and 2.750 senior notes due 2023 on the date of maturity. 
 
 As of September 30, 2024, we had fixed-rate senior notes outstanding with an aggregate principal amount of 7.0 billion, with 800 million payable within 12 months. The net proceeds from the issuances of these senior notes are used for general corporate purposes, including, among other things, capital expenditures, share repurchases, repayment of indebtedness and possible acquisitions. 
 
 Commercial Paper 
 
 We have a commercial paper program pursuant to which we may issue commercial paper notes in an aggregate principal amount at maturity of up to 1.5 billion outstanding at any time with maturities of up to 397 days from the date of issue. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, we issued and repaid 180 million of commercial paper notes with original maturities less than 90 days and issued 450 million of commercial paper notes with original maturities greater than 90 days. As of September 30, 2024, we had 450 million of commercial paper notes outstanding with a weighted average interest rate of 5.09 per annum, and a weighted average remaining term of 114 days. 
 
 Credit Agreement 
 
 In March 2020, we entered into a credit agreement that provides for an unsecured 2.0 billion five-year credit facility (the Prior Credit Agreement ). 

52 

Table of Contents 

 In January 2024, we terminated the Prior Credit Agreement and entered into a new credit agreement (the Credit Agreement that provides for an unsecured 2.0 billion five-year revolving credit facility. We may also, subject to the agreement of the applicable lenders, increase the commitments under the revolving credit facility by up to 1.0 billion. Funds borrowed under the Credit Agreement may be used for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions and other general corporate purposes and will bear interest at either (i) a customary forward-looking term rate based on the secured overnight financing rate published by CME Group for the relevant interest period plus an adjustment of 0.1 or (ii) a customary base rate formula, plus a margin (based on our public debt ratings) ranging from 0 to 0.375 . The covenants of the Credit Agreement are discussed in Note 8 Debt to the condensed consolidated financial statements included in this report. As of September 30, 2024, we had 450 million of commercial paper notes outstanding; therefore, 1.6 billion of borrowing capacity was available for other purposes permitted by the Credit Agreement. 
 
 Income Taxes 
 
 The timing of the resolution and/or closure of audits is highly uncertain. Given the number of years remaining subject to examination and the number of matters being examined, we are unable to estimate the full range of possible adjustments to the balance of gross unrecognized tax benefits. We expect the gross amount of unrecognized tax benefits to be reduced within the next 12 months by at least 170 million. 
 
 As of September 30, 2024, our assets classified as cash and cash equivalents as well as short-term and long-term non-equity investments included assets held in certain of our foreign operations totaling approximately 1.8 billion. As we repatriate these funds to the United States, we will be required to pay income taxes in certain U.S. states and applicable foreign withholding taxes on those amounts during the period when such repatriation occurs. We have accrued deferred taxes for the tax effect of repatriating the funds to the United States. For additional details related to our income taxes, please see Income Tax Provision in our Results of Operations above and Note 13 Income Taxes to the condensed consolidated financial statements included in this report. 
 
 Stock Repurchases 
 
 Our stock repurchase programs are intended to programmatically offset the impact of dilution from our equity compensation programs and, subject to market conditions and other factors, to make opportunistic and programmatic repurchases of our common stock to reduce our outstanding share count. Any share repurchases under our stock repurchase programs will be funded from our working capital or other financing alternatives. 
 
 We expect to continue making opportunistic and programmatic repurchases of our common stock, subject to market conditions and other uncertainties. However, our stock repurchase programs may be limited or terminated at any time without prior notice. The timing and actual number of shares repurchased will depend on a variety of factors, including corporate and regulatory requirements, price and other market conditions and management s determination as to the appropriate use of our cash. 
 
 In February 2024, our Board authorized an incremental 2.0 billion under our stock repurchase program in addition to the 4.0 billion previously authorized in 2022. The stock repurchase program has no expiration from the date of authorization. 
 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we repurchased approximately 2.2 billion of our common stock under our stock repurchase program. As of September 30, 2024, a total of approximately 1.2 billion remained available for future repurchases of our common stock . See Note 11 Stockholders Equity to the condensed consolidated financial statements included in this report for more information about our stock repurchase program. 
 
 Dividends 
 
 The Company paid a total of 131 million and 132 million in cash dividends during the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and 405 million and 399 million in cash dividends during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. In October 2024, our Board declared a cash dividend of 0.27 per share of common stock to be paid on December 13, 2024 to stockholders of record as of November 29, 2024.

Other Capital Resource Requirements 
 
 We actively monitor all counterparties that hold our cash and cash equivalents and non-equity investments, focusing primarily on the safety of principal and secondarily on improving yield on these assets. We diversify our cash and cash equivalents and investments among various counterparties in order to reduce our exposure should any one of these counterparties fail or encounter difficulties. To date, we have not experienced any material loss or lack of access to our invested cash, cash equivalents or short-term investments; however, we can provide no assurances that access to our invested cash, cash equivalents or short-term investments will not be impacted by adverse conditions in the financial markets, including, without limitation, as a result of the impact of geopolitical events, inflationary pressure, lower consumer spending and foreign exchange rate volatility. At any point in time, we have funds in our operating accounts and customer accounts that are deposited and invested with third party financial institutions. We have entered into various indemnification agreements and, in the ordinary course of business, we have included limited indemnification provisions in certain of our agreements with parties with which we have commercial relations. It is not possible to determine the maximum potential loss under these various indemnification provisions due to our limited history of prior indemnification claims and the unique facts and circumstances involved in each particular provision. To date, losses recorded in our consolidated statement of income in connection with our indemnification provisions have not been significant, either individually or collectively. See Note 10 Commitments and Contingencies to the condensed consolidated financial statements included in this report for more information about our indemnification provisions.

 Item 3: Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 
 
 Interest Rate Risk 
 
 We are exposed to interest rate risk relating to our investments and outstanding debt. In addition, adverse economic conditions and events (including volatility or distress in the equity and/or debt or credit markets) may impact regional and global financial markets. These events and conditions could cause us to write down our assets or investments. We seek to reduce earnings volatility that may result from adverse economic conditions and events or changes in interest rates. 
 
 The primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal while at the same time improving yields without significantly increasing risk. To achieve this objective, we maintain our cash equivalents, customer accounts and short-term and long-term investments in a variety of asset types, including bank deposits, government bonds and corporate debt securities. As of September 30, 2024, approximately 25 of our total cash and investments was held in cash and cash equivalents and customer accounts. As such, changes in interest rates will impact interest income. As discussed below, the fair market values of our fixed-rate securities may be adversely affected due to a rise in interest rates, and we may suffer losses in principal if we are forced to sell securities that have declined in market value due to changes in interest rates. 
 
 As of September 30, 2024, the balance of our corporate debt and government bond securities was 4.3 billion, which represented approximately 47 of our total cash and investments. Investments in both fixed-rate and floating-rate interest-earning instruments carry varying degrees of interest rate risk. The fair market value of our fixed-rate investment securities may be adversely impacted due to a rise in interest rates. In general, fixed-rate securities with longer maturities are subject to greater interest rate risk than those with shorter maturities. While floating rate securities generally are subject to less interest rate risk than fixed-rate securities, floating-rate securities may produce less income than expected if interest rates decrease and may also suffer a decline in market value if interest rates increase. Due in part to these factors, our investment income may fall short of expectations or we may suffer losses in principal if we sell securities that have declined in market value due to changes in interest rates. A hypothetical 1 (100 basis point) increase in interest rates would have resulted in a decrease in the fair value of our investments of 25 million and 20 million as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. 
 
 Further changes in interest rates will impact interest expense on any borrowings under our revolving credit facility, which bear interest at floating rates, and the interest rate on any commercial paper borrowings we make and any debt securities we may issue in the future and, accordingly, will impact interest expense. For additional details related to our debt, see Note 8 Debt to the condensed consolidated financial statements included in this report. 
 
 Equity Price Risk 
 
 Equity investments 
 
 Our equity investments are primarily investments in privately-held companies. Our consolidated results of operations include, as a component of gain (loss) on equity investments and warrant, net, our share of the net income or loss of the equity investments accounted for under the equity method of accounting, or the change in fair value of the equity method investments accounted for under the fair value option. Equity investments without readily determinable fair values are accounted for at cost, less impairment and adjusted for subsequent observable price changes obtained from orderly transactions for identical or similar investments issued by the same investee. Such changes in the basis of the equity investment are recognized in gain (loss) on equity investments and warrant, net. Equity investments under the fair value option are measured at fair value based on a quarterly valuation analysis and are classified within Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy as the valuation reflects management s estimate of assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the equity investment. S ubsequent changes in fair value are recognized in gain (loss) on equity investments and warrant, net. 
 
 As of September 30, 2024, our equity investments totaled 2.5 billion, which represented approximately 27 of our total cash and investments. 
 
 For additional details related to these investments, please see Note 5 Investments to our condensed consolidated financial statements included in this report.

 Warrant 
 
 We entered into a warrant agreement in conjunction with a commercial agreement with Adyen that, subject to meeting certain conditions, entitles us to acquire a fixed number of shares up to 5 of Adyen s fully diluted issued and outstanding share capital at a specific date. As discussed in Note 6 Derivative Instruments to our condensed consolidated financial statements included in this report, in 2021 we met the processing volume milestone target to vest the first tranche of the warrant, and we exercised the option to purchase shares of Adyen. The remaining tranches of the warrant are accounted for as a derivative instrument under ASC Topic 815, Derivatives and Hedging . Changes in Adyen s common stock price and equity volatility may have a significant impact on the value of the warrant. As of September 30, 2024, a hypothetical one dollar change in the fair value of one share of Adyen s common stock, holding other factors constant, would have increased or decreased the fair value of the warrant by approximately 0.4 million. For additional details related to the warrant, please see Note 6 Derivative Instruments to our condensed consolidated financial statements included in this report. 
 
 On October 15, 2024, we met the processing volume milestone target to vest the second tranche of the Adyen warrant. Upon vesting of the second tranche, we exercised the option to purchase approximately 404 thousand shares of Adyen valued at 630 million on the settlement date of October 30, 2024 in exchange for 108 million in cash. 
 
 Foreign Currency Risk 
 
 Our commerce platforms operate globally, resulting in certain revenues and costs that are denominated in foreign currencies, primarily the British pound and euro, subjecting us to foreign currency risk, which may adversely impact our financial results. We transact business in various foreign currencies and have significant international revenues as well as costs. In addition, we charge our international subsidiaries for their use of intellectual property and technology and for certain corporate services we provide. Our cash flow and results of operations that are exposed to foreign exchange rate fluctuations may differ materially from expectations and we may record significant gains or losses due to foreign currency fluctuations and related hedging activities. 
 
 We have a foreign exchange exposure management program designed to identify material foreign currency exposures, manage these exposures and reduce the potential effects of currency fluctuations on our reported consolidated cash flows and results of operations through the purchase of foreign currency exchange contracts. The effectiveness of the program and resulting usage of foreign exchange derivative contracts is at times limited by our ability to achieve cash flow hedge accounting. For additional details related to our derivative instruments, please see Note 6 Derivative Instruments to our condensed consolidated financial statements included in this report. 
 
 We use foreign exchange derivative contracts to help protect our forecasted U.S. dollar-equivalent earnings from adverse changes in foreign currency exchange rates. These hedging contracts reduce, but do not entirely eliminate, the impact of adverse currency exchange rate movements. Most of these contracts are designated as cash flow hedges for accounting purposes. For qualifying cash flow hedges, the derivative s gain or loss is initially reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income and subsequently reclassified into earnings in the same period the forecasted transaction affects earnings. For contracts not designated as cash flow hedges for accounting purposes, the derivative s gain or loss is recognized immediately in earnings in our consolidated statement of income. However, only certain revenue and costs are eligible for cash flow hedge accounting. 
 
 The following table illustrates the fair values of outstanding foreign exchange contracts designated as cash flow hedges and foreign exchange contracts not designated for hedge accounting and the before-tax effect on fair values of a hypothetical adverse change in the foreign exchange rates that existed as of September 30, 2024. The sensitivity for foreign currency contracts is based on a 20 adverse change in foreign exchange rates, against relevant functional currencies.

Table of Contents 

 Since our risk management programs are highly effective, the potential loss in value described above would be largely offset by changes in the value of the underlying exposure. 
 
 We also use foreign exchange contracts to offset the foreign exchange risk on our assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of our subsidiaries. These contracts reduce, but do not entirely eliminate, the impact of currency exchange rate movements on our assets and liabilities. The foreign currency gains and losses on the assets and liabilities are recorded in interest income and other, net, which are offset by the gains and losses on the foreign exchange contracts. 
 
 We considered the historical trends in currency exchange rates and determined that it was reasonably possible that adverse changes in exchange rates of 20 for all currencies could be experienced in the near term. These changes would have resulted in an immaterial adverse impact on income before income taxes as of September 30, 2024 taking into consideration the offsetting effect of foreign exchange forwards in place as of September 30, 2024.

 Item 4: Controls and Procedures 
 
 (a) Evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures. Based on the evaluation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the Exchange Act) required by Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(b) or 15d-15(b), our principal executive officer and our principal financial officer have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of September 30, 2024. 
 
 (b) Changes in internal controls. There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(f)) identified in connection with the evaluation required by Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(d) or 15d-15(d) that occurred during our most recently completed fiscal quarter that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

 Item 1: Legal Proceedings 
 
 The information set forth under Note 10 Commitments and Contingencies Litigation and Other Legal Matters to the condensed consolidated financial statements included in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q is incorporated herein by reference. 

Item 1A: Risk Factors 
 
 We are subject to various risks and uncertainties that may affect our business, results of operations and financial condition including, not limited to, those described in Part I Item 1A: Risk Factors in the 2023 Form 10-K. Current global economic and geopolitical events and conditions may amplify many of these risks. These risks are not the only risks that may affect us. Additional risks that we are not aware of or do not believe are material at the time of this filing may also become important factors that adversely affect our business. There have been no material changes to the Company s risk factors from those disclosed in the 2023 Form 10-K. 

Item 2: Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds 
 
 Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities 
 
 Stock repurchase activity during the three months ended September 30, 2024 was as follows:

 (1) Our stock repurchase program is intended to programmatically offset the impact of dilution from our equity compensation programs and, subject to market conditions and other factors, to make opportunistic and programmatic repurchases of our common stock to reduce our outstanding share count. Any share repurchases under our stock repurchase program may be made through open market transactions, block trades, privately negotiated transactions (including accelerated share repurchase transactions) or other means at times and in such amounts as management deems appropriate and will be funded from our working capital or other financing alternatives. 
 In February 2024, our Board authorized an incremental 2.0 billion under our stock repurchase program in addition to the 4.0 billion previously authorized in 2022. Our stock repurchase program has no expiration from the date of authorization. 
 During the three months ended September 30, 2024, we repurchased approximately 750 million of our common stock under our stock repurchase program. As of September 30, 2024, a total of approximately 1.2 billion remained available for future repurchases of our common stock. 
 We expect, subject to market conditions and other uncertainties, to continue making opportunistic and programmatic repurchases of our common stock. However, our stock repurchase program may be limited or terminated at any time without prior notice. The timing and actual number of shares repurchased will depend on a variety of factors, including corporate and regulatory requirements, price and other market conditions and management s determination as to the appropriate use of our cash. 
 (2) Excludes broker commissions and excise tax accruals.
