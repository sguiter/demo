In
December 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-09, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures . The Board
is issuing the amendments in this Update to enhance the transparency and decision usefulness of income tax disclosures. Investors, lenders,
creditors, and other allocators of capital (collectively, investors indicated that the existing income tax disclosures
should be enhanced to provide information to better assess how an entity s operations and related tax risks and tax planning and
operational opportunities affect its tax rate and prospects for future cash flows. Investors currently rely on the rate reconciliation
table and other disclosures, including total income taxes paid, to evaluate income tax risks and opportunities. While investors find
these disclosures helpful, they suggested possible enhancements to better (1) understand an entity s exposure to potential changes
in jurisdictional tax legislation and the ensuing risks and opportunities, (2) assess income tax information that affects cash flow forecasts
and capital allocation decisions, and (3) identify potential opportunities to increase future cash flows. The amendments in this Update
address investor requests for more transparency about income tax information through improvements to income tax disclosures primarily
related to the rate reconciliation and income taxes paid information. This Update also includes certain other amendments to improve the
effectiveness of income tax disclosures. The amendments in this Update are effective for annual periods beginning after December 15,
2024, with early adoption permitted, and should be applied on a prospective basis. The Company is currently evaluating the potential
effect of this ASU on its consolidated financial statements.

In
the ordinary course of business, we extend credit to customers on a generally non-collateralized basis. The Company maintains an allowance
for expected credit losses which is based on management s assessments of the amount which may become uncollectible in the future
and is determined through consideration of our write-off history, specific identification of uncollectible accounts based in part on
the customer s past due balance (based on contractual terms), and consideration of prevailing economic and industry conditions.
Uncollectible accounts are written off after repeated attempts to collect from the customer have been unsuccessful.

Contract
Assets and Liabilities 

Contract
assets represent accumulated incurred costs and earned profits on contracts with customers that have been recorded as sales but have
not been billed to customers and are classified as current. In addition, a portion of the amounts billed on certain fixed price contracts
that are withheld by the customer as a retainage until a final good receipt of the complete project to the customers satisfaction. Contract
liabilities consist of advance payments and billings in excess of costs incurred and deferred revenue, and represent amounts received
in excess of sales recognized on contracts. The Company classifies advance payments and billings in excess of costs incurred as current,
and deferred revenue as current or non-current based on the expected timing of sales recognition. Contract assets and contract liabilities
are determined on a contract-by-contract basis at the end of each reporting period. The non-current portion of contract liabilities is
included in long-term liabilities in the Company s condensed consolidated balance sheets.

Long-term debt 

In
November 2021, the Company amended its Senior Secured Credit Facility to million to million, (ii) reduce its borrowing costs by an approximate 130 basis points and (iii) extend the initial
maturity date by one year to the end of 2026 . Borrowings under the credit facility now bear interest at a rate of LIBOR with no floor
plus a spread of , based on the Company s net leverage ratio, compared to a prior rate of LIBOR with a floor of plus
a spread of , resulting on total annual savings of approximately million at current levels of outstanding borrowings, since
entering into our inaugural US Bank syndicated facility in October 2020. The effective interest rate for this credit facility including
deferred issuance costs is . In relation to this transaction, the Company accounted for costs related to fees paid of . This
was accounted for as a debt modification and of fees paid to banks were capitalized as deferred cost of financing and paid
to third parties recorded as an operating expense on the consolidated statements of operations for the year ended December 31, 2021.
Beginning on July 1, 2023, the interest rate on this credit facility was updated to SOFR plus the same spread of . As of September
2024, we voluntarily prepaid million of capital to this credit facility which has decreased our net leverage ratio and triggered
a step down in the applicable interest rate spread to .

Total 

The
Company s loans have maturities ranging from . Our credit facilities bore a weighted average interest rate
of as of September 30, 2024. 

to . Regarding the conditions of our outstanding debt, only Libor was replaced by SOFR, maintaining the other initial conditions. 

As
of September 30, 2024, the fair value of our interest rate swap was in a net asset position of million. We had outstanding interest
rate swap contracts to hedge million related to our outstanding debt through November 2026. We assessed the risk of non-performance
of the Company to these contracts and determined it was insignificant and, therefore, did not record any adjustment to fair value as
of September 30, 2024. 

We
assess the effectiveness of our interest rate swap contracts by comparing the change in the fair value of the interest rate swap contracts
to the change in the expected cash to be paid for the hedged item. The effective portion of the gain or loss on our interest rate swap
contracts is reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income and is reclassified into earnings in the same line item
in the income statement as the hedged item in the same period or periods during which the transaction affects earnings. The amount of
gains, net, recognized in the accumulated other comprehensive income line item in the accompanying consolidated balance
sheet as of September 30, 2024, that we expect will be reclassified to earnings within the next twelve months, is million.

Fair
Value Measurements 

The
Company accounts for financial assets and liabilities in accordance with accounting standards that define fair value and establish a
framework for measuring fair value. The hierarchy prioritizes the inputs into three broad levels. Level 1 inputs are quoted prices (unadjusted)
in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. Level 2 inputs are quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active
markets or inputs that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly through market corroboration, for substantially
the full term of the financial instrument. Level 3 inputs are unobservable inputs based on the Company s assumptions used to measure
assets and liabilities at fair value. A financial asset s or liability s classification within the hierarchy is determined
based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement. 

The
carrying amounts of the Company s financial instruments, including cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable
and advances from customers approximate their fair value due to their relatively short-term maturities. The Company bases its fair value
estimate for long term debt obligations on its internal valuation that all debt is floating rate debt based on current interest rates
in Colombia. 

The
fair values of derivatives used to manage interest rate risks are based on SOFR rates and interest rate swap curves. Measurement of our
derivative assets and liabilities is considered a level 2 measurement. To carry out the swap valuation, the definition of the fixed leg
(obligation) and variable leg (right) is used. Once the projected flows are obtained in both fixed and variable rates, the regression
analysis is performed for prospective effectiveness test. The projection curve contains the forward interest rates to project flows at
a variable rate and the discount curve contains the interest rates to discount future flows, using the one-month USD Libor curve. 

As
of September 30, 2024, financial instruments carried at amortized cost that do not approximate fair value consist of long-term debt.
See Note 7 Debt. The fair value of long-term debt was calculated based on an analysis of future cash flows discounted at current
market rates (which are level 2 inputs).

an approximate premium based on the closing stock price as of October 27, 2020. 

The
land will serve the purpose of developing a second float glass plant nearby our existing manufacturing facilities which we expect will
carry significant efficiencies for us once it becomes operative, in which we will also have a interest. The new plant will be funded
with proceeds from the original cash contribution made by the Company, operating cashflows from the Bogota plant, debt incurred at the
joint venture level that will not consolidate into the Company and an additional contribution by us of approximately million if

General
Legal Matters 

From
time to time, the Company is involved in legal matters arising in the regular course of business. Some disputes are derived directly
from our construction projects, related to supply and installation, and even though deemed ordinary, they may involve significant monetary
damages. We are also subject to other type of litigations arising from employment practices, worker s compensation, automobile
claims and general liability. It is very difficult to predict precisely what the outcome of these litigations might be. However, with
the information at our disposition as this time, there are no indications that such claims will result in a material adverse effect on
the business, financial condition or results of operations of the Company.

Overview 

We
are experienced and highly skilled in the vertical integration of architectural glass manufacturing, distribution, and professional fitting.
Our expertise extends to the production of top-quality windows, as well as the supply of aluminum, vinyl, and other components. Our dedicated
and knowledgeable team serves a diverse range of commercial and residential construction projects worldwide, guaranteeing outstanding
products and seamless installation services. With a focus on innovation, combined with providing highly specified products with the highest
quality standards at competitive prices, we have earned #1 spot in the Forbe s list of America s 100 most successful small-cap
companies for 2024, and developed a leadership position in each of our core markets. In the United States, which is our largest market,
we were ranked as the third largest glass fabricator serving the United States in 2023 by Glass Magazine. In addition, we believe we
are the leading glass transformation company in Colombia. Our customers, which include developers, general contractors or installers
for hotels, office buildings, shopping centers, airports, universities, hospitals and multi-family and residential buildings, look to
us as a value-added partner based on our product development capabilities, our high-quality products and our unwavering commitment to
exceptional service. 

With
over 40 years of experience in architectural glass and aluminum assembly, we specialize in transforming various glass products. Our offerings
include tempered safety glass, double thermo-acoustic glass, and laminated glass. Our wide range of finished glass products are utilized
in diverse buildings for floating facades, curtain walls, windows, doors, handrails, as well as interior and bathroom spatial dividers.
In addition to glass, we manufacture aluminum and vinyl products such as profiles, rods, bars, plates, and other hardware specifically
designed for window manufacturing. 

Our
products are manufactured in a 5.6 million square foot, state-of-the-art manufacturing complex in Barranquilla, Colombia that provides
easy access to North, Central and South America, the Caribbean and the Pacific. Our products can be found on some of the most distinctive
buildings in these regions, including 100 Hood Park Drive (Boston), 601 West 29 th St (New York). Norwegian Cruise Line Terminal
B (Miami), Paramount Miami Worldcenter (Miami), Via 57 West (New York), One65 Main (Cambridge), AE O Tower (Honolulu), Salesforce
Tower (San Francisco), and One Thousand Museum (Miami). Our track record of successfully delivering high profile projects has earned
us an increasing number of opportunities across the United States, evidenced by our expanding backlog and overall revenue growth. 

Our
structural competitive advantage is underpinned by our low-cost manufacturing footprint, vertically integrated business model and geographic
location. Our integrated facilities in Colombia and distribution and services operations in Florida provide us with a significant cost
advantage in both manufacturing and distribution, and we continue to invest in these operations to expand our operational capabilities.
Our lower cost manufacturing footprint allows us to offer competitive prices for our customers, while also providing innovative, high
quality and high value-added products, together with consistent and reliable service. We have historically generated high margin organic
growth based on our position as a value-added solutions provider for our customers. 

We
have a strong presence in the Florida market, which represents a substantial portion of our revenue stream and backlog. Our success in
Florida has primarily been achieved through sustained organic growth, with further penetration now taking place into other highly populated
areas of the United States. As part of our strategy to become a fully vertically integrated company, we have supplemented our organic
growth with some acquisitions that have allowed us added control over our supply chain allowed for further vertical integration of our
business and will act as a platform for our future expansion in the United States. In 2016, we completed the acquisition of ESW, which
gave us control over the distribution of products into the United States from our manufacturing facilities in Colombia. In March 2017,
we completed the acquisition of GM P, a consulting and glazing installation business that was previously our largest installation
customer. 

21 

On
May 3, 2019, we consummated the joint venture agreement with Saint-Gobain, acquiring a 25.8 minority ownership interest in Vidrio Andino,
a Colombia-based subsidiary of Saint-Gobain, solidifying our vertical integration strategy by acquiring an interest in the first stage
of our production chain, while securing ample glass supply for our expected production needs. Additionally, in April 2019, we acquired
a 70 equity interest in ESMetals, which has been consolidated in our financial statements since. In November 2023, we acquired the remaining
30 equity interest in ESMetals. ESMetals is a Colombian entity that serves as a metalwork contractor to supply us with steel accessories
used in the assembly of certain architectural systems as part of our vertical integration strategy. 

The
continued diversification of the group s presence and product portfolio is a core component of our strategy. In particular, we
are actively seeking to expand our presence in United States outside of Florida. We also launched a residential window offering which,
we believe, will help us expand our presence in the United States and generate additional organic growth. We believe that the quality
of our products, coupled with our ability to price competitively given our structural advantages on cost, will allow us to generate further
growth in the future. 

We
have focused on working with The Power of Quality , always making sure that our vision of sustainability is immersed into every
aspect of our business, including social, environmental, economic and governance variables, that help us make decisions and create value
for our stakeholders. We carry out a series of initiatives based on our global sustainability strategy, which is supported on three fundamental
pillars: promoting an ethical and responsible continuous growth, leading eco-efficiency and innovation, and empowering our environment.
As part of this strategy, we have voluntarily adhered to UN Global Compact Principles since 2017 and in pursuit of our cooperation with
the attainment of the SDGs joined in 2021 a program to dynamize, strengthen and make visible the management of greenhouse gas emissions
as a carbon neutral strategy set out by the Colombian government for 2050.

Comparison
of quarterly periods ended September 30, 2024, and 2023 

Revenues 

Operating
revenues increased 27.6 million, or 13.1 , from 210.7 during the quarter ended September 30, 2023, to 238.3 million, during the quarter
ended September 30, 2024. Strong revenues during the third quarter of 2024 were driven by strong activity in the U.S market, where revenues
increased 27.8 million, or 13.9 year over year, from 200.3 million during the quarter ended September 30, 2023, to 228.2 million
during the quarter ended September 30, 2024. The increase was driven by higher residential revenues, up 21.9 million, or 25.0 year
over year, resulting from strong demand since the beginning of 2024. Commercial market revenues increased 5.7 million, or 4.6 year
over year, as we continue to execute on our growing backlog. Revenues from Latin-America remained stable at approximately 10.1 million
year over year. 

Gross
profit 

Gross
profit increased 18.7 million, or 20.7 , from 90.5 million during the three months ended September 30, 2023, to 109.2 million, during
the three months ended September 30, 2024. The gross profit margin during the three months ended September 30, 2024, was 45.8 , up from
43.0 during the third quarter of 2023, primarily related to favorable pricing dynamic, a more profitable revenue mix, as residential
sales (with no installation) represent 46.0 of our total revenues in 2024, compared to 41.7 in 2023. 

Expenses 

Operating
expenses increased 12.0 million, or 40.7 , from 29.5 million to 41.5 million for the quarters ended September 30, 2023 and 2024, respectively.
The increase resulted primarily from higher administrative and selling expenses to support a larger operation and ongoing geographical
expansion over the US market, as well as inflation adjusted increases on administrative expenses such as salaries and others. 

22 

Non-operating
income and expenses, net 

During
the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the Company recorded net non-operating income of 1.4 million and 0.6 million, respectively.
Non-operating income is comprised of interest income from short term investments, as well as non-operating expenses related to certain
charitable contributions outside of the Company s direct sphere of influence. 

Foreign
currency transaction gains and losses 

During
the three months ended September 30, 2024, the Company recorded a non-operating gain of 0.9 million associated with foreign currency
transactions compared to a net non-operating gain of 1.1 million during the three months ended September 30, 2023. 

Interest
Expense and deferred cost of financing 

Interest
expense and deferred cost of financing decreased 0.5 million, or 22.1 , to 1.8 million during the quarter ended September 30, 2024,
as the Company voluntarily prepaid 47.0 million during the year to reduce its debt balance and benefited from having a favorable interest
rate hedge in place for 100 of its outstanding syndicated debt after giving effect to the voluntary prepayments. 

Income
Taxes 

The
effective income tax rate of 28.7 and 25.1 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, and 2023, respectively, are below the average
statutory rates of 31.1 and 33.1 during each of those periods, respectively, as the proportion of our taxable income shift jurisdictions
resulting from new developments of our product designs, trademarks and other intellectual property rights. 

As
a result of the foregoing, the Company recorded net income for the three months ended September 30, 2024, of 49.5 million compared to
net income of 46.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. 

Comparison
of nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 

Revenues 

Operating
revenues during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 650.6 million, compared to 638.7 million during the nine months ended
September 30, 2023, an increase of 11.9 million or 1.9 , year over year. Revenues from the U.S residential market increased 20.3 million,
or 7.9 , from 258.3 million in 2023, to 278.6 million in 2024, resulting from strong demand since the beginning of 2024. Revenues from
the commercial market decreased 8.3 million, or 2.2 year over year, impacted by high interest and mortgage rates. 

23 

Gross
profit 

Gross
profit during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, was 273.5 million, a decrease of 34.5 million, or 11.2 , from 308.0 million
during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The gross profit margin during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, decreased to
42.0 from 48.2 during the nine months ended September 30, 2023, primarily related to a 9.8 appreciation of the Colombian Peso impacting
our costs denominated in Colombian Pesos against our predominantly US Dollar revenue stream. Additionally, the year over year comparison
was also impacted by higher salaries which were adjusted at the beginning of the year and higher headcount to adjust for ongoing growth. 

Expenses 

Operating
expenses increased 14.9 million, or 15.0 , from 98.8 million to 113.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 and 2024,
respectively. The increase was mainly driven by administrative salary adjustments, operating headcount increase, and a negative effect
in COP denominated amounts related to a 9.8 appreciation of the Colombian Peso against US Dollar over the period. 

Non-operating
income and expenses, net 

During
the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the Company recorded non-operating income of 5.2 and 3.5 million, respectively.
Non-operating income for the period is comprised primarily of interest income from short-term investments, income from rental properties
and gains on sale of scrap materials as well as non-operating expenses related to certain charitable contributions outside of the Company s
direct sphere of influence. 

Foreign
currency transaction gains and losses 

During
the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company recorded a non-operating net loss of 4.9 million associated with foreign currency
transactions, compared to a net gain of 0.9 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 

Interest
Expense 

Interest
expense and deferred cost of financing decreased 1.0 million, or 14.4 , to 5.9 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024,
from 6.9 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2023, as the Company voluntarily prepaid 47.0 million to reduce its debt
balance and benefited from having a favorable interest rate hedge in place for 100 of its outstanding debt. 

Income
Taxes 

The
effective income tax rate of 27.6 and 30.1 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, and 2023, respectively, are below the average
statutory rates of 31.1 and 33.1 during each of those periods, respectively, as the proportion of our taxable income shift jurisdictions
resulting from new developments of our product designs, trademarks and other intellectual property rights. 

As
a result of the foregoing, the Company recorded a net income for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 of 114.3 million compared
to 147.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 

Liquidity 

As
of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we had cash and cash equivalents of approximately 122.1 million and 129.5 million, respectively.
Additionally, we currently have approximately 175.0 million available under different lines of credit. 

We
anticipate that the Company will continue to generate positive cashflow from operating activities through the remainder of the year,
which we believe, in addition to our current liquidity position, provides ample flexibility to service our obligations through the next
twelve months. 

24 

Capital
Resources 

We
transform glass and aluminum into high specification architectural glass and custom-made aluminum profiles which require significant
investments in state-of-the-art technology. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, we made investments primarily in
building and construction and machinery and equipment in the amounts of 59.4 million and 73.8 million, respectively. These investments
across our vertically-integrated operations include further automating our glass and window assembly production lines, adding glass production
lines, expanding our aluminum facilities, putting new vinyl windows lines to penetrate this new product segment and purchasing land to
grow beyond current installed capacity. The Company estimates that current manufacturing operating capacity has reached approximately
 1.2 billion which does not account for incremental installation revenue capacity. Additionally, the Company expects the resulting increase
in output to improve efficiency throughout its operations while reducing material waste and overall lead times.

During
the nine months ended September 30, 2024, and 2023, operating activities generated approximately 109.4 million and 94.5 million, respectively.
The main sources of operating cash during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, were driven by contract assets and liabilities, and
trade accounts payable. Contract assets and liabilities generated 15.9 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, mostly
due to an increase in billings in excess of costs, as main projects are being executed, and large projects from our backlog are starting
operations; compared to 13.1 million generated during the nine months ended September 30, 2023, as we executed on our growing backlog.
In addition, trade accounts payable generated 10.1 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 mainly as a result of our
growing operation, while our days payable outstanding remain moderately stable and decreasing year over year, compared with 8.4 million
generated during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The largest use of cash in operating activities was trade accounts payable,
which used 38.8 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared with a use of 10.4 million during the prior year period,
driven by a pick up in pace of large commercial installation jobs during the third quarter of 2024, which entail longer cash cycles.
Additionally, taxes payable used 22.2 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, resulted from taxes being paid during
the period, as the Colombian subsidiaries fully paid their 2023 income tax during the second quarter of 2024. 

We
used 51.5 million and 62.5 million in investing activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, and 2023, respectively.
The main use of cash in investing activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was related to scheduled payments on previous
investments to increase capacity and efficiency as well as new investments in land and equipment. During the nine months ended September
30, 2024, we paid 53.9 million to acquire property plant and equipment, which in combination with 5.5 million acquired under credit
or debt, amount to total capital expenditures of 59.4 million. During the nine months ended September 30, 2023, we used 62.2 million
for the acquisition of property and equipment. Including assets acquired with debt or supplier credit, total capital expenditures during
the period were 73.8 million. 

Financing
activities used 63.4 million and 20.9 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. On April 10,
2024, we paid 2,500 to Incantesimo SAS, related to the acquisition of the remaining 30 equity interest of ES Metals. We paid 14.6
million and 12.2 million of dividends to holders of our ordinary shares during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively.
Additionally, during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we used 49.0 million to repay debt from our Senior Secured Line of Credit
and other smaller facilities.

3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk 

We
are exposed to ongoing market risk related to changes in foreign currency exchange rates and commodity market prices. 

Previously,
a rise in interest rates could negatively affect the cost of financing for a significant portion of our debt with variable interest rates.
However, following recent repayments in 2024 only an immaterial portion of our debt is exposed to market risk, net of the effect from
interest rate hedging derivative financial instruments further described in the footnotes to the financial statements, and fluctuations
in interest rates would not have a significant impact on our cost of financing. 

We
are subject to market risk due to changes in the value of foreign currencies in relation to our reporting currency, the U.S. dollar.
Some of our subsidiaries operations are based in Colombia, and primarily transact business in local currency. Approximately 2.5 
of our consolidated revenues and 25.7 of our costs and expenses are effectively incurred in Colombian pesos, thereby mitigating some
of the risk associated with changes in foreign exchange rates. This portion of costs and expenses denominated in Colombian Peso excludes
certain items which are transacted in Colombia using Colombian Peso but are priced in U.S. Dollars or are otherwise indexed to U.S. Dollar
rates. Thus5 appreciation of the Colombian Peso relative to the US Dollar would result in our quarter revenues increasing by 0.9 million
and our costs and expenses increasing by approximately 7.3 million, resulting in a 6.4 million decrease to net earnings based on results
for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 

25 

Similarly,
a significant portion of the monetary assets and liabilities of these subsidiaries are generally denominated in US Dollars, while their
functional currency is the Colombian peso, thereby resulting in gains or losses from remeasurement of assets and liabilities using the
end of period spot exchange rate. These subsidiaries have both monetary assets and monetary liabilities denominated in US Dollars, thereby
mitigating some of the risk associated with changes in foreign exchange rate. Furthermore, we record a portion of the non-cash foreign
currency transaction gains and losses from remeasurement of certain intercompany loans as other comprehensive income. Net of this, the
Colombian subsidiaries US Dollar denominated monetary liabilities exceed their monetary assets by 20.5 million, such that a 1 
devaluation of the Colombian peso will result in a loss of 0.2 million recorded in the Company s Consolidated Statement of Operations
as of September 30, 2024. 

Additionally,
the results of the foreign subsidiaries must be translated into US Dollars, our reporting currency, in the Company s consolidated
financial statements. The currency translation of the financial statements using different exchange rates, as appropriate, for different
parts of the financial statements generates a translation adjustment, which is recorded within other comprehensive income on the Company s
Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income and Consolidated Balance Sheet. 

We
are also subject to market risk exposure related to volatility in the prices of aluminum, one of the principal raw materials used for
our manufacturing. The commodities markets, which include the aluminum industry, are highly cyclical in nature, and as a result, prices
can be volatile. Commodity costs are influenced by numerous factors beyond our control, including general economic conditions, the availability
of raw materials, competition, labor costs, freight and transportation costs, production costs, import duties and other trade restrictions.
Our selling prices are also impacted by changes in commodity costs base our pricing of aluminum products based on the quoted price on
the London Metals Exchange plus a manufacturing premium with the intention of aligning cost of our raw materials with selling prices
to attempt to pass commodity price changes through to our customers. 

We
cannot accurately estimate the impact a one percent change in the commodity costs of would have on our results of operation, as the change
in commodity costs would both impact the cost to purchase materials and our selling prices. The impact to our results of operations depends
on the conditions of the market for our products, which could impact our ability to pass commodities costs to our customers.

4. Controls and Procedures 

Evaluation
of Disclosure Controls and Procedures

Changes
