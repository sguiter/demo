Company s ability to continue as a going concern for a period of one year from the issuance of these financial statements. The
financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of these uncertainties. 

Management is seeking additional funding to provide operating capital for

additional funding will be available on acceptable terms, if at all. 

from two of the convertible note holders as working capital loans to enable the Company to meet its
obligations for operating expenses. The advances bear interest at the rate of , but there are no other terms established. While
the intent is to memorialize these advances through the issuance of a convertible note, as of the date of this filing that has not
been done. Therefore these advances are treated as on demand notes and are included in our current liabilities. Until such agreement
is reached, the balance of as of September 30, 2024 is unsecured and due on demand. At September 30, 2024 there is

, terminating on August 25, 2015. This plan was approved by the stockholders of the Company at their annual meeting
of shareholders on November 22, 2005. Under the Plan, the exercise price for all options issued will not be less than the average quoted
closing market price of the Company s trading common stock for the thirty-day period immediately preceding the grant date plus a
premium of percent. The maximum aggregate number of shares that may be awarded under the plan is shares. The Company
continues to utilize the Black-Scholes option-pricing model for calculating the fair value of the options granted as defined by ASC Topic
718, which is an acceptable valuation approach under ASC 718. This model requires the input of subjective assumptions, including the expected
price volatility of the underlying stock. 

On August 24, 2015, the Board of Directors approved the issuance
of options to purchase shares of the Company s common stock. Of the total issued, options were issued to replace
options held by directors and employees which were to expire and options were issued to new employees. Of the options issued,
 have an option price of per share, have an option price of per share, have an option price of 
per share, and have an option price of per share. Options issued as replacement shall have immediate vesting terms. Options
which are not replacements shall vest over a two -year, four-month period in equal installments on the last day of 2015, 2016 and 2017,
respectively. 

Projected data related to the expected volatility and expected
life of stock options is based upon historical and other information, and notably, the Company's common stock has limited trading history.
Changes in these subjective assumptions can materially affect the fair value of the estimate, and therefore, the existing valuation models
do not provide a precise measure of the fair value of the Company's employee stock options. 

Between August 25, 2005 and August 25, 2019, the Company granted
options to employees to purchase an aggregate shares of common stock at exercise prices ranging from to per share.
The options all vested by December 31, 2017 and expire years from the date of grant. 

On December 30, 2020 the Board of Directors approved the revaluation
of all outstanding stock options, reducing the option price to per share. The Company recorded a charge of as the result

ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL
CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 

EXECUTIVE OVERVIEW 

Flexpoint Sensor Systems, Inc. is a company engaged
principally in improving its unique sensor technology, expanding its suite of products, developing new sensor applications, obtaining
financing and seeking long-term sustainable manufacturing contracts, licensing agreements and royalty agreements. Our operations
have not yet commenced to a commercially sustainable level and include designing, engineering, manufacturing, licensing and selling sensor
technology and products featuring our Bend Sensor technology and equipment. 

Finalizing long-term, constant revenue generating
production contracts with our existing and other customers remains our greatest challenge because our on-going business is dependent on
the types of revenues and cash flows generated by such contracts. Cash flow and cash requirement risks are closely tied to and are dependent
upon our ability to attract significant long-term production contracts. We must continue to obtain funding to operate and expand our operations
so that we can deliver our unique Bend Sensor and Bend Sensor related technologies and products
to the market. Management believes that even though we are making positive strides forward with our business plan we will need to
raise additional operating capital. 

Worldwide automakers are faced with the challenge
of providing a safer, more energy efficient, longer lasting product that consumers can afford. This has required automakers to search
new and innovative ways to lower the overall weight of the vehicle and to improve its fuel efficiencies, while lowering the cost. We continue
to experience an increased interest regarding automotive and other potential applications for our sensor technology because they meet
this criterion. With its versatility, light weight, single layer construction and the fact that it is currently being used in various
safety devices the Bend Sensor is positioned well to meet the challenges that the automobile industry is facing. 

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES 

The challenges posed by the Pandemic in the United States and global economies
has had a significant effect on our business. During this difficult time, we have worked to ensure that our customers continue to receive
quality, personalized service. 

Currently our revenue is primarily from product development, manufacturing
and recurring sales with additional contributions to income from design contract, testing and limited production services for prototypes
and samples, and is currently not at a level to support our operations. Depending upon the world returning to some form of normalcy
following the end of the Pandemic, we believe, based upon current orders and projected orders over the next twelve months, that we could
be producing sensors under long-term contracts in the future that will help support our existing operations and potential future growth.
Management recognizes such contracts usually go 

15 

through a long negotiation process and there can be no guarantee that we
will be successful in our negotiations or that such contracts will be sufficient to support our current operations in the near future. 

In the first nine months of 2024, we have relied on the proceeds of advances
in the form of on-demand loans from existing shareholders, which funds are accounted for as demand notes. The balances of the non-related
party convertible notes have a combined total of 180,000 as of September 30, 2024. The notes have an annual interest rate of 8 to 10 
and default rates of 10 to 15 , have various maturity dates, and are secured by the Company s business assets. The on-demand notes
have a principal balance of 1,472,427 at September 30, 2024 and no terms have yet been established for these funds. 

Management believes that our current cash burn rate is approximately
 60,000 per month and expectations are that it will continue at this rate for the foreseeable future. If the business returns to pre-Pandemic
levels, with proceeds from additional convertible notes and estimated revenues for manufacturing, production, engineering design and prototype
products should be sufficient to fund the next twelve months of operations. Our auditors have expressed doubt about our ability to continue
as a going concern and that we may not realize significant revenue or become profitable within the next twelve months. We will require
additional financing to fund our short-term cash needs. We will have to rely on additional debt financing, loans from existing shareholders
and private placements of common stock for additional funding. Based upon our anticipated purchase orders over the next twelve months
the revenue generated will not be sufficient to cover our operating expenses, based on our current burn rate. However, we cannot assure
that we will be able to obtain short-term financing, or that sources of such financing, if any, will continue to be available, and if
available, that they will be on terms favorable to us. Nor is there any guarantee that the projected volume of purchase orders will meet
the volumes that we anticipate. 

As we enter into new agreements, we must ensure that those agreements
provide adequate funding for any pre-production research and development and manufacturing costs. If we are successful in establishing
agreements with adequate initial funding, management believes that our operations for the long term will be funded by revenues, licensing
fees and/or royalties related to these agreements. However, we have formalized only a few agreements during the past four years and there
can be no assurance that the agreements will generate sufficient revenues or be profitable in the future or that a desired technological
application will be successful enough to produce the volumes and profits necessary to fund our operations. 

FINANCIAL OBLIGATIONS AND CONTINGENT LIABILITIES 

Our principal commitments at September 30, 2024 consisted of our operating
lease of 6,657 per month, and total liabilities of 5,335,648, which includes 398,513 of convertible notes payable. Accrued liabilities
at September 30, 2024, were 2,889,710 and were related to payroll, payroll tax liabilities, accrued professional expenses, accrued insurance
expense, accrued interest expense on notes and accrued paid time off. 

In August 2020 the Company
received 50,000 from John Kelly, a large shareholder, to meet operating expenses. Mr. Kelly indicated that he would want the 50,000
repaid when the Company was in a position to do so. Mr. Kelly subsequently provided an additional 5,000, for a total loan of 55,000.
This funding has not formally been documented by a note at the time of this filing, and there is no term or interest on the note. In 2023,
2022 and 2021 payment of 40,000 was made to reduce the balance. During the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024, an additional
payment of 2,500 was made, leaving a remaining balance of 15,000. 

The Company has received
 1,472,427 in funding from holders of our convertible notes. These fundings have not yet been memorialized into convertible notes. The
only term agreed upon to date is that all funds advanced will bear interest at the rate of 10 per annum from the date of deposit. 

The Company has a few major customers who represent a significant portion
of revenue and accounts receivable. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, two customers represented 87 of sales and one customer
represented 96 of accounts receivable. The Company has a strong ongoing relationship with these customers with scheduled product deliveries
extending through the year from one of the customers with an account receivable and does not believe this concentration poses a significant
risk, as their products are based entirely on the Company s technologies.

OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS 

We have not entered into any off-balance sheet arrangements that have or
are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses,
results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources and would be considered material to investors. 

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES 

Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB Accounting
Standards Codification ASC The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the
consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Estimates of particular significance in our financial statements include goodwill
and the annual tests for impairment of goodwill and long-lived assets and valuing stock option compensation. 

ASC 350-20 Intangibles Goodwill and Other: The Company
follows the guidance provided by ASC 350-20. The Company's goodwill represents the excess of its reorganization value over the fair value
of the net assets upon emergence from bankruptcy. Goodwill is not amortized; therefore, we test our goodwill for impairment annually or
when a triggering event occur using a fair value approach. A fair value-based test is applied at the overall Company level. The test compares
the fair value of the Company to the carrying value of its net assets. The test requires various judgments and estimates. During 2023
and for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company recorded no impairment charge to reduce the carrying value of the goodwill
to its estimated fair value. As part of the impairment testing performed at December 31, 2023, the Company considered factors such as
the global market volatility, variables in the economy, and the overall uncertainty in the markets that has resulted in a decline in the
market price of the Company's stock price and market capitalization for a sustained period, as indicators for potential goodwill impairment. 

ASC 820 Fair Value Measurement: We test long-lived assets for impairment
annually or when a triggering event occurs. Impairment is indicated if undiscounted cash flows are less than the carrying value of the
assets. The amount of impairment is measured using a discounted-cash-flows model considering future revenues, operating costs and risk-adjusted
discount rate and other factors. The analysis compares the present value of projected net cash flows for the remaining current year and
next two years against the carrying value of the long-lived assets. If the carrying values of the long-lived assets exceed the present
value of the discounted projected revenues an impairment expense would be recognized in the period and the carrying value of the assets
would be adjusted accordingly. Impairment tests are conducted on an annual basis and, should they indicate a carrying value in excess
of fair value, a charge may be required. 

ASC 718 Compensation Stock Compensation : Financial
accounting standards require that recognition of the cost of employee services received in exchange for stock options and awards of equity
instruments be based on the grant-date fair value of such options and awards and is recognized as an expense in operations over the period
they vest. The fair value of the options we have granted is estimated at the date of grant using the Black-Scholes American option-pricing
model. Option pricing models require the input of highly sensitive assumptions, including expected stock volatility. In addition, our
stock options have characteristics significantly different from those of traded options, and changes in the subjective input assumptions
can materially affect the fair value estimate. Management believes the best input assumptions available were used to value the options
and that the resulting option values are reasonable. For the nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, we recognized 0 and
 0, respectively, of stock-based compensation expense for our stock options and there is no additional unrecognized compensation cost
related to employee stock options at the current time. 

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 

The Company continues to concentrate its marketing resources on a
limited number of customers that have the greatest potential to generate the most short-term revenue while still building relationships
with our larger customers. Management believes this approach has the highest potential to bring long-term commercially viable products
to market and will provide sustainable cash flow to fund the Company's operations in the future. Currently, overall revenues are not sufficient
to sustain our operations . The Pandemic has had a dramatic effect on our business as well as the business of our customers. The
wide-ranging effects on the world-wide business market has led to a general reluctance for businesses to move forward with entering into
major commitments until their future markets have been clarified. Following a return to normal business operations in the world, management
anticipates 

17 

that revenues will increase as we continue to execute our long-term
business plan and cultivate larger customer bases with our existing product offering. However, until the Pandemic ends and a long-term
production contract is in place there is no guarantee that our current customer base will order in sufficient volumes to sustain our operations.
Therefore, management continues to work with larger companies and industries and is hopeful that in the near future we will sign a long-term
licensing or manufacturing contract. 

We recognized revenue from repeat orders from our existing customers, design
contract, and development engineering. Revenue is recognized using the ASC 606 five step detailed in Note 1 to the financial statements.
Revenue from the sale of a product is recorded at the time of shipment to the customer. Revenue from the license agreements was
recognized in the period the agreement was concluded, as it is a right of use license and the Company has no further obligations to perform
under the terms of the agreement. Revenue from research and development engineering contracts is recognized as the services are provided
and accepted by the customer. Revenue from contracts to license technology to others is deferred until all conditions under the contract
are met and then the sale is recognized as licensing royalty revenue over the remaining term of the contract. 

The following discussions are based on the consolidated operations of Flexpoint
Sensor Systems, Inc. and should be read in conjunction with our unaudited financial statements for the three and nine months ended September
30, 2024 and 2023, included in Part I, Item 1, above, and the audited financial statements included in the Company s annual report
on Form 10-K for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022.

Cash at September 30, 2024 was overdrawn by 13,459, which
amount is shown as a liability. At December 31, 2023 there was an overdraft of 11,315. The negative cash is due to the issuance of
checks for operating expenses and the delayed receipt of funds to deposit. Our non-current assets are unchanged, as all property and
equipment and patents have been fully depreciated. 

Total liabilities increased by 366,346 at September 30, 2024
due to the increase of on-demand notes and accrued interest. 

INFLATION 

We do not expect the impact of inflation to have a negative impact on our
product sales or our operations for the next twelve months. 

ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 

Not applicable to smaller reporting companies. 

ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 

(a) Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

As of the end of the period covered by this quarterly report, we carried
out an evaluation of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures under the supervision and with the participation of our
Chief Executive Officer, who also serves as our Principal Financial Officer. Our controls and procedures are designed to allow information
required to be disclosed in our reports to be recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the specified periods, and accumulated
and communicated to management to allow for timely decisions regarding required disclosure of material information. Our disclosure controls
and procedures are designed to provide reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives. Based upon the evaluation, our Chief Executive
Officer concluded that our 

19 

disclosure controls and procedures were not effective at
that reasonable assurance level as of the end of the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024. 

The material weaknesses relate to the limited number of persons responsible
for the recording and reporting of financial information, the lack of separation of financial reporting duties, and the limited size of
our management team in general. We are in the process of evaluating methods of improving our internal control over financial reporting,
including the possible addition of financial reporting staff and the increased separation of financial reporting responsibility, and intend
to implement such steps as are necessary and possible to correct these material weaknesses 

(b) Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 

There have been no changes in internal control over financial reporting
during the nine months of 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect our internal control over
financial reporting. 

PART II - OTHER INFORMATION
