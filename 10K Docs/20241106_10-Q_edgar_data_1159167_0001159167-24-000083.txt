 million (the "Parent Termination Fee") on January 29, 2024. During the first quarter of fiscal 2024, as a result of the termination of the Merger Agreement and receipt of the Parent Termination Fee of million from Amazon, the Company made a payment of million for professional fees incurred in connection with the Transactions. In accordance with the terms of the Credit Agreement (as defined below), the Company applied million to repay a portion of the Term Loan. The remaining million of the Parent Termination Fee was set aside as restricted cash to be used for future repayments of the Term Loan subject to limited rights of the Company to utilize such amounts for the purchase of inventory. See Note 9, Debt , for additional information. The Parent Termination Fee received net of professional fees paid was million and was recorded during the first quarter of fiscal 2024 as a benefit in general and administrative expenses on the consolidated statements of operations.

 , compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The Company's operating loss of million and operating cash outflows of million for the nine months ended September 28, 2024 benefited from the one-time receipt of the Parent Termination Fee net of professional fees paid of million during the first quarter of fiscal 2024. The Company's operating loss also includes the one-time benefit of million related to an intellectual property litigation settlement ("Litigation Settlement") during the third quarter of fiscal 2024 with cash received subsequently in October. At September 28, 2024, the Company's cash and cash equivalents were million. The Company also had million in restricted cash. During the three months ended September 28, 2024, the Company elected to draw down million of the restricted cash which was subsequently received in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024. The cash will be used for the purchase of inventory and is required to be repaid within five months in accordance with the terms of the loan agreement. It will then be available again during the third quarter of 2025 for purchases of inventory. 
 Management has considered and assessed its ability to continue as a going concern for the one year from the date that the unaudited consolidated financial statements are issued. Management's assessment included the preparation of cash flow forecasts taking into account the restructuring actions and maintaining debt covenant compliance. On January 29, 2024, following the termination of the Merger Agreement, the Company announced an operational restructuring plan to more closely align its cost structure with near-term revenue expectations and drive profitability. The 2024 operational restructuring plan is structured to: 
 achieve gross margin improvements through a focus on design-to-value and more beneficial terms with the Company's existing and new manufacturing partners; 
 lower research and development expenditure by pausing work unrelated to the Company's core floorcare business and shifting to greater reliance on contract manufacturers as it relates to the lower-value commodity engineering work; 
 return selling and marketing expenditures to a more normalized level, consistent with industry standards in the consumer products market, by centralizing resources on more limited geographies and consolidating marketing efforts for efficiencies; and 
 further reduce headcount by approximately employees, which represents approximately of the Company's global workforce as of December 30, 2023. 
 During the nine months ended September 28, 2024, the Company made significant progress in implementing its 2024 operational restructuring plan. The Company's total operating expenses declined million, or , which excludes the one-time benefits of million related to the Parent Termination Fee and million related to the Litigation Settlement, compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Research and development expenses decreased million, or , while selling and marketing expenses decreased million, or , during the nine months ended September 28, 2024. Gross margin improved to during the third quarter of fiscal 2024, compared to during the third quarter of 2023. In addition to the reduction of its headcount, the Company entered into or amended sublease agreements between fiscal 2022 and 2024 to sublease portions of its headquarters. iRobot expects these sublease agreements will generate million in sublease cash payments in the future over the remaining lease terms. The Company expects to continue to right size its global real estate footprint through additional subleasing at its corporate headquarters and the elimination of offices in smaller, underperforming geographies. The Company continues to evaluate its cost structure, and in November 2024, as part of the ongoing restructuring plan, the Company announced an additional round of workforce reductions, totaling approximately 105 employees. Since the start of 2024 and including this new action, the Company has reduced its global workforce by approximately 50 . 
 Inventory has consumed a significant amount of cash and the Company continues to manage its inventory level carefully to ensure efficiency in its working capital. Days in inventory has improved from days during the third quarter of fiscal 2023 to days in the third quarter of fiscal 2024. The Company plans to continue to manage its inventory to a level that aligns with current run rates and seasonality of the business. 
 While management estimates such actions will be sufficient to allow it to maintain its debt covenant compliance, and its liquidity and operations in the ordinary course for at least 12 months from the issuance of these financial statements, there can be no assurance the Company will meet its debt covenant compliance and generate sufficient future cash flows from operations due to potential factors, including, but not limited to, further inflation, higher interest rates, ongoing recessionary conditions or continued reduced demand for the Company's products due to consumer sentiment or competition. If the Company is not successful in increasing demand for its products, or if macroeconomic conditions further constrain consumer demand, the Company may continue to experience adverse impacts to revenue and profitability. Additional actions within the Company's control to maintain its liquidity and operations include optimizing its production volumes with contract manufacturers by reducing inventory supply forecast for cancellable purchase orders, further reducing discretionary spending in all areas of the business and realigning resources through ongoing attrition without rehiring activity. In addition, the Company may need

 million and million, respectively. 
 The Company's products generally carry a one-year or two-year limited warranty that promises customers that delivered products are as specified. The Company does not consider these assurance-type warranties as a separate performance obligation and therefore, the Company accounts for such warranties under Accounting Standards Codification ("ASC") 460, "Guarantees." For contracts with the right to upgrade to a new product after a specified period of time, the Company accounts for this trade-in right as a guarantee obligation under ASC 460. The total transaction price is reduced by the full amount of the trade-in right's fair value and the remaining transaction price is allocated between the performance obligations within the contract. 
 The Company provides limited rights of returns for direct-to-consumer sales generated through its online stores and certain resellers and distributors. The Company records an allowance for product returns based on specific terms and conditions included in the customer agreements or based on historical experience and the Company's expectation of future returns. In addition, the Company may provide other credits or incentives which are accounted for as variable consideration when estimating the amount of revenue to recognize. Where appropriate, these estimates take into consideration relevant factors such as the Company's historical experience, current contractual requirements, specific known market events and forecasted inventory level in the channels. Overall, these reserves reflect the Company's best estimates, and the actual amounts of consideration ultimately received may differ from the Company's estimates. Returns and credits are estimated at the time of sale and updated at the end of each reporting period as additional information becomes available. As of September 28, 2024, the Company had reserves for product returns of million and other credits and incentives of million. As of December 30, 2023, the Company had reserves for product returns of million and other credits and incentives of million. The Company regularly evaluates the adequacy of its estimates for product returns and other credits and incentives. Future market conditions and product transitions may require the Company to take action to change such programs and related estimates. When the variables used to estimate these reserves change, or if actual results differ significantly from the estimates, the Company increases or reduces revenue to reflect the impact. During the three and nine months ended September 28, 2024 and September 30, 2023, changes to these estimates related to performance obligations satisfied in prior periods were not material.

 On January 29, 2024, following the termination of the Merger Agreement, the Company announced an operational restructuring plan which includes a reduction in headcount. As of September 28, 2024, approximately employees have been notified, with million and million of restructuring cost recorded during the three and nine months ended September 28, 2024, respectively. These charges consist primarily of employee termination benefits including severance, payroll taxes and other benefits. 
 In addition, the operational restructuring plan includes actions to pause work unrelated to the Company's core floorcare business and, as a result, during the nine months ended September 28, 2024, the Company recorded restructuring costs of million. These charges typically consist of write-offs on certain fixed assets as well as material liabilities at contract manufacturers due to discontinuation of programs. 
 In conjunction with the termination of the Merger Agreement, Colin Angle, the Company's then-Chief Executive Officer, stepped down as an officer of the Company and from his position as chairman of the Board effective January 28, 2024. The Board appointed Glen D. Weinstein, the Company's then Executive Vice President and Chief Legal Officer, as Interim Chief Executive Officer while a search was conducted for a permanent CEO. On May 6, 2024, the Company appointed Gary S. Cohen as the Company's Chief Executive Officer. Gary S. Cohen succeeded Glen D. Weinstein as the principal executive officer of the Company. Glen D. Weinstein provided transition services as a Company employee during the transition period. CEO transition costs represent costs incurred for CEO search fees and charges associated with the transition-related agreements with Colin Angle and Glen D. Weinstein which include compensation during the transition period as well as adjustments for modification of stock-based awards.

 As discussed further in Note 9 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company elected to recognize the Term Loan under the fair value option. The fair value of the Term Loan as of September 28, 2024 has been determined based on a discounted cash flow model, which represents Level 3 measurements. Fair value was estimated using probability-weighted scenarios which include assumptions that are highly subjective and require judgment regarding significant matters, such as the amount and timing of future cash flows, expected interest rate volatility and the discount rate. The use of different assumptions could have a material effect on the fair value estimates. 
 Fair Value Measurements - Nonrecurring Basis 
 The Company measures the fair value of certain assets on a nonrecurring basis when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable. During the second quarter of fiscal 2024, as a result of the execution of an amendment to one of its sublease agreements, the Company determined that indicators of impairment existed related to the long-lived assets associated with the subleased space. The right-of-use asset was measured and written down to fair value on a nonrecurring basis as a result of impairment. The fair value measurement was determined using a discounted

 million senior secured term loan credit facility (the "Term Loan"). Total proceeds from the Term Loan were million, net of million of debt issuance costs. The Term Loan matures on July 24, 2026. 
 The Term Loan bears interest at a rate per annum equal to, at the Company's option, (i) a rate based on term SOFR plus a credit spread adjustment plus a spread or (ii) a rate based on the base rate plus a rate adjustment plus an spread. A portion of each spread equal to is paid in kind by capitalizing such option into principal of the Term Loan. In the event of repayment, prepayment or acceleration of all or any portion of the Term Loan, the Company is required to pay to the lenders an additional amount which represents a minimum guaranteed return on the Term Loan that ranges between 1.30x and 1.75x of the principal in accordance with the provisions within the Credit Agreement. The minimum guaranteed return range is based on the date on which it is paid. The Credit Agreement provides for mandatory prepayments of borrowings under certain circumstances, including non-ordinary course asset sales and incurrence of other indebtedness, subject to customary exceptions. 
 The Credit Agreement contains customary affirmative covenants, including financial statement reporting requirements and delivery of compliance certificates. The Credit Agreement also contains customary negative covenants that limit the Company's and its subsidiaries' ability to, among other things, grant or incur liens, incur additional indebtedness, make certain restricted investments or payments, including payment of dividends on its capital stock and payments on certain permitted indebtedness, enter into certain mergers and acquisitions or engage in certain asset sales, subject in each case to certain exceptions. In addition, the Credit Agreement contains a financial covenant that the Company will not permit its consolidated core assets (comprising cash, accounts receivable and inventory), measured on the last day of each fiscal month, to be less than

 million which amount is subject to increase or decrease upon certain triggers related to the payment or non-payment of any termination fees under the Amended Merger Agreement (or fees in lieu of such termination fees) and the occurrence or non-occurrence of the Merger. 
 During the first quarter of 2024, as a result of the termination of the Merger Agreement and receipt of the Parent Termination Fee of million from Amazon on January 29, 2024, million of such Parent Termination Fee was used immediately to repay a portion of the Term Loan, and million of the Parent Termination Fee has been set aside in a restricted account to be used for future repayments of the Term Loan subject to limited rights of the Company to utilize such amounts for the purchase of inventory in the third quarters of fiscal 2024 and 2025. The million repayment was applied to the principal, interest and the 1.4x minimum guaranteed return, reducing the principal balance of the loan to million. With the termination of the Merger Agreement and the million repayment, the applicable minimum guaranteed return ranges between 1.4x and 1.7x of the principal and the consolidated core assets financial covenant is reduced to million. To access the million of restricted cash for inventory purchases, on the day of such election, the Company must certify to its lenders that the Company has pro forma consolidated core assets of million and no default or event of default under the Credit Agreement. During the three months ended September 28, 2024, the Company elected to draw down million of the restricted cash, which was subsequently received in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024. As of September 28, 2024, the Company was in compliance with the covenants under the Term Loan. 
 The Credit Agreement also contains customary events of default (subject to certain exceptions, thresholds and grace periods), such as the failure to pay obligations when due, breach of certain covenants, including the financial covenant, cross-default or cross-acceleration of certain indebtedness, bankruptcy-related defaults, judgment defaults, and the occurrence of certain change of control events involving the Company. The occurrence of an event of default may result in the termination of the Credit Agreement and acceleration of repayment obligations with respect to any outstanding loans or letters of credit under the Term Loan. 
 The obligations under the Term Loan are guaranteed by the Company and certain of its subsidiaries located in the United States, United Kingdom, Japan, France and Spain. In addition, the obligations under the Term Loan are secured by a first priority lien on substantially all tangible and intangible property of the Company and the guarantors and pledges of the equity of certain subsidiaries, in each case subject to certain exceptions, limitations and exclusions from the collateral. 
 Upon issuance, the Company elected to account for the Term Loan under the fair value option. The primary reason for electing the fair value option is for simplification and cost-benefit considerations of accounting for the Term Loan at fair value in its entirety versus bifurcation of the embedded features. The fair value of the Term Loan was determined using a discounted cash flow model which represents Level 3 measurements. The significant assumptions used in the discounted cash flow model include the amount and timing of future cash flows, expected interest rate volatility and the discount rate. 
 Under the fair value election, debt issuance costs are expensed as incurred, and debt liability is subsequently valued at fair market value, including paid in kind interest, during each reporting period until its settlement.

 Overview 
 iRobot is a leading global consumer robot company that designs and builds robots that empower people to do more. With over 30 years of artificial intelligence ("AI") and advanced robotics experience, we are focused on building thoughtful robots and developing intelligent home innovations that help make life better for millions of people around the world. iRobot's portfolio of home robots and smart home devices features proprietary technologies for the connected home and advanced concepts in cleaning, mapping and navigation. Leveraging this portfolio, we plan to add new capabilities and expand our offerings to help consumers make their homes easier to maintain, more efficient, more secure and healthier places to live. 
 Since our founding in 1990, we have developed the expertise necessary to design, build, sell and support durable, high-performance and cost-effective robots through the close integration of software, electronics and hardware. Following the introduction of the Roomba robotic vacuum cleaner in 2002, we have sold over 50 million consumer robots worldwide to become a global, market-leading consumer robotics innovator with a strong presence in a number of major geographic regions worldwide. Our core technologies serve as reusable building blocks that we adapt and expand to create next-generation robotic platforms. We believe that this approach accelerates the time to market, while also reducing the costs, time and other risks associated with product development. These capabilities are amplified by iRobot OS. The software intelligence of iRobot OS powers our portfolio of connected robotic floorcare products, enabling an expanding range of new features and thoughtful digital experiences that improve overall cleaning performance, personalization and control. By leveraging our considerable expertise and ongoing investment in AI, home understanding and machine vision technologies, iRobot OS provides consumers with greater control over where, when and how our robots work, simple integration with other smart home devices, thoughtful recommendations to further enhance the cleaning experience, and the ability to share and transfer home knowledge across multiple iRobot robots. We believe that the capabilities within iRobot OS will help support our long-term vision of building out a larger ecosystem that encompasses a broader range of robots. We believe that our significant expertise in robot design, engineering, and smart home technologies and targeted focus on understanding and addressing consumer needs, positions us well to expand our total addressable market and capitalize on the anticipated growth in a wider range of robotic and smart home categories over time.

During the first quarter of fiscal 2024, we launched the Roomba Combo Essential robot which replaces Roomba 600 Series with an added mopping function, more suction power, longer battery life and intelligent iRobot OS automations. This robot makes the 2-in-1 cleaning experience more accessible to customers given the lower price point. The Roomba Combo Essential robot is available in North America and EMEA and became available in APAC beginning in the second quarter of fiscal 2024. In addition, the Roomba Vac Essential was launched in North America as the vacuum-only version. These are the first products to benefit from our new contract manufacturing paradigm, taking advantage of their mature supply chains, expertise in design-for-manufacturing, and flexibility in component selection. In July 2024, we introduced the Roomba Combo 10 Max Robot + AutoWash dock, an advanced robot vacuum and mop which brings independent cleaning to a new level. The robot is engineered to powerfully vacuum and mop multiple floor types while the dock automatically refills and recharges the robot, washes and dries the mopping pad, empties debris, and self-cleans. This robot is our first entry into the fast-growing market segment of multifunctional docks and is our first robot floor cleaner to be compliant with the Matter smart home protocol and compatible with the Apple Home ecosystem. The launch represents an important milestone in our product innovation roadmap and is central to our strategy for Europe, where we aim to capitalize on growth opportunities at the high end of the market. Shipping of the Roomba Combo 10 Max Robot began in August 2024 through our DTC channels and select distributors and retailers in the U.S., Japan and EMEA. It will be available in remaining international markets during the fourth quarter of 2024. During the third quarter of fiscal 2024, we launched the 2-in-1 Roomba Combo 2 Essential robot and Roomba Vac 2 Essential robot in North America and Japan, followed by the launch in EMEA during October 2024. These robots are the first in our affordable Essential series that automatically empty their dust bin into an AutoEmpty dock after cleaning. The robots also provide twice the cleaning power of the original Essential series, an enhanced bumper design to more seamlessly navigate, and the ability to recharge and resume during cleaning missions. 
 Our total revenue for the nine months ended September 28, 2024 was 509.8 million, a decline of 73.2 million, or 12.6 , from revenue of 583.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Geographically, domestic revenue declined by 30.3 million, or 10.5 , and international revenue declined by 42.9 million, or 14.6 . Continuing from 2023, our revenue performance was impacted by lower orders from retailers and distributors largely resulting from a decline in consumer spending in the U.S. and Japan. The overall market conditions continue to be challenging with aggressive competition in EMEA and the U.S. We are leveraging our brand and innovative products to extend or reclaim our leadership positions in the mid and premium market segments as well as leveraging our new product launches that balance price point and cost profile to participate more fully in the entry market segment. Revenue from mid-tier robots (with an MSRP between 300 and 499) and premium robots (with an MSRP of 500 or more) represented 78 of total robot sales during the nine months ended September 28, 2024 versus 84 from the same period last year, reflecting the introduction of the Roomba Combo Essential, providing the iRobot 2-in-1 cleaning experience at a lower price point. 
 Entering the last quarter of 2024, we continue to focus on managing our cash and executing on our near-term robotic floorcare roadmaps. To achieve our goals for the year and set us up for success, we announced an operational restructuring plan that is designed to more closely align our cost structure with near-term revenue expectations and drive profitability. During the nine months ended September 28, 2024, we initiated an overall reduction of approximately 350 employees, which represents 31 of our global workforce as of December 30, 2023. During the nine months ended September 28, 2024, our operating expenses declined 93.5 million, or 26.7 , which excludes the one-time benefit of 75.2 million related to the Parent Termination Fee and the one-time benefit of 13.5 million related to an intellectual property litigation settlement ("Litigation Settlement"), compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. See Note 4 to our consolidated financial statements for additional details and charges related to the operational restructuring plan. During the third quarter of fiscal 2024, we continued to carefully manage our inventory to a level that better aligns with current revenue run rates and seasonality of the business. 
 Our operational restructuring plan has focused on cost savings and improving our gross margin and cash flow. During the second quarter of fiscal 2024, we launched "iRobot Elevate," which is a new strategy focused on growth. Elevate centers on 1) improving our financial performance, 2) increasing consumer focus to elevate our brand, 3) bringing innovative products to market in an entirely new and more profitable way, 4) continuing our operational and organization improvements, and 5) developing and retaining our best talent. 
 Termination of Merger Agreement 
 As previously disclosed, on August 4, 2022, we entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the "Original Merger Agreement") with Amazon.com, Inc., a Delaware corporation ("Parent" or "Amazon"), and Martin Merger Sub, Inc., a Delaware corporation and an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of Amazon ("Merger Sub"), providing for, among other things, the merger of Merger Sub with and into us, with us surviving the merger as a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent (the "Merger", and, together with the other transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement (as defined below), the "Transactions"). On July 24, 2023, iRobot, Amazon and Merger Sub entered into an amendment to the Original Merger Agreement (the "Amendment", and the Original Merger Agreement, as amended and supplemented by the Amendment, the "Merger Agreement"). The Amendment adjusted the merger consideration to reflect the incurrence of the Term Loan (see Note 9 to our consolidated financial statements). 
 23 

On January 28, 2024, we and Amazon mutually agreed to terminate the Merger Agreement and entered into a mutual termination agreement effective as of such date (the "Termination Agreement"). The termination of the Merger Agreement was approved by our Board of Directors. In accordance with the terms of the Termination Agreement, Amazon made a cash payment to us in the previously agreed amount of 94.0 million (the "Parent Termination Fee") on January 29, 2024. During the first quarter of fiscal 2024, as a result of the termination of the Merger Agreement and receipt of the Parent Termination Fee of 94.0 million from Amazon, we made a payment of 18.8 million for professional fees incurred in connection with the Transactions. In accordance with the terms of the Credit Agreement, we applied 35.0 million to repay a portion of the Term Loan. The remaining 40.0 million of the Parent Termination Fee was set aside as restricted cash to be used for future repayments of the Term Loan subject to limited rights of us to utilize such amounts for the purchase of inventory. The Parent Termination Fee received net of professional fees paid was 75.2 million and was recorded during the first quarter of fiscal 2024 as a benefit in Operating Expense, which is classified in general and administrative expenses on the consolidated statements of operations. 
 
 Key Financial Metrics and Non-GAAP Financial Measures 
 In addition to the measures presented in our consolidated financial statements in accordance with GAAP, we use the following key metrics, including non-GAAP financial measures, to evaluate and analyze our core operating performance and trends, and to develop short-term and long-term operational plans. The most directly comparable financial measures to the following non-GAAP metrics calculated under U.S. GAAP are gross profit, gross margin, operating income (loss) and operating margin. During the three months ended September 28, 2024 and September 30, 2023, we had gross profit of 62.4 million and 48.0 million, gross margin of 32.2 and 25.8 , operating income (loss) of 7.3 million and 59.5) million and operating margin of 3.8 and (32.0) , respectively. During the nine months ended September 28, 2024 and September 30, 2023, we had gross profit of 125.9 million and 138.2 million, gross margin of 24.7 and 23.7 , operating loss of 41.9) million and 211.8) million and operating margin of (8.2) and (36.3) , respectively. A summary of key metrics for the three and nine months ended September 28, 2024, as compared to the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, is as follows: 
 Three Months Ended Nine Months Ended September 28, 2024 September 30, 2023 September 28, 2024 September 30, 2023 (dollars in thousands, except average gross selling prices) (unaudited) Total Revenue 193,435 186,176 509,811 583,036 Non-GAAP Gross Profit 62,764 49,414 127,432 142,228 Non-GAAP Gross Margin 32.4 26.5 25.0 24.4 Non-GAAP Operating Income (Loss) 15,069 (40,649) (73,083) (153,449) Non-GAAP Operating Margin

The metrics for each period are presented in accordance with this updated methodology; as a result, the third quarter and the nine months ended September 30, 2023 differ from those previously presented by the amount of IP litigation expense, net recorded in such period. 
 Our non-GAAP financial measures reflect adjustments based on the following items. These non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered a substitute for, or superior to, financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP, and the financial results calculated in accordance with GAAP and reconciliations from these results, provided below, should be carefully evaluated. 
 Amortization of acquired intangible assets: Amortization of acquired intangible assets consists of amortization of intangible assets including completed technology, customer relationships, and reacquired distribution rights acquired in connection with business combinations as well as any non-cash impairment charges associated with intangible assets in connection with our past acquisitions. Amortization charges for our acquisition-related intangible assets are inconsistent in size and are significantly impacted by the timing and valuation of our acquisitions. 
 24 

Net Merger, Acquisition and Divestiture (Income) Expense: Net merger, acquisition and divestiture (income) expense primarily consists of transaction fees, professional fees, and transition and integration costs directly associated with mergers, acquisitions and divestitures, including with respect to the Merger. It also includes business combination adjustments including adjustments after the measurement period has ended. During the first quarter of fiscal 2024, the adjustment included the impact of the Termination Agreement and receipt of the Parent Termination Fee. 
 Stock-Based Compensation: Stock-based compensation is a non-cash charge relating to stock-based awards. 
 Restructuring and Other: Restructuring charges are related to one-time actions associated with realigning resources, enhancing operational productivity and efficiency, or improving our cost structure in support of our strategy. Such actions are not reflective of ongoing operations and include costs primarily associated with severance and related costs, charges related to paused work unrelated to our core business, costs associated with the Chief Executive Officer transition and other non-recurring costs directly associated with resource realignments tied to strategic initiatives or changes in business conditions. 
 Gain/Loss on Strategic Investments: Gain/loss on strategic investments includes fair value adjustments, realized gains and losses on the sales of these investments and losses on the impairment of these investments. 
 Debt issuance costs: Debt issuance costs include various incremental fees and commissions paid to third parties in connection with the issuance of debt. 
 Income tax adjustments: Income tax adjustments include the tax effect of the non-GAAP adjustments, calculated using the appropriate statutory tax rate for each adjustment. We regularly assess the need to record valuation allowances based on the non-GAAP profitability and other factors. We also exclude certain tax items, including the impact from stock-based compensation windfalls/shortfalls, which are not reflective of income tax expense incurred as a result of current period earnings. 
 We exclude these items from our non-GAAP measures to facilitate an evaluation of our current operating performance and comparisons to our past operating performance. These items may vary significantly in magnitude or timing and do not necessarily reflect anticipated future operating activities. In addition, we believe that providing these non-GAAP measures affords investors a view of our operating results that may be more easily compared with our peer companies.

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 
 Our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, expenses and related disclosures. Our estimates and assumptions are based on historical experience and various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results and outcomes may differ from our estimates and assumptions. 
 The critical accounting policies affected most significantly by estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements are described in Item 7 of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 30, 2023, filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on February 27, 2024. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate the critical accounting policies used to prepare our consolidated financial statements.

 Revenue for the three months ended September 28, 2024 increased 7.3 million to 193.4 million, or 3.9 , from 186.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase was primarily attributable to a 19.4 million, or 22.6 increase in domestic revenue, partially offset by a 12.1 million, or 12.0 decrease in international revenue, which reflected decreases of 20.2 in Japan and 11.5 in EMEA compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in domestic revenue during the third quarter of fiscal 2024 was primarily related to the timing of certain large orders. In contrast, the decrease in international revenue was driven by reduced demand due to declining consumer sentiment and continuing increased competition in the market, which required additional promotional activities and pricing adjustments. The increase in revenue also reflected an increase of 16.7 in total robots shipped, partially offset by a 5.4 decrease in gross average selling price for the three months ended September 28, 2024, compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023.

Revenue for the nine months ended September 28, 2024 decreased 73.2 million to 509.8 million, or 12.6 , from 583.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Geographically, in the nine months ended September 28, 2024, domestic revenue decreased 30.3 million, or 10.5 , and international revenue decreased 42.9 million, or 14.6 , which reflected decreases of 24.4 in Japan and 12.4 in EMEA. The decrease in revenue during the nine months ended September 28, 2024 was primarily driven by reduced demand due to declining consumer sentiment, continuing increased competition in the market, requiring additional promotional activities and pricing adjustments, as well as unfavorable exchange rate changes on Japanese Yen. Excluding the unfavorable foreign currency impact, Japan revenue decreased 17.5 over the same period in the prior year. The decrease in revenue also reflected a decrease of 7.0 in total robots shipped and a 7.1 decrease in gross average selling price for the nine months ended September 28, 2024, compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease in gross average selling price was primarily due to the launch of Roomba Combo Essential and Roomba Vac Essential robots, which are offered at a lower price point.

 Cost of product revenue decreased to 131.1 million in the three months ended September 28, 2024, compared to 137.9 million in the three months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease was primarily driven by lower product costs from our new products with a better cost profile, as well as cost reductions on existing products during the year. The decrease was also driven by the reduced people-related costs as a result of our restructuring activities. The decrease was also attributable to lower charges related to excess material during the three months ended September 28, 2024. 
 Cost of product revenue decreased to 383.9 million in the nine months ended September 28, 2024, compared to 443.9 million in the nine ended September 30, 2023. The decrease was primarily driven by the 12.6 decrease in revenue, offset by adjustments for obsolete or excess inventory and losses on purchase commitments in the nine months ended September 28, 2024. During the second quarter of fiscal 2024, we finalized our 2025 product roadmap as part of our transition to a new contract manufacturing paradigm. As a result, we evaluated our component inventory on-hand and non-cancelable purchase commitments with our contract manufacturers and suppliers and recorded a charge totaling 18.4 million. This charge includes a 10.3 million non-cash reserve for obsolete or excess component inventory and a 8.1 million charge for losses on non-cancelable purchase commitments.

 Gross margin increased to 32.2 in the three months ended September 28, 2024, compared to 25.8 in the three months ended September 30, 2023. Gross margin increased 6.4 percentage points primarily driven by favorable impact from lower product costs which is driven by new products with a better cost profile, as well as cost reductions on existing products during the year. The decrease was also driven by reduced people-related costs as a result of the restructuring activities and improved leverage on our fixed costs due to increased revenue during the three months ended September 28, 2024. The increase in gross margin is partially offset by continued increases in promotional and pricing activities. Although we have taken a wide range of actions to drive gross margin improvement through a multitude of product cost optimization, manufacturing and supply chain initiatives that have been implemented over the past few quarters, our ability to deliver sustainable gross margin improvement will largely depend on our ability to drive revenue growth and seasonality of our business. 
 Gross margin increased to 24.7 in the nine months ended September 28, 2024, compared to 23.7 in the nine months ended September 30, 2023.

Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 At September 28, 2024, our cash and cash equivalents were 99.4 million. We also had 42.4 million in restricted cash, 41.1 million of which is set aside for future repayment of the Term Loan subject to limited rights of us to utilize such amounts for the purchase of inventory in the third quarters of fiscal 2024 and 2025. During the three months ended September 28, 2024, we elected to draw down 40.0 million of the restricted cash, which was subsequently received in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024. The remaining 1.4 million is used for collateral for our credit card program and to secure the outstanding letters of credit and was included in other assets. Our working capital, which represents our total current assets less total current liabilities, was 131.1 million as of September 28, 2024, compared to 178.3 million as of December 30, 2023. Cash and cash equivalents held by our foreign subsidiaries totaled 20.5 million as of September 28, 2024. The undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries remain permanently reinvested outside of the United States as of September 28, 2024. 
 On January 28, 2024, we and Amazon mutually agreed to terminate the Merger Agreement and entered into a mutual termination agreement effective as of such date. In accordance with the terms of the Termination Agreement, Amazon made a cash payment to us in the previously agreed amount of 94.0 million on January 29, 2024. During the first quarter of 2024, as a result of the termination of the Merger Agreement and receipt of the Parent Termination Fee of 94.0 million from Amazon, we made a payment of 18.8 million for professional fees incurred in connection with the Transactions. In accordance with the terms of the Credit Agreement, we applied 35.0 million to repay a portion of the Term Loan. The remaining 40.0 million of the proceeds was set aside in a restricted account to be used for future repayments of the Term Loan subject to our limited rights to utilize such amounts for the purchase of inventory in the third quarters of fiscal 2024 and 2025. 
 We manufacture and distribute our products through contract manufacturers and third-party logistics providers. We believe this approach gives us the advantages of relatively low capital investment and significant flexibility in scheduling production and managing inventory levels. By leasing our office facilities, we also minimize the cash needed for expansion, and only invest periodically in leasehold improvements, a portion of which is often reimbursed by the landlords of these facilities. Accordingly, our capital spending is generally limited to leasehold improvements, business applications software and computer and equipment. With the shift to the new contract manufacturing paradigm in 2024, we are spending significantly less on tooling and machinery than in previous periods. During the nine months ended September 28, 2024 and September 30, 2023, we spent 0.1 million and 3.1 million, respectively, on capital expenditures. 
 Our strategy for delivering consumer products to our distributors and retail customers gives us the flexibility to provide container shipments directly from our contract manufacturers in Southern China, Malaysia and other areas of APAC to our customers or, alternatively, allows our distributors and certain retail customers to take possession of product on a domestic basis. Accordingly, our inventory consists of goods shipped to our third-party logistics providers for the fulfillment of distributor, retail and direct-to-consumer sales. Our contract manufacturers are also responsible for purchasing and stocking components required for the production of our products, and they typically invoice us when the finished goods are shipped. 
 Cash used in operating activities 
 Net cash used in operating activities for the nine months ended September 28, 2024 was 30.5 million, of which the principal components were our net loss of 68.4 million and the cash ouflow of 16.2 million from change in working capital, offset by non-cash charges of 54.1 million. The change in working capital was driven by net cash outflows of 22.1 million from accounts receivable, 15.8 million from accrued expenses and other liabilities, and 10.5 million from inventory, partially offset by net cash inflow of 16.7 million from accounts payable. During the nine months ended September 28, 2024, the net cash used in operating activities benefited from the one-time receipt of the Parent Termination Fee, net of professional fees paid of 75.2 million in first quarter of fiscal 2024, as a result of the termination of the Merger Agreement. 
 Cash used in investing activities 
 Net cash used in investing activities for the nine months ended September 28, 2024 was 0.2 million and related to the purchase of computers and software and the purchase of investments.

During the nine months ended September 28, 2024, we sold an aggregate of 1.9 million shares under the ATM Agreement and received net proceeds of 19.4 million.

Debt 
 Term Loan 
 On July 24, 2023, we entered into a Credit Agreement (the "Credit Agreement") by and among us, as borrower, each lender from time to time party thereto and TCG Senior Funding L.L.C., an affiliate of The Carlyle Group, as administrative agent and collateral agent, providing for a 200.0 million senior secured term loan credit facility (the "Term Loan"). During fiscal 2023, we received total proceeds from the Term Loan of 188.2 million, net of 11.8 million of debt issuance costs. During the first quarter of 2024, as a result of the termination of the Merger Agreement and receipt of the Parent Termination Fee of 94.0 million from Amazon on January 29, 2024, 35.0 million of such Parent Termination Fee was used immediately to repay a portion of the Term Loan. The Term Loan matures on July 24, 2026 with additional terms more fully described in Note 9 to our consolidated financial statements. 
 Lines of Credit 
 As of September 28, 2024, we had letters of credit outstanding of 0.4 million with Bank of America, N.A. The letters of credit were collateralized with a cash deposit. 
 We have an unsecured guarantee line of credit with Mizuho, Bank Ltd., available to fund import tax payments up to an aggregate outstanding amount of 250.0 million Japanese Yen. As of September 28, 2024, we had no outstanding balance under the guarantee line of credit. 
 ATM Equity Offering 
 In February 2024, we entered into an ATM Equity Offering Sales Agreement (the "ATM Agreement") with BofA Securities, Inc. ("BofA") pursuant to which we may offer and sell, from time to time, at our option, up to an aggregate of 100.0 million in shares of Common Stock through BofA, as sales agent, in an "at the market" offering. The shares will be offered and sold pursuant to an effective automatic shelf registration statement on Form S-3, which was originally filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on February 27, 2024. BofA will receive a commission up to 3.00 of the aggregate gross sales proceeds of any Common Stock sold through BofA under the ATM Agreement. 
 During the three and nine months ended September 28, 2024, we sold an aggregate of 0.2 million and 1.9 million shares under the ATM Agreement, respectively, and received net proceeds of 1.4 million and 19.4 million, respectively. The issuance costs incurred in connection with the offering were 0.1 million and 1.1 million during the three and nine months ended September 28, 2024, respectively. As of September 28, 2024, 79.6 million remained available for further sale under the ATM Agreement. 
 Liquidity 
 The accompanying unaudited consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming that we will continue as a going concern, which contemplates the continuity of operations, realization of assets, and liquidation of liabilities in the normal course of business. 
 In the third quarter of fiscal 2024, our performance continued to be impacted by lower orders from retailers and distributors largely resulting from a decline in consumer sentiment and increased pricing competition in the market. During the nine months ended September 28, 2024, our revenue declined 12.6 , compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Our operating loss of 41.9 million and operating cash outflows of 30.5 million for the nine months ended September 28, 2024 benefited from the one-time receipt of the Parent Termination Fee net of professional fees paid of 75.2 million during the first quarter of fiscal 2024. Our operating loss also includes the one-time benefit of 13.5 million related to the Litigation Settlement during the third quarter of fiscal 2024 with cash received subsequently in October. At September 28, 2024, our cash and cash equivalents were 99.4 million. We also had 42.4 million in restricted cash. During the three months ended September 28, 2024, we elected to draw down 40.0 million of the restricted cash which was subsequently received in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024. The cash will be used for the purchase of inventory and is required to be repaid within five months in accordance with the terms of the loan agreement. It will then be available again during the third quarter of 2025 for purchases of inventory. 
 We have considered and assessed our ability to continue as a going concern for the one year from the date that the unaudited consolidated financial statements are issued. Our assessment included the preparation of cash flow forecasts taking into account our restructuring actions and maintaining debt covenant compliance. On January 29, 2024, following the termination of the Merger Agreement, we announced an operational restructuring plan to more closely align our cost structure with near-term revenue expectations and drive profitability. The 2024 operational restructuring plan is structured to: 
 achieve gross margin improvements through a focus on design-to-value and more beneficial terms with our existing and new manufacturing partners; 
 lower research and development expenditure by pausing work unrelated to our core floorcare business and shifting to greater reliance on contract manufacturers as it relates to the lower-value commodity engineering work; 
 33 

return selling and marketing expenditures to a more normalized level, consistent with industry standards in the consumer products market, by centralizing resources on more limited geographies and consolidating marketing efforts for efficiencies; and 
 further reduce headcount by approximately 350 employees, which represents approximately 31 of our global workforce as of December 30, 2023. 
 During the nine months ended September 28, 2024, we made significant progress in implementing our 2024 operational restructuring plan. Our total operating expenses declined 93.5 million, or 26.7 , which excludes the one-time benefits of 75.2 million related to the Parent Termination Fee and 13.5 million related to the Litigation Settlement, compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Research and development expenses decreased 39.8 million, or 34.2 , while selling and marketing expenses decreased 40.7 million, or 29.1 , during the nine months ended September 28, 2024. Gross margin improved to 32.2 during the third quarter of fiscal 2024, compared to 25.8 during the third quarter of 2023. In addition to the reduction of our headcount, we entered into or amended three sublease agreements between fiscal 2022 and 2024 to sublease portions of our headquarters. We expect these sublease agreements will generate 6.1 million in sublease cash payments in the future over the remaining lease terms. We expect to continue to right size our global real estate footprint through additional subleasing at our corporate headquarters and the elimination of offices in smaller, underperforming geographies. We continue to evaluate our cost structure, and in November 2024, as part of the ongoing restructuring plan, we announced an additional round of workforce reductions, totaling approximately 105 employees. Since the start of 2024 and including this new action, we have reduced our global workforce by approximately 50 . 
 Inventory has consumed a significant amount of cash and we continue to manage our inventory level carefully to ensure efficiency in our working capital. Days in inventory has improved from 161 days during the third quarter of fiscal 2023 to 104 days in the third quarter of fiscal 2024. We plan to continue to manage our inventory to a level that aligns with current run rates and seasonality of the business. 
 While we estimate such actions will be sufficient to allow us to maintain our debt covenant compliance, and our liquidity and our operations in the ordinary course for at least 12 months from the issuance of these financial statements, there can be no assurance we will meet our debt covenant compliance and generate sufficient future cash flows from operations due to potential factors, including, but not limited to, further inflation, higher interest rates, ongoing recessionary conditions or continued reduced demand for our products due to consumer sentiment or competition. If we are not successful in increasing demand for our products, or if macroeconomic conditions further constrain consumer demand, we may continue to experience adverse impacts to revenue and profitability. Additional actions within our control to maintain our liquidity and operations include optimizing our production volumes with contract manufacturers by reducing inventory supply forecast for cancellable purchase orders, further reducing discretionary spending in all areas of the business and realigning resources through ongoing attrition without rehiring activity. In addition, we may need additional financing, including public or private equity or debt financing, to execute on our current or future business strategy, and additional financing may not be available or on terms favorable to us. 
 The consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments to reflect the possible future effects on the recoverability and classification of assets or the amounts and classification of liabilities that may result from the outcome of these uncertainties. 
 Contractual Obligations 
 The disclosure of our contractual obligations and commitments is set forth under the heading "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Contractual Obligations" in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 30, 2023. Our principal commitments generally consist of obligations under the Term Loan, leases for office space, inventory related purchase obligations, and minimum contractual obligations. Other obligations consist primarily of subscription services. 
 As of September 28, 2024, we had outstanding purchase orders aggregating approximately 104.6 million. The purchase orders are typically related to the purchase of inventory and marketing and media spend in the normal course of business. Included in these outstanding purchase orders is 41.2 million related to inventory purchases at our contract manufacturers, of which 22.7 million are not cancellable without penalty. 
 We utilize contract manufacturers to build our products and accessories. These contract manufacturers manage the supply of components, capacity and resources to build products based on a forecasted production plan, which typically covers a rolling 12-month period. During the normal course of business, and in order to ensure adequate supply, we enter into purchase commitments with contract manufacturers and suppliers. In certain instances, these purchase commitments allow us the option to cancel, reschedule and/or adjust the supply requirements based on our business needs for a period of time before the order is due to be fulfilled. In some instances, these purchase commitments are not cancellable in the event of a change in demand or other circumstance, such as where the contract manufacturer and/or supplier has built products, semi-finished products or procured and/or order unique, iRobot-specific designs, and/or specific non-cancellable, non-returnable components based on the provided forecasts. If we cancel all or part of the orders, or materially reduce forecasted orders, in certain circumstances we 
 34 

may be liable to our contract manufacturers for the cost of the excess components purchased by our contract manufacturers based on the forecasted production plan and the purchase terms of its component suppliers. As a result, we evaluated our component inventory on-hand and non-cancelable purchase commitments with our contract manufacturers and suppliers and recorded a charge totaling 18.4 million in cost of product revenue in the second quarter of fiscal 2024. This charge included a 10.3 million non-cash reserve for obsolete or excess component inventory and a 8.1 million charge for losses on non-cancellable purchase commitments. The loss on purchase commitments is included in accrued manufacturing and logistics cost on the consolidated balance sheets.

 Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosure About Market Risk 
 Exchange Rate Sensitivity 
 Our international revenue and expenses are denominated in multiple currencies, including British Pounds, Canadian Dollars, Chinese Renminbi, Euros and Japanese Yen. As such, we have exposure to adverse changes in exchange rates associated with the revenue and operating expenses of our foreign operations. Any fluctuations in other currencies will have minimal direct impact on our international revenue. Based on transactions denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar as of September 28, 2024, a hypothetical change of 10 would have resulted in an impact on revenue of approximately 5 million and 16 million for the three and nine months ended September 28, 2024, respectively. 
 In addition to international business conducted in foreign currencies, we have international revenue denominated in U.S. dollars. As the U.S. dollar strengthens or weakens against other currencies, our international distributors may be impacted, which could affect their profitability and our ability to maintain current pricing levels on our international consumer products. 
 We do not currently use foreign exchange contracts or derivatives that are designated as cash flow hedges to hedge any foreign currency exposures for accounting purposes. The volatility of exchange rates depends on many factors that we cannot forecast with reliable accuracy, such fluctuations could have a significant impact on our future results of operations. 
 We enter into economic hedges that are not designated as hedges from an accounting standpoint to reduce or eliminate the effects of foreign exchange rate changes typically related to short term trade receivables and payables. These contracts have maturities of one month or less. At September 28, 2024 and December 30, 2023, we had outstanding economic hedges with a total notional value of 11.9 million and 252.0 million, respectively. 
 
 Item 4. Controls and Procedures 
 Our management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) of the Exchange Act) as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based on that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this report were effective at a reasonable assurance level in ensuring that information required to be disclosed by us in reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act (i) is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission's rules and forms; and (ii) accumulated and communicated to management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely discussions regarding required disclosure. We believe that a control system, no matter how well designed and operated, cannot provide absolute assurance that the objectives of the control system are met, and no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within a company have been detected. 
 There was no change in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) of the Exchange Act) that occurred during the period covered by this report that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

Part II. Other Information 
 Item 1. Legal Proceedings 
 From time to time and in the ordinary course of business, we are subject to various claims, charges and litigation. The outcome of litigation cannot be predicted with certainty and some lawsuits, claims or proceedings may be disposed of unfavorably to us, which could materially affect our financial condition or results of operations. See Note 12 to our consolidated financial statements for a description of certain of our legal proceedings. 
 
 Item 1A. Risk Factors 
 We operate in a rapidly changing environment that involves a number of risks that could materially affect our business, financial condition or future results, some of which are beyond our control. In addition to the other information set forth in this report, the risks and uncertainties that we believe are most important for you to consider are discussed in Part I, "Item 1A. Risk Factors" in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 30, 2023 and in our Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q for the period ended March 30, 2024 and June 29, 2024, which could materially affect our business, financial condition or future results. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us, which we currently deem immaterial or which are similar to those faced by other companies in our industry or business in general, may also impair our business operations. There are no material changes to the Risk Factors described in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 30, 2023 or in our Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q for the period ended March 30, 2024 and June 29, 2024, other than as set forth below: 
 We are transitioning primarily to a single contract manufacturer, and our reputation and results of operations would be harmed if the contract manufacturer fails to meet our requirements. 
 We depend on third-party contract manufacturers to produce our products. For fiscal 2023, we purchased 79 of our finished goods from one vendor. Starting in 2025, we will primarily depend on a single contract manufacturer, Shenzhen 3irobotix Co., Ltd. d/b/a Picea ("Picea"), located in China, to manufacture our products. Our agreement with Picea is scheduled to expire on August 17, 2025, but it can be extended if both parties agree in writing. Either party has the option to terminate the agreement for convenience with 180 days' advance written notice. 
 These manufacturers manage the supply chain for all of the raw materials and provide all facilities and labor required to manufacture our products. If Picea terminates its arrangement with us or fails to provide the required capacity and quality on a timely basis, there would be a disruption in manufacturing our products until replacement contract manufacturing services could be obtained or volume transferred to an alternative manufacturing partner, each of which is a costly and time-consuming process. We cannot assure you that we would be able to establish alternative manufacturing arrangements on acceptable terms or in a timely manner. Any significant interruption in manufacturing at Picea would reduce the supply of our products, which could cause a delay in fulfillment of our orders or breach of our agreements with distribution partners, which in turn would reduce our revenue. Any adverse change in Picea's financial or business conditions could disrupt our ability to supply our products. 
 Our reliance on these contract manufacturers involves certain risks, including the following: 
 lack of direct control over production capacity and delivery schedules; 
 lack of direct control over quality assurance, manufacturing yields and production costs; 
 lack of enforceable contractual provisions over the production and costs of consumer products; 
 risk of loss of inventory while in transit; 
 risk of increased shipping costs as a result of rebel attacks on commercial ships. 
 Any interruption in the manufacture of our products would be likely to result in delays in shipment, lost sales and revenue and damage to our reputation in the market, all of which would harm our business and results of operations. In addition, because our purchase contracts with contract manufacturers are typically denominated in U.S. dollars, changes in currency exchange rates may impact our contract manufacturers who operate in local currency, which may cause our suppliers to seek price concessions on future orders. 
 We depend on the experience and expertise of our senior management team and key technical employees, and the loss of any key employee may impair our ability to operate effectively. 
 Our success depends upon the continued services of our senior management team and key technical employees. Each of our executive officers, key technical personnel and other employees could terminate his or her relationship with us at any time. The loss of any member of our senior management team or key technical employee might significantly delay or prevent the achievement of our business objectives, result in a loss of institutional know-how and could materially harm our business and customer relationships. In addition, because of the highly technical nature of our robots, the loss of any significant number of our existing engineering and project management personnel could have a material adverse effect on our business and operating results. Also, increased turnover, particularly on the senior management team, with insufficient development of leadership 
 36 

talent and succession plans, could diminish employee confidence and increase risks for retaining key employees. Our failure to successfully attract well-qualified employees, retain and motivate existing employees or integrate new members of our senior management team and key employees, could materially and adversely affect our operations and our ability to execute our strategy. Leadership transitions and management changes can be inherently difficult to manage and may cause uncertainty or a disruption to our business or may increase the likelihood of turnover in key employees and senior management. In addition, recently appointed members of senior management may view our business differently than prior members, and have made and may continue to make changes to our strategic focus, operations, business plans, existing personnel and their responsibilities. We may not be able to properly manage such shifts in focus, and any changes to our business may not ultimately prove successful. Further, changes in our senior management team may be disruptive to our business, and any failure to successfully transition and assimilate key new hires or promoted employees could adversely affect our business and results of operations. 
 By the end 2024, most of our senior management team will have turned over during the course of the year. In January 2024, Colin Angle stepped down as Chief Executive Officer and chairman of our board of directors and our board of directors appointed Glen Weinstein, our then Executive Vice President and Chief Legal Officer, as interim Chief Executive Officer. In May 2024, our board of directors appointed Gary S. Cohen as Chief Executive Officer, in June 2024, Faris Habbaba stepped down as our Chief Research and Development Officer and in August 2024, our board of directors appointed Jeff Engel as President and Chief Operating Officer. Effective December 2024, Russ Campanello will step down as Executive Vice President, Human Resources and Corporate Communications, and Jules Connelly will be appointed as Senior Vice President and Chief Human Resources Officer. Additionally, Julie Zeiler will step down as Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, and Karian Wong will be appointed as Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. These changes in our management team could cause retention and morale concerns among current employees, as well as operational risks. If this leadership transition is not successful, it could disrupt our business, affect our culture, cause employee retention concerns, be viewed negatively by our customers or investors, and affect our financial condition and operational results. 
 If we are unable to attract and retain additional skilled personnel, we may be unable to operate our business. 
 To execute our business stabilization plan and return to profitability, we must attract and retain additional, highly-qualified personnel. Competition for hiring these employees is intense, especially with regard to engineers with high levels of experience in designing, developing and integrating robots and engineers with expertise in artificial intelligence, machine learning, data science and cloud applications. Many of the companies with which we compete for hiring experienced employees have greater resources than we have. If we fail to attract new technical personnel or fail to retain and motivate our current employees, our business and future growth prospects could be severely harmed. 
 In addition, we have experienced increased employee turnover as a result of general market conditions, the impact of reductions in force executed in August 2022, February 2023 and the first half of 2024, and the termination of the proposed acquisition by Amazon. These factors may cause additional attrition and affect the morale of our current employees and might adversely affect our reputation among job seekers. Significant or prolonged turnover or revised hiring priorities may negatively affect our operations and culture, as well as our ability to successfully maintain our processes and procedures. New hires require significant training and, in most cases, take significant time before they achieve full productivity. New employees may not become as productive as we expect, and we may be unable to hire or retain significant numbers of qualified individuals. Moreover, we may be forced to adjust salaries or other compensation in order to retain key talent. Job seekers and existing personnel often consider the value of the equity awards they receive in connection with their employment. The recent decline in our stock price may impact the actual or perceived value of our equity awards for current employees or new hires, and we may need to grant additional or larger equity awards to offer attractive compensation packages to hire and retain employees. If our retention efforts are not successful or our team member turnover rate continues to increase in the future, our business, results of operations and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected. 
 Additionally, as we are operating our business with fewer employees, we face additional risks that we might not be able to execute on our strategic plans and product roadmap, which may have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and operating results. 
 37 

Cybersecurity risks could adversely affect our business and disrupt our operations. 
 The threats to network and data security are increasingly diverse and sophisticated. Despite our efforts and processes to prevent breaches, our devices, as well as our servers, computer systems, and those of third parties that we use in our operations are vulnerable to personnel misconduct, cybersecurity risks, including cyber attacks such as viruses and worms, phishing attacks, distributed denial-of-service attacks, ransomware, and similar disruptions from unauthorized tampering with our servers and computer systems or those of third parties that we use in our operations, which could lead to interruptions, delays, loss of critical data, and loss of consumer confidence. In addition, we may be the target of numerous attack vectors and methods, including email scams, social engineering, smishing, vishing, and identity spoofing, which attempt to acquire sensitive information or company assets. Despite our efforts to create security barriers to such threats, we may not be able to entirely mitigate these risks. These threats may be increased due to work-from-home policies implemented by us and our customers, suppliers and distributors. Any cyber attack that attempts to obtain our data and assets, disrupt our service, or otherwise access our systems, or those of third parties we use, if successful, could adversely affect our business, operating results, and financial condition, be expensive to remedy, and damage our reputation. Our cyber insurance may not protect against all of the costs and liabilities arising from a cyber attack.
