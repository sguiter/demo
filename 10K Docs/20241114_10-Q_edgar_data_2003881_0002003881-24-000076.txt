 hotel properties and assumed a mortgage loan secured by the hotel properties (the Initial Portfolio from Ashford Hospitality Limited Partnership Ashford Hospitality OP and Ashford TRS Corporation Ashford Hospitality TRS, and together with Ashford Hospitality OP, the Anchor Investor ), each a subsidiary of Ashford Hospitality Trust, Inc. Ashford Trust ), in exchange for Class I units of Stirling OP pursuant to the terms of the contribution agreement (the Contribution Agreement ), by and among Stirling OP and the Anchor Investor. The gross contribution value was million. Additionally, Stirling OP assumed a mortgage loan with a carrying value of million. The acquisition also included million of net working capital and reserves and was subject to customary post-closing adjustments resulting in a net contribution value of the Initial Portfolio of million. During the three months ended March 31, 2024, estimated working capital and reserves were finalized resulting in the Anchor Investor returning Class I units totaling approximately to Stirling OP. The final net contribution value of the Initial Portfolio was million. 
 The Company determined the acquisition of the Initial Portfolio resulted in Ashford Trust becoming the primary beneficiary of Stirling OP in contemplation of: 1) the related party group comprised of (i) Ashford Trust and (ii) the stockholders who have control over election or removal of the board of directors of the Company that have power to direct the most significant activities of Stirling OP; and 2) the consideration that substantially all the economics are held by Ashford Trust through its equity interest, and substantially all of the activities are performed on Ashford Trust s behalf. As a result, Ashford Trust began consolidating Stirling OP as of December 6, 2023. 
 Pursuant to the Contribution Agreement, the Anchor Investor entered into a lock-up agreement with respect to its Class I units that restrict the assignment, sale, and transfer of the units for a period of following the closing of the transactions contemplated by the Contribution Agreement (the Lock-Up Agreement ). In addition, pursuant to the Lock-Up Agreement, the Anchor Investor is prohibited from redeeming the Class I units for a period of s following such closing. At the end of the period, the Class I units may be redeemed pursuant to the terms of the Stirling OP Agreement and any Class I units converted to shares of the Company s Class I common stock may be repurchased by the Company pursuant to the terms and conditions of the Company s share repurchase plan. In addition, the Anchor Investor agreed not to withdraw as a participant in the distribution reinvestment plan of Stirling OP, and thereby receive any distributions payable on its Class I units in additional Class I units, through December 31, 2024. 
 Concurrently with entry into the Contribution Agreement, the Company, directly or through its wholly owned subsidiaries, entered into the Advisory Agreement, the Stirling OP Agreement, the Master Hotel Management Agreement and the Master Project Management Agreement, each as described in additional detail in note 4.

 Distribution Reinvestment Plan 
 We have adopted a distribution reinvestment plan whereby stockholders will have their cash distributions automatically reinvested in additional shares of our common stock unless they elect to receive their distributions in cash. If stockholders participate in our distribution reinvestment plan, the cash distributions attributable to the class of shares that they own will be automatically invested in additional shares of the same class. The purchase price for shares purchased under our distribution reinvestment plan will be equal to the most recently disclosed transaction price for such shares at the time of the record date of the distribution. Stockholders will not pay upfront selling commissions or dealer manager fees when purchasing shares pursuant to the distribution reinvestment plan, but distribution fees will apply depending upon the class of shares purchased. Participants may terminate their participation in the distribution reinvestment plan with ten business days prior written notice to us. 
 Share Repurchase Plan 
 Stockholders may request on a monthly basis that we repurchase all or any portion of their shares pursuant to our share repurchase plan. We are not obligated to repurchase any shares and may choose to repurchase only some, or even none, of the shares that have been requested to be repurchased in any particular month in our discretion. In addition, our ability to fulfill repurchase requests is subject to a number of limitations. As a result, share repurchases may not be available each month. Under our share repurchase plan, to the extent we choose to repurchase shares in any particular month, we will only repurchase shares as of the opening of the last business day of that month (each such date, a Repurchase Date ). Repurchases will be made at the transaction price in effect on the Repurchase Date, except that shares that have not been outstanding for at least will be repurchased at of the transaction price (an Early Repurchase Deduction ). The end of the holding period will be measured as of the first business day immediately following the prospective repurchase date. Additionally, stockholders who have received shares of our common stock in exchange for their common units in Stirling OP may include the period of time such stockholder held such common units in Stirling OP for purposes of calculating the holding period for such shares of our

 of our aggregate NAV per month (measured using the aggregate NAV attributable to stockholders as of the end of the immediately preceding month) and no more than of our aggregate NAV per calendar quarter (measured using the aggregate NAV attributable to stockholders as of the end of the immediately preceding quarter). In the event that we determine to repurchase some but not all of the shares submitted for repurchase during any month, shares submitted for repurchase during such month will be repurchased on a pro rata basis after we have repurchased all shares for which repurchase has been requested due to death or disability. All unsatisfied repurchase requests must be resubmitted after the start of the next month or quarter, or upon the recommencement of the share repurchase plan, as applicable. Shares held by our Advisor or the Special Limited Partner acquired as payment of our Advisor s management fee or in respect of distributions on the performance participation interest, respectively, will not be subject to our share repurchase plan, including with respect to any repurchase limits or the Early Repurchase Deduction and will not be included in the calculation of our aggregate NAV for purposes of the monthly or quarterly limitations on repurchases.

 of aggregate NAV represented by the Class T, Class S, Class D and Class I shares. Additionally, to the extent Stirling OP issues Class T, Class S, Class D or Class I operating partnership units to parties other than the Company, Stirling OP will pay the Advisor a management fee equal to of the aggregate NAV of Stirling OP attributable to such Class T, Class S, Class D and Class I operating partnership units not held by the Company per annum payable monthly in arrears. No management fee will be paid with respect to Class E shares or Class E units of Stirling OP. The management fee is allocated on a class-specific basis and borne by all holders of the applicable class. The management fee will be paid, at the Advisor s election, in cash, Class E shares or Class E units of Stirling OP. If the Advisor elects to receive any portion of its management fee in Class E shares or Class E units of Stirling OP, the Company may be obligated to repurchase such Class E shares or Class E units from the Advisor at a later date. Such repurchases will be outside the Company s share repurchase plan and thus will not be subject to the repurchase limits of the share repurchase plan or any early repurchase deduction. 
 The Company does not intend to pay the Advisor any acquisition or other similar fees in connection with making investments. The Company will, however, reimburse the Advisor for out-of-pocket expenses in connection with the selection and acquisition of properties and real estate-related debt, whether or not such investments are acquired, and make payments to third parties in connection with making investments. 
 In addition to organization and offering expense and acquisition expense reimbursements, the Company will reimburse the Advisor for out-of-pocket costs and expenses it incurs in connection with the services it provides to the Company, including, but not limited to, (i) the actual cost of goods and services used by the Company and obtained from third parties, including fees paid to administrators, consultants, attorneys, technology providers and other service providers, and brokerage fees paid in connection with the purchase and sale of investments, (ii) expenses of managing and operating the Company s properties, whether payable to an affiliate or a non-affiliated person, and (iii) expenses related to personnel of the Advisor performing services for the Company other than those who provide investment advisory services or serve as executive officers of the Company.

 of the annual Total Return, subject to a annual Hurdle Amount and a High-Water Mark, with a Catch-Up (each term as will be defined in the Stirling OP Agreement). Such allocation will be measured on a calendar basis, made quarterly and accrued monthly. Class E units of Stirling OP will not be subject to the performance participation allocation. Distributions on the performance participation interest may be payable in cash or Class E units at the election of the Special Limited Partner. To the extent that the Special Limited Partner elects to receive such distributions in Class E units, the Special Limited Partner may request that Stirling OP repurchase such Class E units for cash at the then-current NAV per unit. Repurchase requests for Class E units will not be subject to the one-year hold period provided for other limited partners. 
 Master Hotel Management Agreement The Company, through Stirling TRS, entered into a master hotel management agreement (the Master Hotel Management Agreement with Remington Lodging Hospitality, LLC Remington Hospitality ), a wholly owned subsidiary of Ashford, to provide hotel and restaurant management services for certain of the Company s hotels. For providing these services, Remington Hospitality will receive a monthly base fee on assets managed that is equal to the greater of (i) (to be increased annually based on any increases in CPI over the preceding annual period) or (ii) of a property s gross revenues. Remington Hospitality may also earn an incentive management fee that is equal to the lesser of (i) of a hotel s gross revenues for each fiscal year and (ii) the amount by which the actual house profit exceeds the budgeted house profit determined on a property-by-property basis.

 The Company was formed on September 1, 2023 as a Maryland corporation and intends to qualify as a REIT for U.S. federal income tax purposes beginning with our taxable year ending December 31, 2024. Until that time, the Company will be subject to taxation at regular corporate rates under the Internal Revenue Code. If the Company qualifies for taxation as a REIT, we generally will not be subject to U.S. federal income taxes on our taxable income to the extent we annually distribute substantially all of our net taxable income to shareholders and maintain our qualification as a REIT. 
 In December 2023 the Company commenced a continuous private offering to accredited investors, pursuant to which it is offering for sale up to 1,000,000,000 in shares of common stock consisting of up to 900,000,000 in shares in the primary offering and up to 100,000,000 in shares pursuant to the distribution reinvestment plan. 
 On December 6, 2023, Stirling OP acquired four hotel properties and assumed a mortgage loan secured by the four hotel properties (the Initial Portfolio from Ashford Hospitality Limited Partnership Ashford Hospitality OP and Ashford TRS Corporation Ashford Hospitality TRS, and together with Ashford Hospitality OP, the Anchor Investor ), each a subsidiary of Ashford Trust, in exchange for Class I units of Stirling OP pursuant to the terms of the contribution agreement (the Contribution Agreement ), by and among Stirling OP and the Anchor Investor. The gross contribution value was 56.2 million which represented the appraised value of the Initial Portfolio as provided by LW Hospitality Advisors, an independent third-party appraiser engaged to value the Initial Portfolio with additional input and oversight by Altus Group U.S. Inc. and the Advisor. Additionally, Stirling OP assumed a mortgage loan with a carrying value of 30.2 million. The acquisition also included 9.0 million of net working capital and reserves and was subject to customary post-closing adjustments resulting in a net contribution value of the Initial Portfolio of 35.0 million. During the three months ended March 31, 2024, estimated working capital and reserves were finalized resulting in the Anchor Investor returning 4,423 Class I units totaling approximately 111,000 to Stirling OP. The resulting final net contribution value of the Initial Portfolio was 34.9 million. 
 Other than our investment in Stirling OP, we had neither engaged in any operations nor generated any revenues through September 30, 2024. Our entire activity from inception through September 30, 2024 primarily consisted of investment in Stirling OP and allocation of income (loss) from Stirling OP. When we receive proceeds from the sale of shares of our common 
 15 

stock in our continuous private offering, we will contribute such proceeds to Stirling OP and receive common units in Stirling OP that correspond to the classes of our shares sold. On September 5, 2023 we were capitalized with an initial investment of 25 from our initial stockholder (at such time) to us, which we contributed to Stirling OP and, in exchange, we received one Class I common unit from Stirling OP. W e have sold an additional 3,851 Class I common shares, 19 Class D common shares, 19 Class S common shares and 19 Class T common shares in the ongoing private offering, the proceeds of which we contributed to Stirling OP and, in exchange, we received an additional 3,851 Class I common units , 19 Class D common units, 19 Class S common units and 19 Class T common units from Stirling OP . We account for the common units acquired in Stirling OP as an equity method investment during any period our investment in Stirling OP is not considered significant to Stirling OP and will consolidate Stirling OP at such time our investment in Stirling OP is considered significant to Stirling OP (based on GAAP), and thereafter present the results of operations on a consolidated basis. We expect to invest our capital and all our offering proceeds in Stirling OP and hold no other assets other than Stirling OP common units. We therefore expect to eventually consolidate Stirling OP, and we have included the unaudited consolidated and combined consolidated financial statements of Stirling OP in Part II Item 5 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, as we believe a discussion of the performance and results of operations of Stirling OP would be meaningful to investors as our cash flows and operating results are driven by Stirling OP, and subsequent invested capital will be significant to the Company. 
 
 Current Market Conditions and Related Risks and Opportunities 
 The Company s business is materially affected by conditions in the financial markets and economic conditions in the United States. Rising interest rates and a reduction in the availability of financing, especially from banks, has led to greater spreads between the prices sought by sellers and buyers, which may adversely affect the value of our real estate assets. However, given that we are seeking to raise and invest substantial equity capital, we believe that market stresses could lead to attractive acquisition opportunities. While higher interest rates make financing more expensive, we are fortunate that our Initial Portfolio locked in a mortgage loan at a favorable fixed interest rate. 
 Recent Developments 
 On July 30, 2024, the Company entered into an Amended and Restated Dealer Manager Agreement (the A R Agreement with the Dealer Manager to reflect that the distribution fee paid on the Company s Class T, Class S and Class D shares sold in its offering will cease when underwriting compensation paid by the Company reaches the 8.75 limit provided for in the A R Agreement (or such lower limit as set forth in any applicable agreement between the Dealer Manager and a participating dealer at the time the shares were issued). Previously the limit was calculated irrespective of the source of funding for the fees. 
 On August 1, 2024, the Company filed Articles of Amendment with the Maryland State Department of Assessments and Taxation specifying that the limit at which Class T, Class S and Class D shares convert into an equivalent aggregate net asset value of Class I shares is determined based on upfront selling commissions, dealer manager fees and distribution fees paid by the Company. Previously the limit was calculated irrespective of the source of funding for the fees. The Articles of Amendment were effective upon filing. 
 On November 1, 2024, Stirling Inc. issued approximately 2,481 shares of Class I common stock for gross proceeds of 65,000, based on the net asset value per share of the Class I common shares as of September 30, 2024, the proceeds of which were contributed to Stirling OP and, in exchange, Stirling OP issued approximately 2,481 Class I common units to Stirling Inc. 
 The Company, Stirling OP, Stirling TRS and the Advisor are parties to an Advisory Agreement, dated December 6, 2023(the Advisory Agreement ). On November 7, 2024, the parties to the Advisory Agreement entered into Amendment No. 1 thereto (the Advisory Agreement Amendment ). Pursuant to the Advisory Agreement Amendment, (i) the date prior to which Advisor will pay for all Organization and Offering Expenses (as defined in the Advisory Agreement) is changed from December 31, 2024 to December 31, 2025, and (ii) the repayment period for the Organization and Offering Expenses, as well as for certain other costs and expenses of the Company, is changed from 60 equal monthly installments starting January 2025 to 120 equal monthly installments starting January 2026.

 Results of Operations 
 Since the Company had no significant assets or operations prior to December 6, 2023, the Company does not have any results of operations for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023. The following results of operations for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 represent the operations of Stirling OP. 
 For periods prior to December 6, 2023, the date of Stirling OP s acquisition of the Initial Portfolio, the accompanying historical combined consolidated financial statements of the Initial Portfolio have been carved out of Ashford Trust s consolidated financial statements and reflect certain assumptions and allocations. These hotels are under Ashford Trust s common control. The combined consolidated financial statements were prepared using the financial position and results of operations of the entities set forth above after adjustments for certain ownership related activities that have been historically accounted for by Ashford Trust. These ownership activities include mortgage indebtedness associated with the four hotels, debt-related expenses and other owner related expenses. In addition, the combined consolidated statements of operations include allocations of advisory service fees and corporate general and administrative expenses from Ashford Trust, which in the opinion of management, are reasonable. The historical financial information is not necessarily indicative of the Company s future results of operations, financial position and cash flows subsequent to Stirling OP s acquisition of the Initial Portfolio. 
 Key Indicators of Operating Performance 
 Stirling OP uses a variety of operating and other information to evaluate the operating performance of its business. These key indicators include financial information that is prepared in accordance with GAAP as well as other financial measures that are non-GAAP measures. In addition, it uses other information that may not be financial in nature, including statistical information and comparative data. Stirling OP uses this information to measure the operating performance of its individual hotels, groups of hotels and/or business as a whole. Stirling OP also uses these metrics to evaluate the hotels in its portfolio and potential acquisitions to determine each hotel s contribution to cash flow and its potential to provide attractive long-term total returns. These key indicators include: 
 Occupancy Occupancy means the total number of hotel rooms sold in a given period divided by the total number of rooms available. Occupancy measures the utilization of Stirling OP hotels available capacity. Stirling OP uses occupancy to measure demand at a specific hotel or group of hotels in a given period. 
 ADR ADR means average daily rate and is calculated by dividing total hotel rooms revenues by total number of rooms sold in a given period. ADR measures average room price attained by a hotel and ADR trends provide useful information concerning the pricing environment and the nature of the customer base of a hotel or group of hotels. Stirling OP uses ADR to assess the pricing levels that it is able to generate. 
 RevPAR RevPAR means revenue per available room and is calculated by multiplying ADR by the average daily occupancy. RevPAR is one of the commonly used measures within the hotel industry to evaluate hotel operations. RevPAR does not include revenues from food and beverage sales or parking, telephone or other non-rooms revenues generated by the property. Although RevPAR does not include these ancillary revenues, it is generally considered the leading indicator of core revenues for many hotels. Stirling OP also uses RevPAR to compare the results of its hotels between periods and to analyze results of its comparable hotels (comparable hotels represent hotels it has owned for the entire period). RevPAR improvements attributable to increases in occupancy are generally accompanied by increases in most categories of variable operating costs. RevPAR improvements attributable to increases in ADR are generally accompanied by increases in limited categories of operating costs, such as management fees and franchise fees. 
 17 

RevPAR changes that are primarily driven by changes in occupancy have different implications for overall revenues and profitability than changes that are driven primarily by changes in ADR. For example, an increase in occupancy at a hotel would lead to additional variable operating costs (including housekeeping services, utilities and room supplies) and could also result in increased other operating department revenue and expense. Changes in ADR typically have a greater impact on operating margins and profitability as they do not have a substantial effect on variable operating costs. 
 Occupancy, ADR and RevPAR are commonly used measures within the lodging industry to evaluate operating performance. RevPAR is an important statistic for monitoring operating performance at the individual hotel level and across Stirling OP s entire business. Stirling OP evaluates individual hotel RevPAR performance on an absolute basis with comparisons to budget and prior periods, as well as on a regional and company-wide basis. ADR and RevPAR include only rooms revenue. Rooms revenue is dictated by demand (as measured by occupancy), pricing (as measured by ADR) and its available supply of hotel rooms. 
 
 Principal Factors Affecting Stirling OP s Results of Operations 
 The principal factors affecting Stirling OP s operating results include overall demand for hotel rooms compared to the supply of available hotel rooms, and the ability of its contracted hotel management companies to increase or maintain revenues while controlling expenses. 
 Demand The demand for lodging, including business travel, is directly correlated to the overall economy; as GDP increases, lodging demand typically increases. Historically, periods of declining demand are followed by extended periods of relatively strong demand, which typically occurs during the growth phase of the lodging cycle. 
 Supply The development of new hotels is driven largely by construction costs, the availability of financing and expected performance of existing hotels. Short-term supply is also expected to be below long-term averages. While the industry is expected to have supply growth below historical averages, Stirling OP may experience supply growth, in certain markets, in excess of national averages that may negatively impact performance. 
 Stirling OP expects that its ADR, occupancy and RevPAR performance will be impacted by macroeconomic factors such as national and local employment growth, personal income and corporate earnings, GDP, consumer confidence, office vacancy rates and business relocation decisions, airport and other business and leisure travel, new hotel construction, the pricing strategies of competitors and currency fluctuations. In addition, its ADR, occupancy and RevPAR performance are dependent on the continued success of the Marriott and Hilton brands. 
 Revenue Substantially all of Stirling OP s revenue is derived from the operation of hotels. Specifically, its revenue is comprised of: 
 Rooms revenue: Occupancy and ADR are the major drivers of rooms revenue. Rooms revenue accounts for the substantial majority of Stirling OP s total revenue. 
 Other hotel revenue: Occupancy and the nature of the property are the main drivers of other ancillary revenue, such as telecommunications, parking and leasing services. 
 Hotel Operating Expenses The following presents the components of Stirling OP s hotel operating expenses: 
 Rooms expense: These costs include housekeeping wages and payroll taxes, reservation systems, room supplies, laundry services and front desk costs. Like rooms revenue, occupancy is the major driver of rooms expense and, therefore, rooms expense has a significant correlation to rooms revenue. These costs can increase based on increases in salaries and wages, as well as the level of service and amenities that are provided. 
 Management fees: Base management fees are computed as a percentage of gross revenues. Incentive management fees generally are paid when operating profits exceed certain threshold levels. 
 Other hotel expenses: These expenses include labor and other costs associated with the other operating department revenues, as well as labor and other costs associated with administrative departments, franchise fees, sales and marketing, repairs and maintenance and utility costs. 
 Most categories of variable operating expenses, including labor costs such as housekeeping, fluctuate with changes in occupancy. Increases in occupancy are accompanied by increases in most categories of variable operating expenses, while increases in ADR typically only result in increases in limited categories of operating costs and expenses, such as franchise fees, management fees and credit card processing fee expenses, which are based on hotel revenues. Thus, changes in ADR have a more significant impact on operating margins than changes in occupancy.

 Rooms Revenue. Rooms revenue decreased 51,000, or 1.2 , to 4.2 million during the 2024 quarter compared to the 2023 quarter. During the 2024 quarter, we experienced a 166 basis point increase in occupancy and a 3.2 decrease in room rates. 
 19 

Fluctuations in rooms revenue between the 2024 quarter and the 2023 quarter are a result of the changes in occupancy and ADR between the 2024 quarter and the 2023 quarter as reflected in the table below (dollars in thousands): 
 Favorable (Unfavorable) 
 Hotel Property Rooms Revenue 
 Occupancy (change in bps) 
 ADR 
 (change in 
 Residence Inn Manchester (1) 
 (55) (71) (3.7) Hampton Inn Buford (2) 
 (141) (636) (5.7) SpringHill Suites Buford 
 75 705 (1.2) Residence Inn Jacksonville 
 70 537 (0.6) Total 
 (51) 166 (3.2) 
 _______ 
 (1) The decline in rooms revenue and occupancy in the 2024 quarter compared to the 2023 quarter was attributable to the ongoing full renovation of the property, which is expected to be completed later in 2024. 
 (2) The decline in rooms revenue in 2024 quarter compared to 2023 quarter was driven by particularly strong results in 2023 quarter, when inclement weather in the region allowed the property to realize unseasonably high occupancy and ADR. 
 Other Hotel Revenue. Other hotel revenue, which consists mainly of Internet access, parking, and spa revenue, decreased 17,000, or 21.5 , to 62,000. This decrease is primarily attributable to a decrease of 22,000 at two hotel properties, partially offset by an increase of 5,000 at SpringHill Suites Buford and Hampton Inn Buford. 
 Rooms Expense . Rooms expense decreased 56,000, or 5.4 , to 988,000 in the 2024 quarter compared to the 2023 quarter. The decrease is attributable to a decrease of 63,000 at three hotel properties, partially offset by an increase of 7,000 at SpringHill Suites Buford. Rooms margin was 76.6 in the 2024 quarter and 75.6 in the 2023 quarter. 
 Other Operating Expenses . Other operating expenses increased 87,000, or 5.8 , to 1.6 million in the 2024 quarter compared to the 2023 quarter. Hotel operating expenses consist of direct expenses from departments associated with revenue streams and indirect expenses associated with support departments and incentive management fees. 
 Direct expenses were 0.5 of total hotel revenue in the 2024 quarter and 0.5 in the 2023 quarter. The Initial Portfolio experienced an increase in indirect expenses of 90,000. The increase in indirect expenses was attributable to increases in (i) general and administrative costs of 28,000; (ii) repairs and maintenance of 2,000; (iii) marketing costs of 51,000; (iv) incentive management fees of 5,000; and (v) 4,000 in energy costs. 
 Property Taxes, Insurance and Other. Property taxes, insurance and other expense increased 57,000, or 21.9 , to 317,000 during the 2024 quarter compared to the 2023 quarter, which was primarily due to higher property insurance costs of 80,000 and higher miscellaneous tax expense of 1,000, partially offset by lower property taxes of 24,000. 
 Depreciation and Amortization. Depreciation and amortization increased 279,000, or 31.7 , to 1.2 million during the 2024 quarter compared to the 2023 quarter as a result of higher fixed asset balances in the 2024 quarter related to renovations. 
 Advisory Services Fee. Advisory services fee was 296,000 in 2024 quarter that was comprised of base advisory fee of 123,000, reimbursable expenses of 62,000 and a performance participation fee of 111,000. In the 2023 quarter, advisory services fee consisted of an allocated advisory services fee of 113,000 from Ashford Trust. 
 Corporate, General and Administrative. Corporate, general and administrative expense of 286,000 in the 2024 quarter consisted of legal, accounting and other professional fees of 185,000, equity-based compensation of 26,000, corporate expenses of 58,000 and miscellaneous expenses of 17,000. In the 2023 quarter corporate, general and administrative expense of 64,000 was comprised of allocated expenses from Ashford Trust. 
 Interest Income. Interest income was 28,000 for the 2024 quarter. 
 Interest Expense and Amortization of Loan Costs. Interest expense and amortization of discounts and loan costs increased 327,000, or 79.8 , to 737,000 during the 2024 quarter compared to the 2023 quarter, due primarily to a higher stated interest rate on current mortgage loans compared to the stated interest rates on the mortgage loans that were refinanced, partially offset by a lower principal balance. On November 16, 2023, Ashford Trust refinanced the 6.2 million mortgage loan secured by the Residence Inn Manchester, the 9.1 million mortgage loan secured by the Residence Inn Jacksonville, and the 21.9 million mortgage loan secured by the Hampton Inn Buford and the SpringHill Suites Buford. The new mortgage loan totaled 30.2 million. 
 20 

Income Tax (Expense) Benefit. Income tax expense decreased 92,000, from 92,000 in the 2023 quarter to 0 in the 2024 quarter. This decrease was primarily due to a decrease in the profitability of the Stirling TRS entities in the 2024 quarter compared to the profitability of the Ashford TRS entities as it relates to the Initial Portfolio in the 2023 quarter.

 Rooms Revenue. Rooms revenue decreased 738,000, or 5.8 , to 11.9 million during the 2024 period compared to the 2023 period. During the 2024 period, the Initial Portfolio experienced a 2.5 decrease in room rates and a 296 basis point decrease in occupancy. 
 21 

Fluctuations in rooms revenue between the 2024 period and the 2023 period are a result of the changes in occupancy and ADR between 2024 and 2023 as reflected in the table below (dollars in thousands): 
 Favorable (Unfavorable) Hotel Property Rooms Revenue Occupancy (change in bps) 
 ADR 
 (change in 
 Residence Inn Manchester (1) 
 (427) (1,080) 0.1 Hampton Inn Buford (2)

 254 704 (0.4) Residence Inn Jacksonville 
 (59) (32) (1.7) Total 
 (738) (296) (2.5) 
 _______ 
 (1) The decline in rooms revenue and occupancy in the 2024 period compared to the 2023 period was attributable to the ongoing full renovation of the property, which is expected to be completed later in 2024. 
 (2) The decline in rooms revenue in the 2024 period compared to the 2023 period was driven by particularly strong results in the 2023 period, when inclement weather in the region allowed the property to realize unseasonably high occupancy and ADR. 
 Other Hotel Revenue. Other hotel revenue, which consists of various miscellaneous revenues, decreased 17,000, or 8.4 , to 186,000 in the 2024 period compared to the 2023 period. This decrease is primarily attributable to an aggregate decrease of 30,000 at two hotel properties, partially offset by an increase of 10,000 at SpringHill Suites Buford and an increase of 3,000 at Hampton Inn Buford. 
 Rooms Expense . Rooms expense decreased 57,000, or 1.9 , to 2.9 million in the 2024 period compared to the 2023 period. This decrease is primarily attributable to an aggregate decrease of 110,000 at two hotel properties, partially offset by an increase of 29,000 at SpringHill Suites Buford and an increase of 24,000 at Residence Inn Jacksonville. Rooms margin was 75.6 in the 2024 period and 76.6 in the 2023 period. 
 Other Operating Expenses . Other operating expenses decreased 107,000, or 2.3 , to 4.5 million in the 2024 period compared to the 2023 period. Hotel operating expenses consist of direct expenses from departments associated with revenue streams and indirect expenses associated with support departments and incentive management fees. 
 Direct expenses were 0.5 of total hotel revenue in the 2024 period and 0.5 in the 2023 period. The Initial Portfolio experienced a decrease in indirect expenses of 104,000. The decrease in indirect expenses was attributable to decreases in (i) repairs and maintenance of 55,000; (ii) general and administrative costs of 46,000; and (iii) marketing costs of 13,000. These decreases were partially offset by increases in (i) energy costs of 6,000; and (ii) incentive management fees of 4,000. 
 Property Taxes, Insurance and Other. Property taxes, insurance and other expense increased 132,000 or 18.7 , to 838,000 in the 2024 period compared to the 2023 period, which was primarily due to higher property insurance costs of 158,000 and higher miscellaneous tax expense of 12,000, partially offset by lower property taxes of 38,000. 
 Depreciation and Amortization. Depreciation and amortization increased 571,000 or 21.1 , to 3.3 million in the 2024 period compared to the 2023 period as a result of higher fixed asset balances in the 2024 period. 
 Advisory Services Fee. Advisory services fee was 838,000 in the 2024 period that was comprised of base advisory fee of 353,000, reimbursable expenses of 152,000 and a performance participation fee of 333,000. In the 2023 period, advisory services fee consisted of an allocated advisory services fee of 392,000 from Ashford Trust. 
 Corporate, General and Administrative. Corporate, general and administrative expense of 1.2 million in the 2024 period consisted of legal, accounting and other professional fees of 799,000, corporate expenses of 226,000, miscellaneous expenses of 65,000 and equity based compensation of 66,000. In the 2023 period, corporate, general and administrative expense of 147,000 was comprised of allocated expenses from Ashford Trust. 
 Interest Income. Interest income was 68,000 in the 2024 period. 
 Interest Expense and Amortization of Loan Costs. Interest expense and amortization of loan costs increased 970,000 or 79.5 to 2.2 million in the 2024 period compared to the 2023 period, due primarily to a higher stated interest rate on current mortgage loans compared to the stated interest rates on the mortgage loans that were refinanced, partially offset by a lower principal balance. On November 16, 2023, Ashford Trust refinanced the 6.2 million mortgage loan secured by the Residence Inn Manchester, the 9.1 million mortgage loan secured by the Residence Inn Jacksonville, and the 21.9 million mortgage loan secured by the Hampton Inn Buford and the SpringHill Suites Buford. The new mortgage loan totaled 30.2 million. 
 22 

Income Tax (Expense) Benefit. Income tax expense decreased from 349,000 in the 2023 period to 0 in the 2024 period. This decrease was primarily due to a decrease in the profitability of the Stirling TRS entities in the 2024 period compared to the profitability of the Ashford TRS entities as it relates to the Initial Portfolio in the 2023 period. 
 
 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 Liquidity 
 We believe that Stirling OP has sufficient liquidity to operate its business. Stirling OP s cash and cash equivalents as of September 30, 2024 was approximately 4.1 million. In addition to Stirling OP s immediate liquidity, we expect to obtain incremental liquidity through the sale of our common shares in our ongoing private offering. In addition, Stirling OP may incur indebtedness secured by its real estate investments, borrow money through unsecured financings, or incur other forms of indebtedness. Stirling OP may also generate incremental liquidity through the sale of real estate. 
 Our primary liquidity needs are to fund future investments, make distributions to our stockholders, repurchase common shares pursuant to our share repurchase plan, pay operating expenses, fund capital expenditures, and repay indebtedness. Our operating expenses will include, among other things, the management fee Stirling OP pays to the Advisor and the performance participation allocation that Stirling OP pays to the Special Limited Partner, both of which will impact our liquidity to the extent the Advisor or the Special Limited Partner elect to receive such payments in cash, or subsequently redeem common shares or common units previously issued to them in lieu of cash. 
 We expect that our cash needs for acquisitions and other capital investments will be funded primarily from the sale of common shares and through the incurrence or assumption of debt. Other potential future sources of capital include secured or unsecured financings from banks or other lenders and proceeds from the sale of assets. If necessary, we may use financings or other sources of capital in the event of unforeseen significant capital expenditures. 
 We believe that our current liquidity position is sufficient to meet the need of our expected investment and operating activity. 
 Stirling OP s cash and cash equivalents are primarily comprised of corporate cash held at commercial banks in Insured Cash Sweep ICS accounts, which are fully insured by the FDIC. Stirling OP s cash and cash equivalents also includes property-level operating cash deposited with commercial banks that have been designated as a Global Systemically Important Bank G-SIB by the Financial Stability Board FSB and a small amount deposited with other commercial banks. 
 Capital Resources 
 As of November 11, 2024 , Stirling OP s indebtedness included a single mortgage loan secured by all four of its hotel properties, which carries a fixed interest rate of 8.51 and matures in December 2028. 
 In December 2023, the Company commenced the offering of its Class I shares through a continuous private offering. On February 13, 2024, we commenced issuing Class D, Class S, and Class T shares in the offering. As of November 11, 2024 , we have sold approximately 3,851 Class I common shares, 19 Class D common shares, 19 Class S common shares and 19 Class T common shares in the ongoing private offering. 
 
 Sources and Uses of Cash 
 Our and Stirling OP s principal sources of funds to meet cash requirements include cash on hand, cash flow from operations, capital market activities, property refinancing proceeds and asset sales. Additionally, our and Stirling OP s principal uses of funds are expected to include possible operating shortfalls, owner-funded capital expenditures, dividends, new investments, and debt interest and principal payments. Items that impacted Stirling OP s cash flow and liquidity during the periods indicated are summarized as follows: 
 Net Cash Flows Provided by (Used in) Operating Activities. Net cash flows provided by operating activities, pursuant to our consolidated statements of cash flows, which includes changes in balance sheet items, were 540,000 and 2.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Cash flows provided by (used in) operations were impacted by changes in hotel operations as well as the timing of collecting receivables from hotel guests, paying vendors, settling with related parties and settling with hotel managers. 
 Net Cash Flows Provided by (Used in) Investing Activities. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, net cash flows used in investing activities were 4.6 million, which consisted of 4.6 million for capital improvements made to various hotel properties. 
 23 

For the nine months ended September 30, 2023, net cash flows used in investing activities were 3.9 million, which consisted of 3.9 million for capital improvements made to various hotel properties. 
 Net Cash Flows Provided by (Used in) Financing Activities. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, net cash flows provided by financing activities were 33,000, which consisted of proceeds of 37,000 from the issuance of common units, partially offset by 4,000 of distributions paid. 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2023, net cash flows provided by financing activities were 2.7 million. Cash inflows consisted of 3.2 million of contributions from parent, partially offset by cash outflows of 533,000 for repayments of indebtedness. 
 
 Distributions 
 We intend to declare monthly distributions as authorized by our board of directors (or a committee of the board of directors) and to pay such distributions on a monthly basis. Our first such distribution was declared for our holders of record as of December 31, 2023 in an amount equal to 0.1042 per share/unit, less certain expenses. Subsequent monthly distributions were declared for our holders of record as of each month through October 31, 2024, each in an amount equal to 0.1042 per share/unit less certain expenses. Our distribution policy is set by our board of directors and is subject to change based on available cash flows and other factors. We cannot guarantee the amount of distributions that will be paid, if any. In connection with a distribution to our stockholders/unitholders, our board of directors approves a monthly distribution for a certain dollar amount per share for each class of our common stock/units. Share repurchases under our share repurchase plan will be effectuated as of the opening of the last business day of each month and we expect to declare monthly distributions with a record date as of the close of business of the last calendar day of each month. You will not be entitled to receive a distribution on any of your shares that are repurchased prior to the applicable record date for such distribution. 
 Sources of Distributions 
 During our offering stage, when we may raise capital more quickly than we acquire income-producing assets, and for some period after our offering stage, Stirling OP may not be able to make distributions solely from its cash flows from operating activities. Further, because Stirling OP may receive income from its investments at various times during its fiscal year and because it may need cash flow from operations during a particular period to fund capital expenditures and other expenses, we expect that at least during the early stages of our existence and from time to time during our operational stage, we will declare distributions in anticipation of cash flows that we expect to receive during a later period and we will make these distributions in advance of our actual receipt of these funds. 
 The following table presents information with respect to Stirling OP s distributions declared and cash flow provided by (used in) provided by operating activities during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024:

 ___________ 
 (1) Distributions are generally expected to be paid on a monthly basis. In general, distributions for all record dates of a given month are paid on or about the 15 th of the following month. 
 (2) The allocation of total sources are calculated on a quarterly basis. Generally, for purposes of determining the source of our distributions paid, we assume first that positive cash flow from operating activities from the relevant or prior quarter is used to fund distribution payments. 
 For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, distributions declared by Stirling OP were 455,404 and 1,349,691, respectively, including distributions to the general partner for distribution to common stockholders of 448 and 720, respectively. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, Stirling OP paid aggregate distributions of 
 24 

453,586 and 1,344,095, respectively, including distributions to the general partner for distribution to common stockholders of 446 and 570, respectively. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, Stirling OP s net loss was 1.2 million and 4.2 million, respectively. 
 
 NAV and NAV Per Share Calculation 
 We calculate NAV per share in accordance with the valuation guidelines that have been approved by our board of directors. Our total NAV in the following table includes the NAV of our outstanding common stock as of September 30, 2024 as well as the partnership interests of Stirling OP held by parties other than us. The following table sets forth the components of our NAV as of September 30, 2024 (amounts in thousands, except per share/unit data): 
 Components of NAV (1) 
 Investments in real properties 64,400 Cash and cash equivalents 4,294 Restricted cash 1,958 Other assets 1,168 Mortgage notes, term loans, and revolving credit facilities, net (31,630) Other liabilities (1,801) Management fee payable (73) Non-controlling interests in joint ventures Net asset value 38,316 Number of outstanding shares/units 1,463 NAV per share/unit 26.1964 
 _____________ 
 (1) Due to the nature of hotel operations, we expect that the most recent property-level financial information available for use in calculating our NAV will be as of the end of the month prior to the NAV unless otherwise adjusted by the Advisor for material changes. 
 The following table provides a breakdown of our total NAV and NAV per share/unit by class as of September 30, 2024 and shares in thousands, expect per share/unit data):

 _____________ 
 (1) Includes the partnership interest of Stirling OP held by the Special Limited Partner, if any. 
 Set forth below are the weighted averages of the key assumptions in the discounted cash flow methodology used in the September 30, 2024 valuations: 
 Discount Rate Exit Capitalization Rate Hotel properties 10.87 8.62 
 These weighted averages of key assumptions are calculated by our Advisor using information provided by our independent valuation advisor. A change in these assumptions would impact the calculation of the value of our hotel properties. For example, assuming all other factors remain unchanged, the changes listed below would result in the following effects on our property values (asset values in thousands): 
 Sensitivities Change Asset Values Discount rate 0.25 decrease 65,400 0.25 increase 63,400 Exit capitalization rate 0.25 decrease 65,300 0.25 increase 63,600 
 25 

Limits on the Calculation of Our NAV Per Share 
 The overarching principle of our valuation guidelines is to produce reasonable estimated values for each of our investments (and other assets and liabilities), or the price that would be received for that investment in orderly transactions between market participants. However, the majority of our assets will consist of real estate properties and the valuation of our properties (and other assets and liabilities) is based on a number of judgments, assumptions and opinions about future events that may not prove to be correct. The use of different judgments, assumptions or opinions would likely result in a different estimate of the value of our real estate properties (and other assets and liabilities). Any resulting potential disparity in our NAV per share may be in favor of stockholders whose shares are repurchased or new purchasers of our common stock, as the case may be, depending on the circumstances at the time (for cases in which our transaction price is based on NAV). 
 Additionally, while the methodologies contained in our valuation guidelines are designed to operate reliably within a wide variety of circumstances, it is possible that in certain unanticipated situations or after the occurrence of certain extraordinary events (such as a significant disruption in relevant markets, a terrorist attack or an act of nature), our Advisor s ability to calculate NAV may be impaired or delayed, including, without limitation, circumstances where there is a delay in accessing or receiving information from vendors or other reporting agents upon which our Advisor may rely upon in determining the monthly value of our NAV. In these circumstances, a more accurate valuation of our NAV could be obtained by using different assumptions or methodologies. Accordingly, in special situations when, in our Advisor s reasonable judgment, the administration of the valuation guidelines would result in a valuation that does not represent a fair and accurate estimate of the value of our investment, alternative methodologies may be applied, provided that our Advisor must notify our board of directors at the next scheduled board meeting of any alternative methodologies utilized and their impact on the overall valuation of our investment. Notwithstanding the foregoing, our board of directors may suspend the offering and/or our share repurchase plan if it determines that the calculation of our NAV is materially incorrect or unreliable or there is a condition that restricts the valuation of a material portion of our assets. 
 We include no discounts to our NAV for the illiquid nature of our shares, including the limitations on stockholders ability to sell shares under our share repurchase plan and our ability to suspend or terminate our share repurchase plan at any time. Our NAV generally does not consider exit costs (e.g., selling costs and commissions and debt prepayment penalties related to the sale of a property) that would likely be incurred if our assets and liabilities were liquidated or sold. While we may use market pricing concepts to value individual components of our NAV, our per share NAV is not derived from the market pricing information of open-end real estate funds listed on stock exchanges. 
 Our NAV per share does not represent the amount of our assets less our liabilities in accordance with GAAP. We do not represent, warrant or guarantee that: 
 a stockholder would be able to realize the NAV per share for the class of shares a stockholder owns if the stockholder attempts to sell its shares; 
 a stockholder would ultimately realize distributions per share equal to the NAV per share for the class of shares it owns upon liquidation of our assets and settlement of our liabilities or a sale of our company; 
 shares of our common stock would trade at their NAV per share on a national securities exchange; 
 a third party would offer the NAV per share for each class of shares in an arm s-length transaction to purchase all or substantially all of our shares; or 
 the NAV per share would equate to a market price of an open-ended real estate fund. 
 
 Inflation 
 We rely entirely on the performance of our hotel properties and the ability of the hotel properties managers to increase revenues to keep pace with inflation. Hotel operators can generally increase room rates, but competitive pressures may limit their ability to raise rates faster than inflation. Our general and administrative costs, real estate and personal property taxes, property and casualty insurance, labor costs and utilities are subject to inflation as well. 
 Seasonality 
 The hospitality business is seasonal, highly competitive and influenced by factors such as general and local economic conditions, location, room rates, quality, service levels, reputation and reservation systems, among many other factors. The hospitality industry generally experiences seasonal slowdown in the third quarter and, to a lesser extent, in the fourth quarter of each year. As a result of such seasonality, there will likely be quarterly fluctuations in results of operations of any hospitality properties that we may own. 
 26 

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 
 The preparation of our consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Our accounting policies that are critical or most important to understanding our financial condition and results of operations and that require management to make the most difficult judgments are described in our 2023 Form 10-K. There have been no material changes in these critical accounting policies. 
 
 ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURE ABOUT MARKET RISK 
 
 Stirling OP s primary market risk exposure consists of changes in interest rates on borrowings under our debt instruments. Currently Stirling OP s mortgage loan has a fixed rate. 
 
 ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 
 Under the supervision and with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, our management has evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act )) as of September 30, 2024 (the Evaluation Date ). Based upon that evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that, as of the Evaluation Date, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective (i) to ensure that information required to be disclosed in reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC rules and forms; and (ii) to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures. 
 
 PART II. OTHER INFORMATION 
 
 ITEM 1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS 
 
 From time to time we may be involved in various claims and legal actions arising in the ordinary course of business. As of September 30, 2024, we were not involved in any material legal proceedings. 
 
 ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS 
 The Registrant has omitted a discussion of risk factors because as a smaller reporting company, it is not required to provide such information. 
 
 ITEM 2. UNREGISTERED SALES OF EQUITY SECURITIES AND USE OF PROCEEDS 
 The Company is undertaking a continuous private offering to accredited investors, pursuant to which it is offering for sale up to 1,000,000,000 in shares of common stock consisting of up to 900,000,000 in shares in the primary offering and up to 100,000,000 in shares pursuant to the distribution reinvestment plan. The offering is being made pursuant to the exemption from registration provided by Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Regulation D promulgated thereunder, and other exemptions of similar import in the laws of the states and other jurisdictions where the offering is being made. In December 2023, the Company commenced the offering of Class I shares, and on February 13, 2024, the Company commenced the offering of Class D, Class S, and Class T shares. During the three months ended September 30, 2024, the Company issued the following: 
 Three Months Ended September 30, 2024 Class I shares issued Class I gross proceeds Class D shares issued Class D gross proceeds Class S shares issued Class S gross proceeds Class T shares issued Class T gross proceeds 
 27 

No upfront selling commissions or dealer manager fees were paid with respect to the sale of the Class I, D, S and T shares. 
 During the three months ended September 30, 2024, the Company did not receive any repurchase requests. 
 
 ITEM 3. DEFAULTS UPON SENIOR SECURITIES 
 None. 
 
 ITEM 4. MINE SAFETY DISCLOSURES 
 Not applicable. 
 
 ITEM 5. OTHER INFORMATION 
 
 Amendment No. 1 to the Advisory Agreement 
 The Company, Stirling OP, Stirling TRS and the Advisor are parties to an Advisory Agreement, dated December 6, 2023 (the Advisory Agreement ). 
 On November 7, 2024, the parties to the Advisory Agreement entered into Amendment No. 1 (the Amendment to the Advisory Agreement. Pursuant to the Amendment, (i) the date prior to which Advisor will pay for all Organization and Offering Expenses (as defined in the Advisory Agreement) is changed from December 31, 2024 to December 31, 2025, and (ii) the repayment period for the Organization and Offering Expenses, as well as for certain other costs and expenses of the Company, is changed from 60 equal monthly installments starting January 2025 to 120 equal monthly installments starting January 2026. 
 The foregoing description of the Amendment contained in this Item 5 does not purport to be complete and is subject to and qualified in its entirety by the full text of the Amendment and the Advisory Agreement, copies of which are attached hereto as Exhibit 10.2.1 and 10.2, respectively, and incorporated herein by reference. 
 Financial Statements of Stirling REIT OP, LP 
 We account for the common units acquired in Stirling OP as an equity method investment during any period our investment in Stirling OP is not considered significant to Stirling OP and will consolidate Stirling OP at such time that our investment in Stirling OP is considered significant to Stirling OP (based on generally accepted accounting principles). We expect to invest our capital and all our offering proceeds in Stirling OP and hold no assets other than Stirling OP common units. We therefore expect to eventually consolidate Stirling OP. As such, we have included the unaudited consolidated and combined consolidated financial statements of Stirling OP as we believe these financial statements would be meaningful to investors, and subsequent invested capital will be significant to us.

 1. Organization and Description of Business 
 Stirling Hotels Resorts, Inc. Stirling Inc. was formed on September 1, 2023 as a Maryland corporation and intends to qualify as a real estate investment trust REIT for U.S. federal income tax purposes beginning with the taxable year ending December 31, 2024. Substantially all of the Stirling Inc. s business will be conducted through Stirling REIT OP, LP Stirling OP or the Company ), a Delaware limited partnership formed on September 26, 2023. Stirling Inc. is the sole member of the sole general partner of Stirling OP and owns a non-economic general partnership interest in Stirling OP. Stirling REIT Special Limited Partner LLC (the Special Limited Partner ), a Delaware limited partnership, will own a special limited partner interest in Stirling OP. In addition, in order for the income from any hotel property investments to constitute rents from real properties for purposes of the gross income test required for REIT qualification, Stirling Inc. will lease each hotel property to a subsidiary of Stirling OP, which we intend to be treated as a taxable REIT subsidiary, or TRS. 
 Stirling Inc. was organized to invest primarily in a diverse portfolio of stabilized income-producing hotels and resorts across all chain scales primarily located in the United States and operated under widely recognized brands. Stirling Inc. and Stirling OP are externally managed by Stirling REIT Advisors LLC Stirling Advisor or the Advisor ), an affiliate of Ashford Inc. Ashford ), Stirling Inc. s sponsor. We do not have any employees. All of the services that might be provided by employees are provided to us by the Advisor. 
 On December 6, 2023, Stirling OP acquired four hotel properties and assumed a mortgage loan secured by the four hotel properties (the Initial Portfolio from Ashford Hospitality Limited Partnership Ashford Hospitality OP and Ashford TRS Corporation Ashford Hospitality TRS, and together with Ashford Hospitality OP, the Anchor Investor ), each a subsidiary of Ashford Hospitality Trust, Inc. Ashford Trust ), in exchange for Class I units of Stirling OP pursuant to the terms of the contribution agreement (the Contribution Agreement ), by and among Stirling OP and the Anchor Investor. The contribution value was approximately 56.2 million. Additionally, Stirling OP assumed a mortgage loan with an estimated fair value of approximately 30.2 million. The acquisition also included 9.0 million of net working capital and reserves and was subject to customary post-closing adjustments resulting in a net contribution value of the Initial Portfolio of 35.0 million. During the three months ended March 31, 2024, estimated working capital and reserves were finalized resulting in Ashford Trust returning 4,423 Class I units totaling approximately 111,000 to Stirling OP. The final net contribution value of the Initial Portfolio was 34.9 million. 
 Stirling Inc. determined the acquisition of the Initial Portfolio resulted in Ashford Trust becoming the primary beneficiary of Stirling OP in contemplation of: 1) the related party group comprised of (i) Ashford Trust and (ii) the initial stockholder who has control over election or removal of the board of directors of Stirling Inc. that have power to direct the most significant activities of Stirling OP; and 2) the consideration that substantially all the economics are held by Ashford Trust through its equity interest, and substantially all of the activities are performed on Ashford Trust s behalf. As a result, Ashford Trust began consolidating Stirling OP as of December 6, 2023. 
 Pursuant to the Contribution Agreement, the Anchor Investor entered into a lock-up agreement with respect to its Class I units that restrict the assignment, sale, and transfer of the units for a period of one year following the closing of the transactions contemplated by the Contribution Agreement (the Lock-Up Agreement ). In addition, pursuant to the Lock-Up Agreement, the Anchor Investor is prohibited from redeeming the Class I units for a period of three years following such closing. At the end of the three-year period, the Class I units may be redeemed pursuant to the terms of the Stirling OP Agreement and any Class I units converted to shares of Stirling Inc. s Class I common stock may be repurchased by Stirling Inc. pursuant to the terms and conditions of Stirling Inc. s share repurchase plan. In addition, the Anchor Investor agreed not to withdraw as a participant in the distribution reinvestment plan of Stirling OP, and thereby receive any distributions payable on its Class I units in additional Class I units, through December 31, 2024. 
 Concurrently with entry into the Contribution Agreement, Stirling Inc. and Stirling OP, directly or through its wholly owned subsidiaries, entered into the Advisory Agreement, the Stirling OP Agreement, the Master Hotel Management Agreement and the Master Project Management Agreement, each as described in additional detail in note 7. 
 Ashford also provides other products and services to us or our hotel properties through certain entities in which Ashford has an ownership interest. These products and services include, but are not limited to, design and construction services, debt placement and related services, audio visual services, real estate advisory and brokerage services, insurance policies covering general liability, workers compensation and business automobile claims, insurance claims services, hypoallergenic premium rooms, broker-dealer and distribution services, mobile key technology and cash management services.

Each leased hotel is leased under a percentage lease that provides for each lessee to pay in each calendar month the base rent plus, in each calendar quarter, percentage rent, if any, based on hotel revenues. Lease revenue from the TRS is eliminated in combination and/or consolidation. Stirling OP does not operate any of its hotel properties directly; instead Stirling OP employs hotel management companies to operate them for Stirling OP under management contracts.

 Terms such as the Company, we, us, or our refer to Stirling OP and all entities included in its consolidated and combined consolidated financial statements. 
 
 2. Significant Accounting Policies 
 Basis of Presentation and Principles of Combination and Consolidation The accompanying unaudited consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles GAAP for interim financial information and with the instructions to Form 10-Q and the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC ). Accordingly, they do not include all of the information and footnotes required by GAAP for complete financial statements. In the opinion of management, all adjustments (consisting of normal recurring accruals) considered necessary for a fair presentation have been included. We have condensed or omitted certain information and footnote disclosures normally included in financial statements presented in accordance with GAAP in the accompanying unaudited consolidated financial statements. We believe the disclosures made herein are adequate to prevent the information presented from being misleading. However, the financial statements should be read in conjunction with the consolidated and combined consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in the 2023 Stirling Hotels Resorts, Inc. Annual Report to Stockholders on Form 10-K filed with the SEC on March 29, 2024. 
 For periods prior to December 6, 2023, the date of the contribution of the Initial Portfolio, the accompanying historical combined consolidated financial statements of Initial Portfolio have been carved out of Ashford Trust s consolidated financial statements and reflect certain assumptions and allocations. These entities were considered to be under Ashford Trust s common control, under the applicable accounting guidance. The combined consolidated financial statements of the Initial Portfolio were prepared using the financial position and results of operations of the entities set forth above after adjustments for certain 
 36 

STIRLING REIT OP, LP AND SUBSIDIARIES 
 NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED AND COMBINED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued) 
 (unaudited) 

 ownership-related activities that have been historically accounted for by Ashford Trust. These ownership activities include mortgage indebtedness associated with the four hotels, debt related expenses and other owner related expenses. In addition, the combined consolidated statements of operations of the Initial Portfolio include allocations of advisory service fees and corporate general and administrative expenses from Ashford Trust, which in the opinion of management, are reasonable. The historical financial information is not necessarily indicative of the Company s future results of operations, financial position and cash flows subsequent to the contribution. 
 All significant intercompany accounts and transactions between consolidated and combined consolidated entities have been eliminated in these historical consolidated and combined consolidated financial statements. 
 Historical seasonality patterns at some of our hotel properties cause fluctuations in our overall operating results. Consequently, operating results for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the year ending December 31, 2024. 
 Use of Estimates The preparation of these consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. 
 Equity-Based Compensation Equity-based compensation for non-employees is measured at the grant date and expensed ratably over the vesting period based on the original measurement as of the grant date. This results in the recording of expense, included in advisory services fee, management fees and corporate, general and administrative expense, equal to the ratable amount of the grant date fair value based on the requisite service period satisfied during the period. The Company recognizes forfeitures as they occur. 
 
 Recently Issued Accounting Standards In November 2023, the Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB issued Accounting Standards Update ASU 2023-07, Segment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures, which expands annual and interim disclosure requirements for reportable segments, primarily through enhanced disclosures about significant segment expenses. ASU 2023-07 is effective for our annual periods beginning January 1, 2024, and for interim periods beginning January 1, 2025, with early adoption permitted. As of September 30, 2024, the Company has not adopted this ASU. The adoption of this ASU is expected to only impact disclosures with respect to the Company s consolidated financial statements. 
 In December 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-09, Income Taxes (Topics 740): Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures to expand the disclosure requirements for income taxes, specifically related to the rate reconciliation and income taxes paid. ASU 2023-09 is effective for our annual periods beginning January 1, 2025, with early adoption permitted. The amendments in this ASU may be applied prospectively by providing the revised disclosures for the period ending December 31, 2025 and continuing to provide the pre-ASU disclosures for the prior periods, or the amendments may be applied retrospectively by providing the revised disclosures for all periods presented. As of September 30, 2024, the Company has not adopted this ASU. The adoption of this ASU is expected to only impact disclosures with respect to the Company s consolidated financial statements. 
 In November 2024, the FASB issued ASU 2024-03 , Income Statement Reporting Comprehensive Income Expense Disaggregation Disclosures (Subtopic 220-40) Disaggregation of Income Statement Expenses that requires more detailed information about specified categories of expenses (purchases of inventory, employee compensation, depreciation, amortization, and depletion) included in certain expense captions presented on the face of the statement of operations. This ASU is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2026, and for interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2027. Early adoption is permitted. The amendments may be applied either (1) prospectively to financial statements issued for reporting periods after the effective date of this ASU or (2) retrospectively to all prior periods presented in the financial statements.

 6. Summary of Fair Value of Financial Instruments 
 Determining estimated fair values of our financial instruments such as indebtedness requires considerable judgment to interpret market data. Market assumptions and/or estimation methodologies used may have a material effect on estimated fair value amounts. Accordingly, estimates presented are not necessarily indicative of amounts at which these instruments could be purchased, sold, or settled. Carrying amounts and estimated fair values of financial instruments, for periods indicated, were as follows (in thousands): 
 September 30, 2024 December 31, 2023 Carrying Value Estimated Fair Value Carrying Value Estimated Fair Value Financial assets not measured at fair value: Cash and cash equivalents 
 4,110 4,110 2,363 2,363 Restricted cash 2,204 2,204 7,957 7,957 Accounts receivable, net

 Cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash . These financial assets bear interest at market rates and have original maturities of less than 90 days. The carrying value approximates fair value due to their short-term nature. This is considered a Level 1 valuation technique. 
 Accounts receivable, net, due to related parties, net, accounts payable and accrued expenses, due to Ashford Inc., net due to Ashford Trust, net and due to third-party hotel manager. The carrying values of these financial instruments approximate their fair values due to their short-term nature. This is considered a Level 1 valuation technique. 
 Indebtedness. Fair value of indebtedness is determined using future cash flows discounted at current replacement rates for these instruments. Cash flows are determined using a forward interest rate yield curve. Current replacement rates are determined by using the U.S. Treasury yield curve or the index to which these financial instruments are tied and adjusted for credit spreads. Credit spreads take into consideration general market conditions, maturity, and collateral. We estimated the fair value of total indebtedness to be approximately 104.7 of the face value of 30.2 million at September 30, 2024 and approximately 94.3 of the face value of 30.2 million at December 31, 2023. These fair value estimates are considered a Level 2 valuation technique.
