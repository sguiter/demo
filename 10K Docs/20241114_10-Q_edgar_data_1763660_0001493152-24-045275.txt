cash flow of . These factors raise substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern within one
year of the date that the financial statements are issued. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might be necessary
if the Company is unable to continue as a going concern. 

The
Company s ability to continue as a going concern is dependent upon improving its profitability and the continuing financial support
from its Chief Executive Officer cum shareholder. Management believes the existing shareholder or external financing will provide the
additional cash to meet the Company s obligations as they become due. No assurance can be given that any future financing, if needed,
will be available or, if available, that it will be on terms that are satisfactory to the Company. Even if the Company is able to obtain
additional financing, if needed, it may contain undue restrictions on its operations, in the case of debt financing, or cause substantial
dilution for its stockholders, in the case of equity financing.

ITEM
4 CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 

Evaluation
of Disclosure Controls and Procedures: 

We
carried out an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Exchange
Act Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e)) as of September 30, 2024. This evaluation was carried out under the supervision and with the participation
of our Chief Executive Officer. Based upon that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer concluded that, as of September 30, 2024, our
disclosure controls and procedures were not effective due to the presence of material weaknesses in internal control over financial reporting. 

A
material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is
a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the Company s annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented
or detected on a timely basis. Management has identified the following material weaknesses which have caused management to conclude that,
as of September 30, 2024, our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective: (i) inadequate segregation of duties and effective
risk assessment; and (ii) insufficient written policies and procedures for accounting and financial reporting with respect to the requirements
and application of both US GAAP and SEC guidelines. 

Changes
in Internal Control over Financial Reporting: 

There
were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended September 30, 2024, that have materially affected,
or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
