Snacks Corporate Total 
 As of July 28, 2024, we substantially completed the multi-year cost savings initiatives and Snyder's-Lance cost transformation program and integration. Certain phases that had not been fully implemented were incorporated into the 2025 cost savings initiatives described below. 
 Sovos Brands Integration Initiatives 
 On March 12, 2024, we completed the acquisition of Sovos Brands. See Note 3 for additional information. We identified opportunities for cost synergies as we integrate Sovos Brands. 
 In 2024, we recorded Restructuring charges of million for severance pay and benefits related to initiatives to achieve the synergies. The charges incurred in 2024 were associated with the Meals Beverages segment. 
 In 2025, the initiatives to achieve synergies were incorporated into the cost savings initiatives described below. 
 2025 Cost Savings Initiatives 
 On September 10, 2024, we announced plans to implement cost savings initiatives beginning in 2025, including initiatives to further optimize our supply chain and manufacturing network, optimization of our information technology infrastructure and targeted cost management. We also identified additional opportunities for cost synergies as we integrate Sovos Brands. As mentioned above, we substantially completed our previous multi-year cost savings initiatives and Snyder's-Lance cost transformation program and integration. Certain initiatives from that program have been incorporated into our 2025 cost savings initiatives. Cost estimates for the 2025 initiatives, as well as timing for certain activities, are continuing to be developed.

 We expect the costs for the actions that have been identified to date to consist of the following: approximately million in severance pay and benefits; approximately million in asset impairment and accelerated depreciation; and approximately million in implementation costs and other related costs. We expect these pre-tax costs to be associated with our segments as follows: Meals Beverages - approximately ; Snacks - approximately and Corporate - approximately .

In addition, we expect to invest approximately million in capital expenditures, of which we invested million as of October 27, 2024. The capital expenditures primarily relate to optimization of production within our manufacturing network, implementation of our existing SAP enterprise-resource planning system for Sovos Brands and optimization of information technology infrastructure and applications.

 Other Optimization Initiatives 
 In the second quarter of 2024, we began implementation of an initiative to improve the effectiveness of our Snacks direct-store-delivery route-to-market network. Pursuant to this initiative we will purchase certain Pepperidge Farm and Snyder's-Lance routes where there are opportunities to unlock greater scale in select markets, combine them and sell the combined routes to independent contractor distributors. We expect to execute this program in a staggered rollout and to incur expenses of up to approximately million through 2029. In the three-month period ended October 27, 2024, we incurred million in Marketing and selling expenses related to this initiative.

months. The notional amount of foreign exchange forward contracts accounted for as cash-flow hedges was million as of October 27, 2024, and million as of July 28, 2024. Changes in the fair value on the portion of the derivative included in the assessment of hedge effectiveness of cash-flow hedges are recorded in other comprehensive income (loss), until earnings are affected by the variability of cash flows. For derivatives that are designated and qualify as hedging instruments, the initial fair value of hedge components excluded from the assessment of effectiveness is recognized in earnings under a systematic and rational method over the life of the hedging instrument and is presented in the same statement of earnings line item as the earnings effect of the hedged item. Any difference between the change in the fair value of the hedge components excluded from the assessment of effectiveness and the amounts recognized in earnings is recorded as a component of other comprehensive income (loss). The notional amount of foreign exchange forward and option contracts that are not designated as accounting hedges was million as of October 27, 2024, and million as of July 28, 2024. 
 Interest Rate Risk 
 We manage our exposure to changes in interest rates by optimizin g the use of variable-rate and fixed-rate debt. From time to time, we may use interest rate swaps in order to maintain our variable-to-total debt ratio within targeted guidelines. We manage our exposure to interest volatility on future debt issuances by entering into forward starting interest rate swaps or treasury lock contracts to hedge the rate on the interest payments related to the anticipated debt issuance. The forward starting interest rate swaps or treasury lock contracts are either designated as cash-flow hedging instruments or are undesignated. Changes in the fair value on the portion of the derivative included in the assessment of hedge effectiveness of cash-flow hedges are recorded in other comprehensive income (loss), and reclassified into Interest expense over the life of the debt issued. The change in fair value on undesignated instruments is recorded in Interest expense. In conjunction with the issuance of senior unsecured notes on October 2, 2024, due on March 23, 2035, we settled forward starting interest rate swaps with a notional value of million at a gain of less than million. The gain on these instruments was recorded in other comprehensive income (loss) and will be recognized in Interest expense over the life of the debt. There were forward starting interest rate swaps or treasury lock contracts outstanding as of October 27, 2024 and July 28, 2024. 
 Commodity Price Risk 
 We principally use a combination of purchase orders and various short- and long-term supply arrangements in connection with the purchase of raw materials, including certain commodities and agricultural products. We also enter into commodity futures, options and swap contracts to reduce the volatility of price fluctuations of wheat, diesel fuel, soybean oil, natural gas, cocoa, aluminum, corn and soybean meal. Commodity futures, options and swap contracts are either designated as cash-flow hedging instruments or are undesignated. We hedge a portion of commodity requirements for periods typically up to months. There were commodity contracts designated as cash-flow hedges as of October 27, 2024, or July 28, 2024. The notional amount of commodity contracts not designated as accounting hedges was million as of October 27, 2024, and million as of July 28, 2024. The change in fair value on undesignated instruments is recorded in Cost of products sold. 
 We have a supply contract under which prices for certain raw materials are established based on anticipated volume requirements over a twelve-month period. Certain prices under the contract are based in part on certain component parts of the raw materials that are in excess of our needs or not required for our operations, thereby creating an embedded derivative requiring bifurcation. We net settle amounts due under the contract with our counterparty. The notional amount was million as of October 27, 2024, and million as of July 28, 2024. The change in fair value on the embedded derivative is recorded in Cost of products sold. 
 Deferred Compensation Obligation Price Risk 
 We enter into swap contracts which hedge a portion of exposures relating to the total return of certain deferred compensation obligations. These contracts are not designated as hedges for accounting purposes. Unrealized gains (losses) and settlements are included in Administrative expenses in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings. We enter into these contracts for periods typically not exceeding months. The notional amounts of the contracts were million as of October 27, 2024, and million as of July 28, 2024.

Item 2. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 
 
 OVERVIEW 
 This Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations is provided as a supplement to, and should be read in conjunction with, the Consolidated Financial Statements and the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in "Part I - Item 1. Financial Statements," and our Form 10-K for the year ended July 28, 2024, including but not limited to "Part I - Item 1A. Risk Factors" and "Part II - Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations." 
 Executive Summary 
 Unless otherwise stated, the terms "we," "us," "our" and the "company" refer to The Campbell's Company, formerly known as Campbell Soup Company, and its consolidated subsidiaries. 
 We are a manufacturer and marketer of high-quality, branded food and beverage products. We operate in a highly competitive industry and experience competition in all of our categories. 
 On March 12, 2024, we completed the acquisition of Sovos Brands, Inc. (Sovos Brands) for total purchase consideration of 2.899 billion. For additional information on the Sovos Brands acquisition, see Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. All references to the acquisition below refer to the Sovos Brands acquisition. 
 On August 26, 2024, we completed the sale of our Pop Secret popcorn business. For additional information on the divestiture, see Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. 
 In November 2024, we entered into an agreement to sell our noosa yoghurt business for 200 million, subject to certain customary purchase price adjustments. The closing of the transaction is subject to certain customary conditions, including regulatory approval. For additional information on the divestiture, see Note 20 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. 
 Business Trends 
 Our industry continues to navigate a steady and ongoing recovery in light of supply chain disruptions, commodity cost volatility, changes in consumer purchasing and spending patterns, labor market issues, economic uncertainties and impacts of a change in administration as a result of the 2024 presidential election and other global macroeconomic challenges. Through the first quarter, we continued to experience some moderation in input cost inflation, as we continue to see improvement across certain ingredients and packaging materials. We anticipate continued supply chain productivity and benefits from cost savings initiatives to mitigate some of the inflationary pressures and expect such benefits to offset incremental costs in 2025. We expect consumer trends to continue to evolve and our volumes to improve over time; however, economic pressures on consumers, including the challenges of persistent inflation, may continue to negatively impact our volumes throughout 2025. We will continue to evaluate the evolving macroeconomic environment to take action to mitigate the impact on our business, consolidated results of operations and financial condition. 
 Company Name Change 
 On November 19, 2024, at the 2024 Annual Meeting of Shareholders of the company, our shareholders approved an amendment to the company s Restated Certificate of Incorporation to change the company s name from Campbell Soup Company to The Campbell s Company. The company s name change became effective on November 19, 2024. 
 Summary of Results 
 This Summary of Results provides significant highlights from the discussion and analysis that follows. 
 Net sales increased 10 in the quarter to 2.772 billion primarily due to a 12-point benefit from the acquisition of Sovos Brands. 
 Gross profit, as a percent of sales, was 31.3 in 2025 and the prior-year quarter. The performance reflected benefits from supply chain productivity improvements and mark-to-market adjustments on outstanding undesignated commodity hedges offset by the impact of cost inflation and other supply chain costs, unfavorable net price realization and the impact of the acquisition. 
 Earnings per share were .72 in 2025, compared to .78 in the prior-year quarter. The current quarter included expenses of .16 per share and the prior-year quarter included expenses of .13 per share from items impacting comparability as discussed below.

 (1) Includes revenue reductions from trade promotion and consumer coupon redemption programs. 
 In Meals Beverages, sales increased 22 , primarily due to a 22-point benefit from the acquisition of Sovos Brands. Excluding the benefit from the acquisition of Sovos Brands, sales were comparable as gains in Prego pasta sauces, Canada and foodservice were offset by declines in U.S. soup. Favorable volume/mix was offset by lower net price realization. Sales of U.S. soup decreased 4 primarily due to movements in retailer inventory levels influenced by the later timing of the Thanksgiving holiday this year.

In Snacks, sales decreased 4 . Excluding the impact from the divestiture of the Pop Secret popcorn business, sales decreased due to declines in third-party partner brands and contract manufacturing, Pepperidge Farm cookies, Goldfish crackers and Late July snacks. Sales were impacted by volume/mix declines and lower net price realization. 
 Gross Profit 
 Gross profit, defined as Net sales less Cost of products sold, increased by 79 million in 2025 from 2024. As a percent of sales, gross profit was 31.3 in 2025 and 2024.

 Marketing and Selling Expenses 
 Marketing and selling expenses as a percent of sales were 9.0 in 2025 compared to 8.8 in 2024. Marketing and selling expenses increased 13 in 2025 from 2024. The increase was primarily due to the impact of the acquisition (approximately 12 points) and higher costs associated with costs savings and optimization initiatives (approximately 3 points), partially offset by lower other marketing expenses (approximately 2 points). 
 Administrative Expenses 
 Administrative expenses as a percent of sales were 6.3 in 2025 and 2024. Administrative expenses increased 11 in 2025 from 2024. The increase was primarily due to higher general administrative costs and inflation (approximately 7 points); the impact of the acquisition (approximately 5 points) and higher costs associated with cost savings initiatives (approximately 4 points), partially offset by increased benefits from cost savings initiatives (approximately 4 points). 
 Other Expenses / (Income) 
 Other expenses were 43 million in 2025 compared to 24 million in 2024 . Other expenses in 2025 included a loss of 25 million on the sale of the Pop Secret popcorn business, accelerated amortization expense of 7 million and a postretirement actuarial loss of 2 million.

(1) See Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on restructuring charges. 
 Operating earnings from Meals Beverages increased 17 . The increase was primarily due to the benefit of the acquisition of Sovos Brands and lower marketing and selling expenses. 
 Operating earnings from Snacks decreased 12 . The decrease was primarily due to lower gross profit. Gross profit decreased primarily due to the impact of cost inflation and other supply chain costs as well as unfavorable net price realization, partially offset by supply chain productivity improvements. 
 Corporate expense in 2025 included the following: 
 costs of 29 million related to costs savings and optimization initiatives; 
 25 million loss on the sale of the Pop Secret popcorn business; 
 7 million of accelerated amortization expense; 
 2 million postretirement actuarial loss; 
 1 million of certain litigation expenses, including expenses related to Plum; 
 4 million of unrealized mark-to-market gains on outstanding undesignated commodity hedges; and 
 1 million of insurance recoveries related to a cybersecurity incident.

 3 million of costs related to a cybersecurity incident; and 
 2 million of Plum litigation expenses. 
 Interest Expense 
 Interest expense of 87 million in 2025 increased from 49 million in 2024 primarily due to higher levels of debt. 
 Taxes on Earnings 
 The effective tax rate was 23.2 in 2025 and 24.5 in 2024. The decrease in the effective tax rate was primarily due to excess tax benefits associated with the vesting of stock-based compensation awards. 
 
 Restructuring Charges, Cost Savings Initiatives and Other Optimization Initiatives 
 Multi-year Cost Savings Initiatives and Snyder's-Lance, Inc. (Snyder's-Lance) Cost Transformation Program and Integration 
 Continuing Operations 
 Beginning in fiscal 2015, we implemented initiatives to reduce costs and to streamline our organizational structure. 
 Over the years, we expanded these initiatives by continuing to optimize our supply chain and manufacturing networks, as well as our information technology infrastructure. 
 On March 26, 2018, we completed the acquisition of Snyder's-Lance. Prior to the acquisition, Snyder's-Lance launched a cost transformation program following a comprehensive review of its operations with the goal of significantly improving its financial performance. We continued to implement this program and identified opportunities for additional cost synergies as we integrated Snyder's-Lance. 
 32 

In 2022, we expanded these initiatives as we continued to pursue cost savings by further optimizing our supply chain and manufacturing network and through effective cost management. In the second quarter of 2023, we announced plans to consolidate our Snacks offices in Charlotte, North Carolina, and Norwalk, Connecticut, into our headquarters in Camden, New Jersey. 
 A summary of the pre-tax charges recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings related to these initiatives is as follows: Three Months Ended (Millions, except per share amounts)

 (Millions) Total Program 
 Meals Beverages 288 Snacks 383 Corporate 224 Total 895 
 As of July 28, 2024, we substantially completed the multi-year cost savings initiatives and Snyder's-Lance cost transformation program and integration, and we generated total pre-tax savings of approximately 950 million. Certain phases that had not been fully implemented were incorporated into the 2025 cost savings initiatives described below. 
 Sovos Brands Integration Initiatives 
 On March 12, 2024, we completed the acquisition of Sovos Brands. See Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. We identified opportunities for cost synergies as we integrate Sovos Brands. 
 In 2024, we recorded Restructuring charges of 21 million for severance pay and benefits related to initiatives to achieve the synergies and generated pre-tax savings of 10 million. The charges incurred in 2024 were associated with the Meals Beverages segment. 
 In 2025, the initiatives to achieve synergies were incorporated into the cost savings initiatives described below. 
 33 

2025 Cost Savings Initiatives 
 On September 10, 2024, we announced plans to implement cost savings initiatives beginning in 2025, including initiatives to further optimize our supply chain and manufacturing network, optimization of our information technology infrastructure and targeted cost management. We also identified additional opportunities for cost synergies as we integrate Sovos Brands. As mentioned above, we substantially completed our previous multi-year cost savings initiatives and Snyder's-Lance cost transformation program and integration. Certain initiatives from that program have been incorporated into our 2025 cost savings initiatives. Cost estimates for the 2025 initiatives, as well as timing for certain activities, are continuing to be developed. 
 A summary of the pre-tax charges recorded in the Consolidated Statement of Earnings related to these initiatives is as follows: 
 Three Months Ended (Millions, except per share amounts) October 27, 2024 Restructuring charges 6 Administrative expenses 11 Cost of products sold 8 Marketing and selling expenses 1 Research and development expenses 1 Total pre-tax charges 27 Aggregate after-tax impact 21 Per share impact .07 
 A summary of the pre-tax costs associated with the initiatives is as follows: (Millions) Recognized as of October 27, 2024 
 Severance pay and benefits 
 6 Asset impairment/accelerated depreciation 9 Implementation costs and other related costs 
 12 Total 27 
 The total estimated pre-tax costs for actions that have been identified to date are approximately 190 million, and we expect to incur substantially all of the costs through 2028. These estimates will be updated as the detailed plans are developed. 
 We expect the costs for the actions that have been identified to date to consist of the following: approximately 20 million in severance pay and benefits; approximately 50 million in asset impairment and accelerated depreciation; and approximately 120 million in implementation costs and other related costs. We expect these pre-tax costs to be associated with our segments as follows: Meals Beverages - approximately 72 ; Snacks - approximately 12 and Corporate - approximately 16 . 
 Of the aggregate 190 million of pre-tax costs identified to date, we expect approximately 135 million will be cash expenditures. In addition, we expect to invest approximately 215 million in capital expenditures, of which we invested 18 million as of October 27, 2024. The capital expenditures primarily relate to optimization of production within our manufacturing network, implementation of our existing SAP enterprise-resource planning system for Sovos Brands and optimization of information technology infrastructure and applications. 
 We expect the initiatives, once all phases are implemented, to generate annual ongoing savings of approximately 250 million by the end of 2028. As of October 27, 2024, we have generated total program-to-date pre-tax savings of 30 million.

 Three Months Ended (Millions) October 27, 2024 Meals Beverages 21 Snacks 3 Corporate 3 Total 27 
 Other Optimization Initiatives 
 In the second quarter of 2024, we began implementation of an initiative to improve the effectiveness of our Snacks direct-store-delivery route-to-market network. Pursuant to this initiative we will purchase certain Pepperidge Farm and Snyder's-Lance routes where there are opportunities to unlock greater scale in select markets, combine them and sell the combined routes to independent contractor distributors. We expect to execute this program in a staggered rollout and to incur expenses of up to approximately 115 million through 2029. In the three-month period ended October 27, 2024, we incurred 8 million in Marketing and selling expenses related to this initiative. As of October 27, 2024, we have incurred 13 million in Marketing and selling expenses related to this initiative. 
 
 LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES 
 We expect foreseeable liquidity and capital resource requirements to be met through anticipated cash flows from operations; long-term borrowings; short-term borrowings, which may include commercial paper; credit facilities; and cash and cash equivalents. We believe that our sources of financing will be adequate to meet our future requirements. 
 We generated cash flows from operations of 225 million in 2025, compared to 174 million in 2024. The increase in 2025 was primarily due to changes in working capital and higher cash earnings. 
 We had negative working capital of 328 million as of October 27, 2024, and 1.386 billion as of July 28, 2024. Current assets were less than current liabilities, which included debt maturing in one year, due to a focus on lowering core working capital requirements. Total debt maturing within one year was 1.212 billion as of October 27, 2024, and 1.423 billion as of July 28, 2024. 
 As part of our focus to lower core working capital requirements, we have worked with our suppliers to optimize our terms and conditions, including the extension of payment terms. Our current payment terms with our suppliers, which we deem to be commercially reasonable, generally range from 0 to 120 days. We also maintain agreements with third-party administrators that allow participating suppliers to track payment obligations from us, and, at the sole discretion of the supplier, sell those payment obligations to participating financial institutions. Our obligations to our suppliers, including amounts due and scheduled payment terms, are not impacted. Supplier participation in these agreements is voluntary. We have no economic interest in a supplier s decision to enter into these agreements and no direct financial relationship with the financial institutions. We have not pledged assets as security or provided any guarantees in connection with these arrangements. The payment of these obligations is included in cash provided by operating activities in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. Amounts outstanding under these programs, which are included in Accounts payable on the Consolidated Balance Sheets, were approximately 269 million at October 27, 2024 and 243 million at July 28, 2024. 
 Capital expenditures were 110 million in 2025 and 143 million in 2024. Capital expenditures in 2025 included chip and cracker capacity expansion for our Snacks business, enhancements to our headquarters in Camden, New Jersey and network optimization for our Meals Beverages business. Capital expenditures are expected to total approximately 500 million in 2025. 
 In Snacks, we have a direct-store-delivery distribution model that uses independent contractor distributors. From time to time, we purchase and sell routes, including certain routes under our optimization initiatives. The purchase and sale proceeds of the routes are reflected in investing activities.

On August 26, 2024, we sold our Pop Secret popcorn business for 70 million. 
 Dividend payments were 116 million in 2025 and 114 million in 2024. The regular quarterly dividend paid on our capital stock was .37 per share in both the first quarter of 2025 and 2024. On September 18, 2024, the Board of Directors declared a regular quarterly dividend of .37 per share payable on October 28, 2024 to shareholders of record at the close of business on October 3, 2024. On December 3, 2024, the Board of Directors approved an increase in the regular quarterly dividend from .37 per share to .39 per share, or 5 . They then declared a regular quarterly dividend of .39 per share payable on January 27, 2025 to shareholders of record at the close of business on January 2, 2025. 
 In September 2021, the Board approved a strategic share repurchase program of up to 500 million (September 2021 program). The September 2021 program has no expiration date, but it may be suspended or discontinued at any time. Repurchases under the September 2021 program may be made in open-market or privately negotiated transactions. In September 2024, the Board authorized an anti-dilutive share repurchase program of up to 250 million (September 2024 program) to offset the impact of dilution from shares issued under our stock compensation programs. The September 2024 program has no expiration date, but it may be suspended or discontinued at any time. Repurchases under the September 2024 program may be made in open-market or privately negotiated transactions. The September 2024 program replaced an anti-dilutive share repurchase program of up to 250 million that was approved by the Board in June 2021 and has been terminated. During the three-month periods ended October 27, 2024 and October 29, 2023, we repurchased 1.098 million shares at a cost of 54 million and 679 thousand shares at a cost of 28 million, respectively, pursuant to our anti-dilutive share repurchase programs. As of October 27, 2024, approximately 206 million remained available under the September 2024 program and approximately 301 million remained available under the September 2021 program. See Note 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements and Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds for additional information. 
 In August 2023, we filed a registration statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission that registered an indeterminate amount of debt securities. Under the registration statement we may issue debt securities from time to time, depending on market conditions. On October 2, 2024, pursuant to the registration statement, we completed the issuance of senior unsecured notes of 1.15 billion, consisting of: 
 800 million aggregate principal amount of notes bearing interest at a fixed rate of 4.75 per annum, due March 23, 2035, with interest payable semi-annually on each of March 23 and September 23 commencing March 23, 2025; and 
 350 million aggregate principal amount of notes bearing interest at a fixed rate of 5.25 per annum, due October 13, 2054, with interest payable semi-annually on each of April 13 and October 13 commencing April 13, 2025. 
 The notes contain customary covenants and events of default. If a change of control triggering event occurs, we will be required to offer to purchase the notes at a purchase price equal to 101 of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the purchase date. I n October 2024, we used a portion of the net proceeds from the issuance of the notes to repay 200 million of the 400 million outstanding under our 2022 Delayed Draw Term Loan Credit Agreement due November 15, 2025 and a portion of our outstanding commercial paper. We have 1.15 billion aggregate principal amount of senior notes maturing in March 2025, which we intend to repay by using a portion of the proceeds from the issuance of the notes along with cash on hand and issuing commercial paper. 
 As of October 27, 2024, we had 1.212 billion of short-term borrowings due within one year, of which 34 million was comprised of commercial paper borrowings. As of October 27, 2024, we issued 27 million of standby letters of credit. 
 On April 16, 2024, we entered into a Five-Year Credit Agreement for an unsecured, senior revolving credit facility (the 2024 Revolving Credit Facility Agreement) in an aggregate principal amount equal to 1.85 billion with a maturity date of April 16, 2029 or such later date as extended pursuant to the terms set forth in the 2024 Revolving Credit Facility Agreement. The 2024 Revolving Credit Facility Agreement remained unused at October 27, 2024, except for 1 million of standby letters of credit that we issued under it. We may increase the 2024 Revolving Credit Facility Agreement commitments up to an additional 500 million, subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions. Loans under the 2024 Revolving Credit Facility Agreement will bear interest at the rates specified in the 2024 Revolving Credit Facility Agreement, which vary based on the type of loan and certain other conditions. The 2024 Revolving Credit Facility Agreement contains customary covenants, including a financial covenant with respect to a minimum consolidated interest coverage ratio of consolidated adjusted EBITDA to consolidated interest expense of not less than 3.25:1.00, and customary events of default for credit facilities of this type. The facility supports our commercial paper program and other general corporate purposes. We expect to continue to access the commercial paper markets, bank credit lines and utilize cash flows from operations to support our short-term liquidity requirements. 
 We are in compliance with the covenants contained in our credit facilities and debt securities.

Actual results could differ from those estimates and assumptions. Our significant accounting policies are described in Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended July 28, 2024 (2024 Annual Report on Form 10-K). The accounting policies we used in preparing these financial statements are substantially consistent with those we applied in our 2024 Annual Report on Form 10-K.

 impairment to goodwill or other intangible assets; 
 our ability to protect our intellectual property rights; 
 increased liabilities and costs related to our defined benefit pension plans; 
 our ability to attract and retain key talent; 
 goals and initiatives related to, and the impacts of, climate change, including from weather-related events;

 (d) the right to approve, by at least two-thirds of the outstanding shares of the class of Preferred Stock affected, the adoption of any amendment to the Restated Certificate of Incorporation or the by-laws that would materially change existing terms of such class of Preferred Stock, provided that if all series of a class of Preferred Stock are not equally affected by such amendment, then such amendment shall receive the approval of two-thirds of the outstanding shares of the class and, in addition, two-thirds of the outstanding shares of the series that will have a diminished status.
