Contract
Assets and Liabilities 

Contract
liabilities arise in our healthcare IT, VasoHealthcare, and VasoMedical businesses. In our healthcare IT business, payment arrangements
with clients typically include an initial payment due upon contract signing and milestone-based payments based upon product delivery
and go-live, as well as post go-live monthly payments for subscription and support fees. Customer payments received, or receivables recorded,
in advance of go-live and customer acceptance, where applicable, are deferred as contract liabilities. Such amounts aggregated approximately
 ,000 and ,000 at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively, and are included in accrued expenses and other liabilities
in our condensed consolidated balance sheets. 

In
our VasoHealthcare business, we bill amounts for certain milestones in advance of customer acceptance of the underlying equipment. Such
amounts aggregated approximately ,000 and ,000 at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively, and are classified
in our condensed consolidated balance sheets as either current or long-term deferred revenue. In addition, we record a contract liability
for amounts expected to be repaid to GEHC due to customer order reductions. Such amounts aggregated approximately ,000 and ,000
at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively, and are included in accrued expenses and other liabilities in our condensed
consolidated balance sheets. 

In
our VasoMedical business, we bill amounts for post-delivery services and varying duration service contracts in advance of performance.
Such amounts aggregated approximately ,000 and ,000 at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively, and are classified
in our condensed consolidated balance sheets as either current or long-term deferred revenue. 

During
the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, we recognized approximately million and million of revenues, respectively,
that were included in our contract liability balance at July 1, 2024 and January 1, 2024, respectively. 

Contract receivables - September 30 

Increase (decrease) 

Contract liabilities - January 1 

Contract liabilities - September 30 

Increase (decrease) 

The
decrease in contract receivables in the first nine months of 2024 and 2023 was due primarily to collections exceeding billings. The increase
in contract liabilities in the same periods is mainly attributable to orders exceeding deliveries. 

reportable segments. 

IT
 segment, operating through a wholly-owned subsidiary VasoTechnology, Inc., primarily focuses
 on healthcare IT and managed network technology services; 

Professional
 sales service segment, operating through a wholly-owned subsidiary Vaso Diagnostics, Inc.
 d/b/a VasoHealthcare, primarily focuses on the sale of healthcare capital equipment for GEHC

Treasury bills are classified as held-to-maturity and are carried at amortized cost of approximately at December

Cash
and cash equivalents represent cash and short-term, highly liquid investments either in certificates of deposit, treasury bills, money

of three months or less from the date of acquisition. 

The
Company complies with the provisions of ASC 820 Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures ASC 820 ). 
Under ASC 820, fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability (i.e., the
 exit price in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. 

In
determining fair value, the Company uses various valuation approaches. ASC 820 establishes a fair value hierarchy for inputs used
in measuring fair value that maximizes the use of observable inputs and minimizes the use of unobservable inputs by requiring that the
most observable inputs be used when available. Observable inputs are those that market participants would use in pricing the asset
or liability based on market data obtained from sources independent of the Company. Unobservable inputs reflect the Company s
assumptions about the inputs market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability developed based on the best information
available in the circumstances. The fair value hierarchy is categorized into three levels based on the inputs as follows: 

Level
1 

Level
1 applies to assets or liabilities for which there are quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. 

Level
2 

Level
2 applies to assets or liabilities for which there are inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability
such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets; quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in markets
with insufficient volume or infrequent transactions (less active markets); or model-derived valuations in which significant inputs are
observable or can be derived principally from, or corroborated by, observable market data. 

Level
3 

Level
3 applies to assets or liabilities for which there are unobservable inputs to the valuation methodology that are significant to the measurement
of the fair value of the assets or liabilities.

Contract
receivables under Revenue from Contracts with Customers ASC Topic 606 consist of trade
receivables and unbilled receivables. Trade receivables include amounts due for shipped products and services rendered. Unbilled
receivables represent variable consideration recognized in accordance with ASC Topic 606 but not yet billable. Amounts recorded
 billed and unbilled - under the GEHC Agreement are subject to adjustment in subsequent periods should the underlying sales
order amount, upon which the receivable is based, change. 

Allowance
for credit losses and commission adjustments include estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required
payments, and adjustments arising from subsequent changes in sales order amounts that may reduce the amount the Company will ultimately
receive under the GEHC Agreement.

General
Overview 

Our
Business Segments 

Vaso
Corporation Vaso was incorporated in Delaware in July 1987. We principally operate in three distinct business segments
in the healthcare and information technology industries. We manage and evaluate our operations, and report our financial results, through
these three business segments. 

IT
 segment, operating through a wholly-owned subsidiary VasoTechnology, Inc., primarily focuses
 on healthcare IT and managed network technology services; 

Professional
 sales service segment, operating through a wholly-owned subsidiary Vaso Diagnostics, Inc.
 d/b/a VasoHealthcare, primarily focuses on the sale of healthcare capital equipment for GEHC
 into the healthcare provider middle market; and 

Equipment
 segment, primarily focuses on the design, manufacture, sale and service of proprietary medical
 devices and software, operating through a wholly-owned subsidiary VasoMedical, Inc., which
 in turn operates through Vasomedical Solutions, Inc. for domestic business and Vasomedical
 Global Corp. for international business, respectively. 

Termination of Business Combination Agreement 

On September 17, 2024 Vaso provided notice to Achari
to terminate the Business Combination Agreement with Achari. Vaso intends to continue to seek opportunities to increase stockholder value,
including through internal growth, new partnerships, and strategic investments with a concentration on medical and IT service companies. 

Critical
Accounting Policies and Estimates 

Our
discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon the accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated
financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States U.S.
GAAP ). The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make judgments, estimates and
assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, expenses, and the related disclosures at the date of the
financial statements and during the reporting period. Although these estimates are based on our knowledge of current events, our actual
amounts and results could differ from those estimates. The estimates made are based on historical factors, current circumstances, and
the experience and judgment of our management, who continually evaluate the judgments, estimates and assumptions and may employ outside
experts to assist in the evaluations. 

Page 16 

Vaso
Corporation and Subsidiaries 

Certain
of our accounting policies are deemed critical , as they are both most important to the financial statement presentation
and require management s most difficult, subjective or complex judgments as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect
of matters that are inherently uncertain. For a discussion of our critical accounting policies, see Note B to the condensed consolidated
financial statements and Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in
our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 as filed with the SEC on April 1, 2024. 

Results
of Operations For the Three Months Ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 

Revenues 

Total
revenue for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was 20,769,000 and 19,449,000 ,
respectively, representing an increase of 1,320,000, or 7 year-over-year. On a segment basis, revenue in the IT and professional sales
services segments increased by 1,215,000 and 277,000, respectively, while revenue in the equipment segment decreased by 172,000. 

Revenue
in the IT segment for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was 11,082,000 compared to 9,867,000
 for the three months ended September 30, 2023, an increase of 1,215,000, or 12 , of which 1,133,000 resulted from higher network
services revenue and 82,000 from higher revenues in the healthcare IT business. Monthly recurring revenue in the IT segment
accounted for 9,341,000 or 84 of the segment revenue in the third quarter of 2024, and 9,302,000 or 94 of the segment revenue for
the same quarter last year (see Note C). 

Commission
revenues in the professional sales service segment were 9,114,000 in the third quarter of 2024, an increase of 277,000, or 3 , as compared
to 8,837,000 in the same quarter of 2023. The increase in commission revenues was due primarily to both an increase in the volume of
underlying equipment delivered by GEHC during the period and a higher blended commission rate applicable to such deliveries. The Company
only recognizes commission revenue when the underlying equipment has been accepted at the customer site in accordance with the specific
terms of the sales agreement. Consequently, amounts billable, or billed and received, under the agreement with GEHC prior to customer
acceptance of the equipment are recorded as deferred revenue in the condensed consolidated balance sheet. As of September 30, 2024, 33,117,000
in deferred commission revenue was recorded in the Company s condensed consolidated balance sheet, of which 15,623,000 was long-term.
 As of September 30, 2023, 33,232,000 in deferred commission revenue was recorded in the Company s
condensed consolidated balance sheet, of which 14,701,000 was long-term. The small decrease in deferred revenue is principally
due to high deliveries in the 4 th quarter of 2023, partially offset by an increase in new orders booked in 2024. 

Revenue
in the equipment segment decreased by 172,000, or 23 , to 573,000 for the three-month period ended September 30, 2024 from 745,000 for
the same period of the prior year, due to lower ARCS subscription revenues in our US operations as well as lower
deliveries in our China operations. 

Gross
Profit 

Gross
profit for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was 11,756,000, or 57 of revenue, and 12,043,000,
or 62 of revenue, respectively, representing a decrease of 287,000, or 2 year-over-year. On a segment basis, gross profit in
the professional sales service segment increased 75,000, or 1 , while gross profit in the IT and equipment segments decreased 163,000,
or 4 , and 199,000, or 35 , respectively. 

IT
segment gross profit for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was 4,111,000, or 37 of the segment revenue, compared to 4,274,000,
or 43 of the segment revenue for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The year-over-year decrease of 163,000, or 4 , was primarily
a result of a lower margin sales mix in the network services business. 

Professional
sales service segment gross profit was 7,276,000, or 80 of segment revenue, for the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared
to 7,201,000, or 81 of the segment revenue, for the three months ended September 30, 2023, reflecting an increase of 75,000, or 1 .
The increase was due to higher commission revenue as a result of higher volume of GEHC equipment delivered during the third quarter of
2024 and a higher blended commission rate, when compared to the same period last year, partially offset by higher commission expenses.
Cost of commissions in the professional sales service segment of 1,838,000 and 1,636,000 , for
the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, reflected commission expense associated with recognized commission
revenues. 

Page 17 

Vaso
Corporation and Subsidiaries 

Commission
expense associated with short-term deferred revenue is recorded as short-term deferred commission expense, or with long-term deferred
revenue as part of other assets, on the balance sheet until the related commission revenue is recognized. 

Equipment
segment gross profit decreased to 369,000, or 64 of segment revenues, for the third quarter of 2024 compared to 568,000, or 76 of
segment revenues, for the same quarter of 2023. The 199,000, or 35 , decrease in gross profit was primarily the result of lower sales
and a lower gross margin for product sales in China during the quarter. 

Operating
Income (Loss) 

Operating
income (loss) for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was (1,393,000) compared to 907,000 for the same quarter in 2023, representing
a decrease of 2,300,000, or 254 , due primarily to 1,409,000 higher costs for investment banking activities, and to both the decrease
in gross profit and the increase in operating costs (below) in the IT segment. On a segment basis, the IT segment recorded an operating
loss of 695,000 in the third quarter of 2024 as compared to an operating loss of 187,000 in the same period of 2023; the professional
sales service segment recorded operating income of 1,531,000 in the third quarter of 2024 as opposed to operating income of 1,648,000
in the same period of 2023; and the equipment segment recorded an operating loss of 223,000 in the third quarter of 2024 as compared
to an operating loss of 83,000 in the same period of 2023. 

Operating
loss in the IT segment increased to 695,000 for the three-month period ended September 30, 2024 from an operating loss of 187,000 in
the same period of 2023, due to lower gross profit and higher SG A costs. Operating income in the professional sales service segment
decreased by 117,000 in the three-month period ended September 30, 2024 as compared to operating income in the same period of 2023,
due to higher SG A costs, partially offset by higher gross profit. The equipment segment reported an operating loss of 223,000 in
the third quarter of 2024, compared to an operating loss of 83,000 in the third quarter 2023, an increase of 140,000, primarily due
to lower gross profit partially offset by lower SG A costs in both US and China operations. 

SG A
costs for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 were 11,409,000 and 10,887 ,000 ,
respectively, representing an increase of 522,000, or 5 year-over-year. On a segment basis, SG A costs in the IT segment
increased by 346,000 in the third quarter of 2024 from the same quarter of the prior year due primarily to higher personnel costs;
SG A costs in the professional sales service segment increased 191,000 due mainly to higher personnel costs associated with
provision of expanded services; and SG A costs in the equipment segment decreased 41,000 due primarily to lower personnel
costs. Corporate SG A costs not allocated to segments increased 26,000 due mainly to higher annual meeting costs, partially
offset by lower directors fees. Investment banking expenses for the business combination with Achari Venture Holdings I
increased to 1,549,000 in the third quarter of 2024 from 40,000 in the third quarter of 2023. 

Research
and development expenses were 191,000, or 1 of revenues, for the third quarter of 2024, a decrease of 79,000, or 9 , from 209,000,
or 1 of revenues, for the third quarter of 2023. The decrease is primarily attributable to lower product development expenses
in the equipment segment. 

Adjusted
EBITDA 

We
define Adjusted EBITDA (earnings (loss) before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization), which is a non-GAAP financial measure,
as net income (loss), plus interest expense (income), net; tax expense; depreciation and amortization; and non-cash expenses for share-based
compensation. Adjusted EBITDA is a metric that is used by the investment community for comparative and valuation purposes. We disclose
this metric in order to support and facilitate the dialogue with research analysts and investors. 

Page 18 

Vaso
Corporation and Subsidiaries 

Adjusted
EBITDA is not a measure of financial performance under U.S. GAAP and should not be considered a substitute for operating income, which
we consider to be the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP measure. Adjusted EBITDA has limitations as an analytical tool, and when assessing
our operating performance, you should not consider Adjusted EBITDA in isolation, or as a substitute for net income or other consolidated
income statement data prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Other companies may calculate Adjusted EBITDA differently than we do, limiting
its usefulness as a comparative measure. 

A
reconciliation of net income (loss) to Adjusted EBITDA is set forth below:

Adjusted
EBITDA decreased by 2,393,000, to (1,208,000) in the quarter ended September 30, 2024 from 1,185,000
 in the quarter ended September 30, 2023. The decrease was primarily attributable to the decrease in net income and increase in
interest income. 

Interest
and Other Income (Expense) 

Interest
and other income (expense) for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was 242,000 as compared to 307,000
 for the corresponding period of 2023. The decrease in interest and other income (expense) was due primarily to higher loss at
EECP Global, partially offset by higher interest income resulting from higher money market and US Treasury bill balances. 

Income
Tax Expense 

For
the three months ended September 30, 2024, we recorded income tax expense of 30,000 as compared to 16,000
 for the corresponding period of 2023. The 14,000 increase is due mainly to higher state tax expense. 

Net
Income (Loss) 

Net
loss for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was 1,181,000 as compared to net income of 1,198,000 for the three months ended
September 30, 2023, representing a decrease of 2,379,000. Income (loss) per share of (0.01) and 0.01 was recorded in the three-month
periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The principal cause of the decrease in net income is the increase in business
combination transaction costs, decrease in gross profit and increase in SG A costs, partially offset by the increase in interest
income. 

Results
of Operations For the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 

Revenues 

Total
revenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was 59,732,000 and 59,107 ,000 , respectively,
representing an increase of 625,000, or 1 year-over-year. On a segment basis, revenue in the IT segment increased 1,249,000, while
revenue in the professional sales service and equipment segments decreased 51,000 and 573,000, respectively. 

Page 19 

Vaso
Corporation and Subsidiaries 

Revenue
in the IT segment for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 31,825,000 compared to 30,576 ,000 for
the nine months ended September 30, 2023, an increase of 1,249,000, or 4 , of which 1,561,000 resulted from higher network
services revenue, offset by 312,000 lower revenue from healthcare IT services. Our monthly recurring revenue in the IT segment
accounted for 27,445,000 or 86 of the segment revenue in the first nine months of 2024, and 28,180,000 or 92 of the segment
revenue for the same period last year (see Note C). 

Commission
revenues in the professional sales service segment were 26,350,000 in the first nine months of 2024, a decrease of 51,000, or less
than 1 , as compared to 26,401,000 in the first nine months of 2023. The decrease in commission
revenues was due primarily to a slight decrease in the volume of underlying equipment delivered by GEHC during the period, offset by
a higher blended commission rate applicable to such deliveries. The Company recognizes commission revenue when the underlying equipment
has been accepted at the customer site in accordance with the specific terms of the sales agreement. Consequently, amounts billable,
or billed and received, under the agreement with GEHC prior to customer acceptance of the equipment are recorded as deferred revenue
in the condensed consolidated balance sheet. As of September 30, 2024, 33,232,000 in deferred commission revenue was recorded in the
Company s condensed consolidated balance sheet, of which 14,701,000 was long-term. As of September 30, 2023, 33,232,000 in deferred
commission revenue was recorded in the Company s condensed consolidated balance sheet, of which 14,701,000 was long-term. The
small decrease in deferred revenue is principally due to high deliveries in the 4 th quarter of 2023, partially offset by an
increase in new orders booked in 2024. 

Revenue
in the equipment segment decreased by 573,000, or 27 , to 1,557,000 for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024 from 2,130 ,000
 for the same period of the prior year, principally due to lower equipment deliveries in our China operations and lower cloud-based
software-as-a-service SaaS sales in the U.S. 

Gross
Profit 

Gross
profit for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was 34,824,000, or 58 of revenue, and 36,540,000, or 62 of revenue,
respectively, representing a decrease of 1,716,000, or 5 year-over-year. On a segment basis, gross profit in the IT, professional sales
service, and equipment segments decreased 569,000, or 4 ; 653,000, or 3 ; and 494,000, or 31 , respectively. 

IT
segment gross profit for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 12,886,000, or 40 of the segment revenue, compared to 13,455,000,
or 44 of the segment revenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The year-over-year decrease of 569,000, or 4 , was primarily
a result of lower margin product sales mix in both the network service and healthcare IT businesses, partially offset by higher network
service revenues. 

Professional
sales service segment gross profit was 20,827,000, or 79 of segment revenue, for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared
to 21,480,000, or 81 of the segment revenue, for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, reflecting a decrease of 653,000, or 3 .
The decrease was primarily due to the product mix of diagnostic imaging revenues and ultrasound revenues, where ultrasound revenues incur
higher cost of commissions. Cost of commissions in the professional sales service segment of 5,523,000 and 4,921 ,000 ,
for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, reflected commission expense associated with recognized commission
revenues. 

Commission
expense associated with short-term deferred revenue is recorded as short-term deferred commission expense, or with long-term deferred
revenue as part of other assets, on the balance sheet until the related commission revenue is recognized. 

Equipment
segment gross profit decreased to 1,111,000, or 71 of segment revenues, for the first nine months of 2024 compared to 1,605,000, or
75 of segment revenues, for the same period in 2023. The 494,000, or 31 , decrease in gross profit was primarily the result of lower
revenue in both our China operations and our U.S. SaaS operations, and by lower gross profit margin. 

Operating
Income (Loss) 

Operating
income (loss) for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was (1,866,000), and 3, 225,000 ,
respectively, representing a decrease of 5,091,000 as a combined result of gross profit decreasing 1,716,000 and operating costs (below)
increasing 3,375,000, year-over-year. On a segment basis, the IT segment recorded an operating loss of 1,288,000 in the first nine
months of 2024 as compared to an operating loss of 133,000 in the same period of 2023; operating income in the professional sales service
segment decreased by 1,602,000, from 4,784,000 in the first nine months of 2023 to 3,182,000 in the same period of 2024; and the equipment
segment recorded an operating loss of 809,000 in the first nine months of 2024 as compared to an operating loss of 214,000 in the same
period of 2023. 

Operating
loss in the IT segment increased to 1,288,000 for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024 as compared to an operating loss of
 133,000 in the same period of 2023, due primarily to lower gross profit and higher SG A costs. Operating income in the professional
sales service segment decreased 1,602,000 to 3,182,000 in the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024 as compared to operating income
of 4,784,000 in the same period of 2023, due to higher SG A costs and lower gross profit. The equipment segment reported an operating
loss of 809,000 in the first nine months of 2024, compared to an operating loss of 214,000 in the first nine months of 2023, an increase
of 494,000, due mainly to lower gross profit, as well as to higher SG A and R D costs. 

Page 20 

Vaso
Corporation and Subsidiaries 

SG A
costs for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 were 34,316,000 and 32,691 ,000 ,
respectively, representing an increase of 1,625,000, or 5 year-over-year. On a segment basis, SG A costs in the IT segment
increased by 605,000 in the first nine months of 2024 from the same period of the prior year due mainly to higher personnel costs;
SG A costs in the professional sales service segment increased by 948,000 due to higher personnel costs associated with the
provision of expanded services, and to higher travel costs; and SG A costs in the equipment segment increased by 78,000 due
mainly to higher personnel costs. Corporate SG A costs not allocated to segments decreased 7,000 due mainly to lower director
fees and insurance costs, partially offset by higher annual meeting costs. Expenses for investment banking activities associated
with the business combination with Achari Venture Holdings I increased to 1,787,000 in the nine months ended September 30, 2024
from 40,000 in the same period of 2023. 

Research
and development R D expenses were 587,000, or 1 of revenues, for the first nine months of 2024, an increase of
 3,000, or less than 1 , from 584,000, or 1 of revenues, for the first nine months of 2023. The
increase is primarily attributable to higher product development expenses in the equipment segment.

provided by operating activities of 6,860,000 for the same period in 2023. The changes in the account
balances primarily reflect a decrease in accounts and other receivables of 4,111,000 and increases in accounts payables and deferred
revenue of 1,886,000 and 921,000, respectively; partially offset by decreases in accrued commissions and accrued expenses of 1,092,000
and 2,439,000, respectively. 

Cash
provided by investing activities during the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024 was 11,953,000 attributed to 13,757,000 in redemption
of short-term investments, offset by 1,231,000 used for the purchase of equipment and software and 573,000 used in the funding of a
working capital loan to Achari. 

Cash
used in financing activities during the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024 was 67,000 resulting primarily from the repayment
of notes payable and finance lease obligations. 

Liquidity 

The
Company expects to generate sufficient cash flow from operations to satisfy its obligations for at least the next twelve months.
