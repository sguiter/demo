 horsepower, including approximately operating horsepower, for aggregate consideration consisting of million in cash and shares of common stock with an acquisition date fair value of million. The cash portion of the purchase price was funded with proceeds from the July 2024 Equity Offering and the 2032 Notes offering and borrowings under the Credit Facility. The purchase price paid is subject to customary post-closing adjustments in accordance with the terms of the purchase and sale agreement. The TOPS Acquisition was accounted for using the acquisition method of accounting, which requires, among other things, assets acquired and liabilities assumed to be recorded at their fair value on the acquisition date. The excess of the consideration transferred over those fair values is recorded as goodwill. The preliminary allocation of the purchase price, which is subject to certain adjustments, was based upon preliminary valuations. Our estimates and assumptions are subject to change upon the completion of management s review of the final valuations. We are in the process of finalizing valuations related to property, plant and equipment, identifiable intangible assets and goodwill. Post-closing adjustments to the purchase price could impact future depreciation and amortization as well as income tax expense. The final valuation of net assets acquired is expected to be completed as soon as practicable, but no later than one year from the acquisition date.

 . The preliminary fair value of the property, plant and equipment was determined using both the cost and market approach. Under the cost approach, we estimated the replacement cost of the assets by evaluating recent purchases of similar assets or published data, then adjusted replacement cost for physical deterioration and functional and economic obsolescence, as applicable. We then considered the market approach by comparing our estimated dollar per horsepower to market comparables and market participant assumptions and adjusted as necessary. Other fixed assets were valued using the indirect cost method, whereby we applied asset-specific trend information using published indexes to calculate the estimated replacement cost of assets that were identified to be reflected at historical cost. Other assets were depreciated based on published normal useful life estimates and prior experience with similar assets. Intangible Assets The intangible assets consist of customer relationships and trade names that have estimated useful lives of and , respectively. The preliminary amount of intangible assets and their associated useful life were determined based on the period over which the assets are expected to contribute directly or indirectly to our future cash flows. The fair value of the identifiable intangible assets related to customer relationships was determined using the multi-period excess earnings method, which is a specific application of the discounted cash flow method, an income approach, whereby we estimated and then discounted the future cash flows of the intangible asset by adjusting overall business revenue for attrition, obsolescence, cost of sales, operating expenses, taxes and the required returns attributable to other contributory assets acquired. Significant estimates made in arriving at expected future cash flows included our expected customer attrition rate and the amount of earnings attributable to the assets. To discount the estimated future cash flows, we utilized a discount rate that was at a premium to our WACC to reflect the less liquid nature of the customer relationships relative to the tangible assets acquired. It is generally accepted that the fair market value of a trade name is best measured by the relief-from-royalty method under the income approach, whereby we calculated the royalty savings by estimating a reasonable royalty rate that a third party would negotiate in a licensing agreement expressed as a percentage of total revenue involving a trade name. The revenue related to the trade name was multiplied by the selected royalty rate over the estimated expected useful life of the trade name to arrive at the royalty savings. The royalty savings were tax effected and discounted to present value using a discount rate commensurate with the risk profile of the trade name relative to our WACC and the return on the other acquired assets of TOPS. Goodwill The preliminary amount of goodwill resulting from the TOPS Acquisition is attributable to the expansion of our services in the Permian Basin where we currently operate and was allocated to our contract operations segment. The goodwill recorded is considered to have an indefinite life and will be reviewed annually for impairment or more frequently if indicators of potential impairment exist. All of the goodwill recorded for the TOPS Acquisition is expected to be deductible for U.S. federal income tax purposes.

 million and a corresponding indemnification asset of million based on facts existing on the date of acquisition. The tax contingency arose from pre-acquisition activities of TOPS. As part of the acquisition, the sellers agreed to indemnify us for certain tax contingencies up to million as of the acquisition date. Dependent upon facts and circumstances, the sellers indemnification obligation may be reduced over a period of from the acquisition date but may also be extended until the resolution of claims timely submitted to the sellers. The results of operations attributable to the TOPS Acquisition have been included in our condensed consolidated financial statements as part of our contract operations segment since the date of acquisition. Revenue attributable to the assets acquired from the acquisition date through September 30, 2024 was million. We are unable to provide earnings attributable to the assets and liabilities acquired since the acquisition date, as we do not prepare full stand-alone earnings reports for those assets and liabilities. Transaction-Related Costs In connection with the TOPS Acquisition, we recorded million and million of transaction-related costs in our condensed consolidated statements of operations during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively. The following table presents transaction-related cost incurred by cost type: Compensation-related costs (2) Other costs Total transaction-related costs (1) Professional fees include legal, advisory, consulting and other fees. (2) Compensation-related costs include amounts related to employee retention and other compensation related arrangements associated with the acquisition. Payments are due and payable at various times up to and including the anniversary of the TOPS Acquisition. Unaudited Pro Forma Financial Information The unaudited pro forma financial information for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was derived by adjusting our historical financial statements in order to give effect to the assets and liabilities acquired in the TOPS Acquisition. The TOPS Acquisition is presented in this unaudited pro forma financial information as though the acquisition occurred as of January 1, 2023, and reflects the following: the effects of the employee retention and other compensation-related arrangements associated with the TOPS Acquisition; the application of our accounting policies and adjusting the results of TOPS to reflect the additional depreciation and amortization that would have been charged assuming the fair value adjustments to property, plant, and equipment, and intangible assets had been applied from January 1, 2023; the interest expense resulting from the 2032 Notes, the 2027 Notes Tender Offer, and the First Amendment to the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement; the exclusion of million and million of nonrecurring financial advisory, legal, audit and other professional fees incurred related to the acquisition and recorded to transaction-related costs in our condensed consolidated statements of operations during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively. The nine months ended September 30, 2023 pro forma earnings were adjusted to reflect these charges; and

We have elected the fair value option to account for this investment, and during the nine months ended September 30, 2023, we recognized unrealized losses of million related to the change in fair value of our investment (see Note 15 Fair Value Measurements )). Changes in the fair value of this investment are recognized in other expense , net in our condensed consolidated statements of operations. In August 2024, ECOTEC issued a pro-rata capital call to certain investors, including Archrock, which resulted in an additional investment of million in ECOTEC.

The million of issuance costs were recorded as deferred financing costs within long-term debt in our condensed consolidated balance sheets and are being amortized to interest expense in our condensed consolidated statement of operations over the term of the notes. A portion of the net proceeds were used to fund a portion of the cash consideration for the TOPS Acquisition, the 2027 Notes Tender Offer and to repay borrowings outstanding under our Credit Facility. The 2032 Notes have not been and will not be registered under the Securities Act or the securities laws of any other jurisdiction and may not be offered or sold in the U.S. except pursuant to a registration exemption under the Securities Act and applicable state securities laws. We offered and issued the 2032 Notes only to qualified institutional buyers in accordance with Rule 144A under the Securities Act and to certain non-U.S. persons outside the U.S. in accordance with Regulation S under the Securities Act.

 of the 2032 Notes at specified redemption prices and make-whole premiums, plus any accrued and unpaid interest. 2027 Notes Tender Offer In connection with the offering of the 2032 Notes, we completed a concurrent cash tender offer of million, which reflects approximately of the aggregate principal amount of the tendered 2027 Notes and million of agent and legal fees. On the date of tender, the net carrying value of the tendered 2027 Notes was million and we recorded a debt extinguishment loss of million in our condensed consolidated statements of operations. First Amendment to the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement On August 28, 2024, we amended our Amended and Restated Credit Agreement to, among other things: increase the borrowing capacity of the Credit Facility from million to billion; increase the portion of the Credit Facility available for the issuance of swing line loans from million to million; increase the cash dominion trigger threshold amount from million to million; add certain financial institutions as lenders under the Credit Facility; join a newly formed wholly owned subsidiary of Archrock Services, L.P. as a guarantor and grantor under the Credit Facility; and modify certain other covenants to which we are subject to. 
 During both the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, we incurred million in transaction costs related to the First Amendment to the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, which were included in other assets in our condensed consolidated balance sheets and are being amortized over the remaining term of the Credit Facility. Amended and Restated Credit Agreement On May 16, 2023, we amended and restated our Credit Facility to, among other things: extend the maturity date of the Credit Facility from November 8, 2024 to May 16, 2028 (or December 2, 2026 or December 3, 2027 if any portion of the 2027 Notes and 2028 Notes, respectively, remain outstanding at such date); change the referenced rate from LIBOR to SOFR so that borrowings under the Credit Facility bear interest at, based on our election, either a base rate or SOFR, plus an applicable margin; and increase the portion of the Credit Facility available for the issuance of swing line loans from million to million.

 million in transaction costs related to the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, which were included in other assets in our condensed consolidated balance sheets and are being amortized over the remaining term of the Credit Facility. In addition, during the second quarter of 2023, we wrote off million of unamortized deferred financing costs as a result of the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, which was recorded to interest expense in our condensed consolidated statements of operations during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. As of September 30, 2024, there were million letters of credit outstanding under the Credit Facility and the applicable margin on borrowings outstanding was . The weighted-average annual interest rate on the outstanding balance under the Credit Facility was and at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. We incurred million and million of commitment fees on the daily unused amount of the Credit Facility during the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and million and million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. As of September 30, 2024, we were in compliance with all covenants under our Credit Facility. Additionally, all undrawn capacity on our Credit Facility was available for borrowings as of September 30, 2024. million and million, respectively, accrued for the outcomes of non-income-based tax audits. We do not expect that the ultimate resolutions of these audits will result in a material variance from the amounts accrued. We do not accrue for unasserted claims for tax audits unless we believe the assertion of a claim is probable, it is probable that it will be determined that the claim is owed and we can reasonably estimate the claim or range of the claim. We believe the likelihood is remote that the impact of potential unasserted claims from non-income-based tax audits could be material to our consolidated financial position, but it is possible that the resolution of future audits could be material to our consolidated results of operations or cash flows. As of both September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, million of the tax contingencies mentioned above related to audits that have advanced from the audit review phase to the contested hearing phase. As of September 30, 2024, million of the tax contingencies mentioned above had an offsetting indemnification asset. were indemnified as of December 31, 2023.

 ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto included in this Form 10-Q and in conjunction with our 2023 Form 10-K. OVERVIEW We are an energy infrastructure company with a pure-play focus on midstream natural gas compression. We are a premier provider of natural gas compression services, in terms of total compression fleet horsepower, to customers in the energy industry throughout the U.S., and a leading supplier of aftermarket services to customers that own compression equipment in the U.S. We operate in two business segments: contract operations and aftermarket services. Our contract operations services primarily include designing, sourcing, owning, installing, operating, servicing, repairing and maintaining our owned fleet of natural gas compression equipment to provide natural gas compression services to our customers. In our aftermarket services business, we sell parts and components and provide operations, maintenance, overhaul and reconfiguration services to customers who own compression equipment. Recent Business Developments TOPS Acquisition On August 30, 2024, we completed the TOPS Acquisition whereby we acquired all of the issued and outstanding equity interests in TOPS, including a fleet of approximately 580,000 horsepower for aggregate consideration consisting of 869.1 million in cash and 6,873,650 shares of common stock with an acquisition date fair value of 139.1 million. The cash portion of the purchase price was funded with proceeds from the July 2024 Equity Offering, the 2032 Notes offering and borrowings under the Credit Facility. See Note 3 Business Transactions for further details. 2032 Notes On August 26, 2024, we completed a private offering of 700.0 million aggregate principal amount of 6.625 senior notes due September 2032 and received net proceeds of 690.3 million after deducting issuance costs. The 9.7 million of issuance costs were recorded as deferred financing costs within long-term debt in our condensed consolidated balance sheets and are being amortized to interest expense in our condensed consolidated statement of operations over the term of the notes. A portion of the net proceeds was used to fund a portion of the cash consideration for the TOPS Acquisition, the 2027 Notes Tender Offer and to repay borrowings outstanding under our Credit Facility. See Note 7 Long-Term Debt for further details. 2027 Notes Tender Offer In connection with the TOPS Acquisition and offering of the 2032 Notes, we completed a concurrent cash tender offer of 202.0 million, which reflects approximately 101 of the aggregate principal amount of the tendered 2027 Notes and 0.2 million of agent and legal fees. On the date of tender, the net carrying value of the tendered 2027 Notes was 198.8 million and we recorded a debt extinguishment loss of 3.2 million in our condensed consolidated statements of operations. See Note 7 Long-Term Debt for further details. July 2024 Equity Offering On July 24, 2024, Archrock sold, pursuant to a public underwriting offering, 12,650,000 shares, including 1,650,000 shares pursuant to an over-allotment option. Archrock received net proceeds of 255.7 million, after deducting underwriting discounts, commissions and offering expenses. Proceeds from this equity offering were used to fund a portion of the TOPS Acquisition.

 Non-GAAP Financial Measures Management uses a variety of financial and operating metrics to analyze our performance. These metrics are significant factors in assessing our operating results and profitability and include the non-GAAP financial measure of adjusted gross margin. We define adjusted gross margin as total revenue less cost of sales, exclusive of depreciation and amortization. Adjusted gross margin is included as a supplemental disclosure because it is a primary measure used by our management to evaluate the results of revenue and cost of sales, exclusive of depreciation and amortization, which are key components of our operations. We believe adjusted gross margin is important because it focuses on the current operating performance of our operations and excludes the impact of the prior historical costs of the assets acquired or constructed that are utilized in those operations, the indirect costs associated with our SG A activities, our financing methods and income taxes. In addition, depreciation and amortization may not accurately reflect the costs required to maintain and replenish the operational usage of our assets and therefore may not portray the costs of current operating activity. As an indicator of our operating performance, adjusted gross margin should not be considered an alternative to, or more meaningful than, gross margin, net income (loss) or any other measure presented in accordance with GAAP. Our adjusted gross margin may not be comparable to a similarly titled measure of other entities because other entities may not calculate adjusted gross margin in the same manner. Adjusted gross margin has certain material limitations associated with its use as compared to net income. These limitations are primarily due to the exclusion of SG A, depreciation and amortization, long-lived and other asset impairments, restructuring charges, debt extinguishment loss, interest expense, transaction-related costs, gain on sale of assets, net, other expense (income), net and provision for income taxes. Because we intend to finance a portion of our operations through borrowings, interest expense is a necessary element of our costs and our ability to generate revenue. Additionally, because we use capital assets, depreciation expense is a necessary element of our costs and our ability to generate revenue and SG A is necessary to support our operations and required corporate activities. To compensate for these limitations, management uses this non-GAAP measure as a supplemental measure to other GAAP results to provide a more complete understanding of our performance.

The increase in revenue was primarily due to increased revenue from our contract operations business during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024. See Contract Operations and Aftermarket Services below for further details. Net income was 37.5 million and 30.9 million during the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The increase was primarily driven by higher adjusted gross margin from both our contract operations business and aftermarket services business. These changes were partially offset by increases in transaction-related costs, depreciation and amortization, SG A, provision for income taxes, debt extinguishment loss and interest expense, and a decrease in gain on sale of assets, net. Net income was 112.5 million and 72.0 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The increase was primarily driven by higher adjusted gross margin from both our contract operations business and aftermarket services business. These changes were partially offset by increases in provision for income taxes, SG A, depreciation and amortization, transaction-related costs, debt extinguishment loss, interest expense, long-lived and other asset impairment, and decreases in the gain on sale of assets, net and the unrealized change in the fair value of our investment in an unconsolidated affiliate.

The increase in SG A primarily included a 3.6 million increase in employee incentive and other compensation expense, a 0.5 million increase in amortization of capitalized implementation costs and a 0.5 million increase in legal and other professional fees. Depreciation and amortization. The increase in depreciation and amortization was primarily due to fixed assets additions, including 3.7 million depreciation and amortization associated with the compression units and intangible assets acquired in the TOPS Acquisition. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in depreciation associated with assets reaching the end of their depreciable lives, the impact of compression and other asset sales, and long-lived and other asset impairments. Long-lived and other asset impairment . We periodically review the future deployment of our idle compressors for units that are not of the type, configuration, condition, make or model that are cost efficient to maintain and operate. We also evaluate for impairment our idle units that have been culled from our compression fleet in prior years and are available for sale. During the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, we recognized 2.5 million and 2.9 million, respectively, of impairment charges to write down these compressors to their fair value. See Note 11 Long-Lived Asset and Other Impairments for further details .

Restructuring charges of 0.6 million during the three months ended September 30, 2023 consisted of severance and consulting costs related to our restructuring activities. See Note 12 Restructuring Charges for further details Debt extinguishment loss. We incurred 3.2 million of debt extinguishment loss during the three months ended September 30, 2024 as a result of the 2027 Notes Tender Offer. Interest expense. The increase in interest expense was primarily related to a higher average outstanding balance of long-term debt due to the 2032 Notes offering, an increase in the outstanding balance on the Credit Facility and higher interest rates, partially offset by the 2027 Notes Tender Offer. Transaction-related costs. We incurred 9.2 million of financial advisory, legal and other professional fees and retention and other employee compensation costs during the three months ended September 30, 2024 related to the TOPS Acquisition.

During the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, we recognized 9.5 million and 8.4 million, respectively, of impairment charges to write down these compressors to their fair value. See Note 11 Long-Lived Asset and Other Impairments for further details. The following table presents the results of our compression fleet impairment review, as recorded in our contract operations segment: 

Nine Months Ended September 30, (dollars in thousands) 2024 2023 Idle compressors retired from the active fleet 80 75 Horsepower of idle compressors retired from the active fleet 58,000 39,000 Impairment recorded on idle compressors retired from the active fleet 9,478 8,383 Restructuring charges. Restructuring charges of 1.6 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2023 consisted of severance and consulting costs related to our restructuring activities. See Note 12 Restructuring Charges for further details. Debt extinguishment loss. We incurred 3.2 million of debt extinguishment loss during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as a result of the 2027 Notes Tender Offer. Interest expense. The increase in interest expense was primarily related to a higher average outstanding balance of long-term debt due to the 2032 Notes offering, an increase in the outstanding balance on the Credit Facility and higher interest rates. These increases were partially offset by the 2027 Notes Tender Offer and the write-off of 1.0 million of unamortized deferred financing costs as a result of the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement during the nine months ended September 30, 2023.

 Transaction-related costs. We incurred 11.0 million of financial advisory, legal and other professional fees and retention and other employee compensation costs during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 related to the TOPS Acquisition. Gain on sale of assets, net . The decrease in gain on sale of assets, net was primarily due to gains of 5.1 million on compression asset sales during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to gains of 7.3 million on compression asset sales during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Other expense (income), net. The change from other expense, net to other income, net was primarily due to a 2.0 million unrealized change in the fair value of our investment in an unconsolidated affiliate recognized during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Provision for Income Taxes The increase in provision for income taxes was primarily due to the tax effect of the increase in book income and the limitation on executive compensation offset by the benefit from equity-settled long - term incentive compensation and reduction in valuation allowance during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared with the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 

Nine Months Ended September 30, Increase (dollars in thousands) 2024 2023 (Decrease) Provision for income taxes 41,545 27,543 51 Effective tax rate 27 28 (1) LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Overview Our ability to fund operations, finance capital expenditures and pay dividends depends on the levels of our operating cash flows and access to the capital and credit markets. Our primary sources of liquidity are cash flows generated from our operations and our borrowing availability under our Credit Facility. Our cash flow is affected by numerous factors, including prices and demand for our services, oil and natural gas exploration and production spending, conditions in the financial markets and other factors. We have no near-term maturities and believe that our operating cash flows and borrowings under the Credit Facility will be sufficient to meet our future liquidity needs. We may from time to time seek to retire or purchase our outstanding debt through cash purchases and/or exchanges for equity or debt securities in open market purchases, privately negotiated transactions or otherwise. Such repurchases or exchanges, if any, may be material, will be upon terms and prices as we may determine and will depend on prevailing market conditions, our liquidity requirements, contractual restrictions and other factors.

 Cash Requirements Our contract operations business is capital intensive, requiring significant investment to maintain and upgrade existing operations. Our capital spending is primarily dependent on the demand for our contract operations services and the availability of the type of compression equipment required for us to provide those contract operations services to our customers. Our capital requirements have consisted primarily of, and we anticipate will continue to consist of, the following: operating expenses, namely employee compensation and benefits, inventory and lube oil purchases; growth capital expenditures; maintenance capital expenditures; interest on our outstanding debt obligations; dividend payments to our stockholders; and shares repurchased under the Share Repurchase Program and to cover taxes required to be withheld on the vesting date of long-term incentive grants to employees. Capital Expenditures Growth Capital Expenditures . The majority of our growth capital expenditures are related to the acquisition cost of new compressors when our idle equipment cannot be reconfigured to economically fulfill a project s requirements and the new compressor is expected to generate economic returns that exceed our cost of capital over the compressor s expected useful life. In addition to newly-acquired compressors, growth capital expenditures include the upgrading of major components on an existing compression package where the current configuration of the compression package is no longer in demand and the compressor is not likely to return to an operating status without the capital expenditures. These expenditures substantially modify the operating parameters of the compression package such that it can be used in applications for which it previously was not suited. Maintenance Capital Expenditures . Maintenance capital expenditures are related to major overhauls of significant components of a compression package, such as the engine, electric motor, compressor and cooler, which return the components to a like-new condition, but do not modify the application for which the compression package was designed. Projected Capital Expenditures . We expect approximately 260 million in growth capital expenditures in 2024, including 190 million for our pre-acquisition business. The 70 million increase is exclusively related to the addition of the TOPS backlog and the remaining payments to packagers at delivery. This backlog is substantially committed to customers. Dividends On October 24, 2024, our Board of Directors declared a quarterly dividend of 0.175 per share of common stock to be paid on November 13, 2024 to stockholders of record at the close of business on November 6, 2024. Any future determinations to pay cash dividends to our stockholders will be at the discretion of our Board of Directors and will be dependent upon our financial condition, results of operations and credit and loan agreements in effect at that time and other factors deemed relevant by our Board of Directors. Sources of Cash Credit Facility During the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, our Credit Facility had an average debt balance of 268.7 million and 294.5 million, respectively. The weighted - average annual interest rate on the outstanding balance under the Credit Facility was 7.2 and 7.7 at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. As of September 30, 2024, there were 4.1 million letters of credit outstanding under the Credit Facility and the applicable margin on borrowings outstanding was 2.1 . As of September 30, 2024, we were in compliance with all covenants under our Credit Facility. Additionally, all undrawn capacity on our Credit Facility was available for borrowings as of September 30, 2024.

 2032 Notes and 2027 Notes Tender Offer On August 26, 2024, we completed a private offering of 700.0 million aggregate principal amount of 6.625 senior notes due September 2032 and received net proceeds of 690.3 million after deducting issuance costs. In connection with the offering of the 2032 Notes, we completed a concurrent cash tender offer of 202.0 million. See Note 7 Long-Term Debt for further details. July 2024 Equity Offering On July 24, 2024, Archrock sold, pursuant to a public underwriting offering, 12,650,000 shares, including 1,650,000 shares pursuant to an over-allotment option. Archrock received net proceeds of 255.7 million, after deducting underwriting discounts, commissions and offering expenses. See Note 9 Stockholders Equity for further details. Cash Flows Our cash flows, as reflected in our unaudited condensed consolidated statements of cash flows, are summarized below: 

Nine Months Ended September 30, (in thousands) 2024 2023 Net cash provided by (used in): Operating activities 305,253 238,468 Investing activities (1,104,670) (208,157) Financing activities 801,828 (31,395) Net increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents 2,411 (1,084) Operating Activities The increase in net cash provided by operating activities was primarily due to increased cash inflows of 99.0 million from adjusted gross margin, excluding deferred revenue recognized in earnings and amortization of freight and mobilization charges, changes of 5.1 million in inventory as a result of improvement in the lead time for parts and of 2.4 million in accounts receivable due to increased cash receipts from customers. These increases were partially offset by changes of 17.9 million in accounts payable and accrued liabilities due in part to accrued interest paid in connection with the 2027 Notes Tender Offer. Investing Activities The increase in net cash used in investing activities was primarily due to 869.1 million of cash paid in the TOPS Acquisition and a 30.5 million decrease in proceeds from the sale of property, plant and equipment. Financing Activities The change from net cash used in financing activities to net cash provided by financing activities was primarily due to 700.0 million of proceeds from the issuance of the 2032 Notes, 255.7 million of proceeds from the July 2024 Equity Offering and a 103.5 million increase in net borrowings of long-term debt, partially offset by 202.0 million for the 2027 Notes Tender Offer. ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK We are exposed to market risks associated with changes in the variable interest rate of our Credit Facility. A 1 increase in the effective interest rate on our Credit Facility s outstanding balance at September 30, 2024 would have resulted in an annual increase in our interest expense of 4.5 million.

 ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES This Item 4 includes information concerning the controls and controls evaluation referred to in the certifications of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer required by Rule 13a-14 of the Exchange Act included in this Form 10-Q as Exhibits 31.1 and 31.2. Management s Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures Disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in SEC rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that such information is accumulated and communicated to management to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures. As of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) of the Exchange Act), which are designed to provide reasonable assurance that we are able to record, process, summarize and report the information required to be disclosed in our reports under the Exchange Act within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the SEC. Based on the evaluation, as of September 30, 2024, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective to provide reasonable assurance that the information required to be disclosed in reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to management, and made known to our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, on a timely basis to ensure that it is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms. Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f)) during the last fiscal quarter that materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

 PART II. OTHER INFORMATION ITEM 1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS In the ordinary course of business, we are involved in various pending or threatened legal actions. While we are unable to predict the ultimate outcome of these actions, we believe that any ultimate liability arising from any of these actions will not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows, including our ability to pay dividends. However, because of the inherent uncertainty of litigation and arbitration proceedings, we cannot provide assurance that the resolution of any particular claim or proceeding to which we are a party will not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows, including our ability to pay dividends.

 ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS Other than the following items, there have been no material changes or updates to the risk factors previously disclosed in our 2023 Form 10-K. Risks Related to the TOPS Acquisition We may not be able to achieve the expected benefits of the TOPS Acquisition. We may also encounter significant difficulties in integrating TOPS. We may not be able to achieve the expected benefits of the TOPS Acquisition and there can be no assurance that the TOPS Acquisition will be beneficial to us. We may not be able to integrate the assets acquired in the TOPS Acquisition without increases in costs or other difficulties. The integration of a business is a complex, costly and time-consuming process. As a result, we will be required to devote significant management attention and resources to integrating our business practices and operations with the business practices and operations of TOPS. The integration process may disrupt our business and, if implemented ineffectively, would restrict the full realization of the anticipated benefits from the TOPS Acquisition. The failure to meet the challenges involved in integrating TOPS and to realize the anticipated benefits of the TOPS Acquisition could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects, as well as the market price of our common stock. The challenges of integrating the operations of acquired businesses include, among others: difficulties with the integration of the business of TOPS and workforce following the TOPS Acquisition; conditions in the oil and natural gas industry, including the level of production of, demand for or price of oil or natural gas; our reduced profit margins or the loss of market share resulting from competition or the introduction of competing technologies by other companies; changes in economic or political conditions, including terrorism and legislative changes; the inherent risks associated with our operations, such as equipment defects, impairments, malfunctions and natural disasters; the risk that counterparties will not perform their obligations under our financial instruments; the financial condition of our customers; our ability to timely and cost-effectively obtain components necessary to conduct our business; employment and workforce factors, including our ability to hire, train and retain key employees; our ability to implement certain business and financial objectives, such as: winning profitable new business; growing our asset base and enhancing asset utilization; integrating acquired businesses; generating sufficient cash; and accessing the capital markets at an acceptable cost; liability related to the use of our services; changes in governmental safety, health, environmental or other regulations, which could require us to make significant expenditures; the effectiveness of our control environment, including the identification of control deficiencies; and our level of indebtedness and ability to fund our business . 
 Many of these factors are outside of our control, and any one of them could result in increased costs and liabilities, decreases in the amount of expected revenue and earnings, and diversion of management s time and energy, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Further, additional unanticipated costs may be incurred in the integration of the acquired business. The market price of our common stock may decline as a result of the TOPS Acquisition if, among other things, the integration of the properties to be acquired in the TOPS Acquisition is unsuccessful or transaction costs related to the TOPS Acquisition are greater than expected. The market price of our common stock may decline if we do not achieve the perceived benefits of the TOPS Acquisition as rapidly or to the extent anticipated by us or by securities market participants or if the effect of TOPS Acquisition on our business, results of operations or financial condition or prospects is not consistent with our expectations or those of securities market participants.

 Any acquisitions we complete, including the TOPS Acquisition, are subject to substantial risks that could reduce our ability to make distributions to our common stockholders. Even if we do make acquisitions that we believe will increase the amount of cash available for distribution to our common stockholders, these acquisitions, including the TOPS Acquisition, may nevertheless result in a decrease in the amount of cash available for distribution to our common stockholders. Any acquisition, including the TOPS Acquisition, involves potential risks, including, among other things: the assumption of unknown liabilities, losses or costs for which we are not indemnified or for which any indemnity we receive is inadequate; our inability to obtain satisfactory title to the assets we acquire; and the occurrence of other significant changes, such as impairment of long-lived assets, asset devaluation or restructuring charges. ITEM 2. UNREGISTERED SALES OF EQUITY SECURITIES BY ISSUER AND USE OF PROCEEDS Sales of Unregistered Securities None. Purchase of Equity Securities by the Issuer and Affiliated Purchasers The following table summarizes our share repurchase activity for the three months ended September 30, 2024:
