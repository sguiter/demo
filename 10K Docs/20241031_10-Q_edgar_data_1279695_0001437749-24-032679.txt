Interest Income 

Interest income is recognized as it accrues, taking into account the effective yield and consists of interest earned on cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash in interest-bearing accounts. 

Research and Development Tax Incentive Income 

Research and development tax incentive income is recognized when there is reasonable assurance that the income will be received, the relevant expenditure has been incurred and the consideration can be reliably measured. 

The research and development tax incentive is one of the key elements of the Australian Government s support for Australia s innovation system and is supported by legislative law primarily in the form of the Australian Income Tax Assessment Act 1997 as long as eligibility criteria are met. Subject to meeting a number of conditions, an entity involved in eligible research and development R D activities may claim research and development tax incentive income as follows: 

(1) 

as a refundable tax offset if aggregate turnover (which generally means an entity s total income that it derives in the ordinary course of carrying on a business, subject to certain exclusions) of the entity is less than A , or 

(2) 

as a non-refundable tax offset if aggregate turnover of the entity is more than A . 

In accordance with SEC Regulation S-X Article 5-03, the Company s research and development tax incentive income has been recognized as non-operating income as it is not indicative of the core operating activities or revenue producing goals of the Company. Management has assessed the Company s R D activities and expenditures to determine which activities and expenditures are likely to be eligible under the tax incentive regime described above. At each period end management estimates the refundable tax offset available to the Company based on available information at the time. This estimate is also reviewed by external tax advisors on an annual basis. 

The Company has recorded research and development tax incentive income of A and A for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively. In the nine months ended September 30, 2024 there is reasonable assurance that the aggregate turnover of the Company for the year ended December 31, 2024 will not exceed A 20,000,000. 

to for the period commencing July 1, 2023 and increased to on July 1, 2024. Superannuation is an Australian compulsory savings program plan for retirement whereby employers are required to pay a portion of an employee s remuneration to an approved superannuation fund that the employee is typically not able to access until they have reached the statutory retirement age. Whilst the Company has a third-party default superannuation fund, it permits UBS employees to choose an approved and registered superannuation fund into which the contributions are paid. Contributions are charged to the consolidated condensed statements of comprehensive income/(loss) as the expense is incurred.

Amortization expense for the 2024 financial year represents the Company s software. Increase in amortization expense is as a result of certain software costs which were still in development during the 2023 financial year and were not amortized have since been completed and subject to amortization during 2024.

Our research and development R D expenditure declined by 24 during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same period in the previous financial year. R D expenditure increased by 29 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same period in the previous financial year. The primary focus of the R D activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 were: 

activities undertaken to support Xprecia Prime s submission to the FDA. FDA 510(k) and CLIA Waiver approval for the Xprecia Prime device was received in March 2024 

further enhancement of certain Sentia tests that has already been launched 

developing a device to detect heavy metals and other impurities in water Aqua Sense project) 

developing the Company s Oncology platform biosensors used for the detection, staging and monitoring of cancer 

developing the Company s Aptamer based sensing platform 

Research is focused on demonstrating technical feasibility of new technology applications and generally does not incur a large amount of expenses. Development activity is focused on turning these technology platforms into commercial-ready products and represents the majority of the Company s research and development expenses. For the nine months ended September 30, 2023, we had a number of projects in the development phase which included Xprecia Prime (FDA submission made in March 2023), Petrackr (launched in May 2023) and certain Sentia tests (we finalized the development of and launched the Sentia Fructose and Acetic Acid tests in Q1 2023 and the Titratable Acidity test was launched in April 2023) hence the higher R D expenses in 2023 compared to 2024 wherein most of the projects are in the research phase. Increase in R D expenses in the current quarter compared to Q3 2023 as more resources invested in the current quarter; (a) for our Aqua Sense project as we target to launch in 2025 and; (b) to further improve our Sentia products already in the market. 

The timing and cost of any development program is dependent upon a number of factors including achieving technical objectives, which are inherently uncertain and subsequent regulatory approvals. We have project plans in place for all our development programs which we use to plan, manage and assess our projects. As part of this procedure, we also undertake commercial assessments of such projects to optimize outcomes and decision making. 

R D expenses consist of costs associated with research activities, as well as costs associated with our product development efforts, including pilot manufacturing costs. R D expenses include: 

consultant and employee related expenses, which include consulting fees, salaries and benefits; 

materials and consumables acquired for the research and development activities; 

verification and validation work on the various R D projects including clinical trials; 

external research and development expenses incurred under agreements with third party organizations and universities; and 

facilities, depreciation and other allocated expenses, which include direct and allocated expenses for rent and maintenance of facilities, depreciation of leasehold improvements and equipment and laboratory and other supplies.

Other selling, general and administrative expenses include sales and marketing costs to support our products in the market, shipping and handling costs incurred when fulfilling customer orders, repairs and maintenance, insurance, facility costs not otherwise included in R D expenses, consultancy fees and professional fees including legal services and maintenance fees incurred for patent applications, audit and taxation services. 

Selling, general and administrative expenses remained flat for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same period in the previous financial year. Selling, general and administrative expenses decreased by 12 during the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same period in the previous financial year as the Company is managing its non-core expenditure. 

Interest Income 

Interest income decreased by 28 and 42 during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same period in the previous financial year. The decrease in interest income is attributable to the overall lower amount of funds available for investment throughout 2024. 

19

Interest Expense 

Interest expense relates to interest being charged on the secured short-term borrowing initiated by the Company for the 2024 financial year and the interest expense on finance lease liabilities. 

Financing Costs 

Disclosed in this account is accretion expense which is associated with the Company s asset retirement obligations ARO ). Decrease in financing costs is as a result of change of estimate for the ARO liability. 

Research and Development Tax Incentive Income 

As at September 30, 2024 there is reasonable likelihood that the aggregate turnover of the Company for the year ending December 31, 2024 will be less than A 20,000,000 and accordingly an estimated A 1,146,593 has been recorded as research and development tax incentive income for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. Included in this is an understatement of research and development tax incentive income of 16,418 for the year ended December 31, 2023. The decrease period on period is driven by the decrease in eligible research and development expenditure incurred in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the same period in 2023. 

Research and development tax incentive receivable for the 2023 financial year was received in June 2024. 

Exchange Gain/(Loss) 

Foreign exchange gains and losses arise from the settlement of foreign currency transactions that are translated into the functional currency using the exchange rates prevailing at the dates of the transactions and from the translation at period end exchange rates of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies.

Critical Accounting Estimates and Judgments 

The preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles and the Company s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and operating results require the Company s management to make judgments, assumptions and estimates that affect the amounts reported. Significant items subject to such estimates and assumptions include provision for expected credit losses research and development tax incentive income, stock-based compensation expenses and asset retirement obligations: 

Provision for Expected Credit Losses 

The Company evaluates the collectability of accounts receivable and records a provision for expected credit losses based on factors including the length of time the receivables are past due, the current business environment and the Company s historical experience. 

Research and Development Tax Incentive Income 

The refundable tax offset is one of the key elements of the Australian Government s support for Australia s innovation system and, if eligible, provides the recipient with cash based upon its eligible research and development activities and expenditures. The calculation of the refundable tax offset requires judgement as to what is eligible research and development activity and expenditure and the outcome will change if different assumptions were used. 

20

Stock-based Compensation Expenses 

Probability of attaining vesting conditions and the fair value of the stock-based compensation is highly subjective and requires judgement, and results could change materially if different estimates and assumptions were used. The probability assumptions are critically examined by management each reporting period and reviewed by the board of directors for reasonableness. 

Asset Retirement Obligations 

ARO are legal obligations associated with the retirement and removal of long-lived assets. ARO reflects estimates of future costs directly attributable to remediating the liability, inflation, assumptions of risks associated with the future cash outflows, and the applicable risk-free interest rates for discounting future cash outflows. Changes in these factors can result in a change to the ARO recognized by the Company. 

Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in Item 1 of this Form 10-Q and Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, of the Notes to Consolidated Condensed Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of the 2023 Form 10-K describes in further detail the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of the Company s consolidated condensed financial statements. Management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities and the recognition of revenue and expenses. Actual results may differ from these estimates.

Net cash

9,329,347 

Since inception, we have financed our business primarily through the issuance of equity securities, funding from strategic partners, government grants and rebates (including the research and development tax incentive income), cash flows generated from operations and a loan. 

The Group has experienced net cash outflows over recent periods, predominantly in conducting research development activities, product approval and registrations, launch of our products and support of the same in the marketplace. We continue to reduce research development expenditure and other operating expenditure in the foreseeable future and focus on increasing our commercialization efforts. We are closely monitoring the success of our commercialization efforts in relation to the newly launched product portfolio and their impact on our cash position. Given the natural uncertainty that arises with the launch of new products, if we were to experience delays or encounter issues in these commercialization efforts, we would need and expect to adjust our operating expenditure accordingly, to ensure sufficient cash remains available to fund our operations for at least the next twelve months from the date of issuance. We do not have any external debt obligations and are not subject to any covenant obligations. 

We believe we have sufficient cash and cash equivalents to fund our operations for at least the next twelve months from the date of issuance. Liquidity risk is the risk that the Company may encounter difficulty meeting obligations associated with financial liabilities. The Company manages liquidity risk through the management of its capital structure. The purpose of liquidity management is to ensure that there is sufficient cash to meet all the financial commitments and obligations of the Company as they come due. In managing the Company s capital, management estimates future cash requirements by preparing a budget and a multi-year plan for review and approval by the Board of Directors the Board ). The budget is reviewed and updated periodically and establishes the approved activities for the next twelve months and estimates the costs associated with those activities. The multi-year plan estimates future activity along with the potential cash requirements and is based upon management s assessment of current progress along with the expected results from the coming years activity. Budget to actual variances is prepared and reviewed by management and are presented on a regular basis to the Board. 

21

The carrying value of the cash and cash equivalents and the accounts receivables approximates fair value because of their short-term nature. 

We regularly review all our financial assets for impairment. A financial asset is a non-physical asset whose value is derived from a contractual claim and in our case includes cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivables, fixed assets and equity shares. With the exception of a provision for expected credit losses on our accounts receivables balances as at September 30, 2024, there were no impairments recognized as at September 30, 2024 or for the year ended December 31, 2023.

The movement in cash and cash equivalents and working capital (calculated as current assets less current liabilities) during the above periods was primarily the result of ongoing investment in our R D activities and the general operations of the Company. The Company also raised A 2.50 million via an institutional placement at an issue price of A 0.15 per New CDI in March 2024 and A 10.00 million pursuant to a fully underwritten entitlement offer in May 2024, at an issue price of 0.15 per New CDI. There were certain options exercised in March 2024 which raised A 0.47 million. The Company also received A 3.79 million of the research and development tax incentive receivable for the 2023 financial year in June 2024. 

In relation to receivables, the Company performs ongoing credit evaluations of our customers. A provision for expected credit losses of A 141,222 has been determined principally on the basis of past collection experience as well as consideration of current economic conditions and changes in our customer collection trends.

Our net cash used in operating activities for all periods represents receipts offset by payments for our R D projects including efforts involved in establishing and maintaining our manufacturing operations and selling, general and administrative expenditure. Cash outflows from operating activities primarily represent the ongoing investment in our efforts to promote brand awareness of our products, R D activities and the general operations of the Company. As our products capture increased market share, we expect our inflows from the receipt from our customers to eventually exceed the cash outflows from operating activities. 

Our net cash used in investing activities for all periods is primarily for the purchase of various equipment and for the various continuous improvement programs we are undertaking. 

Our net cash increase in financing activities for the period ended September 30, 2024 is primarily the result of A 2.50 million raised via an institutional placement in March 2024 and A 10.00 million raised pursuant to a fully underwritten entitlement offer in May 2024. There were certain options exercised in March 2024 which raised A 0.47 million. The balance primarily represents proceeds received in the form of a short-term loan to finance our insurance program and repayment of the same. 

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangement 

As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we did not have any off-balance sheet arrangements, as such term is defined under Item 303 of Regulation S-K, that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that is material to investors.
