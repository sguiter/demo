Whether the exchanging PWP OpCo Unitholder receives cash or Class A common stock in exchange for their PWP OpCo Units and Class B common stock is at the Company s option. Working partners are restricted in their ability to exchange PWP OpCo Units for a period between three to after the Closing.

General PSUs were granted during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. As of September 30, 2024, the price target was met for the General PSUs. 
 Legacy Awards and Professional Partners Awards 
 Prior to the Business Combination, Professional Partners granted certain equity-based awards to partners providing services to PWP OpCo (the Legacy Awards ). In connection with the Business Combination and a related internal reorganization of Professional Partners, existing Legacy Awards were canceled and replaced by converting each limited partner s capital interests in Professional Partners attributable to PWP OpCo into OCUs, VCUs, and/or ACUs. The OCUs were fully vested upon recapitalization. The VCUs and ACUs (collectively, Professional Partners Awards were held by current working partners and required services to be performed on behalf of PWP OpCo. The Professional Partners Awards were generally subject to a service-based graded vesting schedule over a three to requisite service period. Once vested, the Professional Partners Awards became OCUs, other than the cash-settled ACUs referenced below, and are eligible for the same exchange rights as other PWP OpCo Units, subject to certain lock-up periods. Refer to Note 9 Stockholders Equity and Redeemable Non-Controlling Interests for more information on exchange rights. 
 At the time of the Merger, the Company entered into vesting acceleration agreements with certain holders of Professional Partners Awards (the Accelerated Units to accelerate vesting during the second quarter of 2024 (the Vesting Acceleration ). The Accelerated Units are generally subject to a lock-up period that is identical to the lockup period applicable to such units prior to the Vesting Acceleration. The Company also provided each holder of Accelerated Units that are ACUs the ability to convert a portion of such holder s ACUs into cash upon vesting in an aggregate amount up to such holder s estimated tax liability. The principal purpose of the Vesting Acceleration was to facilitate the payment of taxes associated with ACU vesting to align with the treatment of vested restricted stock units of the Company. 
 As a result of the Merger and Vesting Acceleration, certain Professional Partners Awards were modified from equity-classified to liability-classified awards with changes in fair value generally recorded as incremental equity-based compensation expense through the date of vesting. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company recorded million of equity-based compensation expense related to the acceleration of the Professional Partners Awards. Of that amount, million was related to liability-classified awards. 
 In connection with the Vesting Acceleration, the Company paid or accrued a combined million in settlement of ACUs and corresponding shares of Class B common stock. Of that amount, the Company paid million in settlement of liability-classified ACUs and million for withholding tax payments on equity-classified ACUs and the settlement of other liabilities. These amounts are included within cash flows from operating activities and financing activities, respectively, on the Condensed Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. As of September 30, 2024, million of withholding taxes payable is included in Accounts payable, accrued expenses and other liabilities on the Condensed Consolidated Statement of Financial Condition. 
 Prior to the Merger, all of the compensation expense and corresponding capital contribution associated with the Legacy Awards and Professional Partners Awards were allocated to Non-controlling interests on the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations and Condensed Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition as the granting of the Professional Partners Awards did not change Professional Partners interest in PWP OpCo and did not economically dilute Perella Weinberg Partners shareholders relative to Professional Partners. As a result of the Merger, the Professional Partners Awards are held directly at PWP OpCo and PWP OpCo as a whole bears the cost of the cash settlement feature of the awards. As a result, subsequent to the Merger, the Company allocates the costs associated with the Professional Partners Awards between Perella Weinberg Partners and non-controlling interests in proportion to their ownership interests, which is consistent with the allocation of the other profit and loss activity of PWP OpCo.

 Legal Contingencies 
 From time to time, the Company is named as a defendant in legal actions relating to transactions conducted in the ordinary course of business. Some of these matters may involve claims of substantial amounts. Although there can be no assurance of the outcome of such legal actions, in the opinion of management and, after consultation with external counsel, the Company believes it is neither probable nor reasonably possible that any current legal proceedings or claims would individually or in the aggregate have a material adverse effect on the consolidated financial statements of the Company as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 and for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. 
 In 2015, the Company filed a complaint against former partners and former employee which alleges they entered into a scheme while at PWP to lift out the Company s restructuring group to form a new competing firm that they were secretly forming in breach of their contractual and fiduciary duties. The complaint contains causes of action and seeks declaratory relief as well as damages. Trial is currently scheduled for January 24, 2025 through February 14, 2025. 
 The Company incurred million and million during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, and amounts during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 in legal and professional fees, net of expected insurance reimbursement, related to this litigation.

Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 
 The following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this Form 10-Q. This discussion contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results could differ materially from the forward-looking statements below. Factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include, but are not limited to, those identified below and those discussed in the section entitled Risk Factors and elsewhere in this Form 10-Q. 
 
 Executive Overview 
 We are a leading global independent advisory firm that provides strategic and financial advice to clients across some of the most active industry sectors and international markets. Our wide range of global clients include large public multinational corporations, mid-sized public and private companies, individual entrepreneurs, private and institutional investors, creditor committees and government institutions. 
 For further information regarding our business, refer to Part I. Item 1. Business and Part I. Item1A. Risk Factors in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 as filed with the SEC on February 23, 2024. 
 
 Business Environment 
 Economic and global financial market conditions impact our financial performance. The market environment for advisory services is improving, driving increased dialogue and activity levels across the traditional M A markets. 
 Our core advisory services benefit from macroeconomic changes that impact our client base and lead them to consider business combinations, acquisitions and divestitures, capital raises and restructurings. We continue to invest in our platform to achieve scale, accelerate growth, and deliver value. 
 See Risk Factors included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for a discussion of some of the factors that can affect our performance. 
 
 Key Financial Measures 
 Revenues 
 We operate in a highly competitive environment, and each revenue-generating engagement is separately solicited and negotiated. Our fee-paying client engagements are not predictable, and we may experience fluctuations in revenues from quarter to quarter. To develop new business, we maintain an active business dialogue with existing and potential clients, and we expect to add new clients each year through expanding our relationships, hiring senior advisory professionals, and receiving introductions from our relationship network. However, we also lose clients each year due to various factors, such as sales or mergers, changes in clients senior management, and competition from other financial services firms. 
 Our revenue recognition is often tied to the completion of a transaction, which can be delayed or terminated due to various reasons, including failure to obtain regulatory or board approval, failure to secure financing, or adverse market conditions. Larger transactions may take longer to close, adding unpredictability to the timing of revenues. Despite our efforts, we may receive lower advisory fees or no fee at all if a transaction is not completed. Other barriers to the completion of restructuring transactions include a lack of anticipated bidders, failure to obtain court approval, or a failure to reach an agreement with creditors. In such cases, our advisory fees may be limited to monthly retainer fees plus the reimbursement of expenses. 
 We do not present our revenue by the type of advice we provide because of the complexity of the transactions on which we may earn revenue and our holistic approach to client service. For instance, a traditional M A engagement may require additional advisory services, such as capital markets or capital solutions advice or a private capital raise, which may call for cross-functional expertise from our professionals. We focus on dedicating the necessary resources and expertise to each engagement, regardless of product lines, to achieve the desired outcome for our clients. Consequently, tracking the type of advisory service offered in each instance is not practical. 
 27 

Operating Expenses 
 Our operating expenses are classified as (i) total compensation and benefits expenses, including equity-based compensation, and (ii) non-compensation expenses. 
 Compensation and Benefits Expenses 
 Our compensation and benefits expenses consist of salaries, bonuses (discretionary awards and guaranteed amounts), severance, payroll and related taxes, benefits, and the amortization of equity-based compensation awards that are subject to a service-based vesting condition, and in some cases, a market-based performance vesting condition. These expenses also include signing bonuses and compensation paid pursuant to guarantees for new hires. 
 Compensation is determined by management based on revenues earned, headcount, labor market conditions, and anticipated compensation requirements for our employees. Such factors can fluctuate, including headcount and revenues earned, and as a result, our compensation expenses may fluctuate materially in any particular period. 
 Prior to the Merger, the amortization expense for certain equity-based awards granted by Professional Partners was allocated fully to non-controlling interests. As a result of the Merger, these awards are considered granted by PWP OpCo and PWP OpCo as a whole bears the cost of the cash settlement feature of the awards, which was added in conjunction with the Merger. As a result, subsequent to the Merger, the Company allocates the costs associated with these awards between Perella Weinberg Partners and non-controlling interests in proportion to their ownership interests, which is consistent with the allocation of the other profit and loss activity of PWP OpCo. 
 Non-Compensation Expenses 
 Our non-compensation expenses include the costs of professional fees, technology and infrastructure, rent and occupancy, travel and related expenses, depreciation and amortization and general, administrative and other expenses. Our non-compensation expenses also include certain expenses reimbursed by our clients. Overall, our non-compensation expenses are subject to variability due to multiple factors, including headcount, business needs, and inflation. 
 Non-Operating Income (Expenses) 
 Non-operating income (expenses) includes the impact of income and expense items that we consider to be non-operational in nature, which typically includes related party income, interest income and expense, and other non-operating gains (losses), including the impact of foreign exchange rate fluctuations. 
 Non-Controlling Interests 
 Non-controlling interests represent the ownership interests in PWP OpCo held by holders other than Perella Weinberg Partners, which are current and former working partners. Profits and losses of PWP OpCo are allocated to the non-controlling interests in proportion to their ownership interest regardless of their basis, with an exception for certain equity-based compensation expense which was fully attributed to non-controlling interests prior to the Merger.

 Revenues 
 The following table provides revenue statistics for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023: 
 Three Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 2024 vs. 2023

 Total Advisory Clients 97 81 16 176 159 17 Total Clients with Fees Greater than 1.0 million 43 29 14 107 90 17 
 Revenues were 278.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared with 139.0 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023, representing an increase of 100 . The increase was attributable to increased mergers and acquisition and financing and capital solutions activity, driven by larger transactions and related fee events across the business. 
 29 

Revenues were 652.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared with 436.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, representing an increase of 50 . Similar to the quarter-to-date period, revenues attributed to mergers and acquisition and financing and capital solutions activity were higher year-over-year, driven by larger transactions and related fee events across the business. 
 Compensation and Benefits Expenses 
 For the three months ended September 30, 2024, total compensation and benefits expenses were 202.3 million, an increase of 58 compared with 127.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in total compensation and benefits expenses was primarily the result of a higher bonus accrual in the current year period due to a higher revenue base. This increase was partially offset by a decrease in equity-based compensation expense driven by the Vesting Acceleration in the second quarter of 2024 which fully expensed certain awards that were still being amortized in the prior year period. 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, total compensation and benefits expenses were 628.2 million, an increase of 60 compared with 393.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in total compensation and benefits expenses was primarily the result of a higher bonus accrual due to increased revenues as well as higher year-to-date equity-based compensation expense. The Vesting Acceleration resulted in 144.2 million of equity-based compensation related to the Professional Partners Awards as compared to 46.9 million in the prior year period for those same awards. 
 Non-Compensation Expenses 
 For the three months ended September 30, 2024, total non-compensation expenses were 40.0 million, an increase of 6 compared with 37.9 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in non-compensation expenses was primarily the result of higher depreciation expense, consulting costs, bad debt expense, and certain technology costs. The increase in depreciation is driven by leasehold assets placed in service after the third quarter of 2023 related to the renovation of the New York office space. The overall increase was partially offset by lower rent costs and reduced legal spend. 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, total non-compensation expenses were 124.1 million, an increase of 10 compared with 113.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in non-compensation expenses was primarily the result of increased depreciation expense driven by renovation-related leasehold assets, legal and consulting spend, and bad debt expense. These increases were partially offset by reduced rent costs, VAT expense, and D O insurance costs. 
 Non-Operating Income (Expenses) 
 For the three months ended September 30, 2024, non-operating income was 0.5 million compared with non-operating income of 2.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. In the current period, non-operating income included interest income almost fully offset by a net loss from foreign exchange rate fluctuations. Non-operating income for the three months ended September 30, 2023 included interest income and a net gain from foreign exchange rate fluctuations, partially offset by a 1.25 million charge from a previously reported settlement reached with the staff of the SEC relating to recordkeeping of business communications on off-channel messaging applications (the Settlement ). For both periods, the impact of foreign exchange rate fluctuations was largely related to U.S. dollar-denominated cash and intercompany receivables held by our foreign subsidiaries. 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, non-operating income was 3.9 million compared with non-operating income of 2.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. In the current period, non-operating income included interest income, which increased from the prior year due to higher interest rates and larger interest-bearing cash balances, partially offset by a net loss from foreign exchange rate fluctuations. Non-operating income in the prior year period primarily included interest income, which was partially offset by a non-operating loss on investment, the 1.25 million charge recognized by the Company related to the Settlement, as well as a smaller net loss from foreign exchange rate fluctuations as compared to the current year. For both periods, the impact of foreign exchange rate fluctuations was largely related to U.S. dollar-denominated cash and intercompany receivables held by our foreign subsidiaries.

Income Tax Expense (Benefit) 
 The Company s income tax expense and effective tax rate were 7.5 million and 20.7 , respectively, for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to an income tax benefit and effective tax rate of (0.2) million and 0.8 , respectively, for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The change in the effective tax rate was primarily due to the relative size of our permanent differences in relation to the pre-tax income (loss) in the respective periods and also included the recognition of tax benefits associated with the appreciation in our share price upon vesting of RSUs above the original grant price during the three months ended September 30, 2024. 
 The Company s income tax expense and effective tax rate were 26.0 million and (27.0) , respectively, for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to an income tax expense and effective tax rate of 0.6 million and (0.8) , respectively, for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The change in the effective tax rate was primarily due to the relative size of our permanent differences in relation to the pre-tax loss in the respective periods and also included the recognition of tax benefits associated with the appreciation in our share price upon vesting of RSUs above the original grant price during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 
 
 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 General 
 We regularly monitor our liquidity position, including cash and cash equivalents, working capital assets and liabilities, commitments and other liquidity requirements. Our primary sources of liquidity are generally our cash and cash equivalent balances, investments in short-term marketable debt securities, the net cash generated from operations, and the available borrowing capacity under our Revolving Credit Facility. Our primary cash needs are for working capital, operating expenses (including cash compensation for our employees), repurchasing shares of the Company s Class A common stock, withholding tax payments for vested PWP Incentive Plan Awards, cash-settled exchanges of PWP OpCo Units, income taxes, dividends and distributions, capital expenditures, making payments pursuant to the tax receivable agreement, commitments, and strategic investments. We generally pay a significant portion of our annual cash incentive compensation during the first quarter of each calendar year with respect to the prior year s results. Therefore, levels of cash and cash equivalents and/or investments in short-term marketable debt securities generally decline during the first quarter and build over the remainder of the year. 
 Our current assets are primarily composed of cash and cash equivalents, investments in short-term marketable securities, receivables related to fees earned from providing advisory services, certain prepaid expenses and certain amounts due from related parties. Our current liabilities are primarily composed of accrued employee compensation, accounts payable and other accrued expenses. Cash and cash equivalents include cash held at banks, including interest-bearing money market accounts, and short-term highly liquid investments that have original maturities of three months or less from the date of purchase. We had cash balances of 240.1 million and 247.2 million as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively, and cash equivalents of 20.1 million as of September 30, 2024, which included investments in U.S. Treasury securities. As of December 31, 2023, we held no cash equivalents. Additionally, as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company held U.S. Treasury securities of 74.9 million and 91.2 million, respectively, which were classified as Investments in short-term marketable debt securities within the condensed consolidated financial statements. 
 Our liquidity is highly dependent upon cash receipts from clients, which generally require the successful completion of transactions. Accounts receivable typically have net terms of 30 days. Accounts receivable, net of allowance for credit losses were 87.5 million and 47.8 million as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. 
 We have a Revolving Credit Facility with Cadence Bank with an available line of credit of 50.0 million. Additionally, up to 20.0 million of incremental revolving commitments above the 50.0 million commitment amount may be incurred under the Credit Agreement. As of September 30, 2024, we had no outstanding balance related to the Revolving Credit Facility and no incremental revolving commitments were incurred. For further information on the Revolving Credit Facility, refer to Note 10 Debt in the notes to condensed consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Form 10-Q. 
 On March 1, 2024, we issued and sold 5,750,000 shares of Class A common stock at a price of 12.00 per share for net proceeds of 66.0 million after deducting underwriting discounts and offering costs. 
 During the second quarter of 2024, we paid or accrued a combined 86.6 million in settlement of ACUs in connection with the Vesting Acceleration. Refer to Note 11 Equity-Based Compensation in the notes to the condensed consolidated financial statements for further information regarding the Vesting Acceleration. Also during the second quarter of 2024, we elected to settle exchanges of certain PWP OpCo Units and corresponding shares of Class B common stock for 19.5 million in cash. 
 Based on current market conditions, we believe that our cash on hand, cash equivalents, investments in short-term marketable debt securities, net cash generated from operations, and the available borrowing capacity under our Revolving Credit Facility will be sufficient to meet our operating needs and commitments for the next twelve months; however, if these sources of liquidity are not sufficient, we may seek additional debt or equity financing.

Cash Flows 
 A summary of our operating, investing and financing cash flows is as follows: 
 Nine Months Ended September 30, (Dollars in thousands) 2024 2023 Cash Provided By (Used In) Operating Activities Net income (loss) (122,002) (69,428) Non-cash charges and other operating activity adjustments 198,265 155,335 Other operating activities 7,666 (98,389) Total operating activities 83,929 (12,482) Investing Activities 560 26,274 Financing Activities (74,367) (59,981) Effect of exchange rate changes on cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash 1,273 1,224 Net increase (decrease) in cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash 11,395 (44,965) Cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash, beginning of period 250,102 174,166 Cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash, end of period 261,497 129,201 
 Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 
 Operating activities resulted in a net cash inflow of 83.9 million primarily attributable to cash collections from clients partially offset by an overall increase in client receivables and by cash operating expense outflows, including the settlement of liability-classified ACUs during the second quarter and discretionary bonuses paid during the first quarter of 2024 with respect to prior year compensation expense. 
 Investing activities resulted in a net cash inflow of 0.6 million attributable to the maturation of investments in U.S. Treasury securities, which was almost fully offset by the purchase of additional investments and capital expenditures related to office space renovations. 
 Financing activities resulted in a net cash outflow of 74.4 million primarily due to withholding tax payments for vested PWP Incentive Plan Awards and equity-classified ACUs, the cash settlement of exchanges of PWP OpCo Units, share repurchases, dividend payments, and distributions to partners, all of which was partially offset by the issuance of 5,750,000 shares of Class A common stock for net proceeds of 66.0 million. 
 Nine Months Ended September 30, 2023 
 Operating activities resulted in a net cash outflow of 12.5 million primarily attributable to cash operating expense outflows, including discretionary bonuses paid during the first quarter of 2023 with respect to prior year compensation expense, partially offset by cash collections from clients. 
 Investing activities resulted in a net cash inflow of 26.3 million largely attributable to the maturation of investments in U.S. Treasury securities, net of additional investments in U.S. Treasury securities as well as capital expenditures related to office space renovations. 
 Financing activities resulted in a net cash outflow of 60.0 million primarily related to the repurchase of shares pursuant to the stock repurchase program, withholding tax payments for vested PWP Incentive Plan Awards, distributions to partners, and dividend payments. 
 Share Repurchase Program 
 Our board of directors approved a stock repurchase program under which we are authorized to repurchase up to 200.0 million of our Class A common stock with no requirement to purchase any minimum number of shares. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we repurchased 1,000,000 founder shares at a purchase price of 15.00 per share. As of September 30, 2024, 93.8 million remains of the 200.0 million authorized for share repurchases. 
 32 

Exchange Rights 
 In accordance with the limited partnership agreement of PWP OpCo, holders of PWP OpCo Units (other than the Company) may exchange these units for (i) shares of Class A common stock on a one-for-one basis or (ii) cash from an offering of shares of Class A common stock and (iii) subsequent to the Merger, cash from any other source. Whether future exchanges are settled in cash or shares of Class A common stock is at our option and will depend on our liquidity and capital resources, market conditions, the timing and concentration of exchange elections and other factors. See Note 9 Stockholders Equity and Redeemable Non-Controlling Interests in the notes to the condensed consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in the Form 10-Q for further information. 
 Regulatory Capital 
 We actively monitor our regulatory capital base. Our principal subsidiaries are subject to regulatory requirements in their respective jurisdictions to ensure general financial soundness and liquidity. This requires, among other things, that we comply with certain minimum capital requirements, record-keeping, reporting procedures, experience and training requirements for employees and certain other requirements and procedures. These regulatory requirements may restrict the flow of funds to and from affiliates. Refer to Note 6 Regulatory Requirements in the notes to condensed consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Form 10-Q for further information. These regulations differ in the United States, United Kingdom, Canada, France and other countries in which we operate a registered broker-dealer or regionally similar construct. The license or regulatory framework under which we operate in each such country is meant to comply with applicable laws and regulations to conduct an advisory business. We believe that we provide each of our subsidiaries with sufficient capital and liquidity, consistent with their business and regulatory requirements to effectively operate in each jurisdiction. 
 
 Tax Receivable Agreement 
 As of September 30, 2024, we had an amount due of 46.2 million pursuant to the tax receivable agreement, which represents management s best estimate of the amounts currently expected to be owed in connection with the tax receivable agreement for the Business Combination and subsequent exchanges made to date. See Note 15 Related Party Transactions in the notes to the condensed consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in the Form 10-Q for further information as well as the expected timing of payments. 
 Leases 
 We have various non-cancelable operating leases for our office space and certain equipment. As of September 30, 2024, we had 188.4 million of operating lease liabilities. See Note 4 Leases in the notes to condensed consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Form 10-Q for further information as well as the expected timing of payments. 
 
 Market Risk and Credit Risk 
 Our business is not capital-intensive and we do not invest in derivative instruments. We are not subject to significant market risk (including interest rate risk and commodity price risk) or significant credit risk. 
 Risks Related to Cash and Cash Equivalents 
 Our cash and cash equivalents include any short-term highly liquid investments that are readily convertible to known amounts of cash and have original maturities of three months or less from the date of purchase. Cash is maintained in U.S. and non-U.S. bank accounts. Most account balances exceed U.S. Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) coverage limits or the coverage limits of the relevant foreign deposit insurance system, as applicable. We believe our cash and cash equivalents are not subject to any material interest rate risk, equity price risk, credit risk or other market risk. 
 Credit Risk 
 We regularly review our accounts receivable and allowance for credit losses by considering factors such as historical experience, credit quality, age of the accounts receivable, and the current economic conditions that may affect a client s ability to pay such amounts owed to us. We maintain an allowance for credit losses that, in our opinion, provides for an adequate reserve to cover current expected credit losses. Refer to Note 2 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in the notes to condensed consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Form 10-Q for further information. 
 When we invest our excess cash, we manage our credit risk exposure by holding investments primarily with investment grade credit quality. As of September 30, 2024, the Company held investments of 95.0 million in U.S. Treasury securities with maturities of less than 12 months. Of this amount, 20.1 million is presented in Cash and cash equivalents and 74.9 million is presented in Investments in short-term marketable debt securities on the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition. 
 33 

Exchange Rate Risk 
 We are exposed to exchange rate risk as a result of having foreign subsidiaries with non-U.S. dollar functional currencies as well as from entering into transactions and holding monetary assets and liabilities that are not denominated in the functional currency of its operating subsidiaries. Specifically, the reported amounts in our consolidated financial statements may be affected by movements in the rate of exchange between the pound sterling, euro, and Canadian dollar and our reporting currency, the U.S. dollar. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the net impact of non-functional currency related transaction gains (losses) recorded in Other income (expense) on our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations was (2.4) million and (0.3) million, respectively, primarily related to U.S. dollar-denominated cash and intercompany receivables held by our foreign subsidiaries as the strength of the U.S. dollar fluctuated. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the net impact from the fluctuation of foreign currencies recorded in Foreign currency translation gain (loss) on our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income (Loss) was 2.5 million and 0.7 million, respectively. We have not entered into any transactions to hedge our exposure to these foreign currency fluctuations using derivative instruments or other methods but may do so if we deem appropriate in the future. As of September 30, 2024, we held cash balances of 29.8 million in non-U.S. dollar currencies, composed of pound sterling, euros, and Canadian dollars. 
 
 Critical Accounting Estimates 
 The unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Form 10-Q are prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP, which requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, expenses, and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Estimates and the assumptions underlying these estimates are reviewed periodically, and the effects of revisions are reflected in the period in which they are determined to be necessary. For a discussion of our critical accounting estimates, refer to our Annual Report on Form 10-K filed on February 23, 2024.

 Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f)) during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 that materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

 6. Representations and Warranties of the Participant . The Participant hereby represents and warrants to the Partnership as of the date of this Agreement as follows 
 (a) The Participant qualifies as an Accredited Investor under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission promulgated thereunder (the Securities Act ). 
 (b) The Participant has such knowledge and experience in financial and business matters that the Participant is capable of evaluating the merits and risks of the investment to be made by the Participant hereunder. The Participant understands and has taken cognizance of all the risk factors related to the investment in the PI Unit. 
 (c) The Participant is acquiring the PI Unit for the Participant s own account for investment and not with any view to, or for resale in connection with, any distribution or public offering thereof within the meaning of the Securities Act. 
 (d) The Participant understands that (i) the PI Unit has not been registered under the Securities Act or applicable state securities laws, in reliance on exemptions from registration under the Securities Act and applicable state securities laws and (ii) no federal or state agency has made any finding or determination as to the fairness for investment, nor any recommendation or endorsement, of the PI Unit. 
 (e) The Participant acknowledges and agrees that (i) except as expressly provided for in this Agreement, no representations or warranties have been made to the Participant by the Partnership or any other persons with respect to the Participant s investment in the PI Unit, (ii) except for this Agreement, the PUD and the LP Agreement, there are no agreements, contracts, understandings or commitments between the Participant, on the one hand, and the Partnership, on the other hand, with respect to the Participant s investment in the PI Unit, (iii) in entering into this transaction the Participant is not relying upon any information, other 
 3 

than that contained in the LP Agreement, the PUD, this Agreement and the results of the Participant s own independent investigation, (iv) the Participant s financial situation is such that the Participant can afford to hold the PI Unit for an indefinite period of time, has adequate means for providing for the Participant s current needs and personal contingencies, and can afford the eventuality that the PI Unit may ultimately have no value, (v) the future value of the PI Unit is speculative and (vi) the Participant is not entitled to any preemptive, tag-along, information or other minority investor rights with respect to the PI Unit, other than as expressly set forth in this Agreement, the PUD, the LP Agreement or as otherwise provided under applicable law. 
 (f) The Participant is fully informed and aware of the circumstances under which the PI Unit must be held and the restrictions upon the resale of the PI Unit under the Securities Act and any applicable state securities laws. The Participant understands (i) that the Participant must bear the economic risk of the Participant s investment in the PI Unit for an indefinite period of time because the PI Unit has not been registered under the Securities Act and, therefore, cannot be sold unless it is registered under the Securities Act and any applicable state securities laws or unless an exemption from such registration is available, (ii) that the availability of an exemption may depend on factors over which the Participant has no control and (iii) that unless so registered or exempt from registration, the PI Unit may be required to be held for an indefinite period. The Participant understands that an exemption from registration is not presently available pursuant to Rule 144 promulgated under the Securities Act, that there is no assurance that such exemption will ever become available to the Participant, and that even if it were to become available, sales pursuant to Rule 144 would be limited in amount and could only be made in full compliance with the provisions of Rule 144. 
 (g) The Participant has received and reviewed the LP Agreement and the PUD. The Participant acknowledges and agrees that the PI Unit is subject to the provisions of the LP Agreement and the PUD. 
 (h) The Participant has full authority to enter into this Agreement and the LP Agreement, and to perform the Participant s obligations hereunder and thereunder. This Agreement and the LP Agreement have been duly and validly executed and delivered by the Participant and constitute legal, valid and binding obligations of the Participant, enforceable against the Participant in accordance with their terms, subject, as to the enforcement of remedies, to the effect of any applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or other similar law of general application affecting creditors and general principles of equity. The execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement and the LP Agreement does not and will not conflict with, violate or cause a breach of any agreement, contract or instrument to which the Participant is a party or any judgment, order, decree or law to which the Participant is subject. 
 (i) The Participant understands that the Partnership s decision to grant the PI Unit to the Participant is predicated, in part, on the representations, warranties and covenants of the Participant contained herein. 
 4 

7. Survival of Representations and Warranties Indemnification . All representations and warranties of the Participant contained herein shall survive the execution of this Agreement and the grant of the PI Unit contemplated hereby. The Participant agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the Partnership from any actual liability, loss or expense (including, without limitation, reasonable attorneys fees) incurred by the Partnership as a result of the Participant s breach of any representation or warranty hereunder. 
 8. No Right of Continued Service . Neither the grant of the PI Unit nor anything contained in this Agreement shall confer upon the Participant any right to continue in the service of the Partnership, or to prohibit or restrict the Partnership or an Affiliate thereof from Terminating the Participant at any time or for any reason whatsoever, with or without Cause, notwithstanding the effect any such action may have on the Participant, this Agreement, the LP Agreement or any PI Unit that is or would otherwise be granted under this Agreement. 
 9. Mandatory 83(b) Election . The Participant acknowledges that the Participant is required to timely file an election under Section 83(b) of the Code in the form attached hereto as Exhibit B and that filing such election is the Participant s responsibility.

The Participant will deliver a copy of any such completed Section 83(b) election form to the Partnership promptly upon filing. 
 10. Tax Consequences .

The Participant agrees to determine and be responsible for any and all tax consequences to the Participant related to the grant, ownership, or vesting and related lapsing of any forfeiture conditions, of the PI Unit. By accepting the PI Unit, the Participant acknowledges that the Partnership is treated as a partnership for U.S. federal and state income tax purposes and that the Participant will be treated as a partner for such purposes with respect to the PI Unit. Accordingly, the Participant acknowledges that, among other things, the Participant will be required to report and pay tax on the Participant s individual tax return the Participant s distributive share of the Partnership s income, gain, loss, deductions and credits, regardless of whether the Participant has received a distribution from the Partnership, and accordingly, the ownership of the PI Unit may give rise to an out-of-pocket expense for the Participant.

The Partnership and the Participant hereby acknowledge and agree that the Participant s PI Unit granted under this Agreement is, except to the extent issued in exchange for property, intended to constitute a profits interest in the Partnership within the meaning of IRS Revenue Procedure 93-27, 1993 2 C.B. 343 Rev. Proc. 93-27 ), or any successor IRS or Treasury Department Regulation or other pronouncement applicable at the date of issuance of the PI Unit (a Profits Interest ). The Partnership shall treat the Participant as the owner of such Profits Interest from the date it is granted for all purposes. The Participant shall take into account the distributive share of partnership income, gain, loss, deduction, and credit associated with its Profits Interest in computing the Participant s income tax liability for the entire period during which the Participant has the Profits Interest. Upon the grant of the Profits Interest or at any time thereafter, neither the Partnership nor any of its partners may deduct any amount (as wages, compensation, or otherwise) for the fair market value of the Profits Interest. The undertakings contained in this Section 10 shall be construed in accordance with Section 4 of IRS Revenue Procedure 2001-43, 2001-2 C.B. 191 Rev. Proc. 2001-43 ).
