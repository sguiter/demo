 Notes to the Financial Statements 

 October 31, 2024 and 2023 

 (Unaudited) 

as of October 31, 2024 and 
as of April 30, 2024. The Company currently has losses and has not completed its efforts to establish a stabilized source of revenues
sufficient to cover operating costs over an extended period of time. Therefore, there is substantial doubt about the Company s ability
to continue as a going concern. Management anticipates that the Company will be dependent, for the near future, on additional investment
capital to fund operating expenses. The Company intends to position itself so that it will be able to raise additional funds through the
capital markets. In light of management s efforts, there are no assurances that the Company will be successful in this or any of
its endeavors or become financially viable and continue as a going concern. 

potentially dilutive debt or equity instruments issued
or outstanding. 

,
 par value shares of common stock authorized. 

On April 15, 2022 the
Company issued shares of common stock to a director for services rendered estimated to be at 0.0001 per share. 

In July, 2023, the Company
issued shares of common stock to 3 shareholders in consideration of . 

In September and January
2023, the Company issued shares of common stock to 29 shareholders at 0.02 per share in consideration of . 

In November and December
2022 followed by January 2023, the Company issued shares of common stock to 5 shareholders at 0.02 per share in consideration
of . 

There were 
shares of common stock issued and outstanding as of October 31, 2024. 

Voting Common Stock 

 All shares of common stock have voting rights
and are identical. All holders of shares of voting common stock shall at every meeting of the stockholders be entitled to one vote for
each share of the capital stock held by such stockholder. 

Non-voting Common Stock 

 All of the other terms of the Non-Voting Common
Stock shall be identical to the Voting Common Stock, except for the right of first refusal that attaches to the Non-Voting Common Stock,
as explained in the Company s Bylaws. 

Change in valuation allowance 

Tax benefit (expenses), net 

The tax effects of temporary differences that give rise to significant
portions of the net deferred tax assets are as follows: 

Valuation allowance 

Deferred tax assets, net 

The Company has accumulated approximately 
of net operating losses NOL carried forward to offset future taxable income up to 20 years, if any, in future years which
begin to expire in year 2038. In assessing the realization of deferred tax assets, management considers whether it is more likely than
not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will be realized. The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent
upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences become deductible. Management considers
the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities, projected future taxable income and tax planning strategies in making this assessment.
Based on the assessment, management has established a full valuation allowance against all of the deferred tax asset relating to NOLs
for every period because it is more likely than not that all of the deferred tax asset will not be realized.

ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS
OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATION 

FORWARD LOOKING STATEMENTS 

Statements made in this Form 10-Q that are not
historical or current facts are forward-looking statements made pursuant to the safe harbor provisions of Section 27A of
the Securities Act of 1933 (the Act and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. These statements often can
be identified by the use of terms such as may, will, expect, believe, anticipate, 
 estimate, approximate or continue, or the negative thereof. We intend that such forward-looking
statements be subject to the safe harbors for such statements. We wish to caution readers not to place undue reliance on any such forward-looking
statements, which speak only as of the date made. Any forward-looking statements represent management's best judgment as to what may occur
in the future. However, forward-looking statements are subject to risks, uncertainties and important factors beyond our control that could
cause actual results and events to differ materially from historical results of operations and events and those presently anticipated
or projected. We disclaim any obligation subsequently to revise any forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances after
the date of such statement or to reflect the occurrence of anticipated or unanticipated events. 

Employees
and Employment Agreements 

At present, we have no employees other than our
officer and director. We presently do not have pension, health, annuity, insurance, stock options, profit sharing or similar benefit plans;
however, we may adopt such plans in the future. There are presently no personal benefits available to any officers, directors or employees. 

Results of Operation 

Our financial statements have been prepared assuming
that we will continue as a going concern and, accordingly, do not include adjustments relating to the recoverability and realization of
assets and classification of liabilities that might be necessary should we be unable to continue in operation. 

We expect we will require additional capital to
meet our long-term operating requirements. We expect to raise additional capital through, among other things, the sale of equity or debt
securities. 

Three and Six Months Ended October 31, 2024 and 2023: 

During the three and six months ended October
31, 2024 the Company has generated 6,000 and 6,000 revenue. 

Our net loss for the three and six months ended
October 31, 2024 was 906 and 14,411. Operating expenses consist of mainly professional fees. 

During the three and six months ended October
31, 2023 the Company has not generated any revenue. 

Our net loss for the three and six months ended
October 31, 2023 was 4,003 and 37,626. Operating expenses consist of mainly professional fees. 

12 

Liquidity and Capital Resources 

As of October 31, 2024, our total assets were
 51,825 consisting of website development, net of 134, mobile application 45,500 and cash 6,191 from issuance of common stock. As of
October 31, 2024, our current liabilities were 155,429 consisting of accounts payable-related party advances of 43,000, director loan
of 66,929 and note payable of 45,500. 

Cash Flows from Operating Activities 

We have generated positive cash flows from operating
activities. For the six months ended October 31, 2024, net cash flows used in operating activities were 31,089. 

We have not generated positive cash flows from
operating activities. For the six months ended October 31, 2023, net cash flows used in operating activities were 37,626. 

Cash Flows from Investing Activities 

We have not generated positive cashflow from investing
activities. For the six months ended October 31, 2024 we used 45,500in investing activities. 

Cash Flows from Financing Activities 

We have generated cash flows from financing activities
in the amount 19,412 during the six months ended October 31, 2024. During the six months ended October 31, 2023 we generated cash flows
from financing activities of 30,627. 

Plan of Operation and Funding 

We expect that working capital requirements will
continue to be funded through a combination of our existing funds and further issuances of securities. Our working capital requirements
are expected to increase in line with the growth of our business. 

Existing working capital, further advances and
debt instruments, and anticipated cash flow are expected to be adequate to fund our operations over the next three months. We have no
lines of credit or other bank financing arrangements. Generally, we have financed operations to date through the proceeds of the private
placement of equity and debt instruments. In connection with our business plan, management anticipates additional increases in operating
expenses and capital expenditures relating to: (i) acquisition of inventory; (ii) developmental expenses associated with a start-up business;
and (iii) marketing expenses. We intend to finance these expenses with further issuances of securities, and debt issuances. Thereafter,
we expect we will need to raise additional capital and generate revenues to meet long-term operating requirements. Additional issuances
of equity or convertible debt securities will result in dilution to our current shareholders. Further, such securities might have rights,
preferences or privileges senior to our common stock. Additional financing may not be available upon acceptable terms, or at all. If adequate
funds are not available or are not available on acceptable terms, we may not be able to take advantage of prospective new business endeavors
or opportunities, which could significantly and materially restrict our business operations. We will have to raise additional funds in
the next twelve months in order to sustain and expand our operations. We currently do not have a specific plan of how we will obtain such
funding; however, we anticipate that additional funding will be in the form of equity financing from the sale of our common stock. We
have and will continue to seek to obtain short-term loans from our directors, although no future arrangement for additional loans has
been made. We do not have any agreements with our directors concerning these loans. We do not have any arrangements in place for any future
equity financing. 

13 

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 

As of the date of this Quarterly Report, we do
not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition,
changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that
are material to investors. 

Going Concern 

The financial statements have been prepared "assuming
that we will continue as a going concern", which contemplates that we will realize our assets and satisfy our liabilities and commitments
in the ordinary course of business. 

ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES
ABOUT MARKET RISK. 

No report required. 

ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 

Our management is responsible for establishing
and maintaining a system of disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) that
is designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is
recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the Commission s rules and forms. Disclosure
controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed
by an issuer in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to the issuer s management,
including its principal executive officer or officers and principal financial officer or officers, or persons performing similar functions,
as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 

An evaluation was conducted under the supervision
and with the participation of our management of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures
as of October 31, 2024. Based on that evaluation, our management concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective
as of such date to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act, is recorded,
processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in SEC rules and forms. Such officer also confirmed that there was
no change in our internal control over financial reporting during the three-month period ended October 31, 2024 that has materially affected,
or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
