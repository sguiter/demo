 Summary of significant accounting policies (continued) 

Retroactive
Application of Reverse Recapitalization to the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Shareholders Deficit 

Pursuant
to the terms of the Business Combination Agreement, as part of the Closing, all of the issued and outstanding Seamless common shares
were all converted into ordinary shares of Currenc at an Exchange Ratio of (after adjusting for the share repurchase). 

Retroactive
Application of Reverse Recapitalization to the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Loss 

Furthermore,
based on the retroactive application of the reverse recapitalization to the Company s Condensed Consolidated Statements of Changes
in Shareholders Deficit, Seamless recalculated the weighted-average shares for the pre-Business Combination portion of the periods
ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. The basic and diluted weighted-average Seamless common shares were retroactively converted to Currenc
ordinary shares using the Exchange Ratio to conform to the recast periods (see Note 2 (j), Net income (loss) per share , for additional
information). 

Retroactive
Application of Reverse Recapitalization to the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets 

Finally,

 million. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company had a net loss of million and net cash used in operating
activities of million. Net cash used in investing activities was million. Net cash generated from financing activities was
 million, resulting principally from proceeds of borrowings. 

While
the Company believes that it will be able to continue to grow the Company s revenue base and control expenditures, there is no
assurance that it will be able to achieve these goals. As a result, the Company continually monitors its capital structure and operating
plans and evaluates various potential funding alternatives that may be needed to finance the Company s business development activities,
general and administrative expenses and growth strategy.

 Summary of significant accounting policies (continued) 

Remittance
services revenue 

Revenue
from contracts with customers on service charges and gain/loss on foreign exchange arising from remittance activities are recognized
upon the processing and execution of the international money transfer transactions. Remittance services are further divided into Fiat
Currency Prefunded Remittance Service and XRP Prefunded Remittance Service. Management has considered these two services to be two product
lines. 

The
customers of the remittance services are financial institutions (referred to as Remittance Partners ). Remittance Partners
who use the fiat currency prefunding option for their remittance business with the Company are referred to as Fiat Currency Prefunded
Remittance Partners, whereas customers who choose the XRP Prefunding mode are referred to as XRP Prefunded Remittance Partners. 

Fiat
Currency Prefunded Remittance Service 

The
Company earns revenue by charging their customers a Fiat Currency Prefunded Remittance Fee when they use the Company s platform
to transfer money to a beneficiary in another country. These Fiat Currency Prefunded Remittance Fees are fixed and specific for every
country s currency and are charged at the point-in-time of executing this performance obligation. Prior to delivering cash to the
customer s beneficiary, the customer must directly provide the Company with prefunding (i.e., the cash to be remitted to the beneficiary).
This is the traditional prefunding process, which the Company describes as Fiat Currency Prefunded Remittance Service. 

XRP
Prefunded Remittance Service 

Unlike
the Fiat Currency Prefunded Remittance Service, the customer obtains prefunding through Ripple Solution offered by Ripple Lab Inc. (see
Note 9) with the XRP Prefunded Remittance Service. Ripple supplies the customer with the XRP equivalent of the requested prefunding.
The Company subsequently liquidates this XRP on Ripple s behalf, and the fiat currency obtained as a result of the liquidation
process is transferred to the customer s beneficiary. Customers who prefund their remittance service with XRP must enter into an
agreement with Ripple and undergo stringent credit checks in order to get XRP prefunding and use Ripple s platform. The Company
charges their customers an XRP Prefunded Remittance Service Fee when the money is transferred to the customer s beneficiary. 

For
both the XRP Prefunded and Fiat Currency Prefunded Remittance Services, the Company has no obligations to the customer in terms of guarantees,
warranties or other similar obligations. There are also no significant payment terms involved as the Company obtains their fees shortly
after charging their customers. 

Sales
Walletku Modern Channel 

Revenue
from the sale of goods is recognized at the point in time when the Company satisfies their performance obligation, which is upon delivery
of the goods to the customer. The credit terms are typically 3-7 days. 

Sales
of airtime 

Revenue
from airtime sold is recognized when the relevant international airtime transfer or reload request is processed and executed. 

Other
services 

Revenue
from contracts with customers on other services is recognized as and when services are rendered.

under a trust, with ordinary shares (part of the Exchange Consideration Shares) being placed in trust upon the Closing
of the Business Combination. The trustee will distribute the vested shares to the staff based on a schedule of (i) one third immediately
upon the vesting of Incentive shares at the time of completion of IPO or de-SPAC, (ii) one third on the first anniversary date thereafter,

 Summary of significant accounting policies (continued) 

ASC
825-10, Financial Instruments , allows entities to voluntarily choose to measure certain financial assets and liabilities at fair
value (fair value option). The fair value option may be elected on an instrument-by-instrument basis and is irrevocable unless a new
election date occurs. If the fair value option is elected for an instrument, unrealized gains and losses for that instrument should be
reported in earnings at each subsequent reporting date. The Company elected to apply the fair value option to its PIPE Convertible Note
described in Note 10, Convertible bonds and notes . This financial liability was initially measured at its issue-date fair value
and is subsequently remeasured at fair value on a recurring basis at each reporting period date. The Company elected to present the fair
value and the interest components together in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss.
Therefore, interest is included as a component of changes in fair value of debt presented in the Other income line item
in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss.

As
of December 31, 2023, no financial liabilities were reported at fair value and measured on a recurring basis. There were no transfers
between fair value hierarchy levels during the period ended September 30, 2024.

Combination or earlier upon redemption or liquidation. 

The

to settle such Public Warrant exercise unless a registration statement under the Securities Act covering the issuance of the ordinary
share issuable upon exercise of the Public Warrants is then effective and a prospectus relating thereto is current, subject to the Company
satisfying its obligations with respect to registration or such issuance is deemed to be exempt under the Securities Act and the securities
laws of the state of residence of the registered holder of the warrants. 

Once

If
the Company calls the Public Warrants for redemption, management will have the option to require all holders that wish to exercise the
Public Warrants to do so on a cashless basis, as described in the warrant agreement. The exercise price and number of ordinary
share issuable upon exercise of the warrants may be adjusted in certain circumstances including in the event of a stock dividend, or
recapitalization, reorganization, merger or consolidation. However, except as described below, the warrants will not be adjusted for
issuance of ordinary share at a price below its exercise price. Additionally, in no event will the Company be required to net cash settle
the warrants. If the Company is unable to complete a Business Combination within the Combination Period and the Company liquidates the
funds held in the Trust Account, holders of warrants will not receive any of such funds with respect to their warrants, nor will they
receive any distribution from the Company s assets held outside of the Trust Account with the respect to such warrants. Accordingly,

assessment of the instruments specific terms and applicable authoritative guidance in ASC 480 and ASC 815. The assessment considers
whether the instruments are free standing financial instruments pursuant to ASC 480, meet the definition of a liability pursuant to ASC
480, and whether the instruments meet all of the requirements for equity classification under ASC 815, including whether the instruments
are indexed to the Company s own common shares and whether the instrument holders could potentially require net cash settlement 
in a circumstance outside of the Company s control, among other conditions for equity classification. This assessment, which requires
the use of professional judgment, was conducted at the time of warrant issuance and as of each subsequent period end date while the instruments
are outstanding. Management has concluded that the Public Warrants, Private Placement Warrants and PIPE Warrants issued pursuant to their
respective warrant agreement qualify for equity accounting treatment.

Through
our two major lines of business, remittance and airtime, Currenc is a leading operator of global money transfer services and airtime
trading in Southeast Asia. The remittance business facilitates users in different countries sending money from one country to another
in a low cost and efficient manner. The airtime business sells airtime to users in different countries worldwide, including retail users
in Indonesia. In the past, Currenc operated the two different business lines through four main subsidiaries: Tranglo, WalletKu, TNG Asia
and GEA. On July 30, 2024, Currenc divested GEA and on August 30, 2024, Currenc also disposed TNG Asia. Since then, Currenc operates
the global remittance business mainly through Tranglo, which is one of the leading money remittance platforms in Southeast Asia. Tranglo
provides business-to-business B2B remittance services for financial institutions and is considered as a upstream player
of the remittance industry. Currenc also provides cross-border international airtime transfer services through Tranglo, acting as a switching
platform provider for telecom airtime transfer and a wholesale reseller of foreign airtime. Currenc also runs WalletKu, which is an Indonesian
airtime operator facing end users directly. 

Tranglo
is a leading global money and airtime transfer hub in Southeast Asia. For Tranglo s money remittance business, it provides a single
unified application programming interface for licensed banks and money service operators and acts as a one-stop settlement agent for
cross-border money transfer, offering customers the ability to process payments globally. At September 30, 2024, Tranglo had more than
5,000 bank partners, 35 eWallets, 130,000 cash pick-up points, and 133 corporate clients for remittances, with a remittance network covering
more than 80 countries. As for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024, Tranglo processed around 8.56 million transactions with
a total processing value of 3.92 billion, which represents a growth in volume by 5.5 as compared to 8.11 million transactions, and
a growth in total processing value by 18.8 as compared to the total processing value of 3.3 billion for the nine-month period ended
September 30, 2023. As for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024, the top four sending countries for Tranglo s remittance
business were UK, Hong Kong, Singapore and Korea, whereas the top four receiving countries were Philippines, Indonesia, Thailand and
Vietnam. The predominant portion of Tranglo s Hong Kong related revenue is derived from two customers, TNG Asia and GEA, which
were divested by Currenc in August and July 2024 respectively. Based on the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024 operating results,
post-Divestiture, the percentage of revenue generated in Hong Kong and the PRC represented approximately 6.0 of Currenc s total
revenue. 

The
number of Tranglo unique users increased to 1,024,100 as of September 30, 2024 from 866,800 as of September 30, 2023, while the number
of global money transfer transactions increased from 8.11 million for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2023 to 8.56 million
for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024. The number of average monthly unique sending accounts increased from 326,500 for
the nine-month period ended September 30, 2023 to 358,900 for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024. 

30 

Tranglo
is also a global airtime transfer hub, offering cross-border airtime wholesale and transfer services. At September 30, 2024, Tranglo
has partnered with more than 500 mobile operators that cover 150 countries and served more than 40 airtime corporate customers. As for
the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024, Tranglo processed 3.23 million airtime transfer transactions with a total value of 7.3
million, representing a decrease of 21.4 in volume and 22.3 in value as compared to 4.11 million transactions with a total value of
 9.4 million for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2023. For the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024, the airtime unique
user accounts decreased to 531,000, representing a decline of 25.9 as compared to 716,500 for the nine-month period ended September
30, 2023. The monthly average unique sending accounts also decreased to 140,200 for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024, representing
a decline of 22.1 as compared to 180,000 for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2023. 

WalletKu
is an independent electronic platform in Indonesia directly facing end users, and allows its customers to purchase airtime and conduct
internet data top-up. WalletKu platform also allows users to conduct cash top-up, transfers, and utility or bill payments. WalletKu is
also a participant in the Indosat Cluster Partnership for managing the marketing work of Indosat telecommunication and airtime products
in two cluster areas in Indonesia. WalletKu served approximately 130,502 customers as of September 30, 2024, distributing airtime with
a total value of 9.7 million for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024. 

TNG
Asia operates an eWallet operation in Hong Kong, targeting the niche market of overseas workers, i.e., Philippine and Indonesian overseas
domestic workers living in Hong Kong. TNG Asia generates 80-95 of its revenue by offering the money remittance services to these overseas
workers. 

GEA
is a remittance agent which mainly serves TNG Asia in remitting money to overseas countries. GEA provides a prefunding facility for TNG
Asia and conducts foreign exchange Forex conversion for TNG Asia s customers. GEA also provides currency conversion
and remittance services for other clients and earns revenue via Forex spread markups.

Combination

August 30, 2024 (the Closing Date ), INFINT, INFINT Fintech Merger Sub Corp., a Cayman Islands exempted company and wholly
owned subsidiary of INFINT Merger Sub ), and Seamless Group Inc., a limited liability company under the laws of the Cayman
Islands (along with its wholly owned subsidiaries, Seamless ), consummated a business combination pursuant to the business
combination agreement, dated as of August 3, 2022, as amended (the Business Combination Agreement ). 

On
the Closing Date, INFINT completed a series of transactions (the Closing that resulted in the combination (the Business
Combination of INFINT with Seamless. On August 30, 2024, pursuant to the Business Combination Agreement, the Merger Sub merged
with and into Seamless, with Seamless surviving the merger as a wholly owned subsidiary of INFINT, and INFINT changed its name to Currenc
Group Inc. Currenc ). The Company s ordinary shares are listed on the Nasdaq Capital Market under the symbol CURR . 

As
consideration for the Business Combination, Currenc issued to Seamless shareholders an aggregate of 40,000,000 ordinary shares (the Exchange
Consideration ). In addition, Currenc issued 400,000 commitment shares to the PIPE investor (as described below) and an aggregate
of 200,000 shares to vendors in connection with the Closing, issued promissory notes for approximately 5.7 million to EF Hutton LLC EF Hutton ), approximately 3.2 million to Greenberg Traurig LLP Greenberg Traurig ), and 603,623 to INFINT

million, 400,000 commitment shares, and warrants to purchase 136,110 ordinary shares in a private placement to a PIPE investor (the PIPE
Offering ), which raised 1.75 million in net proceeds. 

Pursuant to ASC 805-40, Reverse Acquisitions ,
for financial accounting and reporting purposes, Seamless was deemed the accounting acquirer with INFINT being treated as the accounting
acquiree, and the Business Combination was accounted for as a reverse recapitalization (the Reverse Recapitalization ). Accordingly,
the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements of the Company represent a continuation of the financial statements of Seamless,
with the Business Combination being treated as the equivalent of Seamless issuing stock for the net assets of INFINT, accompanied by a
recapitalization. The net liabilities of INFINT were stated at historical cost, with no goodwill or other intangible assets recorded,
and were consolidated with Seamless financial statements on the Closing Date. The number of Seamless common shares for all periods
prior to the Closing Date have been retrospectively adjusted using the exchange ratio that was established in accordance with the Business
Combination Agreement, after adjusting for the share repurchase. 

See Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements,
 Reverse Recapitalization and Related Transactions , for additional information. 

Major
Factors Affecting Currenc s Results of Operations 

Currenc
operates in the cross-border money remittance and international airtime transfer markets in Southeast Asia, and its results of operations
and financial condition are significantly affected by general factors driving this market. It has benefited from rapid technological
change, increased low cost and real time cross-border money transfer needs, as well as increased availability, quality and usage of mobile
devices. It has also benefited significantly from the increasing Internet penetration, particularly mobile Internet penetration, in Asia,
and also the increasing adoption of electronic wallets or storage vehicles. On the other hand, its international airtime transfer business
may be adversely affected by the increasing adoption and thus wider availability of free Wi-Fi in public places and buildings in many
Southeast Asian countries as well as other emerging countries. Currenc s results of operations and financial condition are affected
by the general factors driving the currency transfer, digital financial services, e-commerce and other industries in Southeast Asia.
On the other hand, as the global digital remittance market has thrived and grown rapidly, more and more competitors have entered into
the market and as a result, the market competition is intensifying. This has direct impact on the pricing power of Currenc, and thus
its profitability. 

Currenc s
ability to maintain and increase the size of its user base 

Currenc s
revenue is largely driven by the number of users and the number of transactions on its remittance platforms, as well as the users on
the airtime trading platforms. The larger the number of users on Currenc s platforms and the larger the number of partners, including
banks, e-Wallets and corporations that will join its network, the greater will be the number of transactions that drive its revenue.
However, as the market competition is getting more intense, Currenc has to offer more price-competitive and highly efficient services
in order to maintain and increase its user base. 

Also,
the larger the number of merchants and telecommunication companies using the platforms of airtime supplied by Tranglo s airtime
business and WalletKu, the higher the growth in business, and revenue of Currenc will be higher. 

31 

Currenc
will strive to develop B2C markets in Southeast Asia and Middle East, so as to capture the retail remittance and airtime market. This
development, if successfully launched, will generate significant clientele and synergy for Tranglo s remittance and airtime businesses. 

User
engagement and monetization 

Currently,
Currenc s global money transfer and airtime services are the foundation of its relationship with its users globally. It generates
revenue on cross border money transfers and airtime transfer services. In particular, Currenc s in-house cross-border payment processing
B2B platform generates fees on money transfer orders it settles for banks and other money service operators around the world. Currenc
will continue to drive adoption of its retail end users and financial institutions in using Currenc s platform for money transfer,
mass payout and collection services and payment processing business, as well as introduce new B2C financial services and airtime distribution
services, in Southeast Asia and Middle East. Currenc believes it can leverage its expertise and knowhow to develop retail markets in
Southeast Asia and Middle East, offering payment, remittances, airtime and other fintech services. 

As
for airtime business, Currenc will strive to expand its global airtime transfer coverage and telco partner network. The global airtime
transfer business mainly serves migrant workers worldwide. As free Wi-Fi becomes more and more available to many Southeast Asian countries,
the needs for migrant workers from these countries to send airtime back to their homelands diminish over time. Also, as Malaysia-Indonesia
is currently the key global airtime corridor for Tranglo which contributed 51.6 of Tranglo s global airtime revenue for the nine-month
period ended September 30, 2024, Tranglo s global airtime business could be adversely affected by the changes. Currenc needs to
broaden its network and diversify its user base to other Asian countries like Pakistan, Middle East countries like UAE, Saudi Arabia,
and African countries like Egypt, in order to expand its global airtime business in the future. Currenc will also seek to expand the
network and coverage of WalletKu and offer a wider range of products and services for retail customers in Indonesia. Currenc believes
the insights on its users generated by its existing services will enable it to develop new products and services for the existing markets,
and also to explore and develop new markets for the services, and thereby generate more revenue for it. 

Launch
of new products and services and cross-selling to Currenc s users 

Currenc
strives to stay on the cutting edge of the financial technology by developing and launching new products and services to offer to both
new and existing users and intends to continue investing in product development to build new products and services and to bring them
to market. 

Currenc s
existing users represent a sizable opportunity to cross-sell products and services with relatively low incremental marketing and advertising
expenses. Currenc believes that there exists a significant synergy between its B2C eWallet and retail airtime business and its B2B cross
border remittance business and global airtime transfer business. As such, it plans to continually invest in the product development of
its existing platforms, and to also to explore and develop eWallet markets in various Southeast Asian and Middle East countries so as
to expand its B2C business scope and create more synergy between its B2C and B2B businesses. To the extent that Currenc is able to create
significant synergy between its operations, and to cross-sell products and services between different clienteles and countries, it expects
its revenue and financial income to continue to grow and its margins to increase. 

Currenc s
ability to operate in a cost-effective manner 

Currenc s
ability to control costs and expenses relating to its operations affects its profitability. The global remittance market is evolving
rapidly and new entrants to the market have driven market competition. This has a long term downward trend on the gross profit margin
for the whole industry. In order to generate growing operating profits, players have to expand their market scope and scale, while on
the other hand, control their operating costs. General and administrative expenses have historically represented the largest portion
of Currenc s total operating expenses. In particular, Currenc has invested significantly in hiring, training and retaining personnel
and expects to continue to make significant investments in personnel as it grows its business and enters new geographies and offers new
services. With the expansion of its business, Currenc expects its operating costs and expenses to continue to increase, including employee
compensation and benefits, marketing and branding and other costs and expenses. The salary level in the fintech industry in and around
Southeast Asia has generally increased in recent years, and Currenc believes it offers competitive wages and other benefits to recruit
and retain quality professionals. As Currenc is to explore and develop the B2C markets in Southeast Asia and Middle East, Currenc 
operating model allows it to centralize a number of functions, including technology development, operating system infrastructure building
as well as certain general and administrative services. This will allow Currenc to increase efficiencies across each of its businesses
and further increase its overall operating leverage. 

32 

Currenc s
partner network 

Currenc s
results of operations are affected by its ability to continue to maintain and build its collaborative network with partners. 

Tranglo s
business has a large portfolio of blue-chip customers across both its payment and airtime transfer segments, including WISE, SingTel,
Remitly, SBI Japan, Mastercard, WeChat Pay HK, Maxis, Etisalat and Ding. By continuing to develop Tranglo s technological infrastructure,
Currenc will be able to handle larger volumes of money transfer and settlement and open new business opportunities, both in money transfer
and airtime businesses, which in turn will allow it to attract more customers. The ability of Currenc to maintain and develop new partners
will have the direct impact on its business scope and scale. 

As
Currenc is to develop new B2C markets in Southeast Asia and Middle East, it could bring in new partners for Tranglo and WalletKu so as
to create significant business synergy and cross selling between different business segments of Currenc. 

Expansion
into new markets and acquisitions 

As
part of Currenc s strategy of expansion, it has in the past acquired, and may, from time to time, acquire businesses or interests
in businesses, including non-controlling interests, form joint ventures or create strategic alliances. In the future, Currenc will strive
to develop its B2C businesses in Southeast Asia and Middle East, focusing on various fintech and airtime trading services. It expects
to replicate and further develop the existing B2C eWallet, payment, remittance, airtime trading business model in Southeast Asian and
Middle East countries, in particular the Philippines, Indonesia, Cambodia, Vietnam, Abu Dhabi and Saudi Arabia. Currenc will continually
evaluate potential strategic acquisitions of businesses or products with the aim of expanding its user and revenue base, widening its
geographic coverage and increasing its product range. In addition, Currenc s ability to leverage its existing distribution network
to expand its product offering across its current markets and replicate its success in Southeast Asian and Middle East countries where
it operates will affect its growth and results of operations. It expects that its growth prospects will continue to be significantly
affected by its ability to expand its business in new and existing markets.

changes. This information should be read together with its consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this

Revenue
Analysis 

For
the three-month period ended September 30, 2024, Currenc revenue decreased by 11.0 to 11.3 million as compared to 12.7 million
for the three-month period ended September 30, 2023. The decrease was mainly due to a drastic decline of 22.1 in global airtime revenue.
The remittance revenue decreased as well due to a decline in TNG Asia s remittance business. 

For
the three-month period ended September 30, 2024, Tranglo processed 2.71 million remittance transactions with a total value of 1.21 billion,
which compares to 2.72 million transactions and a total value of 1.14 billion for the three-month period ended September 30, 2023. However,
as the overall take rate decreased by 7.5 during the period, Tranglo generated remittance revenues of 4.5 million for the three-month
period ended September 30, 2024, which was at relatively the same level of 4.6 million as the three-month period ended September 30,
2023. 

Due
to COVID and the Malaysian border being closed, Currenc global airtime business dropped by 34 , from 18.4 million for the year
ended December 31, 2022 to 12.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2023. For the three-month period ended September 30, 2024, Currenc 
global airtime revenue continued to decline by 22 to 2.3 million as compared to 2.95 million for the three-month period ended September
30, 2023. As more and more free Wi-Fi is now made available to the people in many Southeast Asian countries, especially in Malaysia and
Indonesia, there was a change in consumers behavior. In particular, the demand for Malaysia-Indonesia airtime transfers has been
declining which led to a continual decline in Tranglo s global airtime business in the years 2023 and 2024. Currenc does not expect
a turn around on its global airtime business in the near future. 

For
the three-month period ended September 30, 2024, the airtime unique user accounts decreased to 531,000, representing a decline of 25.9 
as compared to 716,500 for the three-month period ended September 30, 2023. The monthly average unique sending accounts also decreased
to 140,200 for the three-month period ended September 30, 2024, representing a decline of 22.1 as compared to 180,000 for the three-month
period ended September 30, 2023. 

Currenc 
Indonesian airtime revenue was 4 million for the three-month period ended September 30, 2024, which was at slightly higher as compared
to 3.4 million for the three-month period ended September 30, 2023. 

For
the three-month period ended September 30, 2024, Currenc recorded a gain of 0.1 million as Other income , which was immaterial.
For the three-month period ended September 30, 2023, Currenc also recorded a gain of 0.2 million as Other income . 

34 

Cost
of Revenue 

For
the three-month period ended September 30, 2024, Currenc cost of revenue was 8.1 million which was a decrease of 5.8 as compared to
that of 8.6 million for the three-month period ended September 30, 2023. Due to Currenc efforts at continually lowering the direct
costs for remittance, the direct costs for remittance revenue was 2.2 million for the three-month period ended September 30, 2024, which
represented a decrease of 18.5 as compared to 2.7 million for the three-month period ended September 30. Also, the direct costs for
global airtime revenue decreased substantially by 23.1 from 2.6 million to 2 million, which was in line with the 22.1 decline in
global airtime revenue. The direct costs for Indonesian airtime revenue increased by 18.8 from 3.2 million to 3.8 million during the
periods, which is also consistent to the 17.6 increase in Indonesian airtime revenue. 

The
amortization expense of Currenc was 0.2 million for the three-month period ended September 30, 2024, as compared to 0.3 million for
the three-month period ended September 30, 2023. Again, the amortization expenses were related only to the amortization expense of TNG
Asia. 

Operating
Expenses 

Currenc 
operating expenses increased sharply from 6.5 million for the three-month period ended September 30, 2023, to 19.1 million for the
three-month period ended September 30, 2024. The substantial increase was mainly due to an expense of 13.1 million in recognition of
the incentive shares granted to the employee upon the completion of merging with INFINT SPAC, and also an expense of 1 million in recognition
of shares granted to Roth for their services as the Capital Market Advisor. The staff costs remained relatively stable as Tranglo had
completed its manpower expansion plan, whereas the legal and professional costs declined slightly during the periods. 

Currenc 
legal and professional costs decreased to 0.2 million for the three-month period ended September 30, 2024, from 1.2 million for the
three-month period ended September 30, 2023. This was mainly due to lower extension fees paid for the extension of INFINT SPAC and majority
of the de-SPAC related legal and professional fee has been paid in prior periods. 

Other
income, net 

Other
income for the three-month period ended September 30, 2024 was mainly contributed by 14.7 million gain on divestiture of TNGA and GEA. 

Other
expenses 

Other
expenses were immaterial for the three-month periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. 

Finance
costs, net 

Finance
costs for the three-month period ended September 30, 2024 were mainly represented by PIPE issuance cost of 2.5 million, convertible
bond interest of 0.4 million and interest on loan converted from convertible bond of 0.3 million. 

Finance
costs for the three-month period ended September 30, 2024 were mainly represented by convertible bond interest of 0.4 million and interest
on loan converted from convertible bond of 0.5 million and amortization for the debt discount on convertible bond of 0.2 million. 

35 

Income
tax expenses 

The
effective tax rate of Tranglo for the three-month period ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was consistent with the statutory tax rate.

Revenue
Analysis 

For
the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024, Currenc revenue decreased by 11.3 to 35.4 million as compared to 39.9 million
for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2023. The decrease was mainly due to a drastic decline of 22.3 in global airtime revenue.
The remittance revenue decreased as well due to a decline in TNG Asia s remittance business. 

For
the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024, Tranglo processed 8.56 million remittance transactions with a total value of 3.92 billion,
which compares to 8.11 million transactions and a total value of 3.3 billion for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2023. However,
as the overall take rate decreased by 15.9 during the period, Tranglo generated remittance revenues of 14.3 million for the nine-month
period ended September 30, 2024, which was at relatively the same level as the nine-month period ended September 30, 2023. 

Tranglo s
global money transfer network has been expanding. For the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024, it has increased the number of
global money transfer corridors it serves to more than 80 corridors. The number of unique users increased to 1,024,100 as of September
30, 2024 from 866,800 as of September 30, 2023, and the number of global money transfer transactions increased from 8.11 million for
the nine-month period ended September 30, 2023 to 8.56 million for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024. The number of average
monthly unique sending accounts increased from 326,500 for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2023 to 358,900 for the nine-month
period ended September 30, 2024. 

Due
to COVID and the Malaysian border being closed, Currenc global airtime business dropped by 34 , from 18.4 million for the year
ended December 31, 2022 to 12.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2023. For the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024, Currenc 
global airtime revenue continued to decline by 22.3 to 7.3 million as compared to 9.4 million for the nine-month period ended September
30, 2023. As more and more free Wi-Fi is now made available to the people in many Southeast Asian countries, especially in Malaysia and
Indonesia, there was a change in consumers behavior. In particular, the demand for Malaysia-Indonesia airtime transfers has been
declining which led to a continual decline in Tranglo s global airtime business in the years 2023 and 2024. Currencdoes not expect
a turn around on its global airtime business in the near future. 

36 

For
the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024, the airtime unique user accounts decreased to 531,000, representing a decline of 25.9 
as compared to 716,500 for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2023. The monthly average unique sending accounts also decreased
to 140,200 for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024, representing a decline of 22.1 as compared to 180,000 for the nine-month
period ended September 30, 2023. 

Seamless 
Indonesian airtime revenue was 10.2 million for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024, which was a slight decrease of 2.9 
as compared to 10.5 million for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2023. 

For
the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024, Currenc recorded a gain of 0.7 million as Other income , of which
Tranglo contributed a Forex gain of 0.6 million. For the nine-month period ended September 30, 2023, Currenc recorded a gain of
 0.4 million as Other income , of which Tranglo contributed a Forex gain of 0.8 million whereas TNG Asia contributed a
Forex loss of 0.1 million as TNG Asia launched a negative Forex spreads rate of 0.07 . 

Cost
of Revenue 

For
the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024, Currenc cost of revenue was 24.0 million which was a decrease of 10.1 as compared to
that of 26.7 million for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2023. Due to Currenc efforts at continually lowering the direct
costs for remittance, the direct costs for remittance revenue was 7.7 million for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024, which
represented a decrease of 9.4 as compared to 8.5 million for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2023, despite a substantial
increase of TPV by 18.8 during the two periods. Also, the direct costs for global airtime revenue decreased substantially by 24.1 from
 8.3 million to 6.3 million, which was in line with the 22.3 decline in global airtime revenue. The direct costs for Indonesian airtime
revenue has increased slightly from 9.6 million to 9.7 million during the periods. 

The
amortization expense of Currenc was 1.0 million for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024, as compared to 1.1 million for
the nine-month period ended September 30, 2023. Again, the amortization expenses were related only to the amortization expense of TNG
Asia. 

Operating
Expenses 

Currenc 
operating expenses increased sharply from 18.8 million for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2023, to 30.0 million for the
nine-month period ended September 30, 2024. The substantial increase was mainly due to an expense of 13.1 million in recognition of
the incentive shares granted to the employee upon the completion of merging with INFINT SPAC, and also an expense of 1 million in recognition
of shares granted to Roth for their services as the Capital Market Advisor. The staff costs remained relatively stable as Tranglo had
completed its manpower expansion plan, whereas the legal and professional costs declined slightly during the periods. 

Currenc 
legal and professional costs decreased to 1.5 million for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024, from 3.5 million for the
nine-month period ended September 30, 2023. This was mainly due to lower extension fees paid for the extension of INFINT SPAC. 

Other
income, net 

Other
income, net for the nine- month period ended September 30, 2024 was mainly contributed by 14.7 million gain on divestiture of TNGA and
GEA. 

Other
expenses 

Other
expenses were immaterial for the nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. 

Finance

bond interest of 1.3 million and interest on loan converted from convertible bond of 1.4 million and interest paid to Ripple of 0.6
million for ODL prefunding purposes. 

Finance
costs for the nine months period ended September 30, 2023, finance costs were mainly represented by convertible bond interest.

Income
tax expenses 

The
effective tax rate of Tranglo for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was consistent with the statutory tax rate. 

Non-GAAP
Financial Measures 

To
supplement Currenc consolidated financial statements, which are prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP, it uses EBITDA,
a non-GAAP financial measure as described below, to understand and evaluate its core operating performance. These non-GAAP financial
measures, which may differ from similarly titled measures used by other companies, are presented to enhance investors overall
understanding of its financial performance and should not be considered a substitute for, or superior to, the financial information prepared
and presented in accordance with GAAP. 

EBITDA
is defined as net loss before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization. Currenc believes that EBITDA provides useful information
to investors and others in understanding and evaluating its operating results. These non-GAAP financial measures eliminate the impact
of items that Currenc does not consider indicative of the performance of its business. While Currenc believes that these non-GAAP financial
measures are useful in evaluating its business, this information should be considered as supplemental in nature and is not meant as a
substitute for the related financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP. 

The
table below presents a reconciliation of EBITDA to net loss, the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure, for the periods indicated.

For
the three-month period ended September 30, 2023, Currenc had an EBIT loss of 2.1 million and an EBITDA loss of 1.2 million. For
the three-month period ended September 30, 2024, the EBIT loss decreased to 1.1 million and the EBITDA loss was 0.2 million for
the three-month period ended September 30, 2024. The slight decrease in EBIT and EBITDA losses in the first three months of 2024 was
mainly due to 14.7 million gain on divestiture of TNGA and GEA, offset by an expense of 13.1 million in recognition of the
incentive shares granted to employees upon the completion of merging with INFINT SPAC, as well as an expense of 1 million in
recognition of shares granted to Roth for their services as the Capital Market Advisor after the merging with INFINT
SPAC. 

For
the three-month period ended September 30, 2024, Tranglo recorded an EBIT profit of 0.05 million, which represented a decrease as compared
to 0.4 million for the three-month period ended September 30, 2023. This was due to an improvement in Tranglo s gross profit margin
in its remittance business as Tranglo succeeded in containing its direct remittance payout costs. Despite that there was a 34 decline
in Tranglo s global airtime revenue, Tranglo managed to maintain a positive EBIT. For the three-month period ended September 30,
2024, the EBIT loss of TNG Asia and GEA combined was 0.8 million, as compared to 0.4 million for the three-month period ended September
30, 2023. WalletKu recorded an EBIT loss of 0.04 million for the three-month period ended September 30, 2024 which compared to an EBIT
loss of 0.2 million for the three-month period ended September 30, 2023.

For

EBIT loss decreased to 3.4 million and the EBITDA loss was 0.6 million for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024. The
decrease in EBIT and EBITDA losses in the first nine months of 2024 was mainly due to 14.7 million gain on divestiture of TNGA and
GEA, offset by an expense of 13.1 million in recognition of the incentive shares granted to employees upon the completion of
merging with INFINT SPAC, as well as an expense of 1 million in recognition of shares granted to Roth for their services as the
Capital Market Advisor after the merging with INFINT SPAC. 

For
the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024, Tranglo recorded an EBIT profit of 2.0 million, which represented a slight decrease
as compared to 2.1 million for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2023. This was due to a substantial improvement in Tranglo s
gross profit margin in its remittance business as Tranglo succeeded in containing its direct remittance payout costs. Despite that there
was a 22.3 decline in Tranglo s global airtime revenue, Tranglo managed to maintain its EBIT profit. For the
nine-month period ended September 30, 2024, the EBIT loss of TNG Asia and GEA combined was 2.0 million, as compared to 1.6 million
for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2023. WalletKu recorded an EBIT loss of 0.3 million for the nine-month period ended September
30, 2024 which compared to an EBIT loss of 0.4 million for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2023.

Going Concern 

The Company s unaudited consolidated financial
statements have been prepared using the going concern basis of accounting, which contemplates the realization of assets and the satisfaction
of liabilities in the normal course of business. As of September 30, 2024, the Company had cash balances of 49.1 million, a working capital
deficit of 54.1 million and net capital deficit 22.7 million. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company had a net loss
of 11.3 million and net cash used in operating activities of 11.7 million. Net cash used in investing activities was 0.4 million. Net
cash generated from financing activities was 2.2 million, resulting principally from proceeds of borrowings. 

While the Company believes that it will
be able to continue to grow the Company s revenue base and control expenditures, there is no assurance that it will be able to
achieve these goals. As a result, the Company continually monitors its capital structure and operating plans and evaluates various potential
funding alternatives that may be needed to finance the Company s business development activities, general and administrative expenses
and growth strategy. 

Liquidity

Recent
Accounting Pronouncements 

From
time to time, new accounting pronouncements are issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB or other standard
setting bodies and adopted by the Company as of the specified effective date. Unless otherwise discussed, the impact of recently issued
standards that are not yet effective are not expected to have a material impact on the Company s financial position or results
of operations upon adoption. 

In
November 2023, the Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB issued Accounting Standard Update ASU No.
2023-07, Segment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures, which requires an enhanced disclosure of significant
segment expenses on an annual and interim basis. This guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023, and interim
periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024. Early adoption is permitted. Upon adoption, the guidance should be applied
retrospectively to all prior periods presented in the financial statements. The Company does not expect the adoption of this guidance
to have a material impact on our financial statements. 

Internal
Control Over Financial Reporting 

Prior to the Business Combination, Seamless was a private company with limited accounting personnel and other resources with which to address its internal control and
procedures over financial reporting. As a company with less than 1.235 billion in revenue for its last fiscal year, Currenc
qualifies as an emerging growth company pursuant to the JOBS Act. An emerging growth company may take advantage of
specified reduced reporting and other requirements that are otherwise applicable generally to public companies. These provisions
include exemption from the auditor attestation requirement under Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 in the assessment of
the emerging growth company s internal control over financial reporting. 

Critical
Accounting Policies and Estimates 

Currenc
prepares its consolidated financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP. In doing so, it has to make estimates and assumptions that
affect its reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses, as well as related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities.
To the extent that there are material differences between these estimates and actual results, Currenc financial condition or operating
results and margins would be affected. Currenc bases its estimates on past experience and other assumptions that it believes are reasonable
under the circumstances, and it evaluates these estimates on an ongoing basis. The following is a discussion of the accounting policies
we apply that are considered to involve a higher degree of judgment in their application. 

43 

Revenue
Recognition 

The
Company complies with ASC 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers . 

Revenue
from contracts with customers is measured based on the consideration specified in a contract with a customer in exchange for transferring
goods or services to a customer net of sales and service tax, returns, rebates and discounts. The Company recognizes revenue when (or
as) it transfers control over a product or service to its customer. An asset is transferred when (or as) the customer obtains control
of the asset. Depending on the substance of the contract, revenue is recognized when the performance obligation is satisfied, which may
be at a point in time or over time. 

Contract
assets represent the Company s right to consideration for performance obligations that have been fulfilled but for which the customer
has not been billed as of the balance sheet date. 

Remittance
services revenue 

Revenue
from contracts with customers on service charges and gain/loss on foreign exchange arising from remittance activities are recognized
upon the processing and execution of the international money transfer transactions. Remittance services are further divided into Fiat
Currency Prefunded Remittance Service and XRP Prefunded Remittance Service. Management has considered these two services to be two product
lines. 

The
customers of the remittance services are financial institutions (referred to as Remittance Partners ). Remittance Partners
who use the fiat currency prefunding option for their remittance business with the Company are referred to as Fiat Currency Prefunded
Remittance Partners, whereas customers who choose the XRP Prefunding mode are referred to as XRP Prefunded Remittance Partners. 

Fiat
Currency Prefunded Remittance Service 

The
Company earns revenue by charging their customers a Fiat Currency Prefunded Remittance Fee when they use the Company s platform
to transfer money to a beneficiary in another country. These Fiat Currency Prefunded Remittance Fees are fixed and specific for every
country s currency and are charged at the point-in-time of executing this performance obligation. Prior to delivering cash to the
customer s beneficiary, the customer must directly provide the Company with prefunding (i.e., the cash to be remitted to the beneficiary).
This is the traditional prefunding process, which the Company describes as Fiat Currency Prefunded Remittance Service. 

XRP
Prefunded Remittance Service 

Unlike
the Fiat Currency Prefunded Remittance Service, the customer obtains prefunding through Ripple Solution offered by Ripple Lab Inc. (see
Note 9 in the Company s consolidated financial statements) with the XRP Prefunded Remittance Service. Ripple supplies the customer
with the XRP equivalent of the requested prefunding. The Company subsequently liquidates this XRP on Ripple s behalf, and the fiat
currency obtained as a result of the liquidation process is transferred to the customer s beneficiary. Customers who prefund their
remittance service with XRP must enter into an agreement with Ripple and undergo stringent credit checks in order to get XRP prefunding
and use Ripple s platform. The Company charges their customers an XRP Prefunded Remittance Service Fee when the money is transferred
to the customer s beneficiary. 

For
both the XRP Prefunded and Fiat Currency Prefunded Remittance Services, the Company has no obligations to the customer in terms of guarantees,
warranties or other similar obligations. There are also no significant payment terms involved as the Company obtains their fees shortly
after charging their customers.

Sales
WalletKu Modern Channel 

Revenue
from the sale of goods is recognized at the point in time when the Company satisfies its performance obligation, which is upon delivery
of the goods to customer. The credit terms are typically 3-7 days. 

Sales
of airtime 

Revenue
from airtime sold is recognized when the relevant international airtime transfer or reload request is processed and executed. 

Other
services 

Revenue
from contracts with customers on other services is recognized as and when services are rendered. 

Goodwill
Impairment 

Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase
price over the estimated fair value of net tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired in a business combination. The Company
performs goodwill impairment test on annual basis and more frequently upon the occurrence of certain events as defined by ASC 350. Goodwill
is impaired when the carrying value of the reporting units exceeds its fair value. The Company first assesses qualitative factors to determine
whether events or circumstances indicate that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying
amount. Based on the qualitative assessment, if it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than the carrying
amount, the quantitative impairment test is performed. 

The Company estimates the fair value of the reporting
unit using a discounted cash flow approach. Significant management judgment and estimation are involved in forecasting the amount and
timing of expected future cash flows and the underlying assumptions used in the discounted cash flow approach to determine the fair value
of the reporting unit. As the fair values of the reporting units is not less than carrying amount, no impairment was recorded for the
period ended September 30, 2024 and year ended December 31, 2023. 

Emerging
Growth Company and Smaller Reporting Company Status 

The
Company is an emerging growth company, as defined in Section 2(a) of the Securities Act, as modified by the Jumpstart Our
Business Startups Act of 2012 (the JOBS Act ), and it may take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements
that are applicable to other public companies that are not emerging growth companies including, but not limited to, not being required
to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, reduced disclosure obligations regarding
executive compensation in its periodic reports and proxy statements, and exemptions from the requirements of holding a nonbinding advisory
vote on executive compensation and shareholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. 

Further,
Section 102(b)(1) of the JOBS Act exempts emerging growth companies from being required to comply with new or revised financial accounting
standards until private companies (that is, those that have not had a Securities Act registration statement declared effective or do
not have a class of securities registered under the Exchange Act) are required to comply with the new or revised financial accounting
standards. The JOBS Act provides that a company can elect to opt out of the extended transition period and comply with the requirements
that apply to non-emerging growth companies but any such election to opt out is irrevocable. The Company has elected not to opt out of
such extended transition period which means that when a standard is issued or revised and it has different application dates for public
or private companies, the Company, as an emerging growth company, can adopt the new or revised standard at the time private companies
adopt the new or revised standard. This may make comparison of the Company s financial statements with another public company which
is neither an emerging growth company nor an emerging growth company which has opted out of using the extended transition period difficult
or impossible because of the potential differences in accounting standards used. 

Additionally,
we are a smaller reporting company as defined in Item 10(f)(1) of Regulation S-K. Smaller reporting companies may take
advantage of certain reduced disclosure obligations, including, among other things, providing only two years of audited consolidated
financial statements. 

Item
3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk. 

We
are a smaller reporting company as defined by Rule 12b-2 of the Exchange Act and are not required to provide the information otherwise
required under this item. 

Item
4. Controls and Procedures. 

Evaluation
of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

As
of the end of our quarter ended September 30, 2024, an evaluation of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures 
(as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934) was carried out by our management,
with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer (CEO) and Chief Financial Officer (CFO). Based upon that evaluation, the CEO and
CFO have concluded that as of the end of the quarter ended September 30, 2024, our disclosure controls and procedures are not effective
due to the material weakness in internal controls over financial reporting related to the restatement described in Note 9 to our amendment
to the Form 10-Q for the quarter ended June 30, 2023 financial statements filed with the SEC on August 4, 2023. The material weakness
specifically related to the subsequent measurement of complex financial instruments. 

45 

To
address this material weakness, management has devoted, and plans to continue to devote significant effort and resources to the remediation
and improvement of its internal control over financial reporting and to provide processes and controls over the internal communication
with the Company and the financial advisors. While we have processes to identify and appropriately apply applicable accounting requirements,
we plan to enhance these processes to better evaluate our research and understanding of the nuances of the complex accounting instruments
that apply to our financial statements. We plan to include providing enhanced access to accounting literature, research materials and
documents with whom we consult regarding complex accounting applications. The elements of our remediation plan can only be accomplished
over time, and we can offer no assurance that these initiatives will ultimately have the intended effects. Other than this issue, our
disclosure controls and procedures were effective at a reasonable assurance level and, accordingly, provided reasonable assurance that
the information requirement to be disclosed by us in reports filed under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported
within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms. 

Changes
in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 

There
was no change in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the fiscal quarter ended September 30, 2024, covered
by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control
over financial reporting. 

PART
II - OTHER INFORMATION 

Item
1. Legal Proceedings. 

See NOTE 12 COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES. 

Item
1A. Risk Factors. 

As
a result of closing of the Business Combination on August 30, 2024, the risk factors previously disclosed Part I, Item 1A of our Annual
Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023 no longer apply. For risk factors relating to our business following
the Business Combination, please refer to the section Risk Factors in the Proxy Statement/Prospectus with respect to the
Business Combination, filed with the SEC on July 12, 2024 as well as risk factors in our resale Prospectus, filed with the SEC on September
30, 2024. Any of these factors could result in a significant or material adverse effect on the Company s results of operations
or financial condition. Additional risk factors not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also impair the Company s
business or results of operations. We may disclose changes to such factors or disclose additional factors from time to time in the Company s
future filings with the SEC. 

Item
2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds. 

(a)
During the quarter ended September 30, 2024, there were no unregistered sales of our securities that were not reported in a Current Report
on Form 8-K.

At the closing of the Business Combination, 56.0 million remained in the Company s trust account, of which 54.8 million was used
to pay public shareholders who exercised redemption rights, 0.8 million was used to pay outstanding fees and expenses of INFINT incurred
in connection with the Business Combination, and 0.3 million was used to partially repay deferred underwriting fees, with no balance
remaining for working capital and general corporate purposes of Currenc. 

Simultaneous
with the closing of the Business Combination, Currenc completed the PIPE Offering, resulted in gross proceeds of 1.75 million, of which
 0.8 million was used to pay outstanding fees and expenses of INFINT, 0.5 million was used to pay a directors and officers insurance
premium, and 0.4 million was used to pay outstanding fees and expenses of Seamless.
