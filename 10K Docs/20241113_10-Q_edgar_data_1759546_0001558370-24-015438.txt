These forward-looking statements can be identified by the use of forward-looking terminology, including the words believes, estimates, anticipates, expects, intends, plans, may, will, potential, projects, predicts, continue, could or should, or, in each case, their negative or other variations or comparable terminology, although not all forward-looking statements are accompanied by such terms. There can be no assurance that actual results will not materially differ from expectations. Such statements include, but are not limited to, any statements regarding our intentions, beliefs or current expectations concerning, among other things, our results of operations, financial condition, liquidity, financial or operational prospects, growth, strategies, and possible business combinations and the financing thereof, and related matters, and any other statements that are not statements of current or historical facts. By their nature, forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties because they relate to events and depend on circumstances that may or may not occur in the future. Forward-looking statements are based upon assumptions and are not guarantees of future performance. Actual results may differ materially from those contained in forward-looking statements due to various factors, including, but not limited to: limited management, labor, and financial resources; our reliance upon third parties for key aspects of our business; our ability to maintain adequate internal controls; our ability to maintain a market in our securities; our ability to continue as a going concern; and our ability obtain financing, if and when needed, on terms that are acceptable, as well as those risks and factors described in the Risk Factors section of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 and our Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2024 and for the three and six months ended June 30, 2024.

 Nu Ride Inc. f/k/a Lordstown Motors Corp. NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (unaudited) million in cash in a transaction that closed on October 27, 2023 (discussed below under Sale of Certain Assets to LandX ). The Company s remaining assets following the closing of the LandX Asset Purchase Agreement consist largely of cash on hand, the claims asserted in the Foxconn Litigation (as defined below), claims that the Company may have against other parties, as well as net operating loss NOL carryforwards and other tax attributes. Upon emergence from bankruptcy, the near-term operations of the Company consist of (a) claims administration under the Second Modified First Amended Joint Plan of Lordstown Motors Corp. and Its Affiliated Debtors (the Plan ), (b) addressing the Foxconn Litigation, (c) prosecuting, pursuing, compromising, settling, or otherwise disposing of other retained causes of action, (d) defending the Company against any counterclaims and (e) filing Exchange Act reports and satisfying other regulatory requirements. In the future, the Company may explore potential business opportunities, including strategic alternatives or business combinations, including those designed to maximize the value of the Company s NOLs. No assurances can be made that the Company will be successful in prosecuting any claim or cause of action or that any strategic alternative or business combination will be identified and/or would result in profitable operations or the ability to realize any value from the NOLs. The Company anticipates that the prosecution of claims and causes of action and the evaluation and pursuit of potential strategic alternatives will be costly, complex, and risky. As of the date of this report, the Company has neither entered into a definitive agreement with any party, nor has the Company engaged in any specific discussions with any potential business combination candidate regarding business opportunities. Unless the context indicates otherwise, all shares of the Company s Class A common stock are presented after giving effect to the 1: 15 reverse stock split of the outstanding Class A common stock, which became effective on May 24, 2023. Sale of Certain Assets to LandX On September 29, 2023, the Company entered into an Asset Purchase Agreement (the LandX Asset Purchase Agreement with LAS Capital LLC and Mr. Stephen S. Burns, an individual, as guarantor of certain obligations of LAS Capital under the LandX Asset Purchase Agreement.

 million in cash. Upon consummation of the sale, the Company s investment banker became entitled to a transaction fee of million after crediting certain other fees. The transaction fee was paid in January 2024, with no further amounts payable. Emergence From Bankruptcy On September 1, 2023, the Debtors filed a Joint Plan of Lordstown Motors Corp. and Its Affiliated Debtors and a related proposed disclosure statement, which were amended and modified on each of October 24, 2023, October 29, 2023, and October 30, 2023. On January 31, 2024, the Debtors filed the Plan. The modifications to the Plan since the previously filed version incorporated, among other things, a settlement (the Ohio Securities Litigation Settlement of claims against the Debtors and certain directors and officers of the Debtors that were serving in such roles as of December 12, 2023, asserted in, or on the same or similar basis as those claims asserted in, the securities class action captioned In re Lordstown Motors Corp. Securities Litigation (the Ohio Securities Litigation ). The Plan also included, as a condition to confirmation of the Plan, that the SEC approve an offer of settlement submitted by the Debtors to resolve the SEC Claim (as defined below). On March 5, 2024, the Bankruptcy Court entered a confirmation order confirming the Plan. Following the entry of the confirmation order and all conditions to effectiveness of the Plan being satisfied, the Debtors emerged from bankruptcy on March 14, 2024 under the name Nu Ride Inc. Upon emergence, the SEC Claim was deemed withdrawn pursuant to the terms of the settlement with the SEC and the confirmation order. Upon emergence, a new Board of Directors was appointed pursuant to the Plan and all remaining full-time employees, including the Company s pre-emergence executive officers, were terminated. Some of those employees continue to provide services to the Company as consultants. The Company s Chief Executive Officer, who is its sole executive officer, was elected by the new Board of Directors in accordance with the Plan, as of the Company s emergence. Upon emergence, the Company s primary operations are: (i) resolving claims filed in the bankruptcy, (ii) prosecuting the Foxconn Litigation, (iii) pursuing, compromising, settling or otherwise disposing of other retained causes of action of the Company, and (iv) identifying potential transactions, including business combinations, or otherwise, that could create value, including through permitting the Company to make use of the NOLs, if preserved. Foxconn Litigation On June 27, 2023, the Company commenced an adversary proceeding against Foxconn (the Foxconn Litigation in the Bankruptcy Court seeking relief for fraudulent and tortious conduct as well as breaches of the Investment Agreement (as defined below) and other agreements, the parties joint venture agreement, the Foxconn APA (as defined below), and the CMA (as defined below) that the Company believes were committed by Foxconn. As set forth in the complaint relating to the adversary proceeding, the Company believes Foxconn s actions have caused substantial harm to the Company s operations and prospects and caused significant damages. On September 29, 2023, Foxconn filed a motion to dismiss all counts of the Foxconn Litigation and brief in support of the same (the Foxconn Adversary Motion to Dismiss ), asserting that all of the Company s claims are subject to binding arbitration provisions and that the Company has failed to state a claim for relief. The Company believes that the Foxconn Adversary Motion to Dismiss is without merit and, on November 6, 2023, the Company filed an opposition to Foxconn s Adversary Motion to Dismiss. Foxconn filed a reply in support of the Foxconn Adversary Motion to Dismiss on November 30, 2023. On December 7, 2023, the Company and its equity committee (the Equity Committee filed a notice of completion of briefing, which provided that

 of the Company s claims survived the motion to dismiss on the grounds that the Company pled viable claims against Foxconn and the claims were not subject to mandatory arbitration. The Court also dismissed of the Company s claims in favor of arbitration. The Company intends to vigorously pursue this litigation. Any net proceeds from the Foxconn Litigation may enhance the recoveries for holders of claims and equity interests of shareholders Interests ), as set forth in the Plan. However, no assurances can be provided as to the Company having sufficient resources to pursue the Foxconn Litigation, the outcome or recoveries, if any. See Note 8 Commitments and Contingencies Foxconn Litigation for additional information. Basis of Presentation and Principles of Consolidation The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated interim financial statements are presented in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America GAAP for interim financial statements and the instructions to the Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and Rule 8-03 of Regulation S-X. The unaudited condensed consolidated interim financial statements include the accounts and operations of the Company and its wholly owned subsidiary. All intercompany accounts and transactions are eliminated upon consolidation. Certain information and footnote disclosures normally included in financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP have been condensed or omitted pursuant to these rules and regulations. Accordingly, these unaudited condensed consolidated interim financial statements should be read in conjunction with our audited consolidated financial statements and related notes included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. In the opinion of management, these unaudited condensed consolidated interim financial statements reflect all adjustments necessary for a fair presentation of our interim financial results. All such adjustments are of a normal and recurring nature. The results of operations for any interim period are not indicative of results for the full fiscal year. The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated interim financial statements include our accounts and those of our controlled subsidiaries. Liquidity and Going Concern The accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming the Company will continue as a going concern, which presumes the Company will continue in operation for one year after the date these condensed consolidated financial statements are issued and will be able to realize its assets and discharge its liabilities and commitments in the ordinary course of business. In accordance with Accounting Standards Codification ("ASC") 205-40, Going Concern , the Company has evaluated whether there are any conditions and events, considered in the aggregate, that raise substantial doubt about the Company's ability to continue as a going concern for one year from the date these condensed consolidated financial statements are issued. The Company had cash and cash equivalents of approximately million, excluding restricted cash of approximately million, an accumulated deficit of billion at September 30, 2024, net income of million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, and a net loss of million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. As a result of the Company s accumulated deficit, lack of any immediate sources of revenue, and the risks and uncertainties related to the Company s ability to successfully resolve known and unknown claims that are or may be filed against us, substantial doubt exists regarding our ability to continue as a going concern. The Company s liquidity and ability to continue as a going concern is dependent upon, among other things: (i) the resolution of significant contingent and other claims, liabilities and (ii) the outcome of the Company s efforts to realize value, if any, from its retained causes of action, including the Foxconn Litigation, and other remaining assets. The Company intends to explore potential business opportunities,

There was further impairment loss related to the valuation of assets held for sale during the three months ended September 30, 2023. However, for the quarter ended September 30, 2023, the Company recognized an impairment charge of million to adjust the carrying value of its right of use assets.

The liquidation preference, plus accrued dividends is presented as Mezzanine Equity within the Company s Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet. As of September 30, 2024, the Company did not consider a change of control to be probable. The Company notes that there is significant uncertainty regarding the outcome of the Foxconn Litigation which may impact the foregoing determination, and that the Company can provide no assurance regarding such determination. million shares, consisting of (i) million shares of Class A common stock and (ii) million shares of preferred stock, each with a par value of .

The Company has been subject to extensive pending and threatened legal proceedings arising in the ordinary course of business and has already incurred, and expects to continue to incur, significant legal expenses in defending against these claims. The Company sought and achieved resolution of many of these matters as part of the Chapter 11 Cases and has and may in the future enter into further discussions regarding settlement of these matters and may enter into settlement agreements if it believes it is in the best interest of the Company s stakeholders. The Company records a liability for loss contingencies in the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements when a loss is known or considered probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated. Legal fees and costs of litigation, settlement by the Company or adverse decisions with respect to the matters disclosed may result in a liability that is not insured or that is in excess of insurance coverage and could significantly exceed our current accrual and ability to pay and be, individually or in the aggregate, material to the Company s consolidated results of operations, financial condition or cash flows, and diminish or eliminate any assets available for any distribution to creditors and Interest holders. The filing of the Chapter 11 Cases resulted in an initial automatic stay of legal proceedings against the Company, as further described below. On July 27, 2023, the Bankruptcy Court modified the automatic stay that was in effect at the time of filing the Chapter 11 Cases to allow the Karma Action (defined below) to proceed against the Company in the District Court (defined below) and that matter was settled, as further described below. With respect to the stockholder derivative suits filed on behalf of the Company against certain of its officers and directors and certain former DiamondPeak directors prior to the Chapter 11 Cases, the derivative claims asserted in those suits became the property of the Company.

 putative class action lawsuits were filed against former DiamondPeak directors and DiamondPeak Sponsor LLC on December 8 and 13, 2021 in the Delaware Court of Chancery Hebert v. Hamamoto, et al. (C.A. No. 2021-1066); and Amin v Hamamoto, et al. (C.A. No. 2021-1085)) (collectively, the Delaware Class Action Litigation ). The plaintiffs purport to represent a class of investors in DiamondPeak and assert breach of fiduciary duty claims based on allegations that the defendants made or failed to prevent alleged misrepresentations regarding vehicle pre-orders and production timeline, and that but for those allegedly false and misleading disclosures, the plaintiffs would have exercised a right to redeem their shares prior to the de-SPAC transaction. On February 9, 2023, the parties filed a stipulation and proposed order consolidating the two putative class action lawsuits, appointing Hebert and Amin as co-lead plaintiffs, appointing Bernstein Litowitz Berger Grossmann LLP and Pomerantz LLP as co-lead counsel and setting a briefing schedule for the motions to dismiss and motions to stay.

On June 9, 2023, the court granted in part and denied in part the plaintiffs motion to compel regarding the appropriate scope of the Company s response to the subpoena. On July 5, 2023, in the Chapter 11 Cases, the Company filed (i) an adversary complaint seeking injunctive relief to extend the automatic stay to the plaintiffs in the Delaware Class Action Litigation, initiating the adversary proceeding captioned Lordstown Motors Corp. v. Amin , Adv. Proc. No. 23-50428 (Bankr. D. Del.) and (ii) a motion and brief in support thereof, seeking a preliminary injunction extending the automatic stay to the Delaware Class Action Litigation.

The Court also dismissed of the Company s claims in favor of arbitration. The Company intends to vigorously pursue this litigation. The Post-Petition Securities Action On July 26, 2023, a putative class action lawsuit was filed in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Ohio by Bandol Lim Plaintiff Lim ), individually and on behalf of other stockholders asserting violations of Section 10(b), Section 20(a) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 thereunder relating to the Company s disclosure regarding its relationship with Foxconn and the Foxconn Transactions (the Post-Petition Securities Action ).

Defendants dispute the allegations and intend to vigorously defend against the suit. None of the Debtors is named as a Defendant in the Post-Petition Securities Action. Plaintiff Lim and RIDE Investor Group have each filed motions for appointment as lead plaintiff in the Post-Petition Securities Action and those motions remain pending as of the date of this filing. Separately, each of the members of the RIDE Investor Group filed proofs of claim (the RIDE Proofs of Claims against the Company, purportedly on behalf of themselves and the putative class in the Post-Petition Securities Action, in an unliquidated amount. The RIDE Investor Group has not sought authority from the Bankruptcy Court to file its purported class proofs of claim. The Debtors dispute, each of the RIDE Proofs of Claim, and further dispute that the members of the Ride Investment Group had authority to file proofs of claim on behalf of the putative class in the Post-Petition Securities Action. Messrs. Hightower, Kroll, and Ninivaggi contend that they are both insureds under the directors and officers insurance policies of the Debtors that are currently in effect and have been granted relief from the automatic stay with respect to the Company to seek advancement and payment of expenses relating to the Post-Petition Securities Action under such policies. The Plan constituted an objection to each of the RIDE Proofs of Claim. To the extent any of the RIDE Claims are Allowed, the Plan provides for the treatment of Claims filed against the Debtors on the same or similar basis as those set forth in the Post-Petition Securities Action to limit recoveries (if any) from the Debtors on account of such Claims to available insurance. The Debtors dispute the merits of any such claims.

Forward-looking statements in this MD A are not guarantees of future performance and may involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected. Refer to the "Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements" and Part II Item 1A. Risk Factors for a discussion of these risks and uncertainties, including without limitation, with respect to the Chapter 11 Cases, our emergence from bankruptcy and our liquidity, capital resources and financial condition. As previously disclosed, on June 27, 2023, Lordstown Motors Corp. and its subsidiaries commenced voluntary proceedings under chapter 11 (the Chapter 11 Cases of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the District of Delaware (the Bankruptcy Court ). On September 1, 2023, we filed with the Bankruptcy Court a plan of reorganization and related disclosure statement, which were amended and modified on each of October 24, 2023, October 29, 2023, and October 30, 2023 (as amended, the Proposed Plan ). On November 1, 2023, the Bankruptcy Court entered the Disclosure Statement Order and, thereafter, we solicited votes from their creditors and shareholders for approval of the Proposed Plan. On January 31, 2024, we filed the as-approved Proposed Plan with the Bankruptcy Court. On March 5, 2024, the Bankruptcy Court entered a confirmation order confirming the Proposed Plan (as confirmed, the Plan ). Following the entry of the confirmation order and all conditions to effectiveness of the Plan being satisfied, we emerged from bankruptcy on March 14, 2024 under the name Nu Ride Inc. The Bankruptcy Court established October 10, 2023, as the general bar date for all creditors (except governmental entities) to file their proofs of claim or interest, and December 26, 2023, as the bar date for all governmental entities, which was extended until January 5, 2024, in the case of the SEC. In addition, the deadline for parties to file proofs of claim arising from the Debtors rejection of an executory contract or unexpired lease is the later of (a) the general bar date or the governmental bar date, as applicable, and (b) 5:00 p.m. (ET) on the date that is 30 days after the service of an order of the Bankruptcy Court authorizing the Debtors rejection of the applicable executory contract or unexpired lease. Finally, the deadline for parties to file administrative claims against the Debtors was April 15, 2024. Claimants may have the ability to amend their proofs of claim that could significantly increase the total claims, beyond our estimates or reserve. Furthermore, proofs of claim have been filed asserting unliquidated damages or claims in respect of certain indemnifications or otherwise, that we may not be able to estimate, or may be materially more than we estimate. Upon emergence: (i) the Foxconn Litigation and other retained causes of action of the Company were preserved and may be prosecuted; (ii) claims filed in the bankruptcy will continue to be resolved pursuant to the claims resolution process with allowed claims being treated in accordance with the Plan; (iii) distributions to holders of allowed claims and allowed Interests will be made subject to the provisions of the Plan of Reorganization, and (iv) we will continue to conduct business and may enter into transactions, including business combinations, or otherwise, that could permit the Company to create value, including through use of the NOLs. Upon emergence, a new Board of Directors was appointed pursuant to the Plan and all remaining full-time employees, including the Company s pre-emergence executive officers, were terminated. The Board of Directors oversees and directs the administration of the Company s operations, in accordance with the Plan. Some of those employees continue to provide services to the Company as consultants. Our Chief Executive Officer, who is the sole executive officer, was elected by the new Board of Directors in accordance with the Plan, as of the date we emerged from bankruptcy.

 Net Sales and Cost of Sales As a result of the Chapter 11 Cases, production of the Endurance ended in June 2023. Upon emergence from bankruptcy as a shell company, there were no sales or cost of sales during the three months ended September 30, 2024. The Company completed homologation and testing and received required certifications enabling sales to begin in the fourth quarter of 2022. As a result of filing for bankruptcy protection, there were no sales during the three months ended September 30, 2023. Selling, General and Administrative Expense Selling, general and administration expenses SG A totaled 2.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to a credit of 2.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. With the Chapter 11 Cases commencing in June 2023, our SG A expense is not comparable on a year-over-year basis. Legal and professional fees made up almost the entire SG A expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2024. The credit to selling, general and administration expenses SG A of 2.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023 reflects the reduction of 10.0 million in legal settlement accruals, partially offset by 6.3 million in personnel and professional fees, and 2.2 million in insurance premium amortization. Research and Development Expense As a result of the actions taken in connection with the Chapter 11 Cases, there were no research and development R D expenses during the three months ended September 30, 2024. Research and development R D expenses during the three months ended September 30, 2023, principally represent personnel costs that have been consistently allocated to R D, and our remaining personnel, most of whom were subject to separation notice periods. R D expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2023, were 5.7 million during the three months ended September 30, 2023, consisting of 4.7 million in personnel costs, and 0.7 million in prototype and engineering costs, consisting principally of engineering software amortization. Legal settlement and litigation charges (benefit), net Legal settlement and litigation charges (benefit), net represents adjustments to accrued liabilities subject to compromise from claims as a result of the final settlement of claims. Given that claims began to be settled in 2024, no legal settlement and litigation charges (benefit) was recorded during the three months ended September 30, 2023. Impairment of property, plant, and equipment, prepaids and other intangibles As of September 30, 2023, property, plant, and equipment and other intangibles were reviewed for potential impairment for recoverability. In light of the Chapter 11 Cases, the Company valued its property, plant and equipment and other intangibles based on its estimate of residual and salvage values. For the three months ended September 30, 2023, the Company recognized an impairment charge of 0.7 million to adjust the carrying value of its right of use assets. No such impairment charges were incurred for the same period of 2024.

Net Sales and Cost of Sales As a result of the Chapter 11 Cases, production of the Endurance ended in June 2023. Upon emergence from bankruptcy as a shell company, there were no sales or cost of sales during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. The Company completed homologation and testing and received required certifications enabling sales to begin in the fourth quarter of 2022. Production of the Endurance ended in June 2023. A total of 35 vehicles were sold in the first nine months of 2023.

Table of Contents 
 Cost of sales totaled 91.6 million for the first nine months of 2023, consisting of 7.6 million in costs associated with producing the Endurance, including direct materials net of an adjustment to inventory to reflect its NRV, product warranty accruals and other costs related to selling and delivering the vehicles. The Company recorded 54.3 million in manufacturing depreciation, a 25.8 million charge to reduce the carrying value of inventory to NRV, and a 4.1 million reserve for potential claims from suppliers regarding costs incurred or otherwise that may be owed during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. See Note 2 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and Note 4 - Property, Plant and Equipment and Assets Held for Sale regarding depreciation and inventory charges. Selling, General and Administrative Expense SG A totaled 9.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 69.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. With the Chapter 11 Cases commencing in June 2023, our SG A expense is not comparable on a year-over-year basis. SG A for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 consisted primarily of 6.1 million in personnel and professional fees, including 3.4 million in accelerated stock compensation expense as well as insurance premium amortization of 2.9 million. Selling, general and administration expenses SG A of 69.8 million during the nine months ended September 30 , 2023 consisted primarily of 37.8 million in non-reorganization related legal fees and expenses, including net litigation settlement accruals of 30.3 million, 21.9 million in personnel and professional fees, and 5.2 million in insurance premium amortization. Research and Development Expense As a result of the actions taken in connection with the Chapter 11 Cases, there were no R D expenses during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. For the nine months ended September 30 , 2023, the Company s R D costs were 32.4 million, including 23.4 million in personnel costs, 3.4 million in outside engineering and consulting services, and 4.5 million in prototype components and other engineering costs. Legal settlement and litigation charges (benefit), net Legal settlement and litigation charges (benefit), net represents adjustments to accrued liabilities subject to compromise from claims as a result of the final settlement of claims. Given that claims began to be settled in 2024, no legal settlement and litigation charges (benefit) was recorded during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Reorganization Items Reorganization items represent the expenses directly and incrementally resulting from the Chapter 11 Cases filed on June 27, 2023. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, reorganization items consisted of 3.6 million in legal fees and 1.1 million in consulting fees. The reorganization items include costs incurred by us as well as those incurred by the official Unsecured Creditors Committee and official Equity Committee, for which we are responsible.

 For the nine months ended September 30, 2023, reorganization items consisted of 7.1 million in legal fees, 3.7 million in consulting fees and 2.8 million in potential bankruptcy claims and settlements. Impairment of property, plant, and equipment, prepaids and other intangibles As of September 30, 2023, property, plant and equipment and other intangibles were reviewed for potential impairment for recoverability. In prior periods, fair value of the Company s property, plant, and equipment was derived from the Company s enterprise value at the time of impairment as the Company believed it represented the most appropriate fair value of the asset group in accordance with accounting guidance. In light of the Chapter 11 Cases, the Company valued its property, plant and equipment based on its estimate of residual and salvage values, resulting in an impairment charge of 134.2 million, for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, compared to an impairment charge of 74.9 million for the same period of 2022. See Note 4 - Property, Plant and Equipment and Assets Held For Sale for additional details regarding our impairment. Additionally, during the nine months ended September 30, 2023, the Company recognized an impairment of 6.0 million related to other intangible assets. No such impairment charges were incurred for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. Liquidity and Capital Resources As a result of our accumulated deficit, lack of any immediate sources of revenue, and the risks and uncertainties related to (i) our ability to successfully resolve litigation and other claims that may be filed against us, (ii) the effects of disruption from the Chapter 11 Cases, including the loss of our personnel, and (iii) the costs of the Chapter 11 Cases, substantial doubt exists regarding our ability to continue as a going concern for a period of at least one year from the date of issuance of these condensed consolidated financial statements. We had cash and cash equivalents of approximately 26.1 million, excluding restricted cash of approximately 30.9 million, an accumulated deficit of 1.2 billion at September 30, 2024, net income of 0.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, and a net loss of 6.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. Our liquidity and ability to continue as a going concern is dependent upon, among other things: (i) the resolution of significant contingent and other claims, liabilities (see Note 8 Commitments and Contingencies) and (ii) the outcome of our efforts to realize value, if any, from the Company s retained causes of action, including the Foxconn Litigation, and other remaining assets. We have incurred significant professional fees and other costs in connection with preparation for and prosecution of the Chapter 11 Cases and expect to continue to incur significant professional fees and costs. In addition, we are subject to significant contingent liabilities, the full scope of which is uncertain at this time (see Note 8 Commitments and Contingencies). Furthermore, under the Plan, we are conducting a process to reconcile the claims asserted that has resulted in approximately 30.9 million of our cash being reserved for settling outstanding claims against the Company, including litigation and indemnification claims. Pursuant to the Bankruptcy Code, the Company is first required to pay all administrative claims in full. Under the Plan, the Company established an escrow for the payment of certain professional fees incurred in connection with the Chapter 11 Cases Professional Fee Escrow ), which was fully paid out as of September 30, 2024. The Professional Fee Escrow was established based upon estimates and assumptions as of the date the Company emerged from bankruptcy. The Plan also required the Company to establish a 45 million reserve for allowed and disputed claims of general unsecured creditors (the Claims Reserve ), including interest (although there can be no assurance the Company will be able to pay such claims in full, with interest). As of September 30, 2024, 27.3 million was included in restricted cash, which represents the initial Claims Reserve of 45 million, less 17.7 million which was released from the Claims Reserve related to the claims reconciliation process. Pursuant to the Plan (which includes certain exceptions), upon emergence (i) the Claims Ombudsman was appointed to oversee the administration of claims asserted against the Company by general unsecured creditors and (ii) a trustee was appointed to oversee the litigation trust, which may be

 funded with certain retained causes of action of the Company, as was determined by the Board. Holders of certain unsecured claims are expected to be entitled to receive post-petition interest on their claim amount as of the later of the date the claim was due to be paid, or the petition date. Therefore, if the claims resolution process takes longer than anticipated, the total liability to settle claims will increase. The amount of the Claims Reserve is subject to change and could increase materially. The Claims Reserve is adjusted downward as payments are made for allowed claims, and may also be adjusted downward as claims are resolved or otherwise as a result of the claims resolution process. Claimants may have the ability to amend their proofs of claim that could significantly increase the total claims, beyond our estimates or reserve. There is also risk of additional litigation and claims that may be asserted after the Chapter 11 Cases against the Company or its indemnified directors and officers that may be known or unknown and the Company may not have the resources to adequately defend or dispute such claims due to the Chapter 11 Cases. The Company cannot provide any assurances as to what the Company s total actual liabilities will be based on any such claims. To the extent that the Claims Reserve is insufficient to pay general unsecured creditors in full with interest, such deficiency will be payable from certain other assets of the Company, as set forth in the Plan. Our assets consist of cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash, the Foxconn Litigation claims, claims the Company may have against other parties and NOLs. See Risk Factors under Part I Item 1A. and Part II Item 1A. below for further discussion of the risks associated with our limited capital resources and loss exposures, among other risks. Summary of Cash Flows The following table provides a summary of Nu Ride s cash flow data for the period indicated: 

Nine months ended Nine months ended September 30, 2024 September 30, 2023 Net Cash used in operating activities (29,969) (120,006) Net Cash provided by investing activities 92,301 Net Cash used in financing activities (106) Net Cash Used in Operating Activities Net cash used in operating activities decreased by 90.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 2023. The decrease of cash used in operating activities, was principally due to the cessation of operations as a result of the Chapter 11 Cases. The Company s net loss, as adjusted to reconcile cash used by operating activities was 342.7 million for the first nine months of 2023, compared to 6.9 million for same period of 2024. The net loss, as adjusted to reconcile cash used by operating activities for the first nine months of 2023 included non-cash impairment charges of 140.2 million, 24.1 million related to the write down of inventory and prepaid inventory, 2.8 million for the loss on disposal of fixed assets, 6.6 million of stock-based compensation, and 54.4 million in depreciation of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets, partially offset by 2.2 million of other non-cash changes. No such charges were incurred in the first nine months of 2024 with the exception of stock-based compensation, which totaled 3.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024.

 Net Cash Provided by Investing Activities The Company had no investing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. Investing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, included 134.2 million in maturities of short-term investments, offset by 32.1 million in purchases of short-term investments and 10.2 million in purchases of property, plant, and equipment. Net Cash Used in Financing Activities For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, financing activities were limited to tax withholding payments related to net-settled restricted stock compensation associated with the Company s 2020 Plan. There were no financing transactions during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements We have no obligations, assets or liabilities, which would be considered off-balance sheet arrangements as of September 30, 2024. We do not participate in transactions that create relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships, often referred to as variable interest entities, which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements. We have not entered into any off-balance sheet financing arrangements, established any special purpose entities, guaranteed any debt or commitments of other entities, or purchased any non-financial assets. Critical Accounting Estimates Liabilities Subject to Compromise Since filing the Chapter 11 Cases, the Company has operated as a debtor-in-possession under the jurisdiction of the Bankruptcy Court and in accordance with the applicable provisions of the Bankruptcy Code. In the accompanying Balance Sheet, the Liabilities subject to compromise line is reflective of expected allowed claim amounts in accordance with ASC 852-10 and are subject to change materially based on the proceedings and continued consideration of claims that may be modified, allowed, or disallowed. Refer to Note 8 - Commitments and Contingencies for further detail. Recent Accounting Pronouncements See Note 2 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for more information about recent accounting pronouncements, the timing of their adoption, and management s assessment, to the extent they have made one, of their potential impact on the Company s financial condition and results of operations.

 Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk As a smaller reporting company, the Company is not required to provide the information required by this Item. Item 4. Controls and Procedures Management s Evaluation of our Disclosure Controls and Procedures Disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) are controls and other procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act, are recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls, activities, and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in company reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to management to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. We do not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures will prevent all errors and all instances of fraud. Disclosure controls and procedures, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the disclosure controls and procedures are met. The design of disclosure controls and procedures must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits must be considered relative to their costs and the nature of operating activities. Internal control over financial reporting also can be circumvented by collusion or improper override. Because of the inherent limitations in all disclosure controls and procedures, no evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures can provide absolute assurance that we have detected all our control deficiencies and instances of fraud, if any. The design of disclosure controls and procedures also is based partly on certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions. As required by Rules 13a-15 and 15d-15 under the Exchange Act, our Chief Executive Officer, who also serves as our Chief Financial Officer, carried out an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based upon his evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective. Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting There have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) of the Exchange Act) during the quarter ended September 30, 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. In light of the limited nature of our operations, our controls primarily relate to financial reporting and payment of our expenses. As a result of eliminating personnel, including full-time employees, we have enhanced our oversight of accounting and payment processing with increased executive involvement and support from consultants and advisors to facilitate the presentation of information with respect to our operations that is accurate and complete. Our Chief Executive Officer also serves as our Chief Financial Officer.
