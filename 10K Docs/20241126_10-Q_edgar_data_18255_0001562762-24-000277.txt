 more operating segments may be aggregated into a single reportable segment if aggregation is consistent with 
 the 
objective

principles 
of 
ASC 
280-10, 
which 
require 
the 
segments 
to 
have

At November 2, 
2024, the Company 
had deferred compensation

million. 
During the nine

Company sold its 
corporate equities. 
All of 
 these assets are recorded within Other 
assets in the Condensed Consolidated Balance 
Sheets. 
 Level 1 category securities are measured 
at fair value using quoted active 
market prices. 
Level 2 investment

and 
municipal 
bonds 
for 
which 
quoted 
prices 
may 
not 
be 
available 
on 
 active exchanges for identical instruments. 
Their fair value is principally based on market values determined 
 by management with the assistance of a third-party pricing service. 
Since quoted prices in active markets for 
 identical assets are 
not available, these 
prices are determined 
by the pricing 
service using observable 
market 
 information 
such 
as 
quotes 
from 
less 
active 
markets 
and/or 
quoted 
prices 
of 
securities 
with 
similar 
 characteristics, among other factors. 
 Deferred compensation plan 
assets consist of 
life insurance policies. 
These life insurance 
policies are valued 
 based on the cash surrender value of the insurance contract, which is determined based on 
such factors as the 
 fair value of the underlying assets and discounted cash flow and are therefore classified within Level 3 
of the 
 valuation 
hierarchy. 
The

 CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES:
 The 
Company s 
critical 
accounting 
policies 
and 
estimates 
are 
more 
fully 
described 
in 
 Management s 
 Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in the 
Company s Annual Report 
 on 
Form 
10-K 
for 
the 
fiscal 
year 
ended 
February 
3, 
2024. 
The 
preparation 
of 
the 
Company s 
financial 
 statements 
in 
conformity 
with 
generally 
accepted 
accounting 
principles 
in 
the 
United 
States GAAP 
 requires management to make estimates and assumptions about future events that affect the amounts reported 
 in 
the 
financial 
statements 
and 
accompanying 
notes. 
Future 
events 
and 
their 
effects 
cannot 
be 
determined 
 with absolute 
certainty. Therefore, 
the determination 
of estimates 
requires the 
exercise of 
judgment. Actual 
 results 
inevitably 
will 
differ 
from 
those 
estimates, 
and 
such 
differences 
may 
be 
material 
to 
the 
financial 
 statements. The most significant accounting estimates 
inherent in the preparation of the 
Company s financial 
 statements include 
the calculation 
of potential 
asset impairment, 
income tax 
valuation allowances, 
reserves 
 relating 
to 
self-insured 
health 
insurance, 
workers 
compensation, 
general 
and 
auto 
insurance 
liabilities, 
 uncertain tax positions, the allowance for 
customer credit losses, and inventory shrinkage. 
 The Company s critical accounting policies and 
estimates are discussed with the Audit Committee.

Analysis 
of 
Financial 
Condition

Results 
of 
Operations MD A 
is 
 intended 
to 
provide 
information 
to 
assist 
readers 
in 
better 
understanding 
and 
evaluating 
our 
financial 
 condition and results of 
operations. We recommend reading 
this MD A in conjunction 
with our Condensed 
 Consolidated Financial 
Statements and 
the Notes 
to those 
statements included in 
the Financial 
Statements 
 section of this Quarterly Report on 
Form 10-Q, as well as our 2023 
Annual Report on Form 10-K. 
 Recent Developments 
 Inflationary Cost Pressure and High Interest Rates 
 The pressure on our customers disposable income continued in the 
first three quarters of fiscal 2024, due 
 to 
prolonged and 
persistently higher 
prices caused 
by high 
inflation rates, 
especially related 
to 
housing, 
 groceries 
and 
fuel, 
as 
well 
as 
high 
interest 
rates. 
These 
high 
interest 
rates 
have 
adversely 
affected 
the 
 availability and cost of credit for our customers, including 
revolving credit and auto loans, and continue to 
 negatively 
impact 
our 
customers 
disposable 
income. 
Our 
customers 
willingness 
to 
purchase 
our 
 products may continue to be negatively impacted by these inflationary 
pressures and high interest rates. 
 Although 
interest 
rates 
and 
inflation 
have 
decreased, 
we 
believe 
the 
pressure 
on 
our 
customers 
 disposable 
income adversely 
impacted 
the 
first 
three quarters 
of 
fiscal 
2024 
and will 
likely 
continue to 
 have a 
negative impact 
on consumer 
behavior and, 
by extension, 
our results 
of 
operations and 
financial 
 condition during the remainder of fiscal 2024. 
 Merchandise Supply Chain 
 A 
significant 
amount 
of 
our 
merchandise 
is 
manufactured 
overseas, 
principally 
in 
Southeast 
Asia, 
and 
 traverses 
through 
the 
Panama 
Canal 
or 
the 
Suez 
Canal. 
In 
the 
first 
quarter 
of 
2024, 
the 
drought 
 conditions 
experienced 
in 
the 
region 
surrounding 
the 
Panama 
Canal 
reduced 
the 
number 
of 
transits 
by 
 approximately 37 and 
also reduced the 
permissible draft of 
vessels transiting the 
Panama Canal, which 
 reduced the volume 
and number of 
containers carried by container 
ships and increased 
our costs. 
These 
 conditions improved as 
the Panama 
Canal authority 
increased the 
daily transits 
and the 
permissible draft 
 of vessels, raising the number of 
transits to 95 of pre-drought operations in the 
second quarter and back 
 to pre-drought 
levels in 
the third 
quarter. 
The hostilities 
affecting the 
region surrounding the 
Suez Canal 
 are causing container ships to 
travel longer distances around the 
Cape of Good Hope, 
which is increasing 
 lead times for merchandise and 
our costs to ship these 
goods, as well as decreasing the 
pool of containers 
 available. 
The combination of 
these situations 
has negatively impacted 
the first 
nine months 
of 2024. 
In 
 addition, 
the 
third 
quarter 
was 
impacted 
by 
later 
shipments 
in 
part 
due 
to 
congestion 
at 
certain 
Asian 
 ports, 
the 
U.S. 
port 
strike 
on 
the 
east 
coast, 
and 
civil 
unrest 
in 
some 
Asian 
countries 
that 
caused 
 merchandise to miss 
its shipping windows. 
Though conditions have 
incrementally improved, we believe 
 the totality of 
these conditions will 
likely continue to 
have a negative 
impact on our 
results of operations 
 and financial condition for the foreseeable future.

Months ended November 2, 2024 with October 
28, 2023
 Total retail sales for the 
third quarter were 144.6 million compared to 
last year s third quarter sales 
of 156.7 
 million, an 8 decrease. 
The Company s sales 
decrease in the third quarter 
of fiscal 2024 was 
primarily due 
 to 
a 
3 
decrease 
in 
same-store 
sales 
and 
stores 
closed 
in 
the 
fourth 
quarter 
of 
2023.

 month sales of 
 528.2 million, an 
8 decrease. The 
decrease in sales 
in the first 
nine months of 
fiscal 2024 
 was due 
primarily to 
a 4 
decrease in 
same-store sales 
and store 
closures. 
Same-store sales 
include stores 
 that have been open 
more than 15 months. 
Stores that have been 
relocated or expanded are 
also included in 
 the same-store sales 
calculation after they 
have been open 
more than 15 
months. 
The method of 
calculating 
 same-store 
sales 
varies across 
the 
retail industry. 
As 
a 
result, 
our 
same-store 
sales 
calculation 
may 
not 
be 
 comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies. E-commerce sales were less than 5 of 
 total sales for the nine months ended 
November 2, 2024 and are included in 
the same-store sales calculation. 

 Total 
revenues, 
comprised 
of 
retail 
sales 
and 
other 
revenue 
(principally 
finance 
charges 
and 
late 
fees 
on 
 customer accounts 
receivable and 
layaway fees), 
were 146.2 
million and 
 491.9 million 
for the 
three and 
 nine months ended November 2, 2024, compared to 158.3 million and 533.2 
million for the three and nine 
 months 
ended 
October 
28, 
2023, 
respectively. 
The 
Company 
operated 
1,167 
stores 
at 
November 
2, 
2024 
 compared 
to 
1,245 stores 
at 
October 
28, 
2023. 
During 
the first 
nine 
months of 
fiscal 
2024, the 
Company 
 opened one store 
and closed 
13 stores. 
The Company currently 
expects to 
close approximately 
65 stores 
in 
 total in fiscal 2024. 
 Credit 
revenue 
of 
 0.7 
million 
represented 
0.5 
of 
total 
revenues 
in 
the 
third 
quarter 
of 
fiscal 
2024, 
 compared to credit revenue of 0.7 million or 0.4 of total revenues in the third quarter of fiscal 2023. Credit 
 revenue is 
comprised of 
interest earned 
on the 
Company s private 
label credit 
card portfolio 
and related 
fee 
 income. 
Related expenses principally include 
payroll, postage and other 
administrative expenses and totaled 
 0.4 million in the third quarter 
of fiscal 2024, compared to 
last year s third quarter expense of 
 0.4 million. 
 Other 
revenue, 
a 
component 
of 
total 
revenues, 
was 
 1.5 
million 
and 
 5.0 
million 
for 
the 
three 
and 
nine 
 months ended November 2, 2024, respectively, compared to 1.6 million and 5.0 million for the prior year s 
 comparable three 
and nine 
month periods. 
The slight 
decrease in 
Other revenue 
for the 
three months 
ended 
 November 
2, 
2024 
was 
due 
to 
decreases 
in 
e-commerce 
shipping 
revenue 
and 
finance 
charges 
associated 
 with the Company s proprietary credit 
card, partially offset by an increase 
in gift card breakage income. 
 Cost of 
goods sold 
was 103.0 
million, or 
71.2 of 
retail sales 
and 324.6 
million, or 
66.7 of retail 
sales 
 for the three and 
nine months ended November 
2, 2024, respectively, compared 
to 105.8 million, or 
67.5 
 of retail sales and 345.5 million, or 65.4 of retail sales for the comparable three and nine month periods of 
 fiscal 2023. 
The overall increase in cost of goods sold as a percent of retail sales for the third 
quarter and first 
 nine 
months 
of 
fiscal 
2024 
versus 
the 
comparable 
three 
and 
nine 
month 
periods 
of 
fiscal 
2023 
resulted 
 primarily from deleveraging of occupancy and buying costs and higher distribution and freight costs, partially 
 offset 
by 
higher 
selling 
margins. 
Cost 
of 
goods 
sold 
includes 
merchandise 
costs 
(net 
of 
discounts 
and 
 allowances), 
buying 
costs, 
distribution 
costs, 
occupancy 
costs, 
freight 
and 
inventory 
shrinkage. 
Net 
 merchandise 
costs 
and 
in-bound 
freight 
are 
capitalized 
as 
inventory 
costs. 
Buying 
and 
distribution 
costs 
 include 
payroll, 
payroll-related 
costs 
and 
operating 
expenses 
for 
the 
buying 
departments 
and 
distribution 
 center. 
Occupancy 
costs include 
rent, 
real 
estate taxes, 
insurance, common 
area 
maintenance, utilities 
and 
 maintenance for 
stores and 
distribution facilities. 
Total gross 
margin 
dollars (retail 
sales less 
cost of 
goods 
 sold exclusive of depreciation) decreased by 
18.1 to 41.7 million for the third quarter 
of fiscal 2024 and by 
 11.1 
to 
 162.3 
million 
for 
the 
first 
nine 
months 
of 
fiscal 
2024, 
compared 
to 
 50.9 
million 
and 
 182.6 
 million for the 
prior year s comparable 
three and nine 
months of fiscal 
2023, respectively. 
Gross margin as 
 presented may not be comparable to those 
of other entities. 
 Selling, general and administrative expenses SG A primarily include corporate and store payroll, related 
 payroll 
taxes 
and 
benefits, 
insurance, 
supplies, 
advertising, 
bank 
and 
credit 
card 
processing 
fees. 
SG A 
 expenses were 57.9 million, or 40.0 of retail sales and 172.8 million, or 35.5 of retail sales for the 
third 
 quarter and first nine months of 
fiscal 2024, respectively, compared to 61.8 
million, or 39.4 of retail sales 
 and 
 185.3 
million, 
or 35.1 
of retail 
sales 
for the 
prior 
year s 
comparable three 
and 
nine 
month periods,

 27
 respectively. 
The decrease in SG A 
expenses for the third 
quarter and first nine 
months of fiscal 2024 
was 
 primarily due to lower payroll, 
advertising and insurance expenses, partially 
offset by expenses related to the 
 startup of our distribution center automation project. 
 Depreciation expense was 2.7 million, or 1.9 of retail sales and 7.1 million, or 1.5 of 
retail sales for the 
 third quarter 
and first 
nine months 
of fiscal 
2024, respectively, 
compared to 
 2.5 million, 
or 1.6 
of retail 
 sales and 7.4 million or 1.4 
of retail sales for the comparable three 
and nine month periods of fiscal 
2023, 
 respectively. 

 Interest and other 
income was 2.6 
million, or 1.8 
of retail sales 
and 10.2 million, 
or 2.1 of 
retail sales 
 for the 
three and 
nine months 
ended November 
2, 2024, 
respectively, compared to 
 1.5 million, 
or 1.0 
of 
 retail sales and 3.8 million, 
or 0.7 of retail sales for the 
comparable three and nine month periods 
of fiscal 
 2023, respectively. 
The increase 
for the 
third quarter 
of fiscal 
2024 compared 
to fiscal 
2023 was 
primarily 
 due 
to 
a 
gain 
on 
the 
disposal 
of 
the 
Company s 
corporate 
aircraft 
and 
higher 
interest 
earned 
on 
the 
 Company s investments. 
The increase 
for the 
first nine 
months of 
fiscal 2024 
compared to 
fiscal 2023 
was 
 primarily 
due 
to 
a 
 3.2 
million 
net 
gain 
on 
sale 
of 
land 
held 
for 
investment, 
gain 
on 
the 
disposal 
of 
the 
 Company s corporate aircraft and higher interest 
earned on the Company s investments. 
 Income tax expense was 
 0.3 million and 1.6 million 
for the third quarter 
and first nine months of fiscal 
 2024, respectively, 
compared to 
a tax 
benefit of 
 4.3 million 
and 0.8 
million for 
the comparable 
three 
 and 
nine 
month 
periods 
of 
fiscal 
2023, 
respectively. 
The 
effective 
income 
tax 
rate 
for 
the 
first 
nine 
 months 
of 
fiscal 
2024 
was 
(67.5 
compared 
to 
60.4 
for 
the 
first 
nine 
months 
of 
fiscal 
2023. 
The 
 increase in tax expense in 
2024 is primarily due to 
the valuation allowance against net 
deferred tax assets 
 attributable to 
U.S. federal 
net operating 
loss carryforwards 
recorded in 
the fourth 
quarter of 
2023 and 
a 
 smaller release of reserves for uncertain tax positions. 

 LIQUIDITY, CAPITAL 
RESOURCES 
AND MARKET 
RISK: 

 The Company 
believes that 
its cash, 
cash equivalents 
and short-term 
investments, together 
with cash 
flows 
 from operations, will be adequate to fund the Company s regular operating requirements and expected capital 
 expenditures for the next 12 
months. 
 Cash used in operating activities during the first nine months of fiscal 2024 was 13.3 million as compared 
to 
 11.7 
million 
provided 
in 
the 
first 
nine 
months 
of 
fiscal 
2023. 
The 
increase 
in 
cash 
used 
by 
operating 
 activities 
of 
 25.0 
million 
for the 
first 
nine 
months of 
fiscal 
2024 
as 
compared to 
the 
first nine 
months of 
 fiscal 2023 was primarily attributable to the 
relative change in inventory from year-end to 
the third quarter for 
 both 
years 
and 
a 
subtraction 
of 
net 
income 
for 
non-operating 
gains 
on 
sale 
of 
assets 
held 
for 
investment, 
 partially offset by the relative change 
of accounts payable from year-end to 
the third quarter for both years. 
 At 
November 
2, 
2024, 
the 
Company 
had 
working 
capital 
of 
 60.7 
million 
compared 
to 
 55.1 
million 
at 
 February 3, 
2024.
 The increase 
in working 
capital was 
primarily attributable 
to a 
decrease in 
current lease 
 liability 
and 
an 
increase 
in 
inventory, 
partially 
offset 
by 
a 
decrease 
in 
short-term 
investments, 
cash 
and 
 accounts receivable. 
 At November 2, 
2024, the Company had 
a revolving credit agreement, 
which provides for borrowings of 
up 
 to 35.0 
million, less 
the balance 
of any 
revocable letters 
of credit 
related to 
purchase commitments, 
and is 
 committed 
through 
May 
2027. 
The 
credit 
agreement 
contains 
various 
financial 
covenants 
and 
limitations, 
 including 
the 
maintenance 
of 
specific 
financial 
ratios. 
On 
April 
25, 
2024, 
the 
Company 
amended 
the 

THE CATO CORPORATION
 MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL
 CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 
(CONTINUED)
 28
 revolving credit 
agreement to 
modify a 
definition used 
in calculating 
the Company s 
minimum EBITDAR 
 coverage 
ratio 
to 
add 
back 
certain 
income 
tax 
receivables 
included 
in 
the 
calculation 
of 
the 
ratio. 
On 
 November 1, 2024, the Company 
amended the revolving credit agreement 
to lower the minimum EBITDAR 
 coverage 
ratio 
and 
the 
corresponding 
minimum 
cash 
and 
investments 
used 
to 
determine 
the 
EBITDAR 
 coverage ratio in exchange 
for a secured position 
in any future borrowings. 
For the quarter ended 
November 
 2, 2024, 
after giving 
effect to 
the amendments, 
the Company 
was in 
compliance with 
the credit 
agreement. 
 There 
were 
no 
borrowings 
outstanding, 
nor 
any 
outstanding 
letters 
of 
credit 
that 
reduced 
borrowing 
 availability, as of November 2, 2024. 
The weighted average interest rate under 
the credit facility was zero at 
 November 2, 2024 due to 
no outstanding borrowings. 
 Expenditures 
for 
property 
and 
equipment 
totaled 
 6.5 
million 
in 
the 
first 
nine 
months 
of 
fiscal 
2024, 
 compared to 
 10.3 million 
in last 
fiscal year s 
first nine 
months. The 
decrease in 
expenditures for 
property 
 and equipment 
was 
primarily 
due to 
finishing 
projects related 
to investments 
in the 
distribution center 
and 
 information 
technology. 
For 
the 
full 
fiscal 
2024 
year, 
the 
Company 
expects 
to 
invest 
approximately 
 7.0 
 million for capital expenditures. 
 Net 
cash 
provided 
by 
investing 
activities 
totaled 
 21.5 
million 
in 
the 
first 
nine 
months 
of 
fiscal 
2024 
 compared 
to 
 6.1 
million 
net 
cash 
provided 
in 
the 
comparable 
period 
of 
2023. 
The 
increase 
in 
net 
cash 
 provided 
by 
investing 
activities 
in 
2024 
was 
primarily 
due 
to 
the 
sale 
of 
other 
assets, 
lower 
purchases 
of 
 short-term investments, 
and lower capital 
expenditure spending, 
partially offset 
by lower sales 
of short-term 
 investments. 
 Net cash used in financing activities totaled 12.6 million in the first nine months of fiscal 
2024 compared to 
 12.7 million used in the comparable period of fiscal 2023. 
The slight decrease in net cash used in financing 
 activities in fiscal 2024 was primarily 
due to lower stock repurchases, partially offset 
by dividends paid. 
 As of November 
2, 2024, the Company 
had 442,831 shares remaining 
in open authorizations under 
its share 
 repurchase program. 

 The Company does not use 
derivative financial instruments. 
 The Company s investment portfolio 
was primarily invested in 
corporate bonds and 
U.S. Treasury/Agencies 
 notes and 
bonds held 
in managed 
accounts with 
underlying ratings 
of A 
or better 
at November 
2, 2024 
and 
 February 3, 2024. 
The state, municipal and corporate bonds have contractual maturities which range from 13 
 days to 2.9 years. The U.S. Treasury/Agencies notes and bonds have contractual maturities which range from 
 3 
days 
to 
2.7 
years. 
These

are

 At February

2024, the 
Company 
had 1.1

of corporate

 assets of
