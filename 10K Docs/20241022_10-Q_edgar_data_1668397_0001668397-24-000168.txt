Forward looking statements include, without limitation, statements regarding our results of operations; financial position and performance; liquidity and our ability to fund our business operations and initiatives; capital expenditure and debt service obligations; business strategies, plans and goals, including those related to marketing, acquisitions and expansion of our business; product approvals and plans; industry trends; general economic conditions, including inflation and other pricing pressures that could decrease our operating margins; expectations regarding consumer behaviors and trends; our culture and operating philosophy; human resource management; arrangements with and delivery of our services to the customers; conversion of backlog; dividend policy; legal proceedings; and our objectives for future operations. The words expect, anticipate, intend, plan, believe, seek, see, will, would, target, likely, opportunity, may, could, outlook, can, trend, might, drives, hope, potential, project, predict, and similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements. However, the absence of these words does not mean that a statement is not forward-looking. Forward-looking statements are based largely on our current expectations and projections about future events and financial or other trends that we believe may affect our financial condition, results of operations, business strategy, short-term and long-term business operations and objectives, and financial needs. Any forward-looking statement speaks only as of the date it is made. These forward-looking statements are subject to inherent uncertainties, risks, changes in circumstances and other important factors that are difficult to predict. Moreover, we operate in a very competitive and rapidly changing environment in which new risks emerge from time to time. It is not possible for our management to predict all risks, nor can we assess the impact of all important factors on our business or the extent to which any factor, or combination of such factors, may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statements we may make. In light of these risks, uncertainties and assumptions, the forward-looking events and circumstances discussed may not occur and our financial condition and actual results could differ materially and adversely from those anticipated or implied in the forward-looking statements. In other words, these statements are not guarantees of future performance and inherently involve a wide range of risks and uncertainties that are difficult to predict. We caution you therefore against relying on these forward-looking statements. 
 We qualify all of our forward-looking statements by these cautionary statements. Except as required by applicable law, we do not plan to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements contained herein, whether as a result of any new information, future events, changed circumstances or otherwise.

 We focus on conducting clinical trials across all major therapeutic areas, with particular strength in Oncology, Metabolic Disease, Cardiology, Central Nervous System, or CNS, and Antiviral and Anti-infective, or AVAI. Our global platform includes approximately 5,900 employees across 43 countries as of September 30, 2024, providing our customers with broad access to diverse markets and patient populations as well as local regulatory expertise and market knowledge. 
 
 How We Generate Revenue 
 We earn fees through the performance of services detailed in our customer contracts. Contract scope and pricing is typically based on either a fixed-fee or unit-of-service model, with consideration of activities performed by third parties, as well as ancillary costs necessary to deliver on the contract scope that are reimbursable by our customers. Our contracts can range in duration from a few months to several years. These contracts are individually priced and negotiated based on the anticipated project scope, including the complexity of the project and the performance risks inherent in the project. The majority of our contracts are structured with an upfront fee that is collected at the time of contract signing, and the balance of the fee is collected over the duration of the contract either through an arranged billing schedule or upon completion of certain performance targets or defined milestones. 
 Revenue, which is distinct from billing and cash receipt, is recognized based on the satisfaction of the individual performance obligations identified in each contract. Substantially all of our customer contracts consist of a single performance obligation, as the promise to transfer the individual services defined in the contracts are not separately identifiable from other promises in the contract, and therefore not distinct. Our performance obligations are generally satisfied over time and recognized as services are performed. The progression of our contract performance obligations are measured primarily utilizing the input method of cost to cost. Cancellation provisions in our contracts allow our customers to terminate a contract either immediately or according to advance notice terms specified within the applicable contract, which is typically 30 days. Contract cancellation may occur for various reasons, including, but not limited to, adverse patient reactions, lack of efficacy, or inadequate patient enrollment. Upon cancellation, we are entitled to fees for services rendered through the date of termination, including payment for subsequent services necessary to conclude the study or close out the contract. These fees are typically discussed and agreed upon with the customer and are realized as revenue when we believe the amount can be estimated reliably and its realization is probable. Changes in revenue from period to period are driven primarily by new business volume and task order execution activity, project cancellations, and the mix of active studies during a given period that can vary based on therapeutic area and/or study life cycle stage. 
 
 Costs and Expenses 
 Our costs and expenses are comprised primarily of our total direct costs, selling, general and administrative costs, depreciation and amortization and income taxes. 
 Total Direct Costs 
 Total direct costs are primarily driven by labor and related employee benefits, but also include contracted third party service related expenses, fees paid to site investigators, reimbursed out of pocket expenses, laboratory supplies and other expenses contributing to service delivery. The other costs of service delivery can include office rent, utilities, supplies and software licenses which are allocated between Total direct costs and selling, general and administrative expenses based on the estimated contribution among service delivery and support function efforts on a percentage basis. Total direct costs are expensed as incurred and are not deferred in anticipation of contracts being awarded or finalization of changes in scope. Total direct costs, as a percentage of net revenue, can vary from period to period due to project labor efficiencies, changes in workforce, compensation/bonus programs and service mix. 
 Selling, General and Administrative 
 Selling, general and administrative expenses are primarily driven by compensation and related employee benefits, as well as rent, utilities, supplies, software licenses, professional fees (e.g., legal and accounting expenses), bad debt expense, travel, marketing and other operating expenses. 
 Depreciation 
 Depreciation is provided on our property and equipment on the straight-line method at rates adequate to allocate the cost of the applicable assets over their estimated useful lives, which is three to five years for computer hardware, software, phone, and medical imaging equipment, five to seven years for furniture and fixtures and other equipment, and thirty to forty years for buildings. Leasehold improvements are amortized on a straight-line basis over the shorter of the estimated useful life of the improvement or the associated remaining lease term. 
 -19- 

Table of Contents 

 Amortization 
 Amortization relates to finite-lived intangible assets recognized as expense using the straight-line method or using an accelerated method over their estimated useful lives of 15 years. 
 Income Tax Provision 
 Income tax provision consists of federal, state and local taxes on income in multiple jurisdictions. Our income tax is impacted by the pre-tax earnings in jurisdictions with varying tax rates and any related tax credits that may be available to us. Our current and future provision for income taxes will vary from statutory rates due to the impact of valuation allowances in certain countries, income tax incentives, certain non-deductible expenses, and other discrete items. 
 
 Key Performance Metrics 
 To evaluate the performance of our business, we utilize a variety of financial and performance metrics. These key measures include new business awards, cancellations and backlog. 
 New Business Awards, Cancellations and Backlog 
 New business awards represent the value of anticipated future net revenue that has been awarded during the period that is recognized in backlog. This value is recognized upon the signing of a contract or receipt of a written pre-contract confirmation from a customer that confirms an agreement in principle on budget and scope. New business awards also include contract amendments, or changes in scope, where the customer has provided written authorization for changes in budget and scope or has approved us to perform additional work as of the measurement date. Awards may not be recognized as backlog after consideration of a number of factors, including whether (i) the relevant net revenue is expected only after a pending regulatory hurdle, which might result in cancellation of the study, (ii) the customer funding needed for commencement of the study is not believed to have been secured or (iii) study timelines are uncertain or not well defined. In addition, study amounts that extend beyond a three-year timeline are not included in backlog. The number and amount of new business awards can vary significantly from period to period, and an award s contractual duration can range from several months to several years based on customer and project specifications. 
 Cancellations arise in the normal course of business and are reflected when we receive written confirmation from the customer to cease work on a contractual agreement. The majority of our customers can terminate our contracts without cause upon 30 days notice. Similar to new business awards, the number and amount of cancellations can vary significantly period over period due to timing of customer correspondence and study-specific circumstances. 
 Net new business awards represent gross new business awards received in a period offset by total cancellations in that period. Net new business awards were 533.7 million and 1,700.3 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively. Net new business awards were 611.5 million and 1,742.1 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively. 
 Backlog represents anticipated future net revenue from net new business awards that have not commenced or are currently in process but not complete. Reported backlog will fluctuate based on new business awards, changes in the scope of existing contracts, cancellations, revenue recognition on existing contracts and foreign exchange adjustments from non-U.S. dollar denominated backlog. As of September 30, 2024, our backlog increased by 237.9 million, or 8.8 , to 2,927.4 million compared to 2,689.5 million as of September 30, 2023. Included within backlog as of September 30, 2024 was approximately 1,610.0 million to 1,630.0 million that we expect to convert to net revenue over the next twelve months, with the remainder expected to convert to net revenue thereafter. 
 The effect of foreign currency adjustments on backlog was as follows: favorable foreign currency adjustments of 5.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024; unfavorable foreign currency adjustments of 2.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024; favorable foreign currency adjustments of 1.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023; and favorable foreign currency adjustments of 5.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 Backlog and net new business award metrics may not be reliable indicators of our future period revenue as they are subject to a variety of factors that may cause material fluctuations from period to period. These factors include, but are not limited to, changes in the scope of projects, cancellations, and duration and timing of services provided.

 Exchange Rate Fluctuations 
 The majority of our contracts and operational transactions are U.S. dollar denominated. The Euro represents the largest foreign currency denomination of our contractual and operational exposure. As a result, a portion of our revenue and expenses are subject to exchange rate fluctuations. We have translated the Euro into U.S. dollars using the following average exchange rates based on data obtained from www.xe.com:

 Total revenue 
 Total revenue increased by 40.8 million to 533.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, from 492.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. Total revenue increased by 185.0 million to 1,572.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, from 1,387.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily driven by growth within the Metabolic, Oncology and Cardiology therapeutic areas, compared to the same period in the prior year. The increase for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was broad based, but was primarily driven by growth within the Metabolic, Oncology, Cardiology and other therapeutic areas, compared to the same period in the prior year. 
 Total direct costs 
 Total direct costs increased by 5.0 million, to 364.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 from 359.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. Total direct costs increased by 94.7 million, to 1,094.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from 999.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily attributed to higher personnel costs to support the growth in service activities, partially offset by lower reimbursed out-of-pocket expenses. The increase for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily attributed to higher reimbursed out-of-pocket expenses and higher personnel costs to support the growth in service activities. The higher personnel costs portion increased by 9.5 million and 41.7 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same periods in the prior year. Reimbursed out-of-pocket expenses, which can fluctuate significantly from period to period based on the timing of program initiation and closeout, decreased by 2.2 million and increased by 54.1 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same periods in the prior year. 
 Selling, general and administrative

 Depreciation and Amortization 
 Depreciation and amortization expense increased by 0.6 million, to 7.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 from 6.9 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. Depreciation and amortization expense increased by 2.4 million, to 21.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from 19.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase was primarily related to increased depreciation related to Property and equipment, net, compared to the same periods in the prior year. 
 Miscellaneous income (expense), net 
 
 Miscellaneous income (expense), net changed by 0.6 million to 1.0 million of expense for the three months ended September 30, 2024 from 1.6 million of expense for the three months ended September 30, 2023. Miscellaneous income (expense), net changed by 5.6 million to 3.4 million of income for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from 2.2 million of expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. These changes were mainly attributable to foreign exchange gains and losses that arise in connection with the revaluation of short-term intercompany balances between our domestic and international subsidiaries and from the settlement of third-party accounts receivables and payables denominated in a currency other than the local currency of the entity making the payment, third-party investment gains or losses and proceeds from the recovery of a note receivable. 
 Interest income (expense), net 
 Interest income (expense), net changed by 7.6 million to 7.5 million of income for the three months ended September 30, 2024 from 0.1 million of expense for the three months ended September 30, 2023. Interest income (expense), net changed by 19.4 million to 17.1 million of income for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from 2.3 million of expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. These changes were mainly attributable to increased interest income on Cash and cash equivalents and a reduction in short-term debt, compared to the same periods in the prior year. 
 Income tax provision 
 Income tax provision increased by 9.7 million, to 22.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 from 12.7 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. Income tax provision increased by 14.2 million, to 54.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from 40.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The overall effective tax rate for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was 18.8 , compared to an overall effective tax rate of 15.2 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The overall effective tax rate for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 16.0 compared to an overall effective tax rate of 16.5 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in the income tax provision and overall effective tax rate for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily attributable to an increase in pre-tax book income, which was partially offset by an increase in tax benefits related to Foreign Derived Intangible Income (FDII) compared to the same period in the prior year. The increase in the income tax provision for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily attributable to an increase in pre-tax book income, which was partially offset by an increase in excess tax benefits recognized from share-based compensation and tax benefits related to FDII compared to the same period in the prior year. The decrease in the overall effective tax rate for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily attributable to an increase in excess tax benefits recognized from share-based compensation and tax benefits related to FDII compared to the same period in the prior year. 
 
 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 We assess our liquidity in terms of our ability to generate cash to fund our operating, investing and financing activities. Our principal sources of liquidity are operating cash flows and from borrowings under our unsecured credit facility consisting of up to a 10.0 million revolving line of credit which we entered into on September 30, 2019 (the Credit Facility ), and has subsequently been amended. As of September 30, 2024, we had cash and cash equivalents of 656.9 million which increased from 245.4 million as of December 31, 2023. Approximately 24.8 million of cash and cash equivalents, none of which was restricted, was held by our foreign subsidiaries as of September 30, 2024. 
 As of September 30, 2024, we had 10.0 million available for borrowing under the Credit Facility. Our expected primary cash needs on both a short and long-term basis are for investment in operational growth, including additional lease commitments, capital expenditures, share repurchases, selective strategic bolt-on acquisitions, other investments, and other general corporate needs. We have historically funded our operations and growth with cash flow from operations and borrowings under our credit facilities. We expect to continue expanding our operations through organic growth and potentially highly selective bolt-on acquisitions and investments. As of September 30, 2024, cash commitments to support 
 -23- 

Table of Contents 

 operating business needs include lease liabilities discussed in Note 8 of the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements, purchase commitments discussed in Note 11 of the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements and capital expenditures primarily related to infrastructure investments in our facilities, equipment and technology. Capital spending as a percentage of revenue decreased by 8 basis points to 1.84 in the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same period in the prior year. We expect these activities will be funded from existing cash, cash flow from operations and, if necessary, borrowings under our existing or future credit facilities or other debt. We have deemed that foreign earnings will be indefinitely reinvested and therefore we have not provided taxes on these earnings. While we do not anticipate the need to repatriate these foreign earnings for liquidity purposes given our cash flows from operations and borrowings under existing and future credit facilities, we would incur taxes on these earnings if the need for repatriation due to liquidity purposes arises. 
 Nine Months Ended September 30, Cash Flows (Amounts in thousands) 2024 2023 Net cash provided by operating activities 418,149 276,979 Net cash used in investing activities (20,746) (26,632) Net cash provided by (used in) financing activities 14,600 (184,165) Effect of exchange rates on cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash (552) 760 Increase in cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash 411,451 66,942 
 Cash Flow from Operating Activities 
 Cash flows from operations are driven mainly by net income, depreciation, stock-based compensation expense, noncash lease expense and net movement in advanced billings and accounts receivable and unbilled, net. Advanced billings and accounts receivable and unbilled, net fluctuate on a regular basis as we perform our services, bill our customers and ultimately collect on those receivables. We attempt to negotiate payment terms in order to provide for payments prior to or soon after the provision of services, but this timing of collection can vary significantly on a period by period comparative basis. 
 Net cash flows provided by operating activities was 418.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 beginning with net income of 287.4 million. Adjustments to reconcile net income to net cash provided by operating activities were 52.4 million, primarily related to depreciation of 20.7 million, stock-based compensation expense of 19.6 million and noncash lease expense of 17.3 million. Changes in operating assets and liabilities provided 78.4 million in operating cash flows and was primarily driven by increased advanced billings of 111.1 million, partially offset by decreased lease liabilities of 15.4 million and increased accounts receivable and unbilled, net of 13.0 million. 
 Net cash flows provided by operating activities was 277.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 beginning with net income of 204.5 million.

Changes in operating assets and liabilities provided 33.7 million in operating cash flows and was primarily driven by increased advanced billings of 56.0 million and increased accrued expenses of 54.9 million, partially offset by increased accounts receivable and unbilled, net of 39.3 million, decreased lease liabilities of 14.4 million and a change in other assets and liabilities, net of 13.7 million. 
 Cash Flow from Investing Activities 
 Net cash used in investing activities was 20.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 primarily consisting of property and equipment expenditures of 28.9 million, partially offset by 8.2 million in other investing activity.

 Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 
 The preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America, or U.S. GAAP, requires us to make a variety of decisions which affect reported amounts and related disclosures, including the selection of appropriate accounting principles and the assumptions on which to base accounting estimates. In reaching such decisions, we apply judgment based on our understanding and analysis of the relevant circumstances, including our historical experience and other assumptions. Actual results could differ from our estimates. We are committed to incorporating accounting principles, assumptions and estimates that promote the representational faithfulness, verifiability, neutrality and transparency of the accounting information included in the financial statements. 
 There have been no significant changes in the critical accounting policies and estimates as previously described in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023. 
 Effect of Recent Accounting Pronouncements 
 Refer to Note 1 of the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for management s discussion of the effect of recent accounting pronouncements. 
 
 Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk

 Item 4. Controls and Procedures 
 Limitations on Effectiveness of Controls and Procedures 
 In designing and evaluating our disclosure controls and procedures, management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives. In addition, the design of disclosure controls and procedures must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and that management is required to apply judgment in evaluating the benefits of possible controls and procedures relative to their costs. 
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 The Company s management, with the participation of the Chief Executive Officer (the Principal Executive Officer) and Chief Financial Officer (the Principal Financial Officer), has evaluated the effectiveness of the Company s disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rules 13(a)-15(e) and 15(d) -15(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 Exchange Act ), as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based on this evaluation, we concluded that, as of the 
 -25-

 end of the period covered by this report, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective in providing reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s forms and rules, and the material information relating to the Company is accumulated and communicated to management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures. 
 Control systems, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that control objectives are met. Because of inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within a company will be detected. Additionally, controls can be circumvented by individuals, by collusion of two or more people or by management override. Over time, controls can become inadequate because of changes in conditions or the degree of compliance may deteriorate. Further, the design of any system of controls is based in part upon assumptions about the likelihood of future events. There can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all future conditions. Because of the inherent limitations in any cost-effective control system, misstatements due to errors or fraud may occur and not be detected.

 In the ordinary course of business, we routinely enhance our information systems by either upgrading current systems or implementing new ones. There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the three months ended September 30, 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

 (b) Unless otherwise determined by the Administrator or as set forth in a written agreement between Participant and the Company, any portion of the Option that has not become vested and exercisable on or prior to (i) the date of Participant s Termination of Service (including, without limitation, pursuant to any employment or similar agreement by and between Participant and the Company) or (ii) the Expiration Date, shall be forfeited on such earlier date and shall not thereafter become vested or exercisable. 
 
 3.2 Duration of Exercisability . The installments provided for in the vesting schedule set forth in the Grant Notice are cumulative. Each such installment that becomes vested and exercisable pursuant to the vesting schedule set forth in the Grant Notice shall remain vested and exercisable until it becomes unexercisable under Section 3.3 hereof.

The Company Group may withhold or Participant may make such payment in one or more of the forms specified below 
 
 (i) by cash or check made payable to the Company Group Member with respect to which the withholding obligation arises 
 
 (ii) by the deduction of such amount from other compensation payable to Participant 
 
 (iii) with respect to any withholding taxes arising in connection with the exercise of the Option, with the consent of the Administrator, by requesting that the Company withhold a net number of Shares issuable upon the exercise of the Option having a then current Fair Market Value not exceeding the amount necessary to satisfy the withholding obligation of the Company Group based on the maximum statutory withholding rates in Participant s applicable jurisdictions for federal, state, local and foreign income tax and payroll tax purposes that are applicable to such taxable income 
 
 (iv) with respect to any withholding taxes arising in connection with the exercise of the Option, with the consent of the Administrator, by tendering to the Company vested Shares held for such period of time as may be required by the Administrator in order to avoid adverse accounting consequences and having a then current Fair Market Value not exceeding the amount necessary to satisfy the withholding obligation of the Company Group based on the maximum statutory withholding rates in Participant s applicable jurisdictions for federal, state, local and foreign income tax and payroll tax purposes that are applicable to such taxable income 
 
 (v) with respect to any withholding taxes arising in connection with the exercise of the Option, through the delivery of a notice that Participant has placed a market sell order with a broker acceptable to the Company with respect to Shares then issuable to Participant pursuant to the Option, and that the broker has been directed to pay a sufficient portion of the net proceeds of the sale to the Company Group Member with respect to which the withholding obligation arises in satisfaction of such withholding taxes provided that payment of such proceeds is then made to the applicable Company Group Member at such time as may be required by the Administrator, but in any event not later than the settlement of such sale or 
 
 (vi) in any combination of the foregoing. 
 
 (b) With respect to any withholding taxes arising in connection with the Option, in the event Participant fails to provide timely payment of all sums required pursuant to Section 3.4(a) , the Company shall have the right and option, but not the obligation, to treat such failure as an election by Participant to satisfy all or any portion of Participant s required payment obligation pursuant to Section 3.4(a)(ii) or Section 3.4(a)(iii) above, or any combination of the foregoing as the Company may determine to be appropriate. The Company shall not be obligated to deliver any certificate representing Shares 
 A-4 

issuable with respect to the exercise of the Option to, or to cause any such Shares to be held in book-entry form by, Participant or his or her legal representative unless and until Participant or his or her legal representative shall have paid or otherwise satisfied in full the amount of all federal, state, local and foreign taxes applicable with respect to the taxable income of Participant resulting from the exercise of the Option or any other taxable event related to the Option. 
 
 (c) In the event any tax withholding obligation arising in connection with the Option will be satisfied under Section 3.4(a)(iii) , then the Company may elect to instruct any brokerage firm determined acceptable to the Company for such purpose to sell on Participant s behalf a whole number of Shares from those Shares then issuable upon the exercise of the Option as the Company determines to be appropriate to generate cash proceeds sufficient to satisfy the tax withholding obligation and to remit the proceeds of such sale to the Company Group Member with respect to which the withholding obligation arises. Participant s acceptance of this Option constitutes Participant s instruction and authorization to the Company and such brokerage firm to complete the transactions described in this Section 3.4(c) , including the transactions described in the previous sentence, as applicable. The Company may refuse to issue any Shares to Participant until the foregoing tax withholding obligations are satisfied, provided that no payment shall be delayed under this Section 3.4(c) if such delay will result in a violation of Section 409A. 
 
 (d) Participant is ultimately liable and responsible for, and, to the extent permitted by Applicable Law, agrees to indemnify and keep indemnified the Company Group from, all taxes and social security or national insurance contributions owed in connection with the Option (including the grant or exercise of the Option or the acquisition or disposal of any Shares), regardless of any action any Company Group Member takes with respect to any tax withholding obligations that arise in connection with the Option. No Company Group Member makes any representation or undertaking regarding the treatment of any tax withholding in connection with the awarding, vesting or exercise of the Option or the subsequent sale of Shares. The Company Group does not commit and is under no obligation to structure the Option to reduce or eliminate Participant s tax liability.

Participant and the Company intend that the Restrictive Covenants shall be deemed to be a series of separate covenants, one for each county or province of each and every state or jurisdiction within the Restricted Area and one for each month of the Restricted Period. Participant understands that the Restrictive Covenants may limit his or her ability to earn a livelihood in a business similar to the business of the Company Group, but nevertheless believes that he or she has received and will receive sufficient consideration and other benefits as an employee or other service provider of a Company Group Member and as otherwise provided hereunder to clearly justify such restrictions which, in any event (given Participant s education, skills and ability), Participant does not believe would prevent him or her from otherwise earning a living. Participant agrees that the Restrictive Covenants do not confer a benefit upon the Company Group disproportionate to Participant s detriment. Participant has independently consulted with his or her counsel and after such consultation agrees that the Restrictive Covenants are reasonable and proper to protect the legitimate interest of the Company Group. 
 
 5.7 Enforcement . Participant acknowledges that the Restrictive Covenants are an essential element of this Agreement and are being provided in consideration of the Option granted pursuant to this Agreement, and that any breach by Participant of any provision of this Article V will result in irreparable injury to the Company Group. The Participant acknowledges that in the event of such a breach, in addition to all other remedies available at law, the Company shall be entitled to equitable relief, including injunctive relief, without the necessity of proving actual damages or posting a bond therefor. If, at the time of enforcement of this Article V a court of competent jurisdiction shall hold that either the duration or scope stated herein is unreasonable under the circumstances then existing, the parties agree that the maximum duration or scope under such circumstances shall be substituted for the stated duration or scope and that the court shall be allowed to revise the restrictions contained herein to cover the maximum period and scope permitted by Applicable Law. To the extent of any breach of this Article V by Participant, his or her 
 Restricted Period shall automatically be extended by the length of such breach. 
 
 5.8 Forfeiture Upon Violation . Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement that may provide to the contrary, in the event of Participant s violation of any Restrictive Covenant within this Article V or any other agreement by and between Participant and any Company Group Member, as determined by the Company, in its sole discretion, then (a) the Option shall immediately be terminated and forfeited in its entirety and (b) Participant shall pay to the Company in cash any financial gain Participant realized from exercising all or a portion of the Option during the 12-month period immediately preceding (or at any time after) the date of such violation. For purposes of this Section 5.8 , financial gain shall equal the sum of (x) any excess of the greater of (i) the Fair Market Value per Share on the date of exercise and (ii) the Fair Market Value per Share as of the time of Participant s sale of such Shares, if any, over the Exercise Price, multiplied by the number of Shares purchased pursuant to the exercise (without reduction for any Shares surrendered) and (y) any and all dividends paid to Participant with respect to the Shares purchased pursuant to the exercise. By accepting this Option, Participant hereby acknowledges, agrees and authorizes the Company to reduce any amounts owed by any Company Group Member (including amounts owed as wages or other compensation, fringe benefits, or vacation pay, as well as any other amounts owed to Participant by any Company Group Member), by the amounts Participant owes to the Company under this Section 5.8 . To the extent such amounts are not recovered by the Company through such set-off, Participant agrees to pay such amounts immediately to the Company upon demand. This right of set-off is in addition to any other remedies the Company may have against Participant for Participant s breach of this Agreement or any other agreement. Participant s obligations

In the event that as of the date of recoupment Participant holds Shares obtained through the exercise of the Option under this Grant Notice and Agreement, then the Board may require Participant to surrender the Shares to the Company at the exercise price. By accepting this Option, Participant hereby acknowledges, agrees and authorizes the Company to reduce any amounts owed by any Company Group Member (including amounts owed as wages or other compensation, fringe benefits, or vacation pay, as well as any other amounts owed to Participant by any Company Group Member), by the amounts Participant owes to the Company under this Section 6.2 . To the extent such amounts are not recovered by the Company through such set-off, Participant agrees to pay such amounts immediately to the Company upon demand.

A Restatement does not include situations in which financial statement changes did not result from material non-compliance with financial reporting requirements, such as, but not limited to retrospective (i) application of a change in accounting principles (ii) revision to reportable segment information due to a change in the structure of the Company s internal organization (iii) reclassification due to a discontinued operation (iv) application of a change in reporting entity, such as from a reorganization of entities under common control (v) adjustment to provision amounts in connection with a prior business combination and (vi) revision for stock splits, stock dividends, reverse stock splits or other changes in capital structure.

 AWARD OF RESTRICTED STOCK UNITS AND DIVIDEND EQUIVALENTS 
 
 2.1 Award of RSUs and Dividend Equivalents . 
 
 (a) In consideration of Participant s past and or continued employment with or service to any Company Group Member and for other good and valuable consideration, effective as of the grant date set forth in the Grant Notice (the Grant Date ), the Company has granted to Participant the number of RSUs set forth in the Grant Notice, upon the terms and conditions set forth in the Grant Notice, the Plan and this Agreement, subject to adjustment as provided in Section 13.2 of the Plan. Each RSU represents the right to receive one Share or, at the option of the Company, an amount of cash as set forth in Section 2.3(b) , in either case, at the times and subject to the conditions set forth herein. However, unless and until the RSUs have vested, Participant will have no right to the payment of any Shares subject thereto.

The Dividend Equivalents for each RSU shall be equal to the amount of cash that is paid as a dividend on one Share. All such Dividend Equivalents shall be credited to Participant and be deemed to be reinvested in additional RSUs as of the date of payment of any such dividend based on the Fair Market Value of a Share on such date. Each additional RSU that results from such deemed reinvestment of Dividend Equivalents granted hereunder shall be subject to the same vesting, distribution or payment, adjustment and other provisions that apply to the underlying RSU to which such additional RSU relates. 
 
 2.2 Vesting of RSUs and Dividend Equivalents . 
 
 (a) Subject to Participant s continued employment with or service to a Company Group Member on each applicable vesting date and subject to Section 4.8 and Section 4.15, the RSUs shall vest in such amounts and at such times as are set forth in the Grant Notice. Each additional RSU that results from deemed reinvestments of Dividend Equivalents pursuant to Section 2.1(b) hereof shall vest whenever the underlying RSU to which such additional RSU relates vests. Unless otherwise required by Applicable Law or unless otherwise determined by the Administrator, in the event that prior to the RSUs vesting, Participant takes an extended leave of absence from employment with or service to a Company Group Member, then the vesting period will be tolled for the period of each extended leave of absence, with vesting to resume, subject to the other tolling provisions set forth in this Section 2.2(a), upon the Participant s return to employment or service from each such extended leave of absence. For purposes of this Agreement, any period of time that is longer than two (2) calendar weeks, whether such period is paid or unpaid, that Participant is not providing service as an employee or other service provider to a Company Group Member, and for which Participant has not utilized paid time off for the entire absence, may be considered an extended leave of absence. Any paid time off used before or after a leave of absence where the Participant does not return to employment with or service to a Company Group Member between the 
 A-2 

paid time off and leave of absence shall be considered part of a leave of absence and shall be considered when evaluating whether a leave of absence is an extended leave of absence. Unless otherwise required by Applicable Law or unless otherwise determined by the Administrator, in the event that prior to the RSUs vesting, Participant s full-time equivalent status is reduced from the full-time equivalent status (i.e. the FTE percentage the Participant was at the time of grant) that Participant had on the Grant Date, then the vesting period will be tolled for the period of time that Participant s full-time equivalent status is less than it was on the Grant Date, with vesting to resume upon Participant s return to the full-time equivalent status that Participant had on the Grant Date. 
 
 (b) Unless otherwise determined by the Administrator or as set forth in a written agreement between Participant and the Company, any RSUs and Dividend Equivalents that have not become vested on or prior to (i) the date of Participant s Termination of Service (including, without limitation, pursuant to any employment or similar agreement by and between Participant and the Company) or (ii) the sixth anniversary of the date of grant, shall be forfeited and shall not thereafter become vested.

 (i) by cash or check made payable to the Company Group Member with respect to which the withholding obligation arises 
 
 (ii) by the deduction of such amount from other compensation payable to Participant 
 
 (iii) with respect to any withholding taxes arising in connection with the distribution of the RSUs, with the consent of the Administrator, by requesting that the Company withhold a net number of Shares otherwise issuable pursuant to the RSUs having a then current Fair Market Value not exceeding the amount necessary to satisfy the withholding obligation of the Company Group based on the maximum statutory withholding rates in Participant s applicable jurisdictions for federal, state, local and foreign income tax and payroll tax purposes that are applicable to such taxable income 
 
 (iv) with respect to any withholding taxes arising in connection with the distribution of the RSUs, with the consent of the Administrator, by tendering to the Company vested Shares held for such period of time as may be required by the Administrator in order to avoid adverse accounting consequences and having a then current Fair Market Value not exceeding the amount necessary to satisfy the withholding obligation of the Company Group based on the maximum statutory withholding rates in Participant s applicable jurisdictions for federal, state, local and foreign income tax and payroll tax purposes that are applicable to such taxable income 
 
 (v) with respect to any withholding taxes arising in connection with the distribution of the RSUs, through the delivery of a notice that Participant has placed a market sell order with a broker acceptable to the Company with respect to Shares then issuable to Participant pursuant to the RSUs, and that the broker has been directed to pay a sufficient portion of the net proceeds of the sale to the Company Group Member with respect to which the withholding obligation arises in satisfaction of such withholding taxes provided that payment of such proceeds is then made to the applicable Company Group Member at such time as may be required by the Administrator, but in any event not later than the settlement of such sale or 
 
 (vi) in any combination of the foregoing. 
 
 (b) With respect to any withholding taxes arising in connection with the RSUs, in the event Participant fails to provide timely payment of all sums required pursuant to Section 2.5(a) , the Company shall have the right and option, but not the obligation, to treat such failure as an election by Participant to satisfy all or any portion of Participant s required payment obligation pursuant to Section 2.5(a)(ii) or Section 2.5(a)(iii) above, or any combination of the foregoing as the Company may determine to be appropriate. The Company shall not be obligated to deliver any certificate representing Shares issuable with respect to the RSUs to, or to cause any such Shares to be held in book-entry form by, Participant or his or her legal representative unless and until Participant or his or her legal representative shall have paid or otherwise satisfied in full the amount of all federal, state, local and foreign taxes applicable with respect to the taxable income of Participant resulting from the vesting or settlement of the RSUs or any other taxable event related to the RSUs. 
 
 (c) In the event any tax withholding obligation arising in connection with the RSUs will be satisfied under Section 2.5(a)(iii) , then the Company may elect to instruct any brokerage firm

Participant s acceptance of this Award constitutes Participant s instruction and authorization to the Company and such brokerage firm to complete the transactions described in this Section 2.5(c) , including the transactions described in the previous sentence, as applicable. The Company may refuse to issue any Shares in settlement of the RSUs to Participant until the foregoing tax withholding obligations are satisfied, provided that no payment shall be delayed under this Section 2.5(c) if such delay will result in a violation of Section 409A.

No Company Group Member makes any representation or undertaking regarding the treatment of any tax withholding in connection with the awarding, vesting or payment of the RSUs or the subsequent sale of Shares. The Company Group does not commit and is under no obligation to structure the RSUs to reduce or eliminate Participant s tax liability.
