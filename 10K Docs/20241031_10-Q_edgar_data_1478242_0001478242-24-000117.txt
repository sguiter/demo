 Accounting pronouncements issued but not adopted as of September 30, 2024 
 In November 2023, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued Accounting Standards Update ("ASU") 2023-07, Segment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures , to improve reportable segment disclosure requirements. The new guidance requires disclosure of significant segment expenses that are regularly provided to the chief operating decision maker and included in the reported measure of segment profit or loss. It does not change the definition of a segment or the guidance for determining reportable segments. The new guidance is effective for the Company in the annual period beginning January 1, 2024 and in 2025 for interim periods. Adoption of this ASU will result in additional disclosure, but it will not impact the Company s consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. 
 In December 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-09, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures , to enhance the transparency and decision usefulness of income tax disclosures. The amendments in this ASU require additional disclosures about income taxes, primarily focused on the disclosure of income taxes paid and the rate reconciliation table. The new guidance will be effective for the Company in the annual period beginning January 1, 2025. The Company is assessing the impacts of this ASU on its disclosures within the consolidated financial statements.

 Derivatives Total Liabilities: Derivatives Contingent consideration Total 
 Below is a summary of the valuation techniques used in determining fair value: 
 Marketable securities The Company values trading and available-for-sale securities using the quoted market value of the securities held. 
 Derivatives Derivatives consist of foreign exchange contracts, interest rate swaps, and cross-currency swaps. The fair value of foreign exchange contracts is based on observable market inputs of spot and forward rates or using other observable inputs. The fair value of the interest rate swaps is the estimated amount that the Company would receive or pay to terminate such agreements, taking into account market interest rates and the remaining time to maturities or using market inputs with mid-market pricing as a practical expedient for bid-ask spread. The fair value of the cross-currency swaps is the estimated amount that the Company would receive or pay to terminate such agreements, taking into account the effective interest rates, foreign exchange rates and the remaining time to maturities. 
 Contingent consideration The Company values contingent consideration related to business combinations using a weighted probability calculation of potential payment scenarios discounted at rates reflective of the risks associated with the expected future cash flows. Assumptions used to estimate the fair value of contingent consideration include various financial metrics (revenues performance targets and operating forecasts) and the probability of achieving the specific targets. Based on the assessments of the probability of achieving specific targets, as of September 30, 2024, the Company has accrued approximately of the maximum contingent consideration payments that could potentially become payable. 
 Business combinations Contingent consideration paid ) Revaluations included in earnings and foreign currency translation adjustments ) Balance as of September 30, 2024 
 The current portion of contingent consideration is included within accrued expenses and the long-term portion is included within other liabilities on the accompanying condensed consolidated balance sheets. Revaluations of contingent consideration are recognized in other expense (income), net on the accompanying condensed consolidated statements of income. A change in significant unobservable inputs could result in a higher or lower fair value measurement of contingent consideration.

 We are a global leader in protecting individual patient privacy. We use a wide variety of privacy-enhancing technologies and safeguards to protect individual privacy while generating and analyzing information on a scale that helps healthcare stakeholders identify disease patterns and correlate with the precise treatment path and therapy needed for better outcomes. Our insights and execution capabilities help biotech, medical device and pharmaceutical companies, medical researchers, government agencies, payers and other healthcare stakeholders tap into a deeper understanding of diseases, human behaviors and scientific advances, in an effort to advance their path toward cures. 
 We are managed through three reportable segments: Technology Analytics Solutions, Research Development Solutions and Contract Sales Medical Solutions. Technology Analytics Solutions provides mission critical information, technology solutions and real world insights and services to our life science clients. Research Development Solutions, which primarily serves biopharmaceutical customers, provides outsourced clinical research and clinical trial related services. Contract Sales Medical Solutions provides health care provider (including contract sales) and patient engagement services to both biopharmaceutical clients and the broader healthcare market. 
 Sources of Revenue 
 Total revenues are comprised of revenues from the provision of our services. We do not have any material product revenues. 
 Costs and Expenses 
 Our costs and expenses are comprised primarily of our cost of revenues including reimbursed expenses and selling, general and administrative expenses. Cost of revenues includes compensation and benefits for billable employees and personnel involved in production, trial monitoring, data management and delivery, and the costs of acquiring and processing data for our information offerings; costs of staff directly involved with delivering technology-related services offerings and engagements, related accommodations and the costs of data purchased specifically for technology services engagements; and other expenses directly related to service contracts such as courier fees, laboratory supplies, professional services and travel expenses. Reimbursed expenses, which are included in cost of revenues, are comprised principally of payments to investigators who oversee clinical trials and travel expenses for our clinical monitors and sales representatives. Selling, general and administrative expenses include costs related to sales, marketing and administrative functions (including human resources, legal, finance, quality assurance, compliance and general management) for compensation and benefits, travel, professional services, training and expenses for information technology and facilities. We also incur costs and expenses associated with depreciation and amortization. 
 Foreign Currency Translation 
 In the first nine months of 2024, approximately 30 of our revenues were denominated in currencies other than the United States dollar, which represents approximately 60 currencies. Because a large portion of our revenues and expenses are denominated in foreign currencies and our financial statements are reported in United States dollars, changes in foreign currency exchange rates can significantly affect our results of operations. The revenues and expenses of our foreign operations are generally denominated in local currencies and translated into United States dollars for financial reporting purposes. Accordingly, exchange rate fluctuations will affect the translation of foreign results into United States dollars for purposes of reporting our condensed consolidated results. As a result, we believe that reporting results of operations that exclude the effects of foreign currency rate fluctuations on certain financial results can facilitate analysis of period to period comparisons. This constant currency information assumes the same foreign currency exchange rates that were in effect for the comparable prior-year period were used in translation of the current period results. As such, the differences noted below between reported results of operations and constant currency information is wholly attributable to the effects of foreign currency rate fluctuations.

 The restructuring costs incurred during 2024 and 2023 were due to ongoing efforts to streamline our global operations and reduce overcapacity to adapt to changing market conditions and integrate acquisitions. These restructuring actions are expected to occur throughout 2024 and into 2025 and are expected to consist of consolidating functional activities, eliminating redundant positions and aligning resources with customer requirements.

The decrease for the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the same period in 2023 is primarily a result of lower global deposit rates. The increase for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the same period in 2023 is primarily a result of higher deposit rates. 
 Interest expense during the three months ended September 30, 2024 decreased compared to the same period in 2023 primarily due to lower debt balances. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, interest expense increased as a result of higher base rate interest costs across the floating rate debt portfolio.

 Income Tax Expense Three Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30, (in millions) 2024 2023 2024 2023 Income tax expense 65 51 189 203 
 Our effective income tax rate was 18.6 and 14.6 in the third quarter of 2024 and 2023, and 16.8 and 18.7 in the first nine months of 2024 and 2023, respectively. Our effective income tax rate in the third quarter and in the first nine months of 2024 was favorably impacted due to changes in the geographical mix of earnings amongst the United States and foreign tax jurisdictions. Our effective income tax rate in the third quarter and first nine months of 2023 was favorably impacted by a reversal of uncertain tax positions relating to tax credit carryforwards in the amount of 21 million. Our effective income tax rate in the third quarter and in the first nine months of 2024 and 2023 was also favorably impacted as a result of excess tax benefits recognized upon settlement of share-based compensation awards. For both the third quarter of 2024 and 2023 this impact was 2 million, and for the first nine months of 2024 and 2023 this impact was 14 million and 12 million, respectively. 
 Numerous foreign jurisdictions have agreed to implement the OECD's Pillar 2 global corporate minimum tax rate of 15 on companies with revenues of at least 750 million, which went into effect in 2024. We have continued to evaluate the effect of this through the end of the third quarter of 2024 and do not expect any material impacts for 2024. We will continue to monitor in future periods as additional jurisdictions enact Pillar 2 legislation.

 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 Overview 
 We assess our liquidity in terms of our ability to generate cash to fund our operating, investing and financing activities. Our principal source of liquidity is operating cash flows. In addition to operating cash flows, other significant factors that affect our overall management of liquidity include: capital expenditures, acquisitions, investments, debt service requirements, equity repurchases, adequacy of our revolving credit and receivables financing facilities, and access to the capital markets. 
 We manage our worldwide cash requirements by monitoring the funds available among our subsidiaries and determining the extent to which those funds can be accessed on a cost-effective basis. The repatriation of cash balances from certain of our subsidiaries could have adverse tax consequences; however, those balances are generally available without legal restrictions to fund ordinary business operations. We have and expect to transfer cash from those subsidiaries to the United States and to other international subsidiaries when it is cost effective to do so. 
 We had a cash balance of 1,572 million as of September 30, 2024 538 million of which was in the United States), an increase from 1,376 million as of December 31, 2023. 
 Based on our current operating plan, we believe that our available cash and cash equivalents, future cash flows from operations and our ability to access funds under our revolving credit and receivables financing facilities will enable us to fund our operating requirements, capital expenditures, contractual obligations, and meet debt obligations for at least the next 12 months. We regularly evaluate our debt arrangements, as well as market conditions, and from time to time we may explore opportunities to modify our existing debt arrangements or pursue additional financing arrangements that could result in the issuance of new debt securities by us or our affiliates. We may use our existing cash, cash generated from operations or dispositions of assets or businesses and/or proceeds from any new financing arrangements or issuances of debt or equity securities to repay or reduce some of our outstanding obligations, to repurchase shares from our stockholders or for other purposes. As part of our ongoing business strategy, we also continually evaluate new acquisition, expansion and investment possibilities or other strategic growth opportunities, as well as potential dispositions of assets or businesses, as appropriate, including dispositions that may cause us to recognize a loss on certain assets. Should we elect to pursue any such transaction, we may seek to obtain debt or equity financing to facilitate those activities. Our ability to enter into any such potential transactions and our use of cash or proceeds is limited to varying degrees by the terms and restrictions contained in our existing debt arrangements. We cannot provide assurances that we will be able to complete any such financing arrangements or other transactions on favorable terms or at all. 
 Equity Repurchase Program 
 As of September 30, 2024, the total stock repurchase authorization under our equity repurchase program (the Repurchase Program was 11,725 million. The Repurchase Program does not obligate us to repurchase any particular amount of common stock, and it may be modified, extended, suspended or discontinued at any time.

 Purchases of Equity Securities by the Issuer 
 On October 30, 2013, our Board of Directors (the "Board") approved an equity repurchase program (the Repurchase Program authorizing the repurchase of up to 125 million of our common stock. The Board increased the stock repurchase authorization under the Repurchase Program with respect to the repurchase of our common stock by 600 million, 1.5 billion, 2.0 billion, 1.5 billion, 2.0 billion, 2.0 billion, and 2.0 billion in 2015, 2016, 2017, 2018, 2019, 2022, and 2023, respectively, which increased the total amount that has been authorized under the Repurchase Program to 11,725 million. The Repurchase Program does not obligate us to repurchase any particular amount of common stock, and it may be modified, extended, suspended or discontinued at any time. The timing and amount of repurchases are determined by our management based on a variety of factors such as the market price of our common stock, our corporate requirements, and overall market conditions. Purchases of our common stock may be made in open market transactions effected through a broker-dealer at prevailing market prices, in block trades, or in privately negotiated transactions. The Repurchase Program for common stock does not have an expiration date. In addition, from time to time, we have repurchased and may continue to repurchase common stock through private or other transactions outside of the Repurchase Program. 
 From inception of the Repurchase Program through September 30, 2024, we have repurchased a total of 9,562 million of our securities under the Repurchase Program. 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we repurchased 0.8 million shares of our common stock for 200 million under the Repurchase Program. See Note 9 to our condensed consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for additional details regarding the Repurchase Program. 
 As of September 30, 2024, we had remaining authorization to repurchase up to 2,163 million of our common stock under the Repurchase Program. 
 Since the merger between Quintiles and IMS Health, we have repurchased 79.0 million shares of our common stock at an average market price per share of 116.36 for an aggregate purchase price of 9,188 million both under and outside of the Repurchase Program. This includes shares withheld from employees to satisfy certain tax obligations due in connection with grants of stock under the IQVIA Holdings Inc. 2017 Incentive and Stock Award Plan (the Plan ). The Plan provides for the withholding of shares to satisfy tax obligations. It does not specify a maximum number of shares that can be withheld for this purpose. The shares of common stock withheld to satisfy tax withholding obligations may be deemed to be issuer purchases of shares that are required to be disclosed pursuant to this Item.
