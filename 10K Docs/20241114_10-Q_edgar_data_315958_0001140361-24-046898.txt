Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations

Business Environment

The continuing uncertainty in the worldwide financial system has negatively impacted general business conditions. It is possible that a weakened economy could adversely affect our subscribers 
 discretionary spending for financial risk information, or even their solvency, but we cannot predict whether or to what extent this will occur.

Our strategic priorities and plans for 2024 are to continue to build on the improvement initiatives underway to achieve sustainable, profitable growth.

Financial Condition, Liquidity and Capital Resources

The following table presents selected financial information and statistics as September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 (dollars in thousands):

As of September 30, 2024, the Company had approximately 7.9 million in cash and cash equivalents, a decrease of approximately 3.1 million from December 31, 2023. This decrease was primarily the result of net cash
 used in investing activities, with a shift towards longer duration US Treasury securities relative to cash and cash equivalents, totaling approximately 5.3 million offset by the net cash provided by operating activities of approximately 2.2
 million.

The main component of current liabilities at September 30, 2024 was unexpired subscription revenue of approximately 10.9 million, which should not require significant future cash outlay, as this is annual
 reoccurring revenue, other than the cost of preparation and delivery of the applicable commercial credit reports, which cost much less than the unexpired subscription revenue shown. Unexpired subscription revenue is recognized as income over the
 subscription term, which approximates 12 months.

The Company has no bank lines of credit or other currently available credit sources.

The Company believes that its existing balances of cash and cash equivalents and cash generated from operations will be sufficient to satisfy its anticipated cash requirements through at least the next 12 months and
 the foreseeable future. Moreover, the Company has no long-term debt. However, the Company s liquidity could be negatively affected if it were to make an acquisition or license products or technologies as well as investment in higher skilled
 employees, which may necessitate the need to raise additional capital through future debt or equity financing. Additional financing may not be available at all or on terms favorable to the Company.

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements

The Company is not a party to any off-balance sheet arrangements.

Operating revenues increased approximately 217 thousand, or 5 , for the third quarter of fiscal 2024 compared to the same period of fiscal 2023. This overall revenue growth resulted from an increase in SaaS
 subscription product revenue, attributable to increased sales to new and existing subscribers, as well as related price increases for subscriptions.

Data and product costs increased approximately 255 thousand, or 13 , for the third quarter of fiscal 2024 compared to the same period of fiscal 2023. This increase was due primarily to (1) higher salary and related
 expenses due to new hires, pay raises to existing staff, and expansion of the expert network and (2) higher costs of third-party content due to price increases instituted by some suppliers.

Selling, general and administrative expenses decreased approximately 182 thousand, or 7 , for the third quarter of fiscal 2024 compared to the same period of fiscal 2023. This decrease was due to (1) lower salary
 and related expenses and (2) lower customer acquisition costs.

Other income increased approximately 79 thousand for the third quarter of fiscal 2024 compared to the same period of fiscal 2023. This increase was due to a higher interest rate earned on the held-to-maturity
 securities balance.

Operating revenues increased approximately 686 thousand, or 5 , for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period of fiscal 2023. This overall revenue growth resulted from an increase in SaaS
 subscription product revenue, attributable to increased sales to new and existing subscribers, as well as related price increases for subscriptions.

Data and product costs increased approximately 761 thousand, or 13 , for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period of fiscal 2023. This increase was due primarily to (1) higher salary and
 related expenses from new hires, pay raises to existing staff, and expansion of the expert network and (2) higher costs of third-party content due to price increases instituted by some suppliers.

Selling, general and administrative expenses increased approximately 455 thousand, or 6 , for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period of fiscal 2023. This
 increase was primarily due to (1) overall higher salary and related employee benefits to staff and (2) higher customer acquisition costs for the first half of the fiscal year.

Other income increased approximately 143 thousand for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period of fiscal 2023. This increase was due to a higher interest rate earned on the
 held-to-maturity securities balance.

Future Operations

The Company over time intends to expand its operations by expanding the breadth and depth of its product and service offerings and introducing new and complementary products. Gross margins attributable to new
 business areas may be lower than those associated with the Company s existing business activities.

The Company s current and future expense levels are based largely on its investment plans and estimates of future revenues. To a large extent, these costs do not vary with revenue. Sales and operating results
 generally depend on the Company s ability to attract and retain subscribers as well as the volume and timing of the subscriptions for the Company s products, which are difficult to forecast. The Company may be unable to adjust spending in a timely
 manner to compensate for any unexpected revenue shortfall. Accordingly, any significant shortfall in revenues in relation to the Company s planned expenditures would have an immediate adverse effect on the Company s business, prospects, financial
 condition and results of operations. Further, as a strategic response to changes in the competitive environment, the Company may from time to time make certain pricing, service, marketing or acquisition decisions that could have a material adverse
 effect on its business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations.

14 

Index 

Achieving greater profitability depends on the Company s ability to generate and sustain increased revenue levels. The Company believes that its success will depend in large part on its ability to (i) increase its
 brand awareness, (ii) provide its subscribers with outstanding value, thus encouraging renewals, and (iii) achieve sufficient sales volume to realize economies of scale. Accordingly, the Company intends to continue to increase the size of its sales
 force and service staff as well as invest in product development, operating infrastructure, marketing and promotion. The Company believes that these expenditures will help it to sustain the revenue growth it has experienced over the last several
 years. We anticipate that sales and marketing expenses will continue to increase in dollar amount and as a percentage of revenues into 2025 and future periods as the Company continues to expand its business on a worldwide basis. Further, the
 Company expects that product development expenses will also continue to increase in dollar amount and may increase as a percentage of revenues into 2025 and future periods because it expects to employ more development personnel on average compared
 to prior periods and build the infrastructure required to support the development of new and improved products and services. However, as some of these expenditures are discretionary in nature, the Company expects that the actual amounts incurred
 will be in line with its projections of future cash flows in order not to negatively impact its future liquidity and capital needs. There can be no assurance that the Company will be able to achieve these objectives within a meaningful time frame.

The Company expects to experience fluctuations in its future quarterly operating results due to a variety of factors, some of which are outside the Company s control. Factors that may adversely affect the Company s
 quarterly operating results include, among others, (i) the Company s ability to retain existing subscribers, attract new subscribers at a steady rate and maintain customer satisfaction, (ii) the Company s ability to maintain gross margins in its
 existing business and in future product lines and markets, (iii) the development of new services and products by the Company and its competitors, (iv) price competition, (v) the Company s ability to obtain products and services from its vendors,
 including information suppliers, on commercially reasonable terms, (vi) the Company s ability to upgrade and develop its systems and infrastructure, and adapt to technological change, (vii) the Company s ability to attract and retain personnel in a
 timely and effective manner, (viii) the Company s ability to manage effectively its development of new business segments and markets, (ix) the Company s ability to successfully manage the integration of operations and technology of acquisitions or
 other business combinations, (x) technical difficulties, system downtime, cybersecurity breaches, or Internet brownouts, (xi) the amount and timing of operating costs and capital expenditures relating the Company s business, operations and
 infrastructure, (xii) governmental regulation and taxation policies, (xiii) disruptions in service by common carriers due to strikes or otherwise, (xiv) risks of fire or other casualty, (xv) litigation costs or other unanticipated expenses, (xvi)
 interest rate risks and inflationary pressures, and (xvii) general economic conditions and economic conditions specific to the Internet and online commerce.

Due to the foregoing factors, the Company believes that period-to-period comparisons of its revenues and operating results are not necessarily meaningful and should not be relied on as an indication of future
 performance.

Forward-Looking Statements

This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q may contain forward-looking statements, including statements regarding future prospects, industry trends, competitive conditions and litigation issues. Any statements contained
 herein that are not statements of historical fact may be deemed to be forward-looking statements. Without limiting the foregoing, the words believes , expects , anticipates , plans or words of similar meaning are intended to identify
 forward-looking statements. This notice is intended to take advantage of the safe harbor provided by the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 with respect to such forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements involve a
 number of risks and uncertainties. Among others, factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the Company s beliefs or expectations are those listed under Business Environment and Results of Operations and other factors
 referenced herein or from time to time as risk factors or otherwise in the Company s Registration Statements or Securities and Exchange Commission reports. The Company disclaims any intention or obligation to revise any forward-looking statement,
 whether as a result of new information, a future event or otherwise.

Item 4. 

Controls and Procedures

The Company s management, with the participation of the Company s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, has evaluated the effectiveness of the Company s disclosure controls and procedures (as such term
 is defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended) as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based on that evaluation, the Company s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have
 concluded that, as of the end of such period, the Company s disclosure controls and procedures are effective to ensure that all material information required to be disclosed by us in reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is
 accumulated and communicated to them as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure and that all such information is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC's rules and
 forms.

There have not been any changes in the Company s internal control over financial reporting (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended) during the
 most recent fiscal quarter that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company s internal control over financial reporting.

Limitations of the Effectiveness of Internal Control

A control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the internal control system are met. Because of the inherent limitations of any
 internal control system, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues, if any, within a company have been detected.
