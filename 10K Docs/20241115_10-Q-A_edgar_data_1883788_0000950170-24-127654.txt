EXPLANATORY NOTE 

Background of the Restatement 
 On November 14, 2024, the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors of the Company, after discussions with the Company's management and its current and former independent registered public accounting firms, concluded that certain items of the Company s previously issued unaudited condensed consolidated interim financial statements as of and for the fiscal period ended June 30, 2024 included in the Company s Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q for such periods should no longer be relied upon and that the Company needed to restate those previously issued financial statements. 
 As described in Item 4.02 of the Company s Form 8-K filed with the SEC on November 14, 2024, in connection with the preparation of our unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for the fiscal quarter ended September 30, 2024, we identified certain errors in the timing of revenue and associated cost of sales recognition for two devices that were actually sold in the fiscal quarter ended June 30, 2024 as the control of these devices had been transferred to the customers in June 2024. In addition to the cutoff error discussed above, management has identified other immaterial errors related to the classification of cost of sales and other income (expense) and the classification of our warrant as equity rather than a liability. We have also corrected the immaterial errors herein. 
 Items Amended in this Filing This Form 10-Q/A sets forth the Original Filing, as amended, in its entirety; however, this Form 10-Q/A amends and restates the following Items of the Original Filing to the extent necessary to reflect the adjustments set forth in Note 2, under the caption Restatement of Previously Issued Financial Statements and to make corresponding revisions to the Company s financial data cited elsewhere in this Form 10-Q/A. 
 Part I, Item 1 - Financial Statements 
 Part I, Item 2 - Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 
 Part I, Item 4 - Controls and Procedures 
 In addition, Part II, Item 6 Exhibits of this Form 10-Q/A is amended, as the Company s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have provided new certifications dated as of the date of this filing (Exhibits 31.1, 31.2, 32.1 and 32.2), and the Company has provided its restated condensed consolidated financial statements formatted in Extensible Business Reporting Language (XBRL) in Exhibit 101. 
 Except as discussed above and as further described in Note 2 to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-Q/A, the Company has not modified or updated the disclosures presented in the Original Form 10-Q to reflect events that occurred at a later date or facts that subsequently became known to the Company. Accordingly, forward-looking statements included in this Amendment No.1 may represent management s views as of the Original Form 10-Q and should not be assumed to be accurate as of any date thereafter. Disclosures not affected by the restatement are unchanged and reflect the disclosures made at the time of the Original Filing. Accordingly, this Amended Form 10-Q should be read in conjunction with our filings with the SEC subsequent to the date on which we filed the Original Filing with the SEC.

CAUTIONARY NOTE REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS 
 This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q/A Quarterly Report contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Investors are cautioned that such forward-looking statements are based on our management s beliefs and assumptions and on information currently available to our management and involve risks and uncertainties. Forward-looking statements include statements regarding our plans, strategies, objectives, expectations and intentions, which are subject to change at any time at our discretion. Forward-looking statements include our assessment from time to time of our competitive position, the industry environment, potential growth opportunities, the effects of regulation and events outside of our control, such as natural disasters, wars or health epidemics. Forward-looking statements include all statements that are not historical facts and can be identified by terms such as anticipates, believes, could, estimates, expects, hopes, intends, may, plans, potential, predicts, projects, should, will, would or similar expressions. 
 Forward-looking statements are merely predictions and therefore inherently subject to uncertainties and other factors which could cause the actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statement. These uncertainties and other factors include, among other things: 
 unexpected technical and marketing difficulties inherent in major research and product development efforts; 

our ability to remain a market innovator, to create new market opportunities, and/or to expand into new markets; 

the potential need for changes in our long-term strategy in response to future developments; 

our ability to attract and retain skilled employees; 

our ability to raise sufficient capital to support our operations and fund our growth initiatives; 

unexpected changes in significant operating expenses, including components and raw materials; 

any disruptions or threatened disruptions to our relations with our resellers, suppliers, customers and employees, including shortages in components for our products; 

changes in the supply, demand and/or prices for our products; 

the complexities and uncertainty of obtaining and conducting international business, including export compliance and other reporting and compliance requirements; 

the impact of potential security and cyber threats or the risk of unauthorized access to our, our customers and/or our suppliers information and systems; 

changes in the regulatory environment and the consequences to our financial position, business and reputation that could result from failing to comply with such regulatory requirements; 

our ability to continue to successfully integrate acquired companies into our operations, including the ability to timely and sufficiently integrate international operations into our ongoing business and compliance programs; 

failure to develop new products or integrate new technology into current products; 

unfavorable results in legal proceedings to which we may be subject; 

failure to establish and maintain effective internal control over financial reporting; and 

general economic and business conditions in the United States and elsewhere in the world, including the impact of inflation.

Table of Contents 

You should refer to Part I, Item 1A Risk Factors of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q/A together with the Risk Factors disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for a discussion of important factors that may cause our actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied by our forward-looking statements. As a result of the risks, uncertainties and assumptions described under Risk Factors and elsewhere, we cannot assure you that the forward-looking statements in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q/A will prove to be accurate. Furthermore, if our forward-looking statements prove to be inaccurate, the inaccuracy may be material. In light of the significant uncertainties in these forward-looking statements, you should not regard these statements as a representation or warranty by us or any other person that we will achieve our objectives and plans in any specified time frame or at all. 
 You should not rely upon forward-looking statements as predictions of future events. Although we believe that the expectations reflected in the forward-looking statements are reasonable, we cannot guarantee that the future results, levels of activity, performance, or events and circumstances reflected in the forward-looking statements will be achieved or occur. We undertake no obligation to update publicly any forward-looking statements for any reason after the date of this report to conform these statements to new information, actual results or changes in our expectations, except as required by law. 
 The forward-looking statements contained in this report are based on our current expectations and beliefs concerning future developments and their potential effects on us. There can be no assurance that future developments affecting us will be those that we have anticipated. These forward-looking statements involve a number of risks, uncertainties (some of which are beyond our control) or other assumptions that may cause actual results or performance to be materially different from those expressed or implied by these forward-looking statements. These risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, those factors described under the heading Risk Factors. Should one or more of these risks or uncertainties materialize, or should any of our assumptions prove incorrect, actual results may vary in material respects from those projected in these forward-looking statements.

of DIH Nevada, which owns of DIH US Corp. DIH US Corp owns five commercial entities located in the USA, Chile, Slovenia, Germany, and Singapore. Additionally, the Company owns of Hocoma Medical GmbH, which contains the net operating assets used in the manufacturing process of the company's products. These assets were transferred from Hocoma AG, as of July 1, 2021. The intellectual property ("IP") of Hocoma AG was transferred to the commercial entity located in the USA. The legal entities of Hocoma AG and Motekforce Link BV and its subsidiaries ("Motek Group") remained with DIH Cayman and were excluded from the condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. The Company agreed to use its best efforts to complete the reorganization as defined in the Business Combination Agreement as soon as possible thereafter. The reorganization has not been completed as of the date these financial statements were issued. On February 8, 2024, the Company entered into a subscription agreement with OrbiMed, an existing shareholder of DIH Cayman. Pursuant to the agreement, the Company will issue shares of Common Stock at a purchase price of per share for aggregate purchase price of million together with warrants to purchase an additional shares of DIH Common Stock with an exercise price of . The transaction has not closed as of the date the financial statements were issued. Liquidity and Capital Resources As of June 30, 2024, the Company had million in cash and cash equivalents. The Company s sources of liquidity have been predominantly from proceeds received from product sales and services provided. The Company s sources of liquidity have enabled the Company to expand the installation base and grow its market share. The Company s net losses began in 2020 and continued through the three months ended June 30, 2024. The Company s historical operating losses resulted in an accumulated deficit of million as of June 30, 2024. Operating losses were mainly driven by decreased sales during the COVID-19 pandemic due to social distancing measures that affected demand for rehabilitation services, increased expenditures in connection with its implementation of a new financial system (Oracle) and increased compliance costs associated with the European Union Medical Device Regulation (EU MDR). Additionally, DIH had elevated costs related to efforts of adopting to public company standards. During the three months ended June 30, 2024, the Company had negative cash flows from operating activities and negative operating results. The Company continues to take steps to streamline its organization and cost structure as well as improve future revenue growth.

The Company believes that its current cash and cash equivalents, together with cash provided by operating activities will provide adequate liquidity through one year from the date that these condensed consolidated financial statements are issued. The Company has notes payable to a related party which are included in "Notes payable - related party". Each note is due on with an interest rate of as further discussed in Note 13 to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. The Company has made periodic payments on the principal and interests on the notes payable historically. The Company s future liquidity needs may vary materially from those currently planned and will depend on many factors, including the more aggressive and expansive growth plan, or for any unforeseen reductions in demand.

devices sold in June 2024. Revenue and related cost of sales for the two devices were recognized in July 2024, whereas the control of these devices had transferred to the customers in June 2024, leading to delayed revenue recognition along with cost of sales recognition. In addition to the cutoff error discussed above, the Company has identified other immaterial errors related to the classification of cost of sales and other income (expense) and the classification of our warrant as equity rather than a liability. The Company also identified other immaterial items during its review, which are collectively reflected in the restated financial statements.

million in principal amount of Original Issue Discount Senior Secured Convertible Debentures (the Debentures or Convertible Debt ). The Debentures were issued with an original issue discount of thousand, resulting in gross proceeds of approximately million and net proceeds of approximately million after deducting offering expenses and thousand deposited into a bank account as additional security for the Debentures. At election of the holder, the Debentures are convertible into an aggregate of shares of the Company s Common Stock at a conversion price of per share, subject to adjustment in whole or in part from the issuance date. The Debentures mature on , and bear interest at a rate of per annum, The Company may provide an irrevocable election to redeem some or all of the then outstanding principal amount of the Debenture (in minimum increments of thousand unless the outstanding principal amount is less than thousand) for cash. Beginning on the November 1, 2024, the Company will be required to redeem an amount of the Debentures equal to thousand, together with all other amounts owed to the Purchaser. Such amount shall be payable in cash or in shares of Common Stock based on a conversion price equal to the lesser of (i) the then Conversion Price and (ii) of the average of the five lowest VWAPs for the consecutive Trading Days ending on the trading day immediately prior to redemption date. of the principal amount of the Debentures has either previously been repaid or converted in accordance with the terms of the Debenture, the Company may elect, by notice to the holder of the Debentures, to extend the Maturity Date by six months upon the payment of six months interest on the then-outstanding principal amount. The monthly redemption amount is then adjusted to correspond to the extended maturity date. The Debentures are secured by substantially all of the assets of the Company and its domestic subsidiaries, excluding certain specified assets. Additionally, the Company s domestic subsidiaries have provided an unconditional guarantee of the Debentures. In connection with the issuance of the Debentures, the Company also issued warrants to purchase an aggregate of shares of common stock at an exercise price of per share, with a term. Upon adoption of ASU 2020-06, the Company accounted for the convertible debt along with the associated conversion feature as a single liability measured at fair value to simplify the accounting for the convertible instrument. The fair value of the convertible debt was measured using a Monte Carlo simulation model. The change in fair value is presented in other comprehensive income to the extent that it is attributable to credit risk. The remaining portion of the change in fair value is recognized in other income (expense), net in the condensed consolidated results of operations. The Company evaluated the freestanding warrants issued in connection with issuance of the convertible debt under ASC 815 and determined that they were classified as liability on the condensed consolidated balance sheets. The fair value of the warrant on the issuance date calculated using a Monte Carlo simulation model. The proceeds from the issuance of the convertible debt were allocated to the warrants and convertible note under the relative fair value method. The Monte Carlo simulation model required certain assumptions, including a risk-free rate of , a credit spread of and an estimated volatility of , respectively. The risk-free interest rate assumption was based on U.S. treasury constant maturity yields on the issuance date with a term corresponding to the expected length of the remaining term. The credit spread was derived based on the terms and economics of the instruments and to reconcile the model values of the basket (consisting of convertible notes and warrants) with the proceeds generated from the issuance and sale of the basket in an arm s-length transaction on the inception date. Due to the Company's limited trading history, the estimated volatility assumption was based upon the observed historical volatilities of the designated peer group and consideration of volatility haircut concepts, typical in practice in the valuation of convertible instruments. There was no dividend yield utilized in the Monte Carlo simulation model as the Company has not paid any cash dividends. Such assumptions were applied to both the convertible debt and warrant liability as

Item 2. Management s Discussion and Anal ysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. 
 The following discussion and analysis should be read together with the condensed consolidated financial statements and related notes that are included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q/A. The discussion and analysis should also be read together with the audited consolidated financial statements, the respective notes thereto, and other financial information included elsewhere in the Annual Report for the year ended March 31, 2024 filed by us with the SEC on July 15, 2024. The following discussion may contain forward-looking statements. Actual results could differ materially from those discussed in these forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause or contribute to these differences include those factors discussed below and elsewhere in this Form 10-Q/A, particularly in sections therein entitled Cautionary Note Concerning Forward Looking Statements and Risk Factors. 
 Our fiscal year ends on March 31. Fiscal 2025 and fiscal 2024 refer to the years ended March 31, 2025 and 2024, respectively. 
 Overview 
 DIH Holding US, Inc., a Delaware corporation and its consolidated subsidiaries are referred to in this Form 10-K as "we," our, us, the Company, or DIH. DIH is a global provider of advanced robotic devices used in physical rehabilitation, which incorporate visual stimulation in an interactive manner to enable clinical research and intensive functional rehabilitation and training in patients with walking impairments, reduced balance and/or impaired arm and hand functions. We strive to serve the rehabilitation market by providing a broad array of devices and services focused on the customer and patient recovery. DIH stands for our vision to Deliver Inspiration Health to improve the daily lives of millions of people with disabilities and functional impairments. 
 In the three months ended June 30, 2024, DIH generated revenue of 17.0 million compared to 13.0 million in the three months ended June 30, 2023. 
 DIH s net loss for three months ended June 30, 2024 was 0.3 million, compared to 2.9 million in the three months ended June 30, 2023. The 2.6 million improvement was primarily driven by the 4.1 million increase in gross profit and 2.0 million increase in other income (expense) primarily driven by foreign exchange rate fluctuation. The increase in the gross profit is primarily due to the increase in sales volume. The net loss improvement was partially offset by elevated professional service costs and IT costs related to audit, legal and other professional services, incurred to enhance our infrastructure and operations as a public company following the recent business combination. 
 Recent Developments 
 Business Combination 
 On February 7, 2024, ATAK, Aurora Technology Merger Sub Merger Sub and DIH Nevada consummated a previously announced business combination pursuant to the Business Agreement dated as of February 26, 2023 following the receipt of the required approval by ATAK s and DIH Nevada s shareholders and the fulfillment or waiver of other customary closing conditions. ATAK agreed to waive the closing condition that the Reorganization be completed prior to Closing. As a result, at Closing of the Business Combination, the Company includes Hocoma Medical that holds assets transferred from Hocoma AG as well as other commercial entities controlled by the Company. Hocoma AG and Motekforce Link BV and its subsidiaries were excluded from the reorganization and are not included in the consolidated financials. The Company agreed to use its best efforts to complete the intended Reorganization to transfer Hocoma AG and Motek to the Company as soon as possible thereafter. 
 As a consequence of the Business Combination, the Company became the successor to an SEC-registered company, which required DIH to hire additional personnel and implement procedures and processes to address public company regulatory requirements and customary practices. DIH expects to incur additional annual expenses as a public company for, among other things, directors and officers liability insurance, director fees and additional internal and external accounting and legal and administrative resources, including increased audit and legal fees.

Issuance of Convertible Debt 
 On June 6, 2024, the Company entered into a Securities Purchase Agreement, issuing 3.3 million in principal amount of 8 Original Issue Discount Senior Secured Convertible Debentures ("Debentures"), resulting in net proceeds of approximately 2.5 million after estimated expenses and 300 thousand initially deposited into a bank account pending fulfillment of certain conditions. The Debentures, maturing on December 7, 2025, are convertible into 660,000 shares of Common Stock at a 5.00 per share conversion price, and are secured by substantially all of the Company s domestic assets, with guarantees from domestic subsidiaries. In connection, the Company also issued warrants to purchase 330,000 shares of Common Stock at 5.00 per share. For further details, see Note 12 to the condensed consolidated financial statements . 
 Key Factors Affecting the DIH s Operating Results 
 DIH believes that its future success and financial performance depend on a number of factors that present significant opportunities for its business, but also pose risks and challenges, including those discussed below and in the Section of described in Part I, Item 1A, Risk Factors, of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended March 31, 2024 entitled Item 1a. Risk Factors. 
 Supply Chain and Inflation 
 The global supply chain and logistics challenges continue to impact DIH and the industry. As a result of these challenges, DIH has experienced cost increases for freight and logistics, raw materials and purchased components, and has incurred increased manufacturing conversion costs. While, to date, the supply chain disruptions have not materially affected DIH s business outlook or its operating results, including its revenue, liquidity, and capital resources and, consequently, DIH has not implemented any mitigation efforts as a result, DIH cannot predict the impact of any future or prolonged supply chain disruptions or any mitigation efforts it may need take going forward. For example, as a result of supply chain disruptions, DIH may be required to extend the overall shipment and installation timeline. In addition, DIH may consider additional or alternative third-party manufacturers and logistics providers, suppliers, vendors or distributors. Such mitigation efforts may result in cost increases and any attempts to offset such increases with price increases may result in reduced sales, customer dissatisfaction, or otherwise harm DIH s business. Further, if DIH were to elect to transition or add manufacturers or logistics providers, suppliers, vendors or distributors, it may result in delays in shipments of products or risks related to consistent product quality or reliability. This in turn may limit DIH s ability to fulfill customer sales orders and DIH may be unable to satisfy all of the demand for its products. DIH may also be required to purchase components further in advance of product delivery, which in return could result in less capital being allocated to other activities such as marketing and other business needs. DIH cannot quantify the impact on its business, financial condition and results of operations of any such disruptions at this time or predict the impact of that any mitigation efforts may have. 
 Input cost inflation historically has not been a material factor to our gross margin; however, beginning at the end of fiscal 2022 DIH began to experience increases in raw material and components costs due to inflation effects, which are expected to continue to remain at elevated levels for at least the near term. 
 Foreign Currency Fluctuations 
 DIH s business operates in four different functional currencies (U.S. Dollar, Euro, Swiss Franc, Singapore Dollar). DIH s reporting currency is the U.S. Dollar. DIH s results are affected by fluctuations in currency exchange rates that give rise to translational exchange rate risks. The extent of such fluctuations is determined in part by global economic conditions and macro-economic trends. Movements in exchange rates have a direct impact on DIH s reported revenues. Generally, the impact on operating income or loss associated with exchange rate changes on reported revenues is partially offset from exchange rate impacts on operating expenses denominated in the same functional currencies. As foreign currency exchange rates change, translation of the statements of operations of DIH s international businesses into U.S. dollars may affect year-over-year comparability of DIH s operating results.

EU MDR Implementation Costs 
 Changes in laws or regulations could make it more difficult and costly for DIH and its subsidiaries to manufacture, market, and distribute its products or obtain or maintain regulatory approval of new or modified products. DIH s experience with the transition to the EU MDR, which it began in 2019, showed how complex, time-consuming and expensive a change in Medical Device Legislation can be. The EU MDR replaced the existing European Medical Devices Directive (MDD) and Active Implantable Medical Device Directive (AIMDD) regulatory frameworks, and manufacturers of medical devices were required to comply with EU MDR beginning in May 2021 for new product registrations and by May 2024 for medical devices which have a valid CE Certificate to the prior Directives (issued before May 2021). Updates to the legislative text of the EU MDR were adopted by the European Parliament and are currently being reviewed for adoption by the Council of the European Union, including an extension of the transitional period to 2027 for class IIb and III and 2028 for class I and IIa medical devices which have a valid CE Certificate to the prior Directives (issued before May 2021). 
 Macroeconomic Uncertainties on Future Operations 
 DIH s operations are exposed to and impacted by various global macroeconomic factors. DIH faces continuing market and operating challenges across the globe due to, among other factors, impact of conflict in Ukraine, conditions related to the COVID-19 pandemic, supply chain disruption, higher interest rates and inflationary pressures. Continued evolution of these conditions could lead to economic slowdowns. 
 Basis of Presentation 
 Refer to Note 2 of the Notes to Annual Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of the underlying basis used to prepare the condensed consolidated financial statements. 
 Components of Results of Operations 
 Revenue 
 DIH generates revenue from the sale of medical rehabilitation devices and technology. DIH s primary customers include healthcare systems, clinics, third-party healthcare providers, distributors, and other institutions, including governmental healthcare programs and group purchasing organizations.

Revenue for the three months ended June 30, 2024 increased by 3.9 million, or 30.0 , to 17.0 million from 13.0 million for the three months ended June 30, 2023. The overall increase was primarily due to an increase in devices sold of 3.1 million, or 29.5 year over year. The increase in devices revenue was primarily driven by higher sales volume in EMEA. Services revenue represented an increase of 0.9 million, up 38.9 compared to the prior period. Other revenues was consistent compared to the prior period. Total revenue in the EMEA and in the Americas increased by 4.4 million and 1.6 million, respectively, to 11.0 million and 4.5 million for the three months ended June 30, 2024 compared to 6.6 million and 3.0 million for the three months ended June 30, 2023. The increase was partially offset by a decrease in sales in Asia. 
 The impact due to foreign currency translation resulted in a decrease of approximately 0.1 million for the three months ended June 30, 2024. 
 Cost of Sales 
 Cost of sales for the three months ended June 30, 2024 decreased by 0.1 million, or 1.9 , to 7.5 million from 7.6 million for the three months ended June 30, 2023. The cost of sales for device sales decreased by 0.4 million for the three months ended June 30, 2024 compared to the three months ended June 30, 2023. The cost of device sales increased by 0.7 million correlated to the increase in device sales for the additional volume. An inventory reserve and provisions of approximately 1.1 million were recognized in the three months ended June 30, 2023, while the impact from inventory reserve and provisions was insignificant in the three months ended June 30, 2024. The decrease in cost of device sales was partially offset by an increase of 0.3 million in cost of services. 
 The impact due to foreign currency translation resulted in a decrease of approximately 0.1 million for the three months ended June 30, 2024. 
 Selling, General and Administrative Expense 
 Selling, general and administrative expense for the three months ended June 30, 2024 increased by 2.8 million, or 47.5 , to 8.6 million from 5.8 million for the three months ended June 30, 2023. The increase was driven by a 0.5 million increase in professional service costs related to audit, legal and other professional services along with an investment in finance capacity to support public company reporting obligations. Additionally, the increase included a 0.7 million increase in performance-based compensation and a 0.9 million increase in overhead expenses associated with operating as a public company and supporting current growth. In addition, the provision for credit losses decreased during the three months ended June 30, 2023 and the provision has remained consistent in subsequent periods through the three months ended June 30, 2024. 
 Research and Development 
 Research and development costs for the three months ended June 30, 2024 increased by 0.2 million, or 14.3 , to 1.6 million from 1.4 million for the three months ended June 30, 2023. The increase was primarily attributable to a 0.2 million increase in personnel expenses related to increased employee compensation. 
 Interest Expense 
 Interest expense for three months ended June 30, 2024 and 2023 were consistent to interest on Related Party Notes and bank charges.

Table of Contents 

Other Income (Expense), Net 
 Other income (expense), net for the three months ended June 30, 2024 was 1.3 million of income, compared to 0.7 million of expense for the three months ended June 30, 2023. The change was primarily driven by the fluctuation in the exchange rate, as the Swiss Franc weakened against to the U.S. dollar in the three months ended June 30, 2024. 
 Income Tax Expense 
 Income tax expense for the three months ended June 30, 2024 increased by 0.5 million compared to 0.2 million in the three months ended June 30, 2023. The change was primarily driven by changes in the net results of the underlying subsidiaries across jurisdictions. The tax expense for the three months ended June 30, 2024 and 2023 is driven by pre-tax book income in certain jurisdictions while the benefit from pre-tax losses in other jurisdiction may not be realizable. 
 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 As of June 30, 2024 and March 31 2024, DIH s cash and cash equivalents amounted to 2.7 million and 3.2 million, respectively. DIH s sources of liquidity have been predominantly from proceeds received from product sales and services provided as well as proceeds from convertible debt financing in June 2024. DIH s sources of liquidity have enabled DIH to expand its installation base, capacity, and grow its sales personnel to expand capabilities and enter new markets. 
 DIH s operating losses began in fiscal 2020 and continued through the three months ended June 30, 2024. DIH s historical operating losses resulted in an accumulated deficit of (35.5) million as of June 30, 2024. Operating losses were mainly driven by decreased sales during the COVID-19 pandemic due to social distancing measures that affected demand for rehabilitation services, increased expenditures in connection with its implementation of a new financial system (Oracle) and increased compliance costs associated with the EU MDR. Additionally, DIH had elevated costs related to its efforts of adopting to public company standards. During the three months ended June 30, 2024, DIH had negative cash flows from operating activities of (2.0) million and an operating loss of 0.8 million. Management's plan to transition towards profitability is supported by DIH's ongoing efforts to streamline its organizational structure and enhance cost management through digitization investments such as the Oracle system implementation, alongside initiatives to grow revenue. 
 DIH s gross revenue has increased by 30.0 , from 13.0 million to 17.0 million for the three months ended June 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. DIH plans to continue to fund its growth through cash flows from operations and future debt and equity financings. Management expects that its cash and cash equivalents, together with cash provided by our operating activities and proceeds from future debt and equity financings, will be sufficient to fund its operating expenses and capital expenditures requirements for at least the next 12 months. 
 In connection with the transfer of Hocoma AG's business and assets to DIH, we incurred three related party notes payable to Hocoma AG as further discussed in Note 13 of the Notes to Annual Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. The three Related Party Notes amounting to 10.47 million, 7.80 million and 1.57 million reflect transferring the assets, equity ownership in subsidiaries and IP rights it held to Legacy DIH. Each of the Related Party Notes Payable is due on June 30, 2026 with interest rate of 1.25 . The Company has made periodic payment on Related Party Notes payable with proceeds from its operations. The remaining balance on the Related Party Notes payable is 10.7 million and 11.5 million as of June 30, 2024 and March 31, 2024, respectively. We expect to continue our growth and generate sufficient proceeds to pay the balance of Related Party Notes payable over time. 
 In June 2024, we strengthened our liquidity position through the issuance of 8 Original Issue Discount Senior Secured Convertible Debentures, resulting in net proceeds of approximately 2.5 million after offering expenses, with 300,000 of the proceeds deposited into a bank account pending the fulfillment of certain conditions. For additional details, including the terms and conditions of these Debentures and associated warrants, please refer to Note 12 to the condensed consolidated financial statements 
 DIH s other material contractual operating cash commitments at June 30, 2024 relate to leases and employee benefit plans. DIH s employee benefit plans are discussed further in Note 14 of the Notes to Annual Consolidated Financial Statements. DIH s long-term lease obligations and future payments are discussed further in Note 17 of the Notes to Annual Consolidated Financial Statements .

Net Cash used in Operating Activities 
 Net cash used in operating activities increased by 1.5 million to 2.0 million for the three months ended June 30, 2024 compared to 0.5 million for the three months ended June 30, 2023 primarily driven by: 
 Decrease of net loss of 2.6 million. The primary driver was increased gross profit due to increased sales volume offset by increased operating expenses. The reduction in net loss was also driven by 2.0 million in other income (loss) as a result of the fluctuation in the exchange rate, as the Swiss Franc weakened against to the U.S. dollar in the three months ended June 30, 2024. 

Net decrease of 2.9 million in non-cash charges was due to a 2.6 million increase in foreign exchange gain to 1.9 million as compared to a foreign exchange loss of 0.7 million in the first quarter of Fiscal 2024, which is primarily attributable to the fluctuation in the exchange rate, as the Swiss Franc weakened against the U.S. dollar. The decreases in non-cash charges were offset by a decrease in provision for credit losses of 0.4 million during the three month ended June 30, 2023. 

Net decrease of 1.3 million relating to changes in working capital was driven by a decrease of 3.4 million in advanced payments from customer for the three months ended June 30, 2024 compared to the three months ended June 30, 2023 primarily due to the timing of the order received. The decrease was also due to a 1.6 million net decrease in due from related parties and due to related parties driven by the Company s purchases from the Motek Group and change in balance from Hocoma AG. We also experienced a total decrease of 0.5 million in accounts receivable and accounts payable. 

This decrease in working capital was partially offset by an increase of 1.2 million in deferred revenue 	resulted from the difference in timing of payments received from our customers related to service 		contracts, 1.6 million of accrued expense and other liabilities as well as 1.5 million increase in 		employee compensation accrued. 
 Net Cash used in Investing Activities 
 Net cash used in investing activities increased by 0.2 million for the three months ended June 30, 2024. The cash used in investing activities primarily includes purchase of property and equipment. DIH expects to fund future cash flows used in investing activities with cash flow generated by operations. 
 Net Cash (used in) / provided by Financing Activities 
 Net cash (used in)/provided by financing activities increased by 3.7 million to 1.8 million for the three months ended June 30, 2024 compared to (1.9) million for the three months ended June 30, 2023. The increase was primarily due to the 2.5 million proceeds from the convertible debt financing net of transaction fee and 0.3 million that was deposited to a secured account and a 1.2 million decrease in payments on related party notes payable resulting from the asset transfer from Hocoma AG.

Table of Contents 

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 
 DIH s financial statements are based on the selection and application of significant accounting policies, which require management to make significant estimates and assumptions. Management believes that the following are some of the more critical judgment areas in the application of accounting policies that currently affect DIH s financial condition and results of operations. 
 Revenue Recognition 
 Sales are recognized as the performance obligations to deliver products or services are satisfied and are recorded based on the amount of consideration DIH expects to receive in exchange for satisfying the performance obligations. DIH s sales are recognized primarily when it transfers control to the customer, which can be on the date of shipment of the product, the date of receipt of the product by the customer or upon completion of any required product installation service depending on the terms of the sales contracts and product shipping terms. The sales amount of warranties are deferred and recognized as revenue on a straight-line basis over the warranty period. 
 We provide a variety of products and services to our customers. Most of our contracts consist of a single, distinct performance obligation or promise to transfer goods or services to a customer. For contracts that include multiple performance obligations, we allocate the total transaction price to each performance obligation using our best estimate of the standalone selling price of each identified performance obligation. 
 Deferred revenue primarily represents service contracts and equipment maintenance, for which consideration is received in advance of when service for the device or equipment is provided, and a smaller component of product shipments where a residual installation service is to be completed. Revenue related to services contracts and equipment maintenance is recognized over the service period as time elapses. Revenues related to products containing an installation clause, are recognized once the item is confirmed installed. 
 Employee Benefit Plans 
 DIH has defined contribution plans or benefit pension plans covering substantially all of its employees. We recognize a liability for the underfunded status of the single employer defined benefit plans. Actuarial gains or losses and prior service costs or credits are recorded within other comprehensive income (loss). The determination of our obligation and related expense for our sponsored pensions is dependent, in part, on management s selection of certain actuarial assumptions in calculating these amounts. 
 The actuarial assumptions used for the defined benefit plans are based on the economic conditions prevailing in the jurisdiction in which they are offered. Changes in the defined benefit obligation are most sensitive to changes in the discount rate. The discount rate is based on the yield of high-quality corporate bonds quoted in an active market in the currency of the respective plan. A decrease in the discount curve increases the defined benefit obligation. DIH regularly reviews the actuarial assumptions used in calculating the defined benefit obligation to determine their continuing relevance. We utilized weighted discount rates of 1.50 and 2.10 for our pension plan expenses for fiscal 2024 and fiscal 2023, respectively. 
 Sensitivity to changes in the discount rate used in the calculation of our pension plan liabilities is illustrated below (dollars in millions).

Income Taxes 
 DIH accounts for income taxes in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification Topic 740, Income Taxes (Topic 740). Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating loss and other loss carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. DIH reviews its deferred income tax asset valuation allowances on a quarterly basis or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that a review is required. In determining the requirement for a valuation allowance, the historical and projected financial results of the legal entity or combined group recording the net deferred income tax asset is considered, along with any positive or negative evidence including tax law changes. Since future financial results and tax law may differ from previous estimates, periodic adjustments to DIH s valuation allowances may be necessary. DIH has generated operating losses in each of the years presented. 
 DIH is subject to income taxes in the U.S. and numerous foreign jurisdictions These tax laws and regulations are complex and significant judgment is required in determining DIH s worldwide provision for income taxes and recording the related deferred tax assets and liabilities. 
 In the ordinary course of DIH s business, there are transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. Accruals for unrecognized tax benefits are provided for in accordance with the requirements of Topic 740. An unrecognized tax benefit represents the difference between the recognition of benefits related to items for income tax reporting purposes and financial reporting purposes. DIH s tax returns are subject to regular review and audit by US and non-US tax authorities. Although the outcome of tax audits is always uncertain, DIH believes that it has appropriate support for the positions taken on its tax returns and that its annual tax provision includes amounts sufficient to pay any assessments. Nonetheless, the amounts ultimately paid, if any, upon resolution of the issues raised by the taxing authorities may differ materially from the amounts accrued for each year and would be the obligation of Parent. DIH accrues interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions as a component of income tax expense. 
 Refer to Note 15 of the Notes to Annual Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion regarding DIH s income taxes. 
 Emerging Growth Company Status 
 The Company is an emerging growth company, as defined in Section 2(a) of the Securities Act, as modified by the JOBS Act, and it may take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not emerging growth companies including, but not limited to, not being required to comply with the independent registered public accounting firm attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in its periodic reports and proxy statements, and exemptions from the requirements of holding a nonbinding advisory vote on executive compensation and shareholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. 
 
 Further, Section 102(b)(1) of the JOBS Act exempts emerging growth companies from being required to comply with new or revised financial accounting standards until private companies (that is, those that have not had a Securities Act registration statement declared effective or do not have a class of securities registered under the Exchange Act) are required to comply with the new or revised financial accounting standards. The JOBS Act provides that a company can elect to opt out of the extended transition period and comply with the requirements that apply to non-emerging growth companies but any such election to opt out is irrevocable. The Company has elected not to opt out of such extended transition period which means that when a standard is issued or revised and it has different application dates for public or private companies, the Company, as an emerging growth company, can adopt the new or revised standard at the time private companies adopt the new or revised standard. This may make comparison of the Company s financial statements with another public company which is either not an emerging growth company or an emerging growth company which has opted out of using the extended transition period difficult or impossible because of the potential differences in accounting standards used.

New Accounting Standards Not Yet Adopted 
 For the summary of recent accounting pronouncements, see Note 2 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies to our condensed consolidated financial statements included in this Quarterly Report. 
 Ite m 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk. 
 As a smaller reporting company as defined by Item 10 of Regulation S-K, DIH is not required to provide this information. 
 Item 4. Controls and Procedures. 
 
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 
 Disclosure controls and procedures are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in our Exchange Act reports is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial and accounting officer or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 
 Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and the Company s Chief Financial Officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d- 15(e) under the Exchange Act) as of end of the period covered by this report. Based on this evaluation, our principal executive officer and principal financial and accounting officer have concluded that during the period covered by this report, our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective due to material weaknesses in our internal controls over financial reporting. Specifically, the Company concluded that it had limited accounting personnel and other resources with which to address its internal control over financial reporting in accordance with requirements applicable to public companies. Such material weakness contributed to the restatement of our financial statements as described in this Amendment No. 1 to our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q/A for the three months ended June 30, 2024. In light of the material weakness, we performed additional analysis as deemed necessary to ensure that our financial statements were prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Accordingly, management believes that the financial statements included in this Annual Report present fairly in all material respects our financial position, results of operations and cash flows for the periods presented. 
 Inherent Limitations on Effectiveness of Controls 
 In designing and evaluating our disclosure controls and procedures, management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives. In addition, the design of disclosure controls and procedures must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and that management is required to apply judgment in evaluating the benefits of possible controls and procedures relative to their costs. 
 Remediation Plan 
 We are implementing measures designed to improve our internal controls over financial reporting to remediate this material weakness including adding additional qualified accounting personnel, engaging consultants to assist with the financial statement close process and evaluate accounting treatment of significant unusual transactions, and segregating duties among accounting personnel to enable adequate review controls. These additional resources and procedures are intended to enable us to broaden the scope and quality of our internal review of underlying information related to financial reporting and to formalize and enhance our internal control procedures. 
 The material weakness will not be considered remediated until our remediation plan has been fully implemented, the applicable controls operate for a sufficient period of time, and we have concluded, through testing, that the newly implemented and enhanced controls are operating effectively. We are continuing to work on the implementation of our remediation plan, following which we will continue to test such controls over time.
