Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements 

In addition, the number of shares of common stock issuable upon the exercise of the Company s equity awards, convertible
securities and warrants was proportionally decreased, and the corresponding conversion price or exercise price was proportionally increased.
No fractional shares were issued as a result of the 2023 Reverse Split. 

On
April 25, 2024, the number of shares of common stock issuable upon the exercise of the Company s equity awards, convertible
securities and warrants was proportionally decreased, and the corresponding conversion price or exercise price was proportionally increased.
No fractional shares were issued as a result of the 2024 Reverse Split. 

Accordingly,
all share and per share amounts for all periods presented in these financial statements and notes thereto have been adjusted retroactively,
where applicable, to reflect the 2023 Reverse Split and the 2024 Reverse Split and adjustment of the conversion price or exercise price
of each outstanding equity award, convertible security and warrant as if the transaction had occurred as of the beginning of the earliest
period presented. See Note 7 Stockholders Permanent and Temporary Equity Reverse Stock Split. 

million and a working capital deficit of approximately million.
During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company incurred a net loss of approximately million and used cash in operations
of approximately million. The Company has an accumulated deficit of approximately million as of September 30, 2024. 

The
Company has not yet achieved profitability and expects to continue to incur cash outflows from operations. It is expected that its research
and development and general and administrative expenses will continue to increase and, as a result, the Company will eventually need
to generate significant product revenues to achieve profitability. 

Consequently,
the Company will be required to raise additional funds through equity or debt financing. Subsequent to September 30, 2024, the Company
raised an aggregate of 
 million from stock warrant exercises and
its at-the-market facility. See Note 8 Subsequent Events for additional details. 
Management believes that the Company has access to capital resources and continues to evaluate additional financing opportunities; however,
there can be no assurance that it will be successful in securing additional capital or that the Company will be able to obtain funds
on commercially acceptable terms, if at all. There is also no assurance that the amount of funds the Company might raise will enable
the Company to complete its development initiatives or attain profitable operations. The aforementioned conditions raise substantial
doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern for at least one year from the issuance date of these financial
statements.

Effective tax rate 

The
tax provisions for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 were computed using the estimated effective tax rates applicable
to the taxable jurisdictions for the full year. The Company s tax rate is subject to management s quarterly review and revision,
as necessary. The Company s effective tax rate was ) and for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The
decrease in the quarterly rates is primarily the result of the Company recording a full valuation allowance during the nine months ended
September 30, 2024 due to the reversal of a significant deferred tax liability that existed as of September 30, 2023. 

and , respectively.
The June 30, 2024 invoice represents retroactive interest on invoices going back to September 30, 2022. The July 1, 2024 invoice consisted
of miscellaneous unsupported charges performed over the past several years. On August 1, 2024, ZyVersa management sent the vendor a letter
disputing these invoices and has requested the vendor to rescind each of them. The Company received additional invoices dated July 31,
2024, August 31, 2024, and September 30, 2024 in the amounts of , , and , respectively. Similar to the prior invoices, management
has requested the vendor to rescind each of them. Although the Company has requested the vendor to rescind each of them, the Company
believes that in accordance with the agreement, the vendor can legally charge the Company interest from the point they were notified.
As such, the Company included the calculated interest from July 1, 2024 to September 30, 2024 of within accrued expenses and
other current liabilities on the condensed consolidated balance sheet at September 30, 2024.

Effectiveness
Failure 

In
connection with the business combination with Larkspur Health Acquisition Corp., the Company conducted the Series A Preferred Stock Financing.
On or about February 20, 2023, the Company failed to have the SEC declare a registration statement effective (the Effectiveness
Failure which covered the Series A Preferred Stock registrable securities within the time period prescribed by the Securities
Purchase Agreement (the SPA ). The SPA entitles the investors to receive registration delay payments Registration
Delay Payments equal to of each investor s purchase price on the date of the Effectiveness Failure and every thirty
days thereafter that the Effectiveness Failure persists. Failure to make the Registration Delay Payments on a timely basis result in
the accrual of interest at the rate of per month. On April 28, 2023, the proceeds from the April 2023 Offering were used to make
most of the Registration Delay Payments and redeem substantially all of the Series A Preferred Stock. As of September 30, 2024, the Company
has accrued additional Registration Delay Payments of approximately in the aggregate. 

million in gross proceeds from the sale of shares of its common
stock pursuant to its ATM Agreement with A.G.P. for its at-the-market facility.

ITEM
2. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 

The
following discussion and analysis of the results of operations and financial condition of ZyVersa Therapeutics, Inc. (the Company, 
 we, us or our as of September 30, 2024 and for the three and nine months ended September 30,
2024 and 2023 should be read in conjunction with our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements and the notes to those financial
statements that are included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. This discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction
with the Company s audited financial statements and related disclosures as of December 31, 2023 and for the year then ended, which
are included in the Form 10-K (the Annual Report filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission SEC on March 25, 2024, as amended on May 15, 2024. This Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
Operations contains statements that are forward-looking. These statements are based on current expectations and assumptions that are
subject to risk, uncertainties and other factors. These statements are often identified by the use of words such as may, 
 will, expect, believe, anticipate, intend, could, 
 estimate, or continue, and similar expressions or variations. Actual results could differ materially because
of the factors discussed in Risk Factors in our Annual Report, and other factors that we may not know. Except as otherwise
required by applicable law, we disclaim any duty to update any forward-looking statements, all of which are expressly qualified by the
statements above, to reflect events or circumstances after the date of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. 

Business
Overview 

We
are a clinical stage specialty biopharmaceutical company leveraging advanced proprietary technologies to develop first-in-class drugs
for patients with inflammatory or kidney diseases with high unmet medical needs. We are well positioned in the rapidly emerging inflammasome
space with a highly differentiated monoclonal antibody, Inflammasome ASC Inhibitor IC 100, and in kidney disease with phase 2 Cholesterol
Efflux Mediator TM VAR 200. The lead indication for IC 100 is obesity and its associated metabolic complications, and for VAR
200, focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS). Each therapeutic area offers a pipeline within a product, with potential
for numerous indications. The total accessible market is over 100 billion. 

Financial
Operations Overview 

We
have not generated any revenue to date and have incurred significant operating losses. Our net losses were 8.0 million for the period
from January 1, 2024 through September 30, 2024, compared to 85.0 million for the period from January 1, 2023 through September 30,
2023. As of September 30, 2024, we had an accumulated deficit of approximately 111.2 million and cash of 0.1 million. We expect to
continue to incur significant expenses for the foreseeable future and to incur operating losses. We expect our expenses will increase
in connection with our ongoing activities as we: 

progress
 development of VAR 200 and IC 100; 

prepare
 and file regulatory submissions; 

begin
 to manufacture our product candidates for clinical trials; 

hire
 additional research and development, finance, and general and administrative personnel; 

protect
 and defend our intellectual property; and 

meet
 the requirements of being a public company. 

We
will need additional financing to support our continuing operations. We will seek to fund our operations through public or private equity
or debt financings or other sources, which may include government grants and collaborations with third parties. Adequate additional financing
may not be available to us on acceptable terms, or at all. Our failure to raise capital as and when needed would have a negative impact
on our financial condition and our ability to pursue our business strategy. We will need to generate significant revenues to achieve
profitability, and we may never do so. 

13 

Components
of Operating Results 

Revenue 

Since
inception, we have not generated any revenue and do not expect to generate any revenue from the sale of products in the near future.
If our development efforts for our product candidates are successful and result in regulatory approval, or if we enter into collaboration
or license agreements with third parties, we may generate revenue in the future from a combination of product sales or payments from
collaboration or license agreements. 

Operating
Expenses 

Research
and Development Expenses 

Research
and development expenses consist of costs incurred in the discovery and development of our product candidates, and primarily include: 

expenses
 incurred under third party agreements with contract research organizations CROs ), and investigative sites, that conducted
 or will conduct our clinical trials and a portion of our pre-clinical activities; 

costs
 of raw materials, as well as manufacturing cost of our materials used in clinical trials and other development testing; 

expenses,
 including salaries, stock-based compensation and benefits of employees engaged in research and development activities; 

costs
 of equipment, depreciation and other allocated expenses; and 

fees
 paid for contracted regulatory services as well as fees paid to regulatory authorities including the U.S. Food and Drug Administration
 (the FDA for review and approval of our product candidates. 

We
expense research and development costs as incurred. Costs for external development activities are recognized based on an evaluation of
the progress to completion of specific tasks using information provided to us by our vendors. Payments for these activities are based
on the terms of the individual agreements, which may differ from the pattern of costs incurred, and are reflected in our financial statements
as prepaid expenses or accrued expenses. 

Research
and development activities are central to our business model. We expect that our research and development expenses will continue to increase
for the foreseeable future as we continue clinical development for our product candidates. As products enter later stages of clinical
development, they will generally have higher development costs than those in earlier stages of clinical development, primarily due to
the increased size and duration of later-stage clinical trials. Historically, our research and development costs have primarily related
to the development of VAR 200 and IC 100. As we advance VAR 200 and IC 100, as well as identify any other potential product candidates,
we will continue to allocate our direct external research and development costs to the products. We expect to fund our research and development
expenses from our current cash and cash equivalents and any future equity or debt financings, or other capital sources, including potential
collaborations with other companies or other strategic transactions. 

The
successful development of our product candidates is highly uncertain. At this time, we cannot reasonably estimate or know the nature,
timing and costs of the efforts that will be necessary to complete the remainder of the development of, or when, if ever, material net
cash inflows may commence from our product candidates. This uncertainty is due to the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with
the duration and cost of clinical trials, which vary significantly over the life of a project as a result of many factors, including: 

the
 number of clinical sites included in the clinical trials; 

the
 length of time required to enroll suitable patients; 

the
 size of patient populations participating in the clinical trials; 

the
 number of doses a patient receives; 

the
 duration of patient follow-ups; 

the
 development state of the product candidates; and 

the
 efficacy and safety profile of the product candidates. 

Our
expenditures are subject to additional uncertainties, including the terms and timing of regulatory approvals, and the expense of filing,
prosecuting, defending and enforcing any patent claims or other intellectual property rights. We may never succeed in achieving regulatory
approval for our product candidates. We may obtain unexpected results from our clinical trials. We may elect to discontinue, delay or
modify clinical trials of our product candidates. A change in the outcome of any of these variables with respect to the development of
a product candidate could mean a significant change in the costs and timing associated with the development of that product candidate.
For example, if the FDA or other regulatory authorities were to require us to conduct clinical trials beyond those that we currently
anticipate, or if we experience significant delays in enrollment in any of our clinical trials, we could be required to expend significant
additional financial resources and time on the completion of clinical development. Product commercialization will take several years
and likely millions of dollars in development costs. 

14 

General
and Administrative Expenses 

General
and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries, stock-based compensation and related costs for our employees in administrative,
executive and finance functions. General and administrative expenses also include professional fees for legal, accounting, audit, tax
and consulting services, insurance, human resource, information technology, office, and travel expenses. 

We
expect that our general and administrative expenses will increase in the future as we increase our general and administrative headcount
to support our continued research and development and potential commercialization of our product candidates. We also expect to incur
substantial expenses associated with being a public company, including costs of accounting, audit, legal, regulatory and tax compliance
services, director and officer insurance, and investor and public relations costs.

Research
and Development Expenses 

Research
and development expenses were approximately 0.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, a decrease of approximately 0.2
million or 35.3 from the three months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease is primarily attributable to a decrease of 0.2 million
in the manufacturing and pre-clinical costs of IC 100 and VAR 200. 

General
and Administrative Expenses 

General
and administrative expenses were approximately 1.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, a decrease of approximately
 0.4 million or 17.7 from the three months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease is attributable to a 0.1 million decrease in professional
fees due to reduced fees of public auditors and legal counsel, a 0.2 million decrease in director and officer insurance due to reduced
costs in the second year of being a public company, and a 0.1 million decrease in stock-based compensation as a result of options becoming
fully amortized in 2024.

Interest
expense was approximately 0.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, an increase of approximately 0.1 million or 100

Research
and Development Expenses 

Research
and development expenses were approximately 1.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, a decrease of approximately 1.3
million or 43.8 from the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease is primarily attributable to a decrease of 1.2 million
in the manufacturing and pre-clinical costs of IC 100 and a decrease of approximately 0.5 million in payroll expenses due to employee
attrition. This was slightly offset by an increase of approximately 0.4 million in contract research organization expenses for the production
of VAR 200. 

General
and Administrative Expenses 

General
and administrative expenses were approximately 6.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, a decrease of approximately
 3.5 million or 36.1 from the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease is primarily attributable to 1.2 million of common
stock granted to certain members of the Sponsor and recognized in 2023 in exchange for increasing the duration of the period during which
they are not permitted to sell their common stock, a 0.5 million decrease in professional fees due to reduced fees related to public
auditors and legal counsel, a 0.2 million decrease in marketing costs for investor and public relations as a result of a reduction in
marketing vendors in 2024, and a 0.4 million decrease in expense for the Effectiveness Failure related to shares issued to investors
pursuant to a securities purchase agreement in July 2022, a 0.5 million decrease in director and officer insurance due to reduced costs
in the second year of being a public company, a 0.5 million decrease in payroll expenses as a result of a prior period bonus accrual
recognized upon board approval and a 0.2 million for decrease in stock-based compensation as a result of options becoming fully amortized
in 2024 

Impairment
of In-Process Research and Development and Goodwill 

For
the nine months ended September 30, 2023, impairment of in-process research and development and impairment of goodwill were 69.3 million
and 11.9 million, respectively. The impairment was a result of the decline in stock value and market capitalization of the Company at
June 30, 2023. There was no impairment for the nine months ended September 30, 2024.

Cash
Flows from Operating Activities 

Net
cash used in operating activities was approximately 6.3 million and approximately 5.9 million for the nine months ended September 30,
2024 and 2023, respectively. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the net cash used in operating activities was primarily
attributable to the net loss of approximately 8.0 million and 85.0 million, respectively, offset by 0.6 million and 75.0 million,
respectively, of net non-cash expenses, and approximately 1.0 million and 4.0 million, respectively, of cash generated by the levels
of operating assets and liabilities, respectively. 

Net
Cash Provided By Financing Activities 

Net
cash provided by financing activities was 3.3 million and 1.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively.
Cash provided by financing activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 primarily represented proceeds from the exercise
of warrants. Cash provided by financing activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2023 primarily represented 13.1 million
in proceeds from the issuance of common stock in a public offering. This was partially offset by 10.7 million in cash paid for the redemption
of Series A Preferred Stock and 1.8 million in registration and issuance costs associated with common stock issuances. 

Liquidity
and Capital Resources

 Working Capital Deficiency 
 (11,152 
 (6,842 

Since
our inception in 2014 through September 30, 2024, we have not generated any revenue and have incurred significant operating losses and
negative cash flows from our operations. Based on our current operating plan, we expect our cash of 0.1 million as of September 30,
2024 will only be sufficient to fund our operating expenses and capital expenditure requirements on a month-to-month basis. However,
it is difficult to predict our spending for our product candidates prior to obtaining FDA approval. Moreover, changing circumstances
may cause us to expend cash significantly faster than we currently anticipate, and we may need to spend more cash than currently expected
because of circumstances beyond our control. 

Going
Concern 

Since
inception we have been engaged in organizational activities, including raising capital and research and development activities. We have
not generated revenues and have not yet achieved profitable operations, nor have we ever generated positive cash flow from operations.
There is no assurance that profitable operations, if achieved, could be sustained on a continuing basis. We are subject to those risks
associated with any pre-revenue stage pharmaceutical company that has substantial expenditures for research and development. There can
be no assurance that our research and development projects will be successful, that products developed will obtain necessary regulatory
approval, or that any approved product will be commercially viable. In addition, we operate in an environment of rapid technological
change and are largely dependent on the services of our employees and consultants. Further, our future operations are dependent on the
success of our efforts to raise additional capital. These uncertainties raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going
concern for 12 months after the issuance date of our financial statements. The accompanying financial statements have been prepared on
a going concern basis. The financial statements do not include any adjustments to reflect the possible future effects on the recoverability
and classification of assets or the amounts and classification of liabilities that may result from the possible inability of us to continue
as a going concern, which contemplates the continuation of operations, realization of assets and liquidation of liabilities in the ordinary
course of business. We incurred a net loss of 8.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and a net loss of 85.0 million
for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, and we had an accumulated deficit of 111.2 million at September 30, 2024. We anticipate
incurring additional losses until such time, if ever, that we can generate significant revenue from our product candidates currently
in development. Our primary source of capital has been the issuance of debt and equity securities. We believe that current cash is only
sufficient to fund operations and capital requirements on a month-to-month basis. Additional financing will be needed by us to fund our
operations, to complete development of and to commercially develop our product candidates. There is no assurance that such financing
will be available when needed or on acceptable terms. 

17 

Subsequent to
September 30, 2024, the Company raised an aggregate of 3.1 million from stock warrant exercises and its at-the-market 
facility with A.G.P. 

Contractual
Obligations 

The
following summarizes our contractual obligations as of September 30, 2024 that will affect our future liquidity. Based on our current
operating plan, we plan to satisfy the obligations identified below from our current cash balance and future financing. 

Cash
requirements for our current liabilities as of September 30, 2024 include approximately 11.5 million for accounts payable and accrued
expenses. 

Capital
Needs 

On
September 16, 2024, we entered into a Sales Agreement (the ATM Agreement with A.G.P. pursuant to which we may offer
and sell shares of common stock up to an aggregate offering proceeds of 1,397,396 from time to time. Sales of our common stock
under the ATM Agreement may be made in sales deemed to be an at the market offering as defined in Rule 415(a)(4)
promulgated under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. Subsequent to September 30, 2024, the Company raised 1.39 million in
gross proceeds under the ATM Agreement. 

We
intend to raise additional capital in the future to fund continued development of VAR200 and IC100. 

We
expect to raise additional capital by issuing equity, equity-linked securities, or debt in subsequent offerings. If we are unable to
raise additional capital on terms favorable to us, we may not have sufficient liquidity to execute on our business strategy. We have
various warrants outstanding that can be exercised for our common stock, many of which must be exercised in exchange for cash paid to
us by the holders of such warrants. If the market price of our common stock is less than the exercise price of a holder s warrants,
it is unlikely that holders will exercise their warrants. As such, we do not expect to receive significant proceeds in the near term
from the exercise of most of our warrants based on the current market price of our common stock and the exercise prices of such warrants. 

Our
policy is to invest any cash in excess of our immediate requirements in investments designed to preserve the principal balance and provide
liquidity while producing a modest return on investment. Accordingly, our cash equivalents will be invested primarily in money market
funds. 

We
expect to continue to incur substantial additional operating losses for at least the next several years as we continue to develop our
product candidates and seek marketing approval and, subject to obtaining such approval, the eventual commercialization of our product
candidates. If we obtain marketing approval for our product candidates, we will incur significant sales, marketing and outsourced manufacturing
expenses. In addition, we expect to incur additional expenses to add operational, financial and information systems and personnel, including
personnel to support our planned product commercialization efforts. We also expect to incur significant costs to comply with corporate
governance, internal controls and similar requirements applicable to us as a public company. 

Our
future use of operating cash and capital requirements will depend on many forward-looking factors, including the following: 

the
 initiation, progress, timing, costs and results of clinical trials for our product candidates; 

the
 clinical development plans we establish for each product candidate; 

the
 number and characteristics of product candidates that we develop or may in-license; 

the
 terms of any collaboration agreements we may choose to execute; 

the
 outcome, timing and cost of meeting regulatory requirements established by the FDA or other comparable foreign regulatory authorities; 

the
 cost of filing, prosecuting, defending and enforcing our patent claims and other intellectual property rights; 

the
 cost of defending intellectual property disputes, including patent infringement actions brought by third parties against us; 

the
 cost and timing of the implementation of commercial scale manufacturing activities; and 

the
 cost of establishing, or outsourcing, sales, marketing and distribution capabilities for any product candidates for which we may
 receive regulatory approval in regions where we choose to commercialize our products on our own. 

To
continue to grow our business over the longer term, we plan to commit substantial resources to research and development, clinical trials
of our product candidates, and other operations and potential product acquisitions and in-licensing. We have evaluated and expect to
continue to evaluate a wide array of strategic transactions as part of our plan to acquire or in-license and develop additional products
and product candidates to augment our internal development pipeline. Strategic transaction opportunities that we may pursue could materially
affect our liquidity and capital resources and may require us to incur additional indebtedness, seek equity capital or both. In addition,
we may pursue development, acquisition or in-licensing of approved or development products in new or existing therapeutic areas or continue
the expansion of our existing operations. Accordingly, we expect to continue to opportunistically seek access to additional capital to
license or acquire additional products, product candidates or companies to expand our operations, or for general corporate purposes.
Strategic transactions may require us to raise additional capital through one or more public or private debt or equity financings or
could be structured as a collaboration or partnering arrangement. We have no arrangements, agreements, or understandings in place at
the present time to enter into any acquisition, in-licensing or similar strategic business transaction. In addition, we continue to evaluate
commercial collaborations and strategic relationships with established pharmaceutical companies, which would provide us with more immediate
access to marketing, sales, market access and distribution infrastructure. 

If
we raise additional funds by issuing equity securities, our stockholders will experience dilution. Debt financing, if available, would
result in increased fixed payment obligations and may involve agreements that include covenants limiting or restricting our ability to
take specific actions, such as incurring additional debt, making capital expenditures or declaring dividends. Any debt financing or additional
equity that we raise may contain terms, such as liquidation and other preferences that are not favorable to us or our existing stockholders.
If we raise additional funds through collaboration and licensing arrangements with third parties, it may be necessary to relinquish valuable
rights to our technologies, future revenue streams or product candidates or to grant licenses on terms that may not be favorable to us.

JOBS
Act Accounting Election 

ZyVersa
is an emerging growth company, as defined in the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012, or the JOBS Act. The JOBS
Act permits companies with emerging growth company status to take advantage of an extended transition period to comply with new or revised
accounting standards, delaying the adoption of these accounting standards until they would apply to private companies. ZyVersa expects
to use this extended transition period to enable it to comply with new or revised accounting standards that have different effective
dates for public and private companies until the earlier of the date the Company (1) is no longer an emerging growth company or (2) affirmatively
and irrevocably opts out of the extended transition period provided in the JOBS Act. As a result, our financial statements may not be
comparable to companies that comply with the new or revised accounting standards as of public company effective dates. 

In
addition, the Company intends to rely on the other exemptions and reduced reporting requirements provided by the JOBS Act. 

Off-Balance
Sheet Arrangements 

There
are no off-balance sheet arrangements between us and any other entity that have, or are reasonably likely to have, a current or future
effect on financial conditions, changes in financial conditions, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures
or capital resources that is material to stockholders. 

Critical
Accounting Estimates 

We
prepare our condensed consolidated financial statements in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, which require
our management to make estimates that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities
at the balance sheet dates, as well as the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. To the extent that
there are material differences between these estimates and actual results, our financial condition or results of operations would be
affected. We base our estimates on our own historical experience and other assumptions that we believe are reasonable after taking account
of our circumstances and expectations for the future based on available information. We evaluate these estimates on an ongoing basis. 

We
consider an accounting estimate to be critical if: (i) the accounting estimate requires us to make assumptions about matters that were
highly uncertain at the time the accounting estimate was made, and (ii) changes in the estimate that are reasonably likely to occur from
period to period or use of different estimates that we reasonably could have used in the current period, would have a material impact
on our financial condition or results of operations. There are items within our financial statements that require estimation but are
not deemed critical, as defined above.

ITEM
4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 

Disclosure
Controls and Procedures 

Disclosure
controls and procedures are controls and other procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our
reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act, is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified
in the SEC s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed
to ensure that information required to be disclosed in company reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated
to management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer (who serve as our Principal Executive Officer and Principal
Financial and Accounting Officer, respectively), to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 

As
required by Rules 13a-15 and 15d-15 under the Exchange Act, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer carried out an evaluation
of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of September 30, 2024. Based upon their
evaluation and due to the material weakness cited below, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure
controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) were ineffective. 

Specifically,
management s conclusion was based on the following material weakness which existed as of December 31, 2023 and September 30, 2024: 

Business
 process controls across the entity s financial reporting processes were not effectively designed and implemented to properly
 address the risk of material misstatement, including controls without proper segregation of duties between preparer and reviewer 

Our
management is committed to taking further action and implementing necessary enhancements or improvements, including actions to address
the material weakness identified as of December 31, 2023. Management expects to complete the development and implementation of its remediation
plan during 2024. 

Changes
in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 

Management
has implemented additional controls to address the material weakness identified as of December 31, 2023. This includes the implementation
of proper segregation of duties controls between preparer and reviewer. However, the material weakness will not be deemed to be remediated
until the controls have been operational for a period of time and have been verified to be operating effectively. 

Inherent
Limitations of the Effectiveness of Controls 

Management
does not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures or our internal control over financial reporting will prevent or detect all
error and fraud. A control system, no matter how well designed and operated, is based upon certain assumptions and can provide only reasonable,
not absolute, assurance that its objectives will be met. Further, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that misstatements
due to error or fraud will not occur or that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within the Company have been detected.
