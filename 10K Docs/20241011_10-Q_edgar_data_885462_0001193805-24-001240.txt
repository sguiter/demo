Producing oil and gas properties are depreciated
on a unit-of-production basis over the proved developed reserves. Common facilities that are built specifically to service production
directly attributed to designated oil and gas properties are depreciated based on the proved developed reserves of the respective oil
and gas properties on a pro-rata basis. Common facilities that are not built specifically to service identified oil and gas properties
are depreciated using the straight-line method over their estimated useful lives. Costs associated with significant development projects
are not depreciated until commercial production commences and the reserves related to those costs are excluded from the calculation of

In the last twenty years, to the Company s
knowledge, there were no government regulations requiring bromine manufacturers to obtain land use and planning approval document. As
such, the Company believes most of the bromine manufacturers in Shouguang City do not have land use and planning approval documents and
lease their land parcels from the village associations. They are facing the same issues in connection with land use and planning as the
Company. To the Company s knowledge, the local government has submitted its plan to solve the issues to higher authority and are
waiting for approval from the higher authority. 

The Company is in the process of resolving the
issues in connection with SCHC s land use and planning diligently. The Company has been in discussions closely with the local government
authorities with the help from Shouguang City Bromine Association to seek reliefs and, based on verbal confirmation by local government
authorities, believes the administrative penalties imposed by the Bureau according to the Written Decisions are being re-assessed by local
government authorities and may be revoked. Pursuant to a Written Application dated October 28, 2019 addressed to the Court by the Bureau,
the Bureau withdrew its application for the enforcement proceedings regarding the administrative penalty imposed on Factory No. 7, Factory
No. 8 and Factory No.10. Pursuant to a written decisions of administrative ruling captioned (2019) Lu 0783 Xing Shen No. 389 Zhi Yi, dated
November 25, 2020, the Court orders to terminate the enforcement of the case captioned (2019) Lu 0783 Xing Shen No. 389. Production of
Factory No. 7 was allowed to resume in April 2019. The Company received a notification from the Shouguang City Government in February
2019 informing the Company that Factory No. 1, No.4, No. 7 and No. 9 have passed inspection and were approved to resume operation 

In addition, on August 28, 2019, the People s
Government of Shandong Province, issued a regulation titled Investment Project Management Requirements of Chemical Companies in
Shandong Province permitting the construction of facilities on existing sites or infrastructure of bromine manufacturing and other
chemical industry-related types of projects (clause 11 of section 3). The Company believes that the goal of the government is to standardize
and regulate the industry and not to demolish the facilities or penalize the manufacturers. As of the date of this report, the Company
has not been notified by the local government that it will take any measure to enforce the administrative penalties. Based on information
known to date, the Company believes that it is remote that the Written Decisions or Court Rulings will be enforced within the expected
timeframe and a material penalty or costs and expenses against the Company will result. However, there can be no assurance that there
will not be any further enforcement action, the occurrence of which may result in further liabilities, penalties and operational disruption. 

In view of the above facts and circumstances,
the Company believes that it is not necessary to accrue for any estimated losses or impairment as of March 31, 2024. 

. This decision was made due to the following reasons:
(1) the aqueducts exhibits serious water seepage, posed potential damage, and could lead to environmental pollution; (2) the wells were
found to have reduced water flow, low brine content and high energy consumption. 

In June 2024, SHSI, a wholly owned subsidiary
of the Company, signed acquisition agreements with each of several sellers. Under these agreements, each seller agrees to transfer to
SHSI, and SHSI agrees to purchase from each seller, a parcel of crude salt field located in Shouguang city Yangkou town. The total of
aggregate price for these acquisitions is RMB 280,762,000 (approximately US based on the exchange rate on July 3, 2024.

Overview 

We are a Nevada holding
company which conducts operations through our wholly-owned China-based subsidiaries. Our business is conducted and reported in four segments,
namely, bromine, crude salt, chemical products and natural gas. 

Through our wholly-owned
subsidiary, SCHC, we produce and trade bromine and crude salt. We are one of the largest producers of bromine in China, as measured
by production output. Elemental bromine is used to manufacture a wide variety of bromine compounds used in industry and agriculture. Bromine
also is used to form intermediary chemical compounds such as Tetramethylbenzidine. Bromine is commonly used in brominated flame
retardants, fumigants, water purification compounds, dyes, medicines and disinfectants. Crude salt is the principal material
in alkali production as well as chlorine alkali production and is widely used in the chemical, food and beverage, and other industries. 

Through our wholly-owned
subsidiary, SYCI, we manufacture and sell chemical products used in oil and gas field exploration, oil and gas distribution, oil field
drilling, papermaking chemical agents, inorganic chemicals and materials that are used for human and animal antibiotics. 

Our wholly-owned subsidiary,
DCHC, was established to explore and develop natural gas and brine resources (including bromine and crude salt) in Sichuan Province, China.

As disclosed in the Company s
Current Report on Form 8-K filed on September 8, 2017, the Company received, on September 1, 2017, letters from the Yangkou County, Shouguang
City government addressed to each of its subsidiaries, SCHC and SYCI, which stated that in an effort to improve the safety and environmental
protection management level of chemical enterprises, the plants are requested to immediately stop production and perform rectification
and improvements in accordance with the country s new safety and environmental protection requirements. In the Company s press
release of August 11, 2017 and on its conference call of August 14, 2017, the Company addressed concerns that increased government enforcement
of stringent environmental rules that were adopted in early 2017 to insure corporations bring their facilities up to necessary standards
so that pollution and other negative environmental issues are limited and remediated, could have an impact on our business in both the
short and long-term. The Company also expressed that although it believed its facilities were fully compliant at the time, the Company
did not know how its facilities would fare under the new rules. Teams of inspectors from the government were sent to many provinces to
inspect all mining and manufacturing facilities. The local government requested that facilities be closed, so that the facilities could
undergo the inspection and analysis in the most efficient manner by inspectors team. As a result, our facilities were closed on
September 1, 2017. 

The Company believes
that this is another step by the government to improve the environment. It further believes the goal of the government is not to close
all plants, but rather to codify the regulations related to project approval, land use, planning approval and environmental protection
assessment approval so that illegal plants are not able to open in the future and so that plants close to population centers do not cause
serious environmental damage. In addition, the Company believes that the Shandong provincial government wants to assure that each of its
regional and county governments has applied the Notice in a consistent manner. 

The Shouguang City Bromine
Association, on behalf of all the bromine plants in Shouguang, started discussions with the local government agencies. The local governmental
agencies confirmed the facts that their initial requirements for the bromine industry did not include the project approval, the planning
approval and the land use rights approval and that those three additional approvals were new requirements of the provincial government.
The Company understood from the local government that it has been coordinating with several government agencies to solve these three outstanding
approval issues in a timely manner and that all the affected bromine plants willnot be allowed to commence production prior to obtaining
those approvals. 

In February 2019, the Company received a notification
from the local government of Yangkou County that its Factory No. 1, No.4, No. 7 and No. 9 had passed inspection and could resume operations.
In April 2019, Factory No. 1 and No. 7 resumed operations. 

On February 28, 2020,
the Company announced that it received an approval from the government to resume bromine production after winter temporary closure. Subsequently,
it received another approval from the Shouguang Yangkou People s Government dated on March 5, 2020 to resume production at its bromine
factories No.1, No. 4, No.7 and No. 9 in order to meet the needs of bromide products for epidemic prevention and control. With these two
approvals, the Company was allowed to resume production at all four bromine factories. 

The Company received
an oral notification from the government for its Factory No. 8, which permitted Factory No.8 to resume production in August 2022. Factory
No.8 started to contribute revenue in the fourth quarter 2022. 

Pursuant to the notification
from the government of Shouguang City, all bromine facilities in Shouguang City were temporarily closed from December 10, 2022 until February
1, 2023 8:00 AM China Time. To comply with such notification, the Company had temporarily stopped production at its bromine facilities
during the aforesaid period and reopened the operating bromine and crude salt factories in February, 2023 as planned. 

The Company is still
waiting for governmental approval for factories No.2 and No.10. To its knowledge, the government is currently completing its planning
process for all mining areas including that for prevention of flood. As a result, the Company may be required to make some modifications
to our current wells and aqueducts prior to commencement of operations of these factories to satisfy the local government's requirements.

On November 24, 2017,
Gulf Resources received a letter from the People s Government of Yangkou County, Shouguang City notifying the Company that due to
the new standards and regulations relating to safety production and environmental pollution, from certain local governmental departments,
such as the municipal environmental protection department, the security supervision department and the fire department, its chemical enterprises
would have to be relocated to a new industrial park called Bohai Marine Fine Chemical Industry Park. Although our chemical
companies were in compliance with regulations, they were also close to a residential area. As a result, the government determined we should
relocate to the Bohai park.Chemical companies that are not being asked to move into the park are being permanently closed. Since
our factories closed, the Company has secured from the government the land use rights for its chemical plant. On January 6, 2020, the
Company received the environmental protection approval by the government of Shouguang City, Shandong Province for the proposed Yuxin Chemical
factory. The Company began the construction on its new chemical facilities located at Bohai Marine Fine Chemical Industrial Park in June
2020. The construction was expected to take approximately one year and an additional six months to complete the equipment installation
and testing, however due to the COVID epidemic and electrical restrictions, the opening of the chemical factory has been delayed. The
Company has received the refrigeration and air compressor units. The rest equipment is expected to be delivered by the second quarter
of 2023. The Company intends to start installation of equipment and may start testing andtrial production by the end of 2023 or beginning
of 2024. 

In January 2017, the
Company completed the first brine water and natural gas well field construction in Daying located in Sichuan Province and commenced trial
production in January 2019. On May 29, 2019, the Company received a verbal notice from the government of Tianbao Town ,Daying County,
Sichuan Province, whereby the Company is required to obtain project approval for its well located in Daying, including the whole natural
gas and brine water project, and approvals for safety production inspection, environmental protection assessment, and to solve the related
land issue. Until these approvals have been received, the Company has to temporarily halt trial production at its natural gas well in
Daying. In compliance with the Chinese government new policies, the Company is also required to obtain an exploration license and a mining
license for bromine and natural gas, respectively. Pursuant to the Opinions of the Ministry of Natural Resources on Several Issues in
Promoting the Reform of Mineral Resources Management (Trial) promulgated by the Ministry of Natural Resources of PRC on January 9, 2020,
which came into effect on May 1, 2020, privately owned enterprises are allowed to participate in the natural gas production. The Company
plans to proceed with its applications for the natural gas and brine project approvals with related government departments until after
the governmental planning has been finalized the land and resource planning for Sichuan Province. 

In April 2022, Shouguang Hengde Salt Industry
Co. Ltd SHSI , our subsidiary, was incorporated in Shandong Province, China, for crude salt production and
trading. 

On January 28, 2020 we
completed a 1-for-5 reverse stock split of our common stock, such that for each five shares outstanding prior to the stock split there
was one share outstanding after the reverse stock split. All shares of common stock referenced in this report have been adjusted
to reflect the stock split figures.

Bromine segment 

For the three-month period ended March 31, 2024,
the gross loss margin for our bromine segment was 81 , compared to 27 in the three-month period ended March 31, 2023. The decrease in
gross loss margin was primarily attributable to the higher average selling price of bromine of 2,541 per ton in the three-month period
ended March 31, 2024 compared to 4,193 per ton in the three-month period ended March 31, 2023. Bromine tonnes sales also decreased from
2,020 tonnes for the three month period ended March 31, 2023 to 451 tonnes for the three month period ended March 31, 2024. 

For the three-month period ended March 31, 2023,
the gross profit margin for our bromine segment was 27 . 

Crude salt segmen t 

For the three-month period ended March 31, 2024,
the gross profit margin for our crude salt segment was 60 . 

For the three-month period ended March 31, 2023,
the gross profit margin for our crude salt segment was 17 . 

Direct labor and factory overheads incurred
during plant shutdown On September 1, 2017, the Company received notification from the government of Yangkou County, Shouguang
City of PRC that stated that production at all its bromine and crude salt and chemical factories should be halted with immediate effect
in order for the Company to perform rectification and improvement in accordance with the county s new safety and environmental protection
requirements. On November 24, 2017, the Company received a letter from the Government of Yangkou County, Shouguang City notifying the
Company to relocate its two chemical production plants located in the second living area of the Qinghe Oil Extraction Plant to Bohai
Park. As a result, direct labor and factory overhead costs (including depreciation of plant and machinery) in the amount of 3,734,689
and 2,408,736 incurred for the three-month periods ended March 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively, of factories that have not resumed production

Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities

and amortization expenses of 4.73 million.

and a non-cash adjustment related to depreciation and amortization of property, plant and equipment of 5.36 million, offset by increases

Raw materials decreased by 2,011 as of March

Net Cash Used in Investing Activities 

For the three-month period ended March 31, 2024,
we did not acquire property, plant and equipment. 

For the three-month period ended March 31, 2023,
we used approximately 0.04 million to acquire property, plant and equipment. 

Net Cash Used in Financing Activities 

We have no financing activities for the three-month
periods ended March 31, 2024 and 2023. 

We believe that our available funds and cash flows
generated from operations will be sufficient to meet our anticipated ongoing operating needs and our obligations as they full due in the
next twelve (12) months. 

We had available cash of approximately 70.76
million at March 31, 2024, most of which is in highly liquid current deposits which earn no or little interest. We do not anticipate paying
cash dividends in the foreseeable future. 

We intend to continue to focus our efforts on
the activities of SCHC, SYCI, SHSI and DCHC as these segments continue to expand within the Chinese market. 

We may not be able to identify, successfully integrate
or profitably manage any businesses or business segment we may acquire, or any expansion of our business. An expansion may involve a number
of risks, including possible adverse effects on our operating results, diversion of management s attention, inability to retain
key personnel, risks associated with unanticipated events, risks associated with the COVID-19 pandemic and the financial statement effect
of potential impairment of acquired intangible assets, any of which could have a materially adverse effect on our condition and results of
operations. In addition, if competition for acquisition candidates or operations were to increase, the cost of acquiring businesses could
increase materially. We may effect an acquisition with a target business which may be financially unstable, under-managed, or in its early
stages of development or growth. Our inability to implement and manage our expansion strategy successfully may have a material adverse
effect on our business and future prospects.

Contractual Obligations and Commitments 

We have no significant contractual obligations
not fully recorded on our condensed consolidated balance sheets or fully disclosed in the notes to our condensed consolidated financial
statements. Additional information regarding our contractual obligations and commitments at March 31, 2024 is provided in the notes to
our condensed consolidated financial statements. See Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements, Note 18 Capital
Commitment and Other Service Contractual Obligations . 

Material Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 

We do not currently have any off -balance sheet
arrangements falling within the definition of Item 303(a) of Regulation S-K. 

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 

Our consolidated financial statements have been
prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America and this requires management to make
estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements
and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. We base its estimates on historical experience and on various
other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. Accordingly, actual results may differ significantly from
these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. We have identified the following critical accounting policies and estimates
used by us in the preparation of our financial statements: accounts receivable and allowance for doubtful accounts, inventories and allowance
for obsolescence, assets retirement obligation, property, plant and equipment, recoverability of long-lived assets, mineral rights, leases,
revenue recognition, income taxes, and loss contingencies. These policies and estimates are described in the Company s Form 10-Q
for the three months ended March 31, 2024. 

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 

Pursuant to Item 305(e) of Regulation S-K 
229.305(e)), the Company is not required to provide the information required by this Item as it is a smaller reporting company, 
as defined by Rule 229.10(f)(1). 

Item 4. Controls and Procedures 

(a) Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

We maintain disclosure controls and procedures
(as such term is defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e)) that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed
in our reports filed pursuant to the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in
the SEC s rules, regulations and related forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including
our Chief Executive Officer CEO and Chief Financial Officer CFO ), as appropriate, to allow timely decisions
regarding required disclosure. 

Under the supervision and with the participation
of our management, including our CEO and CFO, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure
controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based on this evaluation, our CEO and CFO concluded that our
disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of the end of the period covered by this Form 10-Q. 

(b) Changes in internal controls 

There were no changes in our internal control
over financial reporting (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act) during our most recently completed fiscal
quarter that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

Item 1A. Risk Factors 

Investing in our common stock involves a high
degree of risk. Before you invest you should carefully review our Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and
Results of Operations set forth in Item 2 of Part I of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, our consolidated financial statements and related
notes included in Item 1 of Part I of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and our consolidated financial statements and related notes,
as well as our Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and the other information in
our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023. Readers should carefully review risks described in other documents
we file from time to time with the Securities and Exchange Commission. 

We are currently
not in compliance with the Nasdaq continued listing requirements. If we are unable to regain compliance with Nasdaq s listing requirements,
our securities could be delisted, which could affect our common stock s market price and liquidity and reduce our ability to raise
capital. 

The
Company received a notice (the Initial Notice from the Listing Qualifications Department of The Nasdaq Stock Market LLC Nasdaq on April 18, 2024 notifying the Company that due to the Company s failure to timely file its Annual Report
on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023 (the Form 10-K ), with the SEC, the Company is not in compliance
with Nasdaq s continued listing requirements under Nasdaq Listing Rule 5250(c)(1) (the Rule ), which requires the timely
filing of all required periodic reports with the SEC, and the Company subsequently received a notice (the May Notice from
Nasdaq on May 21, 2024 due to the Company s non-compliance with the Rule as a result of the Company s failure to timely file
its Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the fiscal quarter ended March 31, 2024 (the Form 10-Q , together with the Form 10-K,
the Delinquent Reports ). The May Notice states that the Company has until June 17, 2024 to submit to Nasdaq a plan to regain
compliance with the Rule. 

On
June 26, 2024, the Company received a letter from Nasdaq indicating that, based on its further review and the plan of compliance submitted
by the Company on June 14, 2024, Nasdaq has determined to grant an exception to enable the Company to regain compliance with the Rule.
The terms of the exception are as follows: on or before October 14, 2024, the Company must file the Delinquent Reports, as required by
the Rule. In the event the Company does not satisfy the terms, Nasdaq will provide written notification that its securities will be delisted.
At that time, the Company may appeal Nasdaq s determination to a hearings panel. 

Subsequently,
on August 20, 2024, the Company received a notice (the August Notice from Nasdaq indicating that, because the Company is
delinquent in filing its quarterly report on Form 10-Q for the period ended June 30, 2024, the Company is not in compliance with the Rule.
The Notice also indicates that as a result of this additional delinquency, the Company must submit an update to its original plan to regain
compliance with respect to the filing requirements. The Company has until September 4, 2024 to submit such update to Nasdaq. 

The
August Notice has no immediate effect on the listing or trading of the Company s common stock on the Nasdaq Global Select Market.
While the Company can provide no assurance to the timing, the Company has submitted a letter to Nasdaq confirming that there has been
no change to its original plan to regain compliance with respect to the filing requirements, and will continue to work diligently to complete
and file its delayed SEC reports. 

On
or before October 14, 2024, we must evidence compliance with the Rule, which requires the timely filing of all required periodic reports
with the SEC. If we fail to regain compliance with the Rule, or fail to evidence compliance with the Rule by October 14, 2024, we may
be subject to delisting. In that event, we would have the right to a hearing before a Nasdaq hearings panel, which would stay any suspension
or delisting action pending the conclusion of the hearing process and the expiration of any additional extension period granted by the
panel following the hearing. 

We
cannot assure you that we will be able to regain compliance with Nasdaq listing standards. Our failure to continue to meet these requirements
would result in our common stock being delisted from Nasdaq, and if our common stock is delisted, our warrants will also be delisted.
We and holders of our securities could be materially adversely impacted if our securities are delisted from Nasdaq. In particular: 

we may be unable to raise equity capital on acceptable terms or at all; 

we may lose the confidence of our customers, which would jeopardize our ability to continue our business as currently conducted; 

the price of our common stock will likely decrease as a result of the loss of market efficiencies associated with Nasdaq and the loss of federal preemption of state securities laws; 

holders may be unable to sell or purchase our securities when they wish to do so; 

we may become subject to stockholder litigation; 

we may lose the interest of institutional investors in our common stock; 

we may lose media and analyst coverage; 

our common stock could be considered a penny stock, which would likely limit the level of trading activity in the secondary market for our common stock; and 

we would likely lose any active trading market for our common stock, as it may only be traded on one of the over-the-counter markets, if at all. 

Item 2. Unregistered Shares of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds 

None. 

Item 3. Defaults Upon Senior Securities 

None. 

Item 4. Mine Safety Disclosures 

Not applicable. 

Item 5. Other Information 

During our fiscal quarter ended March 31, 2024, of our directors
or officers informed us of the adoption or termination of a Rule 10b5-1 trading arrangement or non-Rule 10b5-1 trading
arrangement as those terms are defined in Item 408(a) of Regulation S-K.
