 Interest rate caps designated as cash flow hedges involve the receipt of variable amounts from a counterparty if interest rates rise above the strike rate on the contract in exchange for an up-front premium. For derivatives designated and qualifying as cash flow hedges of interest rate risk, the gain or loss on the derivative is recorded in cumulative other comprehensive income and subsequently reclassified into interest expense in the same period during which the hedged transaction affects earnings. Gains and losses on the derivative representing hedge components excluded from the assessment of effectiveness are recognized over the life of the hedge on a systematic and rational basis, as documented at hedge inception in accordance with our accounting policy election.

 Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 
 
 The following information should be read in conjunction with our condensed consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and with our 2023 Annual Report. 
 
 OVERVIEW (dollars in thousands, except per square foot data) 
 
 We are a real estate investment trust, or REIT, organized under Maryland law. As of September 30, 2024, our portfolio was comprised of 411 properties containing approximately 59,890,000 rentable square feet located in 39 states with 94.4 occupancy leased to approximately 300 different tenants. As of September 30, 2024, we also owned a 22 equity interest in the unconsolidated joint venture. 
 Our portfolio as of September 30, 2024 is summarized below (square feet in thousands):

 (1) Based on annualized rental revenues as of September 30, 2024. 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, our rental income and net operating income, or NOI, increased compared to the 2023 period primarily due to leasing activity and rent resets at our properties. Long-term e-commerce trends and supply chain resiliency have resulted in high occupancy and increases in rents. We believe customer service expectations, growth in the number of households and demand for supply chain resiliency will keep demand for industrial properties strong for the foreseeable future. However, high interest rates, even with the recent reduction and anticipated future reductions by the U.S. Federal Reserve, inflationary pressures, and global geopolitical hostilities and tensions, have given rise to economic uncertainty and have caused disruptions in the financial markets. These conditions continue to keep our cost of capital elevated and negatively impact our ability to reduce our leverage. An economic recession, or continued or intensified disruptions in the financial markets, could adversely affect our financial condition and that of our tenants, could adversely impact the ability or willingness of our tenants to renew our leases or pay rent to us, may restrict our access to and would likely increase our cost of capital, may impact our ability to sell properties and may cause the values of our properties and of our common shares or other securities to decline.

 (1) Leased square feet is pursuant to existing leases as of September 30, 2024, and includes space being fitted out for occupancy, if any, and space which is leased but is not occupied, if any. 
 As of September 30, 2024, subsidiaries of FedEx and Amazon leased 22.7 and 8.0 of our total leased square feet, respectively, and represented 29.3 and 6.8 of our total annualized rental revenues, respectively. 
 Mainland Properties. As of September 30, 2024, occupancy at our Mainland Properties was 97.7 and represented 72.1 of our annualized rental revenues. We generally will seek to renew or extend the terms of leases at our Mainland Properties as their expirations approach. A majority of the leases at our Mainland Properties include periodic set dollar amount or percentage increases that increase the cash rent payable to us. Due to the capital that many of the tenants in our Mainland Properties have invested in these properties and because many of these properties appear to be of strategic importance to the tenants businesses, we believe that it is likely that these tenants will renew or extend their leases prior to their expirations. If we are unable to extend or renew our leases, it may be time consuming and expensive to relet some of these properties and the terms of any leases we may enter may be less favorable to us than the terms of our existing leases for those properties. 
 Hawaii Properties. As of September 30, 2024, occupancy at our Hawaii Properties was 85.7 and represented 27.9 of our annualized rental revenues. Certain of our Hawaii Properties are lands leased for rents that periodically reset based on fair market values, generally every 10 years. Revenues from our Hawaii Properties have generally increased as rents under the leases for those properties have been reset or renewed. Lease renewals, lease extensions, new leases and rental rates for our Hawaii Properties in the future will depend on prevailing market conditions when these lease renewals, lease extensions, new leases and rental rates are set. As rent reset dates or lease expirations approach at our Hawaii Properties, we generally negotiate with existing or new tenants for new lease terms. If we are unable to reach an agreement with a tenant on a rent reset, our Hawaii Properties leases typically provide that rent is reset based on an appraisal process. Due to the limited availability of land suitable for industrial uses that might compete with our Hawaii Properties, we believe that our Hawaii Properties offer the potential for future rent growth as a result of periodic rent resets, lease extensions and new leasing.

 The following table provides the annualized rental revenues scheduled to reset at our Hawaii Properties as of September 30, 2024: 
 Annualized Rental Revenues Scheduled to Reset 2024 2025 1,010 2026 1,316 2027 805 2028 Thereafter 19,742 Total 22,873 
 As of September 30, 2024, 17,287, or 4.0 , of our annualized rental revenues are included in leases scheduled to expire by September 30, 2025 and 5.6 of our rentable square feet are currently vacant. Rental rates for which available space may be leased in the future will depend on prevailing market conditions when lease extensions, lease renewals or new leases are negotiated. Whenever we extend, renew or enter new leases for our properties, we intend to seek rents that are equal to or higher than our historical rents for the same properties. Despite our prior experience with rent resets, lease extensions and new leases in Hawaii, our ability to increase rents when rents reset, leases are extended or leases expire depends upon market conditions, which are beyond our control. Accordingly, we cannot be sure that the historical increases achieved at our Hawaii Properties will continue in the future. 
 Tenant Review Process. Our manager, RMR, conducts a tenant review process for us. RMR assesses tenants on an individual basis based on various applicable credit criteria. Depending on facts and circumstances, RMR evaluates the creditworthiness of a tenant based on information that is provided by the tenant and, in some cases, information that is publicly available or obtained from third party sources. RMR also may use a third party service to monitor the credit ratings of debt securities of our existing tenants whose debt securities are rated by a nationally recognized credit rating agency.

 References to changes in the income and expense categories below relate to the comparison of results for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. 
 Rental income. Rental income decreased primarily due to vacancies at two of our properties, partially offset by increased rental income from leasing activities and rent resets. 
 Real estate taxes . Real estate taxes increased primarily due to higher assessed values at certain of our properties. 
 Other operating expenses . Other operating expenses decreased primarily due to decreases in maintenance and repair expenses incurred in the 2023 period at certain of our properties and insurance expenses.

 Depreciation and amortization. The decrease in depreciation and amortization primarily reflects the impact of renewals at certain of our properties as a result of leasing activity in the 2024 period and certain acquired real estate leases fully amortizing since October 1, 2023, partially offset by increased depreciation related to improvements made to certain of our properties since October 1, 2023. 
 
 General and administrative. The decrease in general and administrative expenses is primarily due to decreases in franchise taxes and professional fees, partially offset by an increase in leasing costs compared to the 2023 period. 
 Interest income. The increase in interest income is primarily due to higher interest rates and average cash balances during the 2024 period as compared to the 2023 period. 
 Interest expense. The increase in interest expense is primarily due to increased amortization related to the cost of the interest rate cap purchased by our consolidated joint venture in March 2024, partially offset by decreased interest costs and amortization of debt issuance costs related to the Mountain Floating Rate Loan. 
 Income tax expense. Income tax expense primarily reflects state income taxes payable in certain jurisdictions. 
 Equity in earnings of unconsolidated joint venture. Equity in earnings of unconsolidated joint venture represents the change in the fair value of our investment in the unconsolidated joint venture.

 Non-GAAP Financial Measures (dollars in thousands, except per share data) 
 
 We present certain non-GAAP financial measures within the meaning of the applicable rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission, or the SEC, including NOI, funds from operations, or FFO, attributable to common shareholders and normalized funds from operations, or Normalized FFO, attributable to common shareholders. These measures do not represent cash generated by operating activities in accordance with GAAP and should not be considered as alternatives to net loss or net loss attributable to common shareholders, as indicators of our operating performance or as measures of our liquidity. These measures should be considered in conjunction with net loss and net loss attributable to common shareholders as presented in our condensed consolidated statements of comprehensive income (loss). We consider these non-GAAP measures to be appropriate supplemental measures of operating performance for a REIT, along with net loss and net loss attributable to common shareholders. We believe these measures provide useful information to investors because by excluding the effects of certain historical amounts, such as depreciation and amortization expense, they may facilitate a comparison of our operating performance between periods and with other REITs and, in the case of NOI, reflecting only those income and expense items that are generated and incurred at the property level may help both investors and management to understand the operations of our properties. 
 Net Operating Income 
 We calculate NOI as shown below. We define NOI as income from our rental of real estate less our property operating expenses. The calculation of NOI excludes certain components of net loss in order to provide results that are more closely related to our property level results of operations. NOI excludes depreciation and amortization. We use NOI to evaluate individual and company-wide property level performance. Other real estate companies and REITs may calculate NOI differently than we do. 
 The following table presents the reconciliation of net loss to NOI for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023: 
 Three Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 2024 2023 Net loss (35,407) (36,191) (102,788) (108,317) Equity in earnings of unconsolidated joint venture (1,161) (719) (5,232) (7,423) Income tax expense 33 51 102 113 Loss before income taxes and equity in earnings of unconsolidated joint venture (36,535) (36,859) (107,918) (115,627) Loss on early extinguishment of debt 359 Loss on sale of real estate 974 Interest expense 73,936 72,941 220,797 215,558 Interest income

 Funds From Operations Attributable to Common Shareholders and Normalized Funds From Operations Attributable to Common Shareholders 
 We calculate FFO attributable to common shareholders and Normalized FFO attributable to common shareholders as shown below. FFO attributable to common shareholders is calculated on the basis defined by The National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts, which is: (1) net loss attributable to common shareholders calculated in accordance with GAAP, excluding (i) any recovery or loss on impairment of real estate, (ii) any gain or loss on sale of real estate and (iii) equity in earnings of unconsolidated joint venture; (2) plus (i) real estate depreciation and amortization of our properties and (ii) our proportionate share of FFO from unconsolidated joint venture properties; (3) minus FFO adjustments attributable to noncontrolling interest; and (4) certain other adjustments currently not applicable to us. In calculating Normalized FFO attributable to common shareholders, we adjust for certain non-recurring items shown below, including adjustments for such items related to the unconsolidated joint venture, if any.

Tabl e of Contents 

 FFO attributable to common shareholders and Normalized FFO attributable to common shareholders are among the factors considered by our Board of Trustees when determining the amount of distributions to our shareholders. Other factors include, but are not limited to, requirements to maintain our qualification for taxation as a REIT, limitations in the agreements governing our debt, the availability to us of debt and equity capital, our distribution rate as a percentage of the trading price of our common shares, or dividend yield, and our dividend yield compared to the dividend yields of other industrial REITs, our expectation of our future capital requirements and operating performance and our expected needs for and availability of cash to pay our obligations. Other real estate companies and REITs may calculate FFO attributable to common shareholders and Normalized FFO attributable to common shareholders differently than we do. 
 The following table presents our calculation of FFO attributable to common shareholders and Normalized FFO attributable to common shareholders and reconciliations of net loss attributable to common shareholders to FFO attributable to common shareholders and Normalized FFO attributable to common shareholders for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023:

 LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES (dollars in thousands) 
 
 Our principal sources of funds to meet our operating and capital obligations, pay our debt service and make distributions to our shareholders are rents from tenants at our properties. As of September 30, 2024, investment grade rated tenants, subsidiaries of investment grade rated parent entities or our Hawaii land leases represented 77.2 of our annualized rental revenues and only 4.0 of our annualized rental revenues were from leases expiring over the next 12 months. We believe that these sources of funds will be sufficient to meet our operating and capital obligations, pay our debt service and make distributions to our shareholders for the next 12 months and for the foreseeable future thereafter.

 The following is a summary of our sources and uses of cash flows for the periods presented, as reflected in our condensed consolidated statements of cash flows: 
 Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 Cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash and cash equivalents at beginning of period 245,723 140,780 Net cash provided by (used in): Operating activities 15,426 14,063 Investing activities 20,048 31,420 Financing activities (16,266) 36,240 Cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash and cash equivalents at end of period 264,931 222,503 
 The increase in net cash provided by operating activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the 2023 period is primarily due to higher cash flows from our properties and favorable changes in working capital in the 2024 period. The decrease in net cash provided by investing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the 2023 period is primarily due to costs associated with the purchase of an interest rate cap for 26,175 in the 2024 period and distributions in excess of earnings from the unconsolidated joint venture in the 2023 period, partially offset by increased proceeds from the settlement of our interest rate caps and a reduction in expenditures on our real estate improvements. The change in net cash used in financing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to net cash provided by financing activities for the 2023 period was primarily due to our consolidated joint venture obtaining a 91,000 fixed rate, interest only mortgage loan secured by four properties owned by our consolidated joint venture in the 2023 period. A portion of the net proceeds was used to repay four then outstanding mortgage loans of our consolidated joint venture with an aggregate outstanding principal balance of 35,910 in the 2023 period. 
 Our Operating Liquidity and Resources 
 Our future cash flows from operating activities will depend primarily upon our ability to: 
 collect rents from our tenants when due; 
 maintain the occupancy of, and maintain or increase the rental rates at, our properties; and 
 control our operating cost increases, including interest and other financing costs. 
 Our Investing and Financing Liquidity and Resources (dollars in thousands, except per share and per square foot data) 
 As of September 30, 2024, we had cash and cash equivalents, excluding restricted cash and cash equivalents, of 153,863. To maintain our qualification for taxation as a REIT under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, we generally are required to distribute at least 90 of our REIT taxable income annually, subject to specified adjustments and excluding any net capital gain. This distribution requirement limits our ability to retain earnings and thereby provide capital for our operations or acquisitions. We may use our cash and cash equivalents on hand, the cash flow from our operations, net proceeds from any sales of assets and net proceeds of offerings of equity or debt securities to fund our distributions to our shareholders. 
 When the maturities of our debt approach or we desire to reduce our leverage or refinance maturing debt, we intend to explore refinancing alternatives, property sales or sales of equity interests in joint ventures. Such alternatives may include incurring term debt, obtaining financing secured by mortgages on properties we own, issuing new equity or debt securities, obtaining a revolving credit facility, participating or selling equity interests in joint ventures or selling properties. Further, any issuances of our equity securities may be dilutive to our existing shareholders. We expect to fund any future property acquisitions, developments and redevelopments with proceeds we may receive in connection with any additional properties we may sell to our joint ventures, equity contributions from any third party investors in our joint ventures or any future joint ventures, net proceeds from offerings of equity or debt securities and cash on hand. We may also assume mortgage loans or incur debt in connection with future acquisitions, developments and redevelopments. Although we cannot be sure that we will be successful in completing any particular type of financing, we believe that we will have access to financing, such as debt or equity offerings, to fund capital expenditures, future acquisitions, development, redevelopment and other activities and to pay our obligations.

 Real Estate Activities 
 During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, amounts capitalized at our properties for tenant improvements, leasing costs, building improvements and development, redevelopment and other activities were as follows: 
 Three Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 2024 2023 Tenant improvements (1) 
 433 194 1,019 1,893 Leasing costs (1) 
 2,695 1,047 5,006 3,886 Building improvements (2) 
 2,509 2,720 5,817 4,373 Development, redevelopment and other activities (3) 
 1,314 7,705 5,637 5,275 11,842 17,857 
 (1) Tenant improvements and leasing costs include capital expenditures used to improve tenants space or amounts paid directly to tenants to improve their space and leasing related costs, such as brokerage commissions and tenant inducements. 
 (2) Building improvements generally include expenditures to replace obsolete building components and expenditures that extend the useful life of existing assets. 
 (3) Development, redevelopment and other activities generally include capital expenditure projects that reposition a property or result in new sources of revenues. 
 As of September 30, 2024, committed, but unspent, tenant related obligations based on existing leases were 6,382, of which 6,042 is expected to be spent during the next 12 months. 
 Joint Ventures 
 We own a 61 equity interest in our consolidated joint venture. We control this consolidated joint venture and therefore account for the properties owned by this joint venture on a consolidated basis in our condensed consolidated financial statements. We also own a 22 equity interest in the unconsolidated joint venture. We account for the unconsolidated joint venture using the equity method of accounting under the fair value option. The unconsolidated joint venture made aggregate cash distributions to us of 990 and 5,390 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and 2,970 and 7,370 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. 
 For further information regarding our consolidated joint venture and unconsolidated joint venture, see Note 3 to our condensed consolidated financial statements included in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. 
 
 Indebtedness 
 The ILPT Floating Rate Loan, which is secured by 104 of our properties, was scheduled to mature in October 2024, subject to three, one year extension options, and required that interest be paid at an annual rate of SOFR plus a weighted average premium of 3.93 . In October 2024, we exercised the first of our three, one year extension options for the maturity date of this loan. In connection with the exercise of the extension, we purchased a one year interest rate cap for 16,975 with a SOFR strike rate equal to 2.78 , which replaced the previous interest rate cap with a SOFR strike rate equal to 2.25 . Subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions, we have the option to prepay the ILPT Floating Rate Loan in full or in part at any time at par with no premium. 
 The Mountain Floating Rate Loan matures in March 2025, subject to two remaining one year extension options, and requires that interest be paid at an annual rate of SOFR plus a premium of 2.77 . In March 2024, in connection with the exercise of the first of its three, one year extension options for the maturity date of this loan, our consolidated joint venture purchased a one year interest rate cap for 26,175 with a SOFR strike rate equal to 3.04 , which replaced the previous interest rate cap with a SOFR strike rate equal to 3.40 . Subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions, we have the option to prepay the Mountain Floating Rate Loan in full or in part at any time at par with no premium.

 The weighted average interest rates under our floating rate loans for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 were as follows: 
 Three Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 2024 2023 ILPT Floating Rate Loan (1) 
 6.18 6.18 6.18 6.18 Mountain Floating Rale Loan (2) 
 5.81 6.17 5.90 6.17 
 (1) Reflects the impact of an interest rate cap with a SOFR strike rate equal to 2.25 . 
 (2) Reflects the impact of interest rate caps with a current SOFR strike rate equal to 3.04 , which replaced the previous strike rate equal to 3.40 in March 2024. 
 The one year extension options for the ILPT Floating Rate Loan and the Mountain Floating Rate Loan require, among other things, that we obtain a replacement interest rate cap, as defined in the applicable agreement. 
 In May 2023, our consolidated joint venture obtained a 91,000 fixed rate, interest only mortgage loan secured by four properties owned by our consolidated joint venture. This mortgage loan matures in June 2030 and requires that interest be paid at an annual rate of 6.25 . A portion of the net proceeds from this mortgage loan was used to repay four then outstanding mortgage loans of our consolidated joint venture with an aggregate outstanding principal balance of 35,910 and a weighted average interest rate of 3.70 . We recognized a loss on early extinguishment of debt of 359 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 in conjunction with the repayment of these mortgage loans. 
 As of September 30, 2024, we had an aggregate principal amount of 4,312,421 of indebtedness, including the ILPT Floating Rate Loan, the Mountain Floating Rate Loan, our 700,000 mortgage loan and our 650,000 mortgage loan, scheduled to mature between 2024 and 2038. 
 The agreements and related documents governing the ILPT Floating Rate Loan, the Mountain Floating Rate Loan, our 700,000 mortgage loan and our 650,000 mortgage loan contain customary covenants, provide for acceleration of payment of all amounts due thereunder upon the occurrence and continuation of certain events of default and, in the case of the 650,000 mortgage loan, also require us to maintain a minimum consolidated net worth of at least 250,000 and liquidity of at least 15,000. As of September 30, 2024, we believe that we were in compliance with all of the covenants and other terms under the agreements governing these loans. 
 For further information regarding our indebtedness, see Notes 5 and 6 to our condensed consolidated financial statements included in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. 
 Distributions 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we paid quarterly cash distributions to our shareholders totaling 1,976 using cash on hand. 
 On October 16, 2024, we declared a regular quarterly distribution to common shareholders of record on October 28, 2024 of 0.01 per share, or approximately 661. We expect to pay this distribution to our shareholders on or about November 14, 2024 using cash on hand. 
 Related Person Transactions 
 We have relationships and historical and continuing transactions with RMR, RMR Inc. and others related to them. For further information about these and other such relationships and related person transactions, see Notes 8 and 9 to our condensed consolidated financial statements included in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, our 2023 Annual Report, our definitive Proxy Statement for our 2024 Annual Meeting of Shareholders and our other filings with the SEC. In addition, see the section captioned Risk Factors of our 2023 Annual Report for a description of risks that may arise as a result of these and other related person transactions and relationships. We may engage in additional transactions with related persons, including businesses to which RMR or its subsidiaries provide management services.

 Critical Accounting Estimates 
 The preparation of our condensed consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Significant estimates in the condensed consolidated financial statements include purchase price allocations, useful lives of fixed assets and assessment of impairment of real estate and related intangibles. 
 A discussion of our critical accounting estimates is included in our 2023 Annual Report. There have been no significant changes in our critical accounting estimates since the year ended December 31, 2023. 
 
 Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk dollars in thousands, except per share data 
 
 We are exposed to risks associated with market changes in interest rates. We manage our exposure to this market risk by monitoring available financing alternatives, including fixed rate debt, and employing derivative instruments, including interest rate caps, to limit our exposure to increasing interest rates. Other than as described below, we do not currently expect any significant changes in our exposure to fluctuations in interest rates or in how we manage this exposure in the near future. 
 Floating Rate Debt 
 As of September 30, 2024, our outstanding floating rate debt consisted of the following: 
 Annual Annual Interest Principal Interest Interest Maturity Payments Debt Balance Rate (1) 
 Expense 
 Date Due ILPT Floating Rate Loan 1,235,000 6.18 77,383 10/09/2024 Monthly Mountain Floating Rate Loan 
 1,400,000 5.81 82,470 03/09/2025 Monthly Total / weighted average 2,635,000 5.98 159,853 
 (1) The annual interest rate is the rate stated in the applicable contract, as adjusted by our interest rate caps. 
 
 The ILPT Floating Rate Loan was subject to three, one year extension options as of September 30, 2024, and requires that interest be paid at an annual rate of SOFR plus a weighted average premium of 3.93 . The Mountain Floating Rate Loan is subject to two remaining one year extension options, and requires that interest be paid at an annual rate of SOFR plus a premium of 2.77 . We are vulnerable to changes in the U.S. dollar based on short term interest rates, specifically SOFR. In conjunction with these borrowings, to hedge our exposure to risks related to changes in SOFR, we purchased interest rate caps with a SOFR strike rate equal to 2.25 for the ILPT Floating Rate Loan and 3.04 for the Mountain Floating Rate Loan. In October 2024, we exercised the first of our three, one year extension options for the maturity date of this loan. In connection with the exercise of the extension, we purchased a one year interest rate cap for 16,975 with a SOFR strike rate equal to 2.78 , which replaced the previous interest rate cap with a SOFR strike rate equal to 2.25 . 
 In addition, upon renewal or refinancing of these obligations, we are vulnerable to increases in interest rate premiums, including increases in the cost of replacement interest rate caps, due to market conditions and our perceived credit risk. Generally, a change in interest rates would not affect the value of our floating rate debt but would affect our operating results. The following table presents the approximate impact a one percentage point increase in interest rates would have on our annual floating rate interest expense at September 30, 2024, including the impact of our interest rate caps: 
 Impact of an Increase in Interest Rates Total Interest Annual Weighted Average 
 Outstanding Expense Earnings Per Interest Rate 
 Debt Per Year Share Impact (1) 
 At September 30, 2024 
 5.98 2,635,000 159,853 (2.43) One percentage point increase (2) 
 5.98 2,635,000 159,853 (2.43) 
 (1) Based on the diluted weighted average common shares outstanding for the three months ended September 30, 2024. 
 (2) A one percentage point increase in interest rates would not have an impact on annual total interest expense for our floating rate debt because current interest rates exceed the strike rates of our interest rate caps. However, a one percentage point increase in our weighted average interest rate percentage of our floating rate loan debt at September 30, 2024 would result in a weighted average interest rate of 6.98 , total interest expense per year of 186,568 and a decrease in annual earnings per share of 2.84. 
 31 

Tabl e of Contents 

 The foregoing table shows the impact of an immediate one percentage point change in floating interest rates, including the impact of our interest rate caps. Our exposure to fluctuations in floating interest rates will increase or decrease in the future with increases or decreases in the outstanding amounts of any floating rate debt we may incur and the impact, if any, of interest rate caps we may purchase. Generally, if interest rates were to change gradually over time, the impact would be spread over time. 
 Fixed Rate Debt 
 There have been no material changes to market interest rate risks associated with our fixed rate debt during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024. For a discussion of market interest rate risks associated with our fixed rate debt, see Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk included in Part II, Item 7A of our 2023 Annual Report. 
 
 Item 4. Controls and Procedures 
 
 As of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, our management carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of our Managing Trustees, our President and Chief Operating Officer and our Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer, of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures pursuant to Rules 13a-15 and 15d-15 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. Based upon that evaluation, our Managing Trustees, our President and Chief Operating Officer and our Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures are effective. 
 There have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended September 30, 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
