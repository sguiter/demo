 million of deposited cash held in banks was in excess of the FDIC coverage limit. The Partnership regularly monitors the financial stability of these financial institutions and believes that it is not exposed to any significant credit risk in cash and cash equivalents. However, in March and April 2023, certain U.S. government banking regulators took steps to intervene in the operations of certain financial institutions due to liquidity concerns, which caused general heightened uncertainties in the financial markets. While these and other current events have not had a material direct impact on the Partnership s Plan of Liquidation, if further liquidity and financial stability concerns arise with respect to banks and financial institutions, either nationally or in specific regions of the United States, the Partnership s ability to access cash may be threatened, which could have a material adverse effect on its net assets in liquidation.

As the various pending legal matters against GPB and the Partnership continue, particularly with respect to the Appeal Process, the estimated legal and legal related costs could continue to be significantly adjusted resulting in additional changes to the liability for estimated cost in excess of estimated receipts.

The combination of increasingly higher interest rates, and lower installation activity has led to increasingly difficult conditions in the sector, and have had a direct material impact on Erus business, profitability and cash-flow. In response, Erus implemented a number of initiatives and explored strategic alternatives, including a sale of the business. Despite best efforts to aggressively restructure the business and consummate a sale, management, working with its legal, financial and other advisors, decided that it was in the best interests of all Erus stakeholders for the Erus entities to cease business operations and file Chapter 7 petitions in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the District of Delaware. The Chapter 7 filing resulted in the appointment of a trustee for the Erus entities who will be charged with liquidating their assets and distributing the proceeds to creditors in accordance with the U.S. Bankruptcy Code.

Following the completion of the sale transactions, the Partnership has no involvement in the operations of GPB Prime or Orangeburg. The summarized operating results for the Automotive Retail segment for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 were inconsequential. million and million, respectively. The increase in these legal and legal indemnification cost projections is primarily as a result of significantly higher legal costs due to: (i) the guilty verdict returned in the Criminal Case (as defined below) and the impact it has on our consideration of potential outcomes with respect to the Criminal Case and the Appeal Process and (ii) higher-than-expected activity in numerous current and ongoing legal matters. Legal indemnification expenses paid during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, were million and million, respectively, and reduced the liability for estimated costs in excess of estimated receipts during liquidation in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Net Assets in Liquidation by a corresponding amount. As the various pending legal matters against GPB and the Partnership continue, particularly with respect to the Appeal Process, the estimated legal and legal related costs could continue to be significantly adjusted resulting in additional changes to the liability for estimated cost in excess of estimated receipts. There is significant uncertainty surrounding estimated costs expected to be incurred during the liquidation term, and potentially thereafter, primarily due to the costs covered under the indemnification agreements described in more detail below and the timing and potential outcomes of the Appeal Process. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, the Partnership had million and million, respectively, of legal indemnification expenses recorded in selling, general and administrative expenses in the Condensed Consolidated Statement of Operations. With respect to all significant litigation and regulatory matters facing us and our General Partner, we have considered the likelihood of an adverse outcome. It is possible that we could incur losses pertaining to these matters that may have a material adverse effect on our operational results, financial condition or liquidity in any future reporting period. We understand that the General Partner is currently paying legal costs associated with these actions for itself and certain indemnified parties. The Partnership expects to provide partial, or in many cases complete, reimbursement to the General Partner as required by various agreements or governing law.

On June 6, 2023, Mr. Lash pled guilty to count of wire fraud in the Criminal Case pursuant to a plea agreement. On June 10, 2024, the trial in the Criminal Case commenced against Mr. Gentile and Mr. Schneider. The jury in the Criminal Case returned a guilty verdict on all counts against Mr. Gentile and Mr. Schneider on August 1, 2024. Sentencing of Mr. Gentile and Mr. Schneider is scheduled for March 6, 2025. Mr. Lash s sentencing is scheduled for March 27, 2025. Appointment of Monitor and Application for Receivership On February 11, 2021, the EDNY Court in the SEC Action appointed Joseph T. Gardemal III as the independent monitor over GPB (the Monitor until further order of the EDNY Court (the Monitor Order ). The EDNY Court appointed the Monitor in response to a request from the SEC, which asserted that the Monitor was necessary to protect investors in light of the alleged misconduct of GPB Capital s former CEO, David Gentile. In its February 4, 2021 complaint the Complaint in the SEC Action, the SEC alleged that Mr. Gentile, as the owner and then-CEO of GPB Capital, along with Jeffry Schneider, the owner of Ascendant, GPB s placement agent, lied to investors about the source of money used to make annualized distribution payments to investors. According to the SEC, Mr. Gentile and others allegedly told investors that the distribution payments were paid exclusively with monies generated by GPB portfolio companies, but as alleged, GPB actually used investor money to pay portions of the annualized distributions. The Complaint further contains allegations that Mr. Gentile and others manipulated financial statements of certain limited partnership funds that GPB manages to perpetuate the deception by giving the false appearance that the funds income was closer to generating sufficient income to cover the distribution payments than it actually was. Moreover, the Complaint alleges that Mr. Gentile engaged in undisclosed self-dealing, including by omitting from investor communications certain conflicts of interest and fees and other compensation that he received, totaling approximately million.

 managers Mr. Gentile purported to have appointed to GPB on May 27, 2022. On that same day, May 31, 2022, the Monitor notified Mr. Gentile and GPB that Mr. Gentile s purported appointment of new managers to GPB without Monitor approval was in violation of the Amended Monitor Order. Mr. Gentile and GPB were, at that time, given ten (10) business days to cure the violation of the Amended Monitor Order. The cure period expired without any steps having been taken to comply with the Monitor s notification of violation of the Amended Monitor Order. On June 13, 2022, the SEC filed by order to show cause in the SEC Action an application and order to (i) convert the existing Monitorship over GPB and the GPB-managed funds to a Receivership, and appoint the Monitor, Joseph T. Gardemal III, as Receiver; and (ii) impose a litigation injunction on cases filed against GPB and the GPB-managed funds (the Receivership Application ). The Receivership Application and the Proposed Order Appointing Receiver and Imposing Litigation Injunction (the Proposed Order were filed with the EDNY Court with the consent of GPB s management. The Receivership Application seeks the appointment of Mr. Gardemal as Receiver in order to, in part, streamline the process by which GPB and the GPB-managed funds liquidate remaining portfolio company assets and distribute money to Limited Partners, subject to the EDNY Court s supervision. The Proposed Order would grant to Mr. Gardemal, generally, all powers and authorities previously possessed by the entities subject to the Proposed Order, as well as the powers possessed by the officers, directors, managers and others previously in charge of those entities, and permits him to, among other things, take all such actions necessary to preserve receivership assets. Additionally, the Receivership Application includes a proposed stay of all Federal and State actions (as well as any arbitrations) presently pending against GPB and the GPB-managed funds, or to be filed in the future, and provides for a centralized claims process for GPB Limited Partners, in the EDNY Court, to prevent potentially disparate actions in different courts that could negatively impact the assets proposed to be subject to the EDNY Court s jurisdiction and control. On July 28, 2023, an Eastern District of New York Magistrate Judge issued a Report and Recommendation R R ), recommending that the EDNY Court grant the SEC s Receivership Application (i.e., convert the monitorship to a receivership), including the imposition of a litigation injunction. The Magistrate Judge further recommended that Mr. Gentile s Rule 60(b) Motion be denied as moot, or alternatively, that it be denied as procedurally improper. Mr. Gentile s and Mr. Schneider s objections to the R R, and all responses thereto, were filed with the EDNY Court as of September 29, 2023.

Mr. Dibre answered GPB s Complaint, and asserted counterclaims alleging breach of contract and unjust enrichment. Plaintiffs have since filed amended complaints, narrowing the prior claims to focus on certain specific provisions in the documents governing the sale of the dealerships at issue. The plaintiffs seek damages based on the value of the subject dealerships related to the alleged breach, and also seek an order of specific performance compelling Mr. Dibre to fulfill other obligations under the governing

These forward-looking statements, including with regards to our Plan of Liquidation, as defined below, are based on our current, reasonable expectations and assumptions, which expectations and assumptions are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those reflected in the forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include, but are not limited to, those discussed in this Form 10-Q. Given these risks and uncertainties, readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on forward-looking statements. We undertake no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements, except as required by law. For purposes of this Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations section, we use the terms Holdings II, the Partnership, we , us , our or Registrant to refer to the business of GPB Holdings II, LP and its consolidated subsidiaries, unless otherwise indicated. OVERVIEW GPB Holdings II, LP Holdings II , the Partnership , we , us , our or the Registrant is a holding company which was organized as a Delaware limited partnership on April 17, 2015 and commenced operations on June 1, 2015. GPB Capital Holdings, LLC General Partner , Capital Holdings , GPB Capital or GPB ), a Delaware limited liability company and registered investment adviser, is the Partnership s General Partner pursuant to the terms of the Fourth Amended and Restated Agreement of Limited Partnership, dated April 26, 2018 (as the same may be amended from time to time, the LPA ). Pursuant to the LPA, GPB conducts and manages our business. Robert Chmiel, GPB s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, currently serves as the sole manager of GPB under the terms of GPB s limited liability company agreement. GPB has entered into a management services agreement with GPB s wholly owned subsidiary, Highline Management, Inc. Highline ), pursuant to which Highline provides certain management services to GPB to assist GPB in fulfilling GPB s duties as the Partnership s General Partner. On February 4, 2021, the Securities and Exchange (the SEC filed a contested civil enforcement action (the SEC Action against GPB, Ascendant Capital, LLC Ascendant ), Ascendant Alternative Strategies, LLC AAS ), David Gentile, Jeffry Schneider and Jeffrey Lash in the EDNY Court, as defined below. No GPB-managed partnership is a named defendant. The SEC Action alleges several violations of the federal securities laws, including securities fraud. The SEC is seeking disgorgement and civil monetary penalties, among other remedies. Also on February 4, 2021, the U.S. Attorney s Office for the Eastern District of New York (the USAO brought a criminal indictment against Mr. Gentile (GPB s sole Member), Mr. Schneider, and Mr. Lash (the Criminal Case ). The indictment in the Criminal Case alleges conspiracy to commit securities fraud, conspiracy to commit wire fraud, and securities fraud against all three individuals. Mr. Gentile and Mr. Lash were also charged with two counts of wire fraud. Promptly following his indictment, Mr. Gentile resigned from all management and board positions with GPB and Highline, the GPB-managed funds, including the Partnership, and subsidiaries of the Partnership. On June 6, 2023, Mr. Lash pled guilty to one count of wire fraud in the Criminal Case pursuant to a plea agreement. On June 10, 2024, the trial in the Criminal Case commenced against Mr. Gentile and Mr. Schneider. The jury in the Criminal Case returned a guilty verdict on all counts against Mr. Gentile and Mr. Schneider on August 1, 2024. Sentencing of Mr. Gentile and Mr. Schneider is scheduled for March 6, 2025. Mr. Lash s sentencing is scheduled for March 27, 2025. On February 11, 2021, the United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York (the EDNY Court in the SEC Action appointed Joseph T. Gardemal III as the independent monitor over GPB (the Monitor until further order of the EDNY Court (the Monitor Order ). The Monitor was granted the authority to approve or disapprove proposed material corporate transactions by GPB, the Partnership or its subsidiaries. On April 14, 2021,the EDNY Court entered an amendment to the Monitor Order (the Amended Monitor Order ), which provided that, in addition to the SEC and GPB, certain State regulators will receive access to the periodic reports

 filed by the Monitor pursuant to the Amended Monitor Order. The Monitor, is thus required to assess the Partnership s operations and business, and make recommendations to the EDNY Court, which may include continuation of the operations subject to his monitoring, or a liquidation of assets, or filing for reorganizing in bankruptcy. See Note 5. Commitments and Contingencies in the Notes to the Financial Statements included in the Form 10-Q for additional information. Prior to the sale of substantially all of the Partnership s assets, our strategy in the segments in which we participated was to own and operate income producing, middle-market private companies primarily in North America on a long-term basis with a goal of maximizing returns for our investors by improving performance of operations, thereby increasing the value of these companies. To accomplish our objectives, we provided managerial expertise and investment capital to our portfolio companies in order to develop the operations and enhance the overall value of the business. In other situations, we had equity interests that enabled us to exercise significant influence but not control over the businesses. Following our strategy, we classified the earnings from our investments in entities where we had the ability to exercise significant influence as a component of operating income in our Condensed Consolidated Statement of Operations. Our focus was primarily on owning and operating our portfolio companies in our Technology-Enabled Services, Automotive Retail and Energy segments. Divestiture of Substantially All of the Partnership s Assets Commencing in the second half of fiscal 2023, the Partnership entered into agreements to divest of its portfolio companies previously comprising its Technology-Enabled Services segment. Those divested portfolio companies included Experience Care, LLC, Experience Care which was sold on August 23, 2023, for 12.7 million in net cash proceeds, Cantata Health, LLC Cantata which was sold on October 24, 2023, for 22.3 million in net cash proceeds, and the entirety of the Partnership s 96 indirect ownership interest in HealthPrime International, LLC HealthPrime or HPI which was sold on January 19, 2024 for 190.0 million in net cash proceeds (collectively, the Divested Technology-Enabled Services Portfolio Companies ). Also, in the second half of fiscal 2023, Erus Holdings LLC Erus ), a 60 owned portfolio company of the Partnership, filed for Chapter 7 Bankruptcy Chapter 7 protection on November 8, 2023. Erus accounted for substantially all of the assets and operational activities of the Partnership s Energy segment. The Chapter 7 filing resulted in the appointment of a trustee for the Erus entities who is charged with liquidating their assets and distributing the proceeds to creditors in accordance with the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. (Erus, together with the Divested Technology-Enabled Services Portfolio Companies, the Divested Businesses ). Subject to the Plan of Liquidation discussed below and as of the date of these financial statements, the Partnership continues to hold its investments in Hotel Internet Services, LLC, HIS and Quantum Energy Holdings, LLC, Quantum ). These investments were previously accounted for under the equity method and included as part of the Technology-Enabled Services segment and the Energy segment, respectively, but are now included as part of the Partnership s remaining Corporate and Other segment. The Partnership determined that the Divested Businesses qualified as a component under Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB Accounting Standards Codification ASC 205-20 Financial Statement Presentation, Discontinued Operations ASC 205-20 because they represented operations and cash flows that can be clearly distinguished, operationally and for financial reporting purposes, from the remainder of the Partnership s operations. Further, the Divested Businesses represent a strategic shift in the Partnership s business and their disposal will have a major effect on the entity s operations and financial results. The Partnership also determined that the Divested Businesses met the criteria to be classified as held for sale upon entering into the agreements to sell and the filing for Chapter 7 protection. Consequently, the Partnership has classified the assets and liabilities comprising the Divested Businesses as Assets held for sale, discontinued operations in the accompanying Condensed Consolidated Statement of Net Assets in Liquidation as of December 31, 2023, and the results of operations and cash flows as discontinued operations in the Condensed Consolidated Statement of Operations and Cash Flows for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. See Note 4. Disposals, Assets Held for Sale and Discontinued Operations in our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part I, Item 1 and Part II, Item 6. Exhibits for more information.

 Plan of Liquidation Concurrent with reaching an agreement in principle to sell all of the Partnership s membership interests in HPI (the HPI Transaction ), Highline, on behalf of GPB, commenced the plan to liquidate the Partnership s remaining net assets and wind up the Partnership Plan of Liquidation ). Highline management reached its decision to commence the Plan of Liquidation because of, among other things, the advanced stage of the HPI Transaction, and that no further plans to deploy capital in other investments are contemplated. In accordance with U.S. GAAP, liquidation of the Partnership was thereby determined to be imminent, resulting in adoption of the liquidation basis of accounting as of December 31, 2023. Liquidation is considered imminent when the likelihood is remote that we will return from liquidation and either (a) the Plan of Liquidation is approved by the person or persons with the authority to make such a plan effective and the likelihood is remote that the execution of the Plan of Liquidation will be blocked by other parties, or (b) the Plan of Liquidation is being imposed by other forces (for example, involuntary bankruptcy). The Highline Board of Directors (the Board formally approved the commencement of the Plan of Liquidation at the Board meeting held on December 29, 2023. The Board concluded that it was appropriate to adopt liquidation accounting in accordance with U.S. GAAP for financial reporting purposes, using a convenience date of December 31, 2023. The Partnership cannot predict the timing or amount of any distributions to its limited partners (the Limited Partners ), because uncertainties exist as to: (i) the ultimate amount of expenses associated with implementing its monetization strategy, liabilities, operating costs, and amounts to be set aside for claims; (ii) obligations and provisions during the liquidation and winding-up process; and (iii) the timing and outcome of the pending litigation; and (iv) the related timing to complete such transactions during the overall liquidation process. Upon transitioning to the liquidation basis of accounting on December 31, 2023, the Partnership estimated the liquidation process would be complete by December 31, 2026, an estimate that is in part, driven by the anticipated sale of the remaining Partnership assets and the commencement date for the Criminal Case as described in Note 5. Commitments and Contingencies in the Notes to the Financial Statements included in the Form 10-Q. No assurances can be provided that the expected liquidation completion date will be met and future changes to this expected date could have a material impact in the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements and the amount, if any, that is ultimately distributed to our Limited Partners. On May 14, 2024, Tom Lemke resigned from the Board. Following the Implementation of the Plan of Liquidation Highline s approval to commence the Plan of Liquidation and to dissolve substantially all of the net assets of the Partnership on December 29, 2023, requires our financial statements to be prepared in accordance with the liquidation basis of accounting as defined in the FASB ASC 205-30 Financial Statement Presentation, Liquidation Basis of Accounting ASC 205-30 ). The liquidation basis of accounting differs significantly from the going concern basis, as summarized below. Under the liquidation basis of accounting, the consolidated balance sheet and consolidated statements of operations, equity and cash flows are no longer presented. The liquidation basis of accounting requires a statement of net assets in liquidation, a statement of changes in net assets in liquidation and all disclosures necessary to present relevant information about our expected resources in liquidation. The liquidation basis of accounting may only be applied prospectively from the day liquidation becomes imminent and the initial statement of changes in net assets in liquidation may present only changes in net assets that occurred during the period since that date. Under the liquidation basis of accounting, our assets are measured at their estimated net realizable value, or liquidation value, which represents the amount of their estimated cash proceeds or other consideration from liquidation, based on current contracts, estimates and other indications of sales value, and includes assets held for sale. In developing these estimates, we utilized the forecasts generated by our management. All estimates by nature involve a large degree of judgement and sensitivity to the underlying assumptions. Under the liquidation basis of accounting, we recognize liabilities as they would have been recognized under the going concern basis as adjusted for the timing assumptions related to the liquidation process and they will not be reduced to expected settlement values prior to settlement. Our liabilities are derecognized when we pay the obligation or when we are legally released from being the primary obligor under the liability.

 The valuation of our assets and liabilities, as described above, represents estimates, based on present facts and circumstances, of the net realizable value of the assets and costs associated with carrying out the Plan of Liquidation. The actual values and costs associated with carrying out the Plan of Liquidation may differ from amounts reflected in the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements because of the Plan of Liquidation s inherent uncertainty. These differences may be material. In particular, these estimates will vary with the length of time necessary to complete the Plan of Liquidation. It is currently anticipated that a majority of the assets we owned on the date the Plan of Liquidation as approved by Highline will be sold by December 31, 2025, with liquidation complete by December 31, 2026, however, no assurances can be provided that this date will be met. This date was determined through management consultation with the Board, consultation with the Monitor and the Partnership s external counsel and contemplates such matters as the sale of the remaining investments in HIS, Quantum and the note receivable from TDR Riverwalk LLC (an unrelated Florida limited liability company, Riverwalk ), as well as the timing of Mr. Gentile s criminal trial and outcome and the settling of pending litigation as the main components driving the estimate on timing of complete liquidation. Any delays in the timing of the resolution of these matters could significantly delay both the completion date and the amounts available to be distributed upon liquidation. Net assets in liquidation represents the estimated liquidation value to holders of Units upon liquidation. It is not possible to predict with certainty the timing or aggregate amount which may ultimately be distributed to our Limited Partners and no assurance can be given that the distributions will equal or exceed the estimate presented in these Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. OUR SEGMENTS Prior to the sale of substantially all of the Partnership s assets, we provided a range of strategic, operational and management resources to our subsidiaries which were engaged in a number of diverse business activities. Our Chief Operating Decision Maker CODM regularly reviewed consolidated financial information, evaluated overall strategic performance, and allocated resources to the Partnership in three distinct segments-the Technology-Enabled Services segment, the Energy segment and the Corporate and Other segment. After the divestiture of our assets, we are now reporting our business operation solely as Corporate and Other . The Corporate and Other segment primarily consisted of other operating segments that were not reportable under the quantitative thresholds in accordance with U.S. GAAP, or were the selling, general and administrative expenses of the Partnership. The Partnership owns a 33.5 interest in GPB Prime Holdings, LLC GPB Prime ), an operator of automotive retail dealerships. The Partnership has a 50 non-controlling investment in Quantum. Quantum provides customer acquisition services to the alternative energy industry. The Partnership also has a non-controlling investment of 31 in HIS. HIS provides the equipment and associated internet access services to hotels, resorts, military, student housing, casinos, and many other commercial venues. Quantum and HIS were formerly accounted for under the equity method but are now accounted for at estimated net realizable value pursuant to our Plan of Liquidation. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS In light of the adoption of Liquidation Basis of Accounting as of December 31, 2023, the results of operations for the current period are not comparable to the prior year period. Due to the adoption of the Plan of Liquidation, we no longer consider this to be a key performance measure, and we no longer report results of our operations information.

 The following table summarizes the results of our operations for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, under the going concern basis of accounting. 

Three Months Ended Nine Months Ended September 30, September 30, 2023 2023 Operating expenses (income): Selling, general and administrative expenses 7,395 19,424 Managerial assistance fee, related party 3,089 9,205 Loss from equity method investments 8,235 4,287 Total net operating expenses 18,719 32,916 Operating loss (18,719) (32,916) Other income: Interest income 4,683 10,704 Other income 321 329 Total other income 5,004 11,033 Net loss from continuing operations (13,715) (21,883) Loss from discontinued operations (11,916) (20,644) Gain from sale of discontinued operations 7,460 7,460 Income tax expense, discontinued operations (95) (562) Net loss from discontinued operations (4,551) (13,746) Net loss from continuing and discontinued operations (18,266) (35,629) Net loss attributable to non-controlling interests (4,601) (10,379) Net loss attributable to the Partnership (13,665) (25,250) LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES The Partnership has historically relied primarily on cash, cash equivalents, and investment securities, cash flows from operations, borrowings under our credit facilities, and lines of credit as the main sources for liquidity. We used those funds to invest in capital improvements and additions, and to satisfy contractual obligations. Since the adoption of our Plan of Liquidation, our ability to meet our obligations is contingent upon the disposal of our assets in accordance with the Plan of Liquidation. All significant non-cash assets except for Quantum, HIS, and the Riverwalk promissory note receivable have been liquidated. As of September 30, 2024, we had 12.4 million in cash and cash equivalents and 494.5 million in Treasury Bills. We expect that this cash, cash equivalents, and investment securities will be adequate to meet our obligations, pursuant to our Plan of Liquidation. CONTRACTUAL PAYMENT OBLIGATIONS As of September 30, 2024, there have been no material changes to the contractual payment obligations table included in the Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC on March 28, 2024 (the Form 10-K ). OFF BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS We do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that have, or are reasonably likely to have, a material current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES There have been no material changes to the critical accounting policies and use of estimates since the filing of our Form 10-K. Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk There have been no material changes in our reported market risks or risk management policies since the filing of our Form 10-K.

 Item 4. Controls and Procedures The Partnership s management, with the participation of Rob Chmiel, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer of GPB, has evaluated the effectiveness of the Partnership s disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act )) as of September 30, 2024. Based on that evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer has concluded that at September 30, 2024, due to the existence of the material weaknesses in the Partnership s internal controls over financial reporting ICFR described below, the Partnership s disclosure controls and procedures were not effective. Notwithstanding such material weaknesses in the Partnership s ICFR, our management concluded that our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-Q present fairly, in all material respects, the Partnership s Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements as on the dates, and for the periods presented, in conformity with U.S. GAAP for interim financial information and in accordance with the rules and regulations of the SEC. Internal Controls over Financial Reporting Material Weaknesses We have concluded that there are material weaknesses in our system of ICFR, which if not remediated could materially and adversely affect our ability to timely and accurately report our results of operations and financial condition. We have identified deficiencies, or a combination of deficiencies, relating to risk assessment, control activities and monitoring of the Partnership s control environment that have been determined to be material weaknesses in our internal controls. These identified weaknesses are attributed, in part, to insufficient and ineffective controls within our financial close and reporting process. Remediation Plan Our management is committed to maintaining a strong internal control environment and implementing measures designed to help ensure the financial statements are free of material error. To remediate the material weaknesses, management believes the following remediation plans would have to be developed, implemented and tested: establishing a hierarchy of review with the appropriate complement of management personnel, and implementing intensive review policies and procedures to be performed at an appropriate level of precision. 
 Our management is currently determining the extent and timing of its remediation efforts including rationalizing the level of investment necessary to mitigate the level of risk brought on by our material weaknesses, in light of the progress being made in our Plan of Liquidation. We may decide to take additional measures to address control deficiencies or determine to modify, or, in appropriate circumstances, not to complete such actions due to the timing of carrying out the Plan of Liquidation. Changes in Internal Controls over Financial Reporting There were no changes in our ICFR during the three Months Ended September 30, 2024, that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our ICFR.
