Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q contains certain forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities
Act of 1933, as amended (the Securities Act ), and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange
Act ). These forward-looking statements represent our expectations, beliefs, intentions or strategies concerning future events,
including, but not limited to, any statements regarding our assumptions about financial performance; the continuation of historical trends;
the sufficiency of our cash balances for future liquidity and capital resource needs; the expected impact of changes in accounting policies
on our results of operations, financial condition or cash flows; anticipated problems and our plans for future operations; and the economy
in general or the future of the agriculture technology industry, all of which were subject to various risks and uncertainties. 

When
used in this Quarterly Report on Form 10- Q and other reports, statements, and information we have filed with the Securities and Exchange
Commission Commission or SEC ), in our press releases, in our periodic reports on Forms 10-K and 10-Q, in
oral statements made by or with the approval of an executive officer, the words or phrases believes, may, 
 will, expects, should, continue, anticipates, intends, 
 will likely result, estimates, projects or similar expressions and variations thereof are intended
to identify such forward-looking statements. However, any statements contained in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q that are not statements

uncertainties, certain of which are beyond our control, and actual results may differ materially depending on a variety of important
factors. 

We
do not assume the obligation to update any forward-looking statement. You should carefully evaluate such statements in light of factors
described in this annual report. In this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, AgriFORCE Growing Systems Ltd. has identified important factors

NOTES
TO THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED INTERIM FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 

 For
the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 (unaudited) 

 (Expressed
in US Dollars, except where noted) 

Liquidity
and Management s Plan 

The
Company has incurred substantial operating losses since its inception and expects to continue to incur significant operating losses
for the foreseeable future. As reflected in the interim financial statements for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the
Company had a net loss of million,
 million
of net cash used in operating activities, and the Company had a working capital deficiency of million. 

On
June 24, 2024, the Company received a Staff Listing Determination Letter from Nasdaq pursuant to which the Staff has determined that
as of June 21, 2024, the Company s common shares had a per share closing bid price of or less for ten consecutive trading
days (the Company s bid price has closed at or below per share from June 6, 2024, through June 21, 2024). Nasdaq has granted
the Company an exception to comply with the bid price rule as follows: 

1. 
 On
 or before November 27, 2024, the Company shall obtain shareholders approval for a reverse stock split at a ratio that satisfies the
 minimum requirement in the Bid Price Rule; 
 
 2. 
 On
 or before December 4, 2024, the Company shall effect a reverse stock split and, thereafter, maintain a closing bid price for a
 minimum of ten consecutive business days; 
 
 3. 
 On
 or before December 17, 2024, the Company shall have demonstrated compliance with the Bid Price Rule, by evidencing a closing bid
 price of or more per share for a minimum of ten consecutive trading sessions. 

To
meet these requirements, the Company is holding its previously postponed Annual Meeting of Shareholders on November 25, 2024, and assuming
shareholder approval, will effect a reverse split immediately thereafter. 

The
accompanying interim financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis, which contemplates the realization of assets
and satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business. The interim financial statements do not include any adjustments
relating to the recoverability and classification of recorded asset amounts or the amounts and classification of liabilities that
might result from the outcome of this uncertainty. The Company is at the development stage of its business plan. As such it is
likely that additional financing will be needed by the Company to fund its operations and to develop and commercialize its
technology. These factors raise substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. For the next
twelve months from issuance of these interim financial statements, the Company plans to seek to obtain additional capital through
the sale of debt or equity financings or other arrangements to fund operations; however, there can be no assurance that the Company
will be able to raise needed capital under acceptable terms, if at all. The sale of additional equity may dilute existing
shareholders and newly issued shares may contain senior rights and preferences compared to our currently outstanding common shares.
If the Company is unable to obtain such additional financing, future operations would need to be scaled back or discontinued. Due to
the uncertainty in the Company s ability to raise capital, management believes that there is substantial doubt in the
Company s ability to continue as a going concern for twelve months from the issuance of these interim financial
statements. 

Reverse
Stock Split 

On
October 11, 2023, the Company executed a one-for-fifty reverse stock split of the Company s common shares (the Reverse Split ).
As a result of the Reverse Split, every 50 shares of the Company s old common shares were converted into one share of the Company s
new common shares. Fractional shares resulting from the reverse split were rounded up to the nearest whole number. The Reverse Split
automatically and proportionately adjusted all issued and outstanding shares of the Company s common shares, as well as convertible
debentures, convertible features, prefunded warrants, stock options and warrants outstanding at the time of the date of the Reverse Split.
The exercise price on outstanding equity based-grants was proportionately increased, while the number of shares available under the Company s
equity-based plans was proportionately reduced. Share and per share data (except par value) for the periods presented reflect the effects
of the Reverse Split. References to numbers of common shares and per share data in the accompanying financial statements and notes thereto
for periods ended prior to October 11, 2023 have been adjusted to reflect the Reverse Split on a retroactive basis. 

In
December 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-09, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures. ASU 2023-09
requires companies to provide enhanced rate reconciliation disclosures, including disclosure of specific categories and additional information
for reconciling items. The standard also requires companies to disaggregate income taxes paid by federal, state and foreign taxes. ASU
2023-09 is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2024 on a retrospective or prospective basis. We are currently assessing
the impact this guidance will have on our financial statements. 

Other
accounting standards that have been issued or proposed by FASB that do not require adoption until a future date are not expected to have
a material impact on the consolidated financial statements upon adoption. The Company does not discuss recent pronouncements that are
not anticipated to have an impact on or are unrelated to its financial condition, results of operations, cash flows or disclosures. 

Level
 2: Defined as observable inputs other than quoted prices included in Level 1. This includes quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities
 in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar assets and liabilities in markets that are not active, or other inputs
 that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities.

Level
 3: Defined as unobservable inputs to the valuation methodology that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant
 to the measurement of the fair value of the assets or liabilities. Level 3 assets and liabilities include those whose fair value
 measurements are determined using pricing models, discounted cash flow methodologies or similar valuation techniques, as well as
 significant management judgment or estimation. 

to ,
and providing the Company control over RCS. The RCS technology is
a product line consisting of patent-pending smart hydroxyl generation systems focused on numerous industry verticals
that is proven to eliminate 99.99+ of all major pathogens, virus, mold, volatile organic compounds VOCs and allergy triggers. As
the Company s investment in RCS does not have a readily determinable fair value, the Company previously elected to account for
its 
interest in RCS at cost, less impairment. The Company recognized a loss on the investment of 
during the three- and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024. 

Net
 loss 

The
Company did not have any material, nonrecurring pro forma adjustments directly attributable to the business combination included in the
reported pro forma revenue and net loss position. 

These
pro forma amounts have been calculated after applying the Company s accounting policies and adjusting the results of RCS to reflect
the additional amortization that would have been charged assuming the fair value adjustments to the intangible assets had been applied
from August 1, 2024, with the consequential tax effects.

Litigation 

On
August 11, 2023, AgriFORCE s former CEO, Ingo Wilhelm Mueller filed a Notice of Civil Claim in which he alleges that AgriFORCE
wrongfully terminated his employment without notice, in breach of the parties underlying employment agreement. Mr. Mueller alleges
to have suffered damages including, among other things, a loss of base salary of CAD per annum and damages from not receiving
common stock of AgriFORCE equivalent in value to CAD. AgriFORCE s position is that Mr. Mueller was terminated for just
cause because he breached his fiduciary duty to act in AgriFORCE s best interest by, among other things, submitting a sizeable
bid for the acquisition of a company without first obtaining Board approval. In doing so, Mr. Mueller misrepresented AgriFORCE s
financial standing and forged, or instructed others to forge, a document by affixing the electronic signature of AgriFORCE s CFO. 

As
at December 31, 2023, the parties were in the discovery stage of litigation. AgriFORCE has produced relevant documents to Mr. Mueller,
and is awaiting Mr. Mueller s production of relevant documents. The parties are also in the process of scheduling examinations
for discovery. Management is instructing counsel to advance the matter given the relative strength of AgriFORCE s case. 

The
likelihood of an unfavorable outcome is relatively low given the facts supporting AgriFORCE s for cause termination
of Mr. Mueller as well as the significant expense that Mr. Mueller would have to incur to advance this matter to trial.

Company s registered and records office address is at 800 525 West 8 th Avenue, Vancouver, British Columbia,
Canada, V5Z 1C6. 

The
Company is an innovative sustainable technology focused company that strives to innovate and deliver sustainable technology
solutions across a wide array of verticals utilization of our proprietary intellectual property to businesses and enterprises
through our AgriFORCE Solutions division Solutions and deliver innovative flour products through our
AgriFORCE Brands division Brands ). To this end, we announce the next phase of
our transition, highlighted by the intended integration of Bitcoin mining solutions and the ancillary environmental and
power-generation benefits that result from engaging in that business. We recognize the potential of Bitcoin and other digital
currencies in facilitating sustainable financial transactions and intend to utilize 10-20 of our future capital raised to purchase
and hold Bitcoin . In the third quarter of 2024, the Company bought the assets of the
Radical Clean Solutions RCS business for which it had bought an exclusive license to the agricultural industry in
2023. During 2023, the Company launched its UN(THINK) Awakened Flour , which is a nutritious flour that we believe provides
health advantages over traditional flour. 

While
Solutions legacy focus was to operate in the plant based pharmaceutical, nutraceutical, and other high value crop markets using
its unique proprietary facility design and hydroponics based automated growing system that enable cultivators to effectively grow crops
in a controlled environment FORCEGH+ ). it has changed its focus to broaden the use of its proprietary intellectual
property across multiple industries. For instance, the Company through its RCS purchase is not able to utilize that technology to deliver
solutions across multiple industries, including not only agriculture, but other industries including hospitality, commercial applications,
education institutions, residential real estate and transportation. 

Brands
is focused on the development and commercialization of plant-based ingredients and products that deliver healthier and more nutritious
solutions. We strive to market and commercialize both branded consumer product offerings and ingredient supply.

Foods 

The
Company purchased Intellectual Property IP from Manna Nutritional Group, LLC Manna ), a privately held
firm based in Boise, Idaho on September 10, 2021. The IP encompasses a granted patent to naturally process and convert grain, pulses
and root vegetables, resulting in low-starch, low-sugar, high-protein, fiber-rich baking flour as well as produces a natural sweetener
juice. The core process is covered under Patent Nr. 11,540,538 in the U.S. and key international markets. The all-natural process is
designed to unlock nutritional properties, flavors, and other qualities in a range of modern, ancient and heritage grains, pulses and
root vegetables to create specialized all-natural baking and all-purpose flours, sweeteners, juices, naturally sweet cereals and other
valuation products, providing numerous opportunities for dietary nutritional, performance and culinary applications. 

During
the year ended December 31, 2023, the Company has achieved milestones towards the commercialization of our UN(THINK) Awakened Flour 
flour, the Company s first line of products to utilize the IP. Management has defined and tested its quality controls and safety
protocols for production, and produced several multi-ton batches of germinated grains, refining and scaling production processes with
our partners in Canada. We are also in the process of qualifying partners in the US to establish additional production hubs at
no additional CAPEX - which will support growth and reduce logistics costs for customers in the region. Additionally, we have established
our supply chain logistics with a contracted shipping company and two warehouses in Canada and the US. Our commercial team made progress
in defining pricing and is starting to approach US and Canadian Bakeries and Baked Goods Companies who are now testing our new flours
for integration into their manufacturing operations and innovation pipeline. Online sales logistics and advertising materials were developed
during the period to support the establishment of the direct-to-consumer sales channel which will be started once the Business to Business
channel sales will ramp up. Lastly, the Company has developed an extensive number of recipes for the application of Awakened Flour 
product line for both customers and consumers.

Wheat
and Flour Market 

Modern
diet is believed to be a contributor to health risks such as heart disease, cancer, diabetes and obesity, due in part to the consumption
of highly processed foods that are low in natural fiber, protein and nutrition; and extremely high in simple starch, sugar and calories.
These empty carbs produce glycemic swings that may cause overeating by triggering cravings for food high in sugar, salt
and starch. As an example, conventional baking flour is low in natural fiber (~ 2-3 ), low-to-average in protein (~ 9 ), and very high
in starch (~ 75 (1) . Apart from dietary fiber, whole flour is only marginally better in terms of these macronutrients (2) . 

In
contrast, foods high in fiber help to satiate hunger, suppress cravings and raise metabolism (3) . They also assist in weight
loss, lower cholesterol, and may reduce the risk of cancer, heart disease and diabetes (4) . 

Advantages
of the UN(THINK) Foods IP 

Our
Controlled Enzymatic Reaction Endothermic Saccharification with Managed Natural Germination CERES-MNG patented
process allows for the development and manufacturing of all-natural flours that are significantly higher in fibers, nutrients and proteins
and significantly lower in carbohydrates and calories than standard baking flour. 

CERES-MNG
baking flour produced from soft white wheat has 40 times more fiber, three (3) times more protein and 75 less net carbohydrates than
regular all- purpose flour (5) .

Understanding
Our Approach Bringing Cutting Edge Technology to Enhance and Modernize Agriculture 

Traditional
farming includes three fundamental approaches: outdoor, greenhouse and indoor. We are taking modern technologies such as artificial intelligence AI and blockchain based advances to bring what is traditionally a low technology industry into the 21 st century.
This approach means that we are able to reach into areas not readily available to agricultural businesses in the past, such as advanced
Fintech to enhance financing capabilities for these businesses and more readily provide advanced intelligence for farmers. These technologies
can also be applied to worldwide sourcing and matching food producers to consumers in an efficient manner. 

Our
intellectual property combines a patented uniquely engineered facility design and automated growing system to solve excessive water loss
and high energy consumption, two problems plaguing nearly all controlled environment agriculture systems. FORCEGH+ delivers a patented
clean, sealed, self-contained micro-environment that maximizes natural sunlight and offers supplemental LED lighting. It limits human
intervention and is designed to provide superior quality control through AI optical technology. It was also created to drastically reduce
environmental impact, substantially decrease utility demands, conserving water, while delivering customers daily harvests and higher
crop yields. 

The
Ag-Tech sector is severely underserved by the capital markets, and we see an opportunity to acquire global companies who have provided
solutions to the industry and are leading innovation moving forward. The robustness of our engagement with potential targets has confirmed
our belief and desire to be part of a larger integrated Ag-Tech solutions provider, where each separate element of the business has its
existing legacy business and can leverage across areas of expertise to expand their business footprint. 

BUSINESS
PLAN

RCS
Acquisition 

We
purchased all of the assets of RCS in August 2024. A discussion of the acquisition is set forth above in footnote 3 to our financial
statements included herein. 

Status
as an Emerging Growth Company 

On
April 5, 2012, the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012, or the JOBS Act, was enacted. Section 107 of the JOBS Act provides that
an emerging growth company can take advantage of the extended transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities
Act of 1933, as amended, or the Securities Act, for complying with new or revised accounting standards. In other words, an emerging
growth company can delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies.
We have irrevocably elected to avail ourselves of this extended transition period and, as a result, we will adopt new or revised accounting
standards on the relevant dates on which adoption of such standards is required for private companies. 

29 

We
are in the process of evaluating the benefits of relying on other exemptions and reduced reporting requirements provided by the JOBS
Act. Subject to certain conditions set forth in the JOBS Act, as an emerging growth company, we intend to rely on certain
of these exemptions from, without limitation, (i) providing an auditor s attestation report on our system of internal controls
over financial reporting pursuant to Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and (ii) complying with any requirement that may be adopted
by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (PCAOB) regarding mandatory audit firm rotation or a supplement to the auditor s
report providing additional information about the audit and the financial statements, known as the auditor discussion and analysis. We
will remain an emerging growth company until the earliest of (a) the last day of our fiscal year following the fifth anniversary
of the closing of the initial public offering, (b) the last day of the first fiscal year in which our annual gross revenues exceed 1.07
billion, (c) the last day of our fiscal year in which we are deemed to be a large accelerated filer as defined in Rule
12b-2 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, or Exchange Act (which would occur if the market value of our equity securities that
is held by non-affiliates exceeds 700 million as of the last business day of our most recently completed second fiscal quarter), or
(d) the date on which we have issued more than 1 billion in nonconvertible debt during the preceding three-year period.

Liquidity
and Capital Resources 

The
Company s primary need for liquidity is to fund working capital requirements, capital expenditures, and for general corporate purposes.
The Company s ability to fund operations and make planned capital expenditures and debt service obligations depends on future operating
performance and cash flows, which are subject to prevailing economic conditions, financial markets, business and other factors. We have
recorded a net loss of 13,407,164 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, and a net loss of 7,740,078 for the nine months ended
September 30, 2023. We have recorded an accumulated deficit of 57,914,468 as of September 30, 2024 and 44,507,304 as of December
31, 2023. Net cash used in operating activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023 was 3,429,189
and 5,437,592 respectively. 

The
Company held 1,373,294 in cash as at September 30, 2024 as compared to 3,878,578 at December 31, 2023. 

Our
future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including: 

the
 cost and timing of our regulatory activities, especially the process to obtain regulatory approval for our intellectual properties
 in the U.S. and in foreign countries 

the
 costs of R D activities we undertake to further develop our technology 

the
 costs of constructing our grow houses, including any impact of complications, delays, and other unknown events 

the
 costs of commercialization activities, including sales, marketing and production 

the
 level of working capital required to support our growth 

our
 need for additional personnel, information technology or other operating infrastructure to support our growth and operations as a
 public company 

completion
 of planned acquisitions 

The
accompanying financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis, which contemplates the realization of assets and satisfaction
of liabilities in the normal course of business. The financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability
and classification of recorded asset amounts or the amounts and classification of liabilities that might result from the outcome of this
uncertainty. The Company is at the stage of development of its first facility and other IP. As such it is likely that additional financing
will be needed by the Company to fund its operations and to develop and commercialize its technology. These factors raise substantial
doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. 

For
the next twelve months from issuance of these financial statements, the Company will seek to obtain additional capital through the sale
of debt or equity financings or other arrangements to fund operations; however, there can be no assurance that the Company will be able
to raise needed capital under acceptable terms, if at all. The sale of additional equity may dilute existing shareholders and newly issued
shares may contain senior rights and preferences compared to currently outstanding common shares. Issued debt securities may contain
covenants and limit the Company s ability to pay dividends or make other distributions to shareholders. If the Company is unable
to obtain such additional financing, future operations would need to be scaled back or discontinued. Due to the uncertainty in the Company s
ability to raise capital, management believes that there is substantial doubt in the Company s ability to continue as a going concern
for twelve months from the issuance of these financial statements. 

Cash
Flows 

The
net cash used by operating activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 3,429,189 compared to 5,437,592 for the nine
months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease of 2,008,403 was primarily due to the following: 

Increase in impairment of intangible asset of 4,137 271 due to assessment
noted above. 

Increase in loss on long-term investment of 97,488 due to assessment noted above. 

Decrease
 in cash flow adjustments of 188,463 for share based compensation due to forfeiture of stock options by departed employees. 

Decrease
 of 3,254,034 in amortization of debt issuance costs for less interest recorded on debentures as the carrying value of the debentures
 were lower as at September 30, 2024 compared to September 30, 2023. 

Increase
in prepaid expenses and other current assets used in operating activities of 571,119 due to utilization of consulting retainers and
as well as additional prepayments made during September 30, 2024 for various services. 

Decrease
 in accounts payable and accrued liabilities of 701,115 due to the Company paying down its higher aged trade payables balance during
 the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 

32 

This
was partially offset by the following: 

Increase in net loss of 5,667,086 due to operating expenses noted above. 

Non-cash
 change in fair value of derivative liabilities decreased by 4,960,5139 due to (1) the draw down as well as the extinguishment of
 conversion feature derivatives as a result of significant conversions of several tranches of debentures, and (2) the Company s
 stock price stabilizing during the period between December 31, 2023 and September 30, 2024, resulting in the smaller revaluation adjustment
 as at September 30, 2024. 

Increase
 in loss on debt extinguishment cash adjustment by 2,223,250 as a result of unscheduled conversions of debentures into the Company s
 common shares which triggered extinguishments of debt due to the change of the fair value of the debt after the conversions. There
 were no debt extinguishments during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 

Increase
 in loss on conversion of convertible debt cash adjustment by 1,086,128 due to a significant amount of unscheduled conversions that
 resulted in shares issued at a higher premium above the exercise price compared to shares issued during the six months ended September
 30, 2023. 

All
 other items aggregate to 114,429. 

Net cash used in investing activities was 356,079
for cash consideration paid for the RCS acquisition. 

Net
cash provided by financing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, represents net proceeds from debentures of 2,250,000.
This was partially offset by repayments on convertible debentures of 802,282 and financing costs of debentures of 84,463. Net cash
provided by financing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, represents net proceeds from debentures of 4,615,385
as well as common shares issued for cash of 1,342,915. This was partially offset by repayments on convertible debentures of 1,741,950,
financing costs of debentures of 325,962 and share issuance costs of 153,220.

Item
3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 

As
a smaller reporting company as defined by Rule 12b-2 of the Exchange Act and in Item 10(f)(1) of Regulation S-K, we are electing scaled
disclosure reporting obligations and therefore are not required to provide the information requested by this item. 

Item
4. Controls and Procedures 

Disclosure
Controls and Procedures. 

Our
management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in Rules 13a-15(f)
and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act. Our management is also required to assess and report on the effectiveness of our internal control
over financial reporting in accordance with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 Section 404 ). Our internal control
over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the
preparation of financial statements for external purposes of accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. Management
assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2024. In making this assessment, we used
the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in Internal Control - Integrated
Framework in the 2013 COSO framework. Based on this assessment, management concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were
effective. 

Changes
in Internal Controls. 

There
have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended September 30, 2024, that have materially
affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal controls over financial reporting. 

Limitations
on Effectiveness of Controls and Procedures 

Our
disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting are designed to provide reasonable assurance of achieving
the desired control objectives. Our management recognizes that any control system, no matter how well designed and operated, is based
upon certain judgments and assumptions and cannot provide absolute assurance that its objectives will be met. In addition, the design
of disclosure controls and procedures must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and that management is required to apply
judgment in evaluating the benefits of possible controls and procedures relative to their costs. Similarly, an evaluation of controls
cannot provide absolute assurance that misstatements due to error or fraud will not occur or that all control issues and instances of
fraud, if any, have been detected.
