Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS This Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (MD A) contains forward-looking statements that involve known and unknown risks, significant uncertainties and other factors that may cause our actual results, levels of activity, performance or achievements to be materially different from any future results, levels of activity, performance or achievements expressed, or implied, by those forward-looking statements. You can identify forward-looking statements by the use of the words may, will, should, could, expects, plans, anticipates, believes, estimates, predicts, intends, potential, proposed, or continue or the negative of those terms. These statements are only predictions. In evaluating these statements, you should consider various factors which may cause our actual results to differ materially from any forward-looking statements.

Therefore, actual results may differ materially and adversely from those expressed in any forward- looking statements.

Liquidity and Capital Resources As of March 31, 2023, we had a cash balance of 20 and total assets of 96,093 compared to cash and total assets of 392 as at June 30, 2022. The increase in total assets was due to an asset acquisition. In furtherance of our business plan, on February 17, 2023, we entered into an Asset Purchase Agreement with Grit Performance Athletics Inc. Grit Performance to acquire all right, title and interest of Grit Performance and its Affiliates in the Grit Mobile Application and related products, including website, Instagram account, etc. (the Assets ). The Assets are valued at 100,000 As at March 31, 2023, and June 30, 2022 we had total liabilities of 98,438 and 82,484 respectively. Our liabilities at March 31, 2023 and June 30, 2022 were comprised of amounts due to our President and Director and for two loans payable to non- related parties for 16,000, which are unsecured, non-interest bearing, and due on or before December 31, 2023. During the three months ended March 31, 2023 the President of the Company contributed 6,416 towards operating expenses. Our working capital deficit was 82,418 as at March 31, 2023 compared to 66,092 as at June 30, 2022 respectively. During the period ended March 31, 2023, we did not issue any common shares. During the year ended June 30, 2022, the Company received 3,000 of share subscriptions relating to a private placement of common shares at 0.10 per share. On October 18, 2021, the Company issued 350,000 common shares at 0.10 per share relating to private placement proceeds of 35,000 that was received as at September 30, 2021. Results of Operations For the three months ended March 31, 2023 and 2022. During the three months ended March 31, 2023, we incurred 9,489 of operating expenditures comprised of amortization expenses, general and administrative, professional fees, and transfer agent fees compared to 23,027 for general and administrative bank and transfer agent fees during the three months ended March 31, 2022. 15 Table of Contents For the nine months ended March 31, 2023 and 2022. During the nine months ended March 31, 2023, we incurred 20,253 of operating expenditures comprised of amortization expenses, general and administrative, professional fees and transfer agent fees compared to 48,489 for general and administrative, professional fees and transfer agent fees during the six months ended March 31, 2022. The decrease during the six months ended March 31, 2023 is due to increased professional fees incurred during the six months ended March 31, 2022 related to updating our SEC reporting requirements which included a one-time fee of 20,000. Cash Flows During the nine months ended March 31, 2023, we used 18,588 of cash for operating activities compared to the use of (48,141) for operating activities during the nine months ended March 31, 2022. Asset Purchase Agreement with Grit Performance Athletics Inc. Grit Performance to acquire all right, title and interest of Grit Performance and its Affiliates in the Grit Mobile Application and related products, including website, Instagram account, etc. (the Assets ). The Assets are valued at 100,000 and the consideration is booked as share subscription payable . The shares were issued after March 31, 2023. During the nine months ended March 31, 2023, we had investing activities which included the purchase of an intangible asset of 100,000). We did not have any investing activities during the nine months ended March 31, 2023. During the nine months ended March 31, 2023, we did not receive any cash from share subscriptions compared to 3,000 during the nine months ended March 31, 2022. Trends There is no assurance that we will be able to generate cash flow from our operations. The outcome of these matters cannot be predicted with any certainty at this time and raises substantial doubt that we will be able to continue as a going concern. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements We have no significant off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in our financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that are material to our stockholders. Inflation The effect of inflation on our revenues and operating results has not been significant. Critical Accounting Policies Our financial statements are presented in United States dollars and are prepared using the accrual method of accounting, which conforms to US GAAP. We have elected to use the extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standards under Section 102(b) (1) of the JOBS Act. This election allows us to delay the adoption of new or revised accounting standards that have different effective dates for public and private companies until those standards apply to private companies. As a result of this election, our financial statements may not be comparable to companies that comply with public company effective dates. 16 Table of Contents The financial statements as of and for the nine months ended March 31, 2023 included herein, which have not been audited pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission, reflect all adjustments which, in the opinion of management, are necessary for a fair presentation of financial position, results of operations and cash flows for the interim periods on a basis consistent with the annual audited statements. All such adjustments are of a normal recurring nature. The results of operations for interim periods are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for any other interim period or for a full year. Certain information, accounting policies and footnote disclosures normally included in financial statements prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America have been omitted pursuant to such rules and regulations, although we believe that the disclosures are adequate to make the information presented not misleading. Going Concern The Company s financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis, which implies that the Company will continue to realize its assets and discharge its liabilities in the normal course of business. The Company has generated no revenues to date, has a working capital deficit of (82,418) and an accumulated deficit of 137,395. The continuation of the Company as a going concern is dependent upon the continued financial support from its shareholders, the ability to raise equity or debt financing, and the attainment of profitable operations from the Company's future business. These factors raise substantial doubt regarding the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. These financial statements do not include any adjustments to the recoverability and classification of recorded asset amounts and classification of liabilities that might be necessary should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern. Use of Estimates and Assumptions The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make certain estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods presented. We are required to make judgments and estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. Although we believe our judgments and estimates are appropriate, actual future results may be different; if different assumptions or conditions were to prevail, the results could be materially different from our reported results. Recent Accounting Pronouncements We review new accounting standards as issued. Although some of these accounting standards issued or effective after the end of our previous fiscal year may be applicable to us, we have not identified any standards that we believe merit further discussion. We believe that none of the new standards will have a significant impact on our financial position, future operations or cash flows. 17 Table of Contents Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosure about Market Risk None Item 4. Controls and Procedures Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures As of the end of the period covered by this report, we carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of our Principal Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures. Based on the evaluation, both the Principal Executive Officer and the Principal Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, were not effective as of March 31, 2023. Internal Control over Financial Reporting There was no change in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) promulgated under the Securities Act of 1934) that materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, such internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended March 31, 2023.
