Generally, the Company recognizes revenue at the time it performs a service. In the event that the Company bills for services in advance of performance, it recognizes deferred revenue for the amount billed and subsequently recognizes revenue at the time the service is provided. Substantially all of the deferred revenue recorded as of June 30, 2024 was recognized as revenue during the three months ended September 30, 2024 when the service was performed. See Note 11 for additional information regarding revenue by reportable segment.

 Current period provision for expected credit losses Write-offs charged against the allowance ) ) Recoveries collected Impact of changes in foreign currency ) Ending balance owned landfills, landfills operated under life-of-site operating agreements and landfills operated under limited-term operating agreements. The Company s landfills had site costs with a net book value of at September 30, 2024. For the Company s landfills operated under limited-term operating agreements and life-of-site operating agreements, the owner of the property (generally a municipality) usually owns the permit and the Company operates the landfill for a contracted term. Where the contracted term is not the life of the landfill, the property owner is generally responsible for final capping, closure and post-closure obligations. The Company is responsible for all final capping, closure and post-closure liabilities at the landfills it operates under life-of-site operating agreements. The Company s internal and third-party engineers perform surveys at least annually to estimate the remaining disposal capacity at its landfills. Many of the Company s existing landfills have the potential for expanded disposal capacity beyond the amount currently permitted. The Company s landfill depletion rates are based on the remaining disposal capacity, considering both permitted and probable expansion airspace, at the landfills it owns and landfills it operates, but does not own, under life-of-site agreements. The Company s landfill depletion rate is based on the term of the operating agreement at its operated landfill that has capitalized expenditures. Expansion airspace consists of additional disposal capacity being pursued through means of an expansion that has not yet been permitted. Expansion airspace that meets certain criteria is included in the estimate of total landfill airspace.

 . As of September 30, 2024, the Company is seeking to expand permitted capacity at of its owned landfills and landfills that it operates under life-of-site operating agreements, and considers the achievement of these expansions to be probable. Although the Company cannot be certain that all future expansions will be permitted as designed, the average remaining life, when considering remaining permitted capacity, probable expansion capacity and projected annual disposal volume, of the Company s owned landfills and landfills operated under life-of-site operating agreements is approximately . The estimated remaining lives of the Company s owned landfills and landfills operated under life-of-site operating agreements range from two to , with approximately of the projected annual disposal volume from landfills with remaining lives of less than . During the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the Company expensed and , respectively, or an average of and per ton consumed, respectively, related to landfill depletion at owned landfills and landfills operated under life-of-site agreements. The Company reserves for estimated final capping, closure and post-closure maintenance obligations at the landfills it owns and landfills it operates under life-of-site operating agreements. The Company calculates the net present value of its final capping, closure and post-closure liabilities by estimating the total obligation in current dollars, inflating the obligation based upon the expected date of the expenditure and discounting the inflated total to its present value using a credit-adjusted risk-free rate. Any changes in expectations that result in an upward revision to the estimated undiscounted cash flows are treated as a new liability and are inflated and discounted at rates reflecting market conditions. Any changes in expectations that result in a downward revision (or no revision) to the estimated undiscounted cash flows result in a liability that is inflated and discounted at rates reflecting the market conditions at the time the cash flows were originally estimated. This policy results in the Company s final capping, closure and post-closure liabilities being recorded in layers. The Company s discount rate assumption for purposes of computing layers for final capping, closure and post-closure liabilities is based on its long-term credit adjusted risk-free rate. The Company s discount rate assumption for purposes of computing 2024 and 2023 layers for final capping, closure and post-closure obligations was for both periods. The Company s long-term inflation rate assumption is for each of the years ending December 31, 2024 and 2023. The resulting final capping, closure and post-closure obligations are recorded on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets along with an offsetting addition to site costs which is amortized to depletion expense as the remaining landfill airspace is consumed. Interest is accreted on the recorded liability using the corresponding discount rate. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the Company expensed and , respectively, or an average of and per ton consumed, respectively, related to final capping, closure and post-closure accretion expense. In the event that changes in an estimate for a closure and post-closure liability are associated with a significant change in facts and circumstances at a landfill or a non-operating section of a landfill, corresponding adjustments to recorded liabilities and Impairments and other operating items are made as soon as is practical. Liability adjustments Accretion expense associated with landfill obligations Closure payments ) Assumption of closure liabilities from acquisitions Foreign currency translation adjustment ) Final capping, closure and post-closure liability at September 30, 2024

The final capping, closure and post-closure liability is included in Other long-term liabilities in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. The Company performs its annual review of its cost and capacity estimates in the first quarter of each year. In the event that changes in an estimate for a closure and post-closure liability are associated with a significant change in facts and circumstances at a landfill or a non-operating section of a landfill, corresponding adjustments to recorded liabilities and Impairments and other operating items are made as soon as is practical.

Los Angeles County, California Landfill Expansion Litigation A. Chiquita Canyon, LLC Lawsuit Against Los Angeles County 
 In October 2004, the Company s subsidiary, Chiquita Canyon, LLC CCL ), then under prior ownership, filed an application (the Application with the County of Los Angeles (the County Department of Regional Planning DRP for a conditional use permit (the CUP to authorize the continued operation and expansion of the Chiquita Canyon Landfill (the CC Landfill ). The CC Landfill has operated since 1972, and as a regional landfill, accepted approximately million tons of materials for disposal and beneficial use in 2023. The CC Landfill is the second largest landfill in the County and plays a vital role in the County s ability to safely and quickly gather, process, and dispose of thousands of tons of waste, six days a week. A significant disruption in that function would be harmful to the County and the Company. The Application requested expansion of the existing waste footprint on CCL s contiguous property, an increase in maximum elevation, creation of a new entrance and new support facilities, construction of a facility for the County or another third-party operator to host household hazardous waste collection events, designation of an area for mixed organics/composting, and other modifications. After many years of reviews and delays, upon the recommendation of County staff, the County s Regional Planning Commission (the Commission approved the Application on April 19, 2017, but imposed operating conditions, fees and exactions that substantially reduced the historical landfill operations and represented a large increase in aggregate taxes and fees. CCL objected to many of the requirements imposed by the Commission. Current estimates for new costs imposed on CCL under the CUP are in excess of . CCL appealed the Commission s decision to the County Board of Supervisors, but the appeal was not successful. At a subsequent hearing, on July 25, 2017, the Board of Supervisors approved the CUP. On October 20, 2017, CCL filed in the Superior Court of California, County of Los Angeles a verified petition for writ of mandate and complaint against the County and the County Board of Supervisors captioned Chiquita Canyon, LLC v. County of Los Angeles (the Complaint ). The Complaint challenges the terms of the CUP in 13 counts generally alleging that the County violated multiple California and federal statutes and California and federal constitutional protections. CCL seeks the following relief: (a) an injunction and writ of mandate against certain of the CUP s operational restrictions, taxes and fees, (b) a declaration that the challenged conditions are unconstitutional and in violation of state and federal statutes, (c) reimbursement for any such illegal fees paid under protest, (d) damages, (e) an award of just compensation for a taking, (f) attorney fees, and (g) all other appropriate legal and equitable relief.

 Bridge Thoroughfare Fee B T Fee that was purportedly due on July 25, 2017. The alleged B T fee was ostensibly to fund the construction of transportation infrastructure in the area of the CC Landfill. At the time the NOV was issued, CCL had already contested the legality of the B T fee in the October 20, 2017 Complaint filed against the County in Los Angeles County Superior Court, described above under paragraph A (the CUP lawsuit ). On January 12, 2018, CCL filed an appeal of the alleged violations in the NOV. Subsequently, CCL filed additional legal arguments and exhibits contesting the NOV. On March 6, 2018, a DRP employee designated as hearing officer sustained the NOV, including the B T fee, and imposed an administrative penalty in the amount of and a noncompliance fee of . A written decision memorializing the hearing officer s findings and order was issued on July 10, 2018. On April 13, 2018, CCL filed in the Superior Court of California, County of Los Angeles, a Petition for Writ of Administrative Mandamus against the County seeking to overturn the decision sustaining the NOV, contending that the NOV and decision are not supported by the facts or law. On July 17, 2018, the court granted CCL leave to pay the B T fee and to amend its Complaint in the CUP lawsuit to reflect the payment under protest, allowing the challenge to the B T fee under the Mitigation Fee Act to proceed in the CUP lawsuit. CCL paid the B T fee under protest on August 10, 2018, and also paid on that date the administrative penalty of and the noncompliance fee of . The court indicated that the NOV case would be coordinated with the CUP lawsuit. On October 11, 2022, CCL and the County entered into the settlement agreement, described above under paragraph A. If the CUP modification application is approved by the County and certain other contingencies are satisfied, CCL will dismiss this lawsuit. However, as described above, the Company is not able to determine the likelihood of any outcome in this matter. Elevated Temperature Landfill Event Beginning in May 2023, the Company s subsidiary, Chiquita Canyon, LLC CCL ), began receiving notices of violation NOVs from the South Coast Air Quality Management District SCAQMD for alleged violations of Section 41700 of the California Health Safety Code and SCAQMD Rule 402 based on complaints from the public of odors,

 Environmental, organizational and financial sustainability initiatives have been key components of our success since we were founded in 1997. We continue to grow and expand these efforts and our disclosure regarding progress towards their achievement as our industry and technology continue to evolve. To that end, we have committed 500 million to the advancement of long-term, aspirational ESG targets, which have been incorporated into executive compensation metrics. Our investments primarily focus on reducing emissions and emissions intensity, increasing resource recovery of both recyclable commodities and clean energy fuels, reducing reliance on off-site disposal for landfill leachate, further improving safety through reduced incidents and enhancing employee engagement through improved voluntary turnover and Servant Leadership scores. Our latest sustainability report can be found at www.wasteconnections.com/sustainability but does not constitute a part of, and is not incorporated by reference into, this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. We generally seek to avoid highly competitive, large urban markets and instead target markets where we can attain high market share either through exclusive contracts, vertical integration or asset positioning. In markets where waste collection services are provided under exclusive arrangements, or where waste disposal is municipally owned or funded or available at multiple municipal sources, we believe that controlling the waste stream by providing collection services under exclusive arrangements is often more important to our growth and profitability than owning or operating landfills. We also target niche markets, like non-hazardous E P waste treatment, recovery and disposal services. The solid waste industry is local and highly competitive in nature, requiring substantial labor and capital resources. We compete for collection accounts primarily on the basis of price and, to a lesser extent, the quality of service, and compete for landfill business on the basis of tipping fees, geographic location and quality of operations. The solid waste industry has been consolidating and continues to consolidate as a result of a number of factors, including the increasing costs and complexity associated with waste management operations and regulatory compliance. Many small independent operators and municipalities lack the capital resources, management, operating skills and technical expertise necessary to operate effectively in such an environment. The consolidation trend has caused solid waste companies to operate larger landfills that have complementary collection routes that can use company-owned disposal capacity. Controlling the point of transfer from haulers to landfills has become increasingly important as landfills continue to close and disposal capacity moves farther from the collection markets it serves. Generally, the most profitable operators within the solid waste industry are those companies that are vertically integrated or enter into long-term collection contracts. A vertically integrated operator will benefit from: (1) the internalization of waste, which is bringing waste to a company-owned landfill; (2) the ability to charge third-party haulers tipping fees either at landfills or at transfer stations; and (3) the efficiencies gained by being able to aggregate and process waste at a transfer station prior to landfilling.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP, requires estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, revenues and expenses and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities in the condensed consolidated financial statements. As described by the SEC, critical accounting estimates and assumptions are those that may be material due to the levels of subjectivity and judgment necessary to account for highly uncertain matters or the susceptibility of such matters to change, and that have a material impact on the financial condition or operating performance of a company. Such critical accounting estimates and assumptions are applicable to our reportable segments. Refer to our most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K for a complete description of our critical accounting estimates and assumptions. NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS For a description of the new accounting standards that affect us, see Note 3 to our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.

 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we managed our operations through the following six geographic solid waste operating segments: Western, Southern, Eastern, Central, Canada and MidSouth. Our six geographic solid waste operating segments comprise our reportable segments. Each operating segment is responsible for managing several vertically integrated operations, which are comprised of districts. Certain corporate or regional overhead expense allocations may affect comparability of the segment information presented herein on a period-over-period basis. Our Chief Operating Decision Maker evaluates operating segment profitability and determines resource allocations based on several factors, of which the primary financial measure is segment EBITDA. We define segment EBITDA as earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization, impairments and other operating items and other income (expense). Segment EBITDA is not a measure of operating income, operating performance or liquidity under GAAP and may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies. Our management uses segment EBITDA in the evaluation of segment operating performance as it is a profit measure that is generally within the control of the operating segments. Summarized financial information for our reportable segments are shown in the following tables in thousands of U.S. dollars and as a percentage of total segment revenue for the periods indicated.

The increase for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was attributable to capital expenditures providing tax benefits resulting from accelerated depreciation and tax benefits resulting from payments for closure and post-closure activities in the period. The increase in deferred taxes for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 was primarily due to accelerated tax depreciation from capital expenditures. 4) Closure and post-closure expenditures Our increase in net cash provided by operating activities was unfavorably impacted by 130.3 million from an increase in payments for closure and post-closure activities as changes in expenditures for these items resulted in a decrease to operating cash flows of 145.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to a decrease in operating cash flows of 14.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 5) Prepaid expenses Our increase in net cash provided by operating activities was unfavorably impacted by 59.8 million from prepaid expenses as changes in prepaid expenses resulted in a decrease to operating cash flows of

 34.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to an increase to operating cash flows of 24.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was due primarily to an increase in prepaids related to higher insurance payments. The increase for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 was due primarily to decreased prepaid income tax payments. 6) Accounts receivable Our increase in net cash provided by operating activities was unfavorably impacted by 25.9 million from accounts receivable as changes in accounts receivable resulted in a decrease to operating cash flows of 57.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to a decrease to operating cash flows of 31.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was due to increases in revenue, which remained as outstanding receivables at September 30, 2024, partially offset by one additional collection day in the period. The decrease for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 was due to increases in revenue, which remained as outstanding receivables at the end of the period. 
 At September 30, 2024, we had a working capital deficit of 398.9 million, including cash and equivalents of 115.3 million. Our working capital deficit decreased 147.2 million from a working capital deficit of 546.1 million at December 31, 2023 including cash and equivalents of 78.4 million, due primarily to an increase in accounts receivables as a result of increases in revenue, an increase in cash and cash equivalents, a decrease in outstanding liabilities for contingent consideration and an increase in prepaid expenditures, partially offset by increases in accounts payable and accrued liabilities driven by an increase in accrued insurance costs and an increase in outstanding obligations to vendors and an increase in deferred revenue. To date, we have experienced no loss or lack of access to our cash and equivalents; however, we can provide no assurances that access to our cash and equivalents will not be impacted by adverse conditions in the financial markets. Our strategy in managing our working capital is generally to apply the cash generated from our operations that remains after satisfying our working capital and capital expenditure requirements, along with share repurchase and dividend programs, to reduce the unhedged portion of our indebtedness under our Revolving Credit Agreement and to minimize our cash balances. Investing Activities Cash Flows Net cash used in investing activities increased 1.460 billion to 2.646 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, from 1.186 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The significant components of the increase included the following: 1) An increase in cash paid for acquisitions of 1.437 billion; and 2) An increase in capital expenditures at operations acquired during the comparative periods of 35.4 million due to expenditures for landfill site costs, trucks and equipment; and 3) An increase in capital expenditures at operations owned in the comparable periods of 8.3 million due to increased truck purchases and facility expenditures, partially offset by decreases in landfill site costs and container purchases; less 4) An increase in cash received of 37.0 million from proceeds from the sale of investment in noncontrolling interests in the period. 
 Financing Activities Cash Flows Net cash provided by financing activities increased 1.407 billion to 1.040 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, from net cash used in financing activities of 366.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The significant components of the increase included the following: 1) An increase from the net change in long-term borrowings of 1.474 billion in which long-term borrowings increased 1.335 billion during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and decreased 138.8 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2023; less 2) A decrease from higher cash dividends paid of 24.4 million due primarily to an increase in our quarterly dividend rate for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 to 0.285 per share, from 0.255 per share for the nine months ended September 30, 2023; and

 3) A decrease from higher payments of contingent consideration of 22.4 million not included in earnings that occurred during the nine months ended September 30, 2024; and 4) A decrease from higher payments related to the issuance of debt of 13.4 million that occurred during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 
 On July 23, 2024, our Board of Directors approved, subject to receipt of regulatory approvals, the annual renewal of our normal course issuer bid, or the NCIB, to purchase up to 12,901,981 of our common shares during the period of August 12, 2024 to August 11, 2025 or until such earlier time as the NCIB is completed or terminated at our option. Shareholders may obtain a copy of our TSX Form 12 Notice of Intention to Make a Normal Course Issuer Bid, without charge, by request directed to our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer at (832) 442-2200. The timing and amounts of any repurchases pursuant to the NCIB will depend on many factors, including our capital structure, the market price of our common shares, any share buyback taxes applicable and overall market conditions. All common shares purchased under the NCIB will be immediately cancelled following their repurchase. Information regarding our NCIB plan can be found under the section Normal Course Issuer Bid in Note 17 to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and is incorporated herein by reference. Our Board of Directors authorized the initiation of a quarterly cash dividend in October 2010 and has increased it on an annual basis. In October 2024, we announced that our Board of Directors increased our regular quarterly cash dividend by 0.03, from 0.285 to 0.315 per share. Cash dividends of 221.3 million and 196.8 million were paid during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. We cannot assure as to the amounts or timing of future dividends. Our business is capital intensive. Our capital requirements include acquisitions and capital expenditures, including for landfill cell construction, landfill development, landfill closure activities and intermodal facility construction in the future. We made 659.3 million in capital expenditures for property and equipment during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, and we expect to make total capital expenditures for property and equipment of approximately 1.150 billion in 2024. We have funded and intend to fund the balance of our planned 2024 capital expenditures principally through cash on hand, internally generated funds and borrowings under our Revolving Credit Agreement. In addition, we may make substantial additional capital expenditures in acquiring land and solid waste businesses. If we acquire additional landfill disposal facilities, we may also have to make significant expenditures to bring them into compliance with applicable regulatory requirements, obtain permits or expand our available disposal capacity. We cannot currently determine the amount of these expenditures because they will depend on the number, nature, condition and permitted status of any acquired landfill disposal facilities. We believe that our cash and equivalents, Revolving Credit Agreement and the funds we expect to generate from operations will provide adequate cash to fund our working capital and other cash needs for the foreseeable future. However, disruptions in the capital and credit markets could adversely affect our ability to draw on our Revolving Credit Agreement or raise other capital. Our access to funds under the Revolving Credit Agreement is dependent on the ability of the banks that are parties to the agreement to meet their funding commitments. Those banks may not be able to meet their funding commitments if they experience shortages of capital and liquidity or if they experience excessive volumes of borrowing requests within a short period of time. On February 21, 2024, we completed an underwritten public offering of 750.0 million aggregate principal amount of our 5.00 Senior Notes due 2034 (the 2034 Senior Notes ). The 2034 Senior Notes were issued under the Indenture, dated as of November 16, 2018, by and between the Company and U.S. Bank Trust Company, National Association, as successor in interest to U.S. Bank National Association, as trustee, as supplemented by the Eighth Supplemental Indenture, dated as of February 21, 2024. See Note 10 to our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for further details on the 2034 Senior Notes.

The Company intends to use substantially all of the proceeds of the borrowings under the Revolving Credit Agreement (i) to repay certain outstanding indebtedness under other credit facilities, (ii) to finance acquisitions, dividends or other equity distributions, in each case as permitted thereunder, (iii) for capital expenditures, working capital and payment of certain transaction fees, costs and expenses and (iv) other lawful corporate purposes. See Note 10 to our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for further details on the new Revolving Credit Agreement. On June 13, 2024, we completed an underwritten public offering of CAD 500.0 million aggregate principal amount of our 4.50 Senior Notes due 2029 (the New 2029 Senior Notes ). The New 2029 Senior Notes were issued under the Indenture, dated as of November 16, 2018, by and between the Company and U.S. Bank Trust Company, National Association, as successor in interest to U.S. Bank National Association, as trustee, as supplemented by the Ninth Supplemental Indenture, dated as of June 13, 2024. See Note 10 to our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for further details on the New 2029 Senior Notes. At September 30, 2024, 2.234 billion under the revolving credit facility was outstanding under the Revolving Credit Agreement, exclusive of outstanding standby letters of credit of 57.7 million. We also had 114.4 million of letters of credit issued and outstanding at September 30, 2024 under a facility other than the Revolving Credit Agreement. Our Revolving Credit Agreement matures on February 27, 2029. We are a well-known seasoned issuer planning to file a shelf registration statement on Form S-3 and register an unspecified amount of debt securities, including debentures, notes or other types of debt. In the future, we may issue debt securities under such shelf registration statement or in private placements from time to time on an opportunistic basis, based on market conditions and available pricing. Unless otherwise indicated in the relevant offering documents, we expect to use the proceeds from any such offerings for general corporate purposes, including repaying, redeeming or repurchasing debt, acquiring additional assets or businesses, capital expenditures and increasing our working capital.

We may elect to draw amounts on our Revolving Credit Agreement in U.S. dollar term SOFR rate loans, U.S. dollar base rate loans, Canadian dollar term CORRA rate loans, and Canadian dollar prime rate loans. At September 30, 2024, 1.430 billion of the outstanding borrowings drawn under the revolving credit facility were in U.S. term SOFR rate loans, which bear interest at the term SOFR rate plus the applicable margin (for a total rate ranging from 5.96 to 6.30 on such date). At September 30, 2024, 25.0 million of the outstanding borrowings drawn under the revolving credit facility were in U.S. base rate loans, which bear interest at the base rate plus the applicable margin (for a total rate of 8.00 on such date).

Our financing leases bear interest at rates between 1.89 and 5.07 at September 30, 2024, and have expiration dates ranging from 2026 to 2029. 
 The following assumptions were made in calculating cash interest payments: 1) We calculated cash interest payments on the Revolving Credit Agreement using the term SOFR rate plus the applicable term SOFR margin, the base rate plus the applicable base rate margin, the term CORRA rate plus the applicable margin and the Canadian prime rate plus the applicable prime rate margin at September 30, 2024. We assumed the Revolving Credit Agreement is paid off when it matures on February 27, 2029. 2) We calculated cash interest payments on our interest rate swaps using the stated interest rate in the swap agreement less the Term SOFR rate through the earlier expiration of the term of the swaps or the term of the credit facility. 
 Contingent consideration payments include 82.6 million recorded as liabilities in our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements at September 30, 2024, and 15.9 million of future interest accretion on the recorded obligations. We are party to operating lease agreements and finance leases. These lease agreements are established in the ordinary course of our business and are designed to provide us with access to facilities and equipment at competitive, market-driven prices. The estimated final capping, closure and post-closure expenditures presented above are in current dollars. 

Amount of Commitment Expiration Per Period (amounts in thousands of U.S. dollars) Less Than 1 to 3 3 to 5 Over 5 Unrecorded Obligations (1) Total 1 Year Years Years Years Unconditional purchase obligations 191,641 134,917 55,482 1,242 ____________________ (1) We are party to unconditional purchase obligations. These purchase obligations are established in the ordinary course of our business and are designed to provide us with access to products at competitive, market-driven prices. At September 30, 2024, our unconditional purchase obligations consisted of multiple fixed-price fuel purchase contracts under which we have 62.9 million gallons remaining to be purchased for a total of 191.6 million. The current fuel purchase contracts expire on or before September 30, 2029. These arrangements have not materially affected our financial position, results of operations or liquidity during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, nor are they expected to have a material impact on our future financial position, results of operations or liquidity. 
 We have obtained financial surety bonds, primarily to support our financial assurance needs and landfill and E P waste operations. We provided customers and various regulatory authorities with surety bonds in the aggregate amounts of approximately 1.966 billion and 1.645 billion at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. These arrangements have not materially affected our financial position, results of operations or liquidity during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, nor are they expected to have a material impact on our future financial position, results of operations or liquidity. From time to time, we evaluate our existing operations and their strategic importance to us. If we determine that a given operating unit does not have future strategic importance, we may sell or otherwise dispose of those operations. Although we believe our reporting units would not be impaired by such dispositions, we could incur losses on them.

 NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES Adjusted Free Cash Flow We present adjusted free cash flow, a non-GAAP financial measure, supplementally because it is widely used by investors as a liquidity measure in the solid waste industry. We calculate adjusted free cash flow as net cash provided by operating activities, plus or minus change in book overdraft, plus proceeds from disposal of assets, less capital expenditures for property and equipment. We further adjust this calculation to exclude the effects of items management believes impact the ability to evaluate the liquidity of our business operations. This measure is not a substitute for, and should be used in conjunction with, GAAP liquidity or financial measures. Other companies may calculate adjusted free cash flow differently. Our adjusted free cash flow for the nine month periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, are calculated as follows (amounts in thousands of U.S. dollars):

 Adjusted EBITDA We present adjusted EBITDA, a non-GAAP financial measure, supplementally because it is widely used by investors as a performance and valuation measure in the solid waste industry. Management uses adjusted EBITDA as one of the principal measures to evaluate and monitor the ongoing financial performance of our operations. We define adjusted EBITDA as net income attributable to Waste Connections, plus or minus net income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests, plus income tax provision, plus interest expense, less interest income, plus depreciation and amortization expense, plus closure and post-closure accretion expense, plus or minus any loss or gain on impairments and other operating items, plus other expense, less other income. We further adjust this calculation to exclude the effects of other items management believes impact the ability to assess the operating performance of our business. This measure is not a substitute for, and should be used in conjunction with, GAAP financial measures. Other companies may calculate adjusted EBITDA differently. Our adjusted EBITDA for the three and nine month periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, are calculated as follows (amounts in thousands of U.S. dollars):

 Adjusted Net Income Attributable to Waste Connections and Adjusted Net Income per Diluted Share Attributable to Waste Connections We present adjusted net income attributable to Waste Connections and adjusted net income per diluted share attributable to Waste Connections, both non-GAAP financial measures, supplementally because they are widely used by investors as valuation measures in the solid waste industry. Management uses adjusted net income attributable to Waste Connections and adjusted net income per diluted share attributable to Waste Connections as one of the principal measures to evaluate and monitor the ongoing financial performance of our operations. We provide adjusted net income attributable to Waste Connections to exclude the effects of items management believes impact the comparability of operating results between periods. Adjusted net income attributable to Waste Connections has limitations due to the fact that it excludes items that have an impact on our financial condition and results of operations. Adjusted net income attributable to Waste Connections and adjusted net income per diluted share attributable to Waste Connections are not a substitute for, and should be used in conjunction with, GAAP financial measures. Other companies may calculate these non-GAAP financial measures differently. Our adjusted net income attributable to Waste Connections and adjusted net income per diluted share attributable to Waste Connections for the three and nine month periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, are calculated as follows (amounts in thousands of U.S. dollars, except per share amounts):

(d) Reflects fair value accounting changes associated with certain equity awards. (e) Reflects the cash and non-cash components of severance expense associated with an executive departure. (f) The aggregate tax effect of the adjustments in footnotes (a) through (e) is calculated based on the applied tax rates for the respective periods. 
 INFLATION In the current environment, we have seen inflationary pressures resulting from higher fuel, materials and labor costs in certain markets and higher resulting third-party costs in areas such as brokerage, repairs and construction. Consistent with industry practice, many of our contracts allow us to pass through certain costs to our customers, including increases in landfill tipping fees and, in some cases, fuel costs. To the extent that there are decreases in fuel costs, in some cases, a portion of these reductions are passed through to customers in the form of lower fuel and material surcharges. Therefore, we believe that we should be able to increase prices to offset many cost increases that result from inflation in the ordinary course of business. However, competitive pressures or delays in the timing of rate increases under certain of our contracts may require us to absorb at least part of these cost increases, especially if cost increases exceed the average rate of inflation. Management s estimates associated with inflation have an impact on our accounting for landfill liabilities.

 SEASONALITY Based on historic trends, excluding any impact from an economic recession, we would expect our operating results to vary seasonally, with revenues typically lowest in the first quarter, higher in the second and third quarters and lower in the fourth quarter than in the second and third quarters. This seasonality reflects (a) the lower volume of solid waste generated during the late fall, winter and early spring because of decreased construction and demolition activities during winter months in Canada and the U.S. and (b) reduced E P activity during harsh weather conditions, with expected fluctuation due to such seasonality between our highest and lowest quarters of approximately 10 . In addition, some of our operating costs may be higher in the winter months. Adverse winter weather conditions slow waste collection activities, resulting in higher labor and operational costs. Greater precipitation in the winter increases the weight of collected municipal solid waste, resulting in higher disposal costs, which are calculated on a per ton basis. Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk In the normal course of business, we are exposed to market risk, including changes in interest rates, prices of certain commodities and foreign currency exchange rate risks. We use hedge agreements to manage a portion of our risks related to interest rates. While we are exposed to credit risk in the event of non-performance by counterparties to our hedge agreements, in all cases such counterparties are highly rated financial institutions and we do not anticipate non-performance under current market conditions. We do not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading purposes. We monitor our hedge positions by regularly evaluating the positions at market and by performing sensitivity analyses over the unhedged variable rate debt positions. At September 30, 2024, our derivative instruments included four interest rate swap agreements that effectively fix the interest rate on the applicable notional amounts of our variable rate debt as follows (dollars in thousands of U.S. dollars): 

Fixed Variable Notional Interest Interest Rate Expiration Date Entered Amount Rate Paid (a) Received Effective Date (b) Date August 2017 200,000 2.1230 1-month Term SOFR November 2022 October 2025 June 2018 200,000 2.8480 1-month Term SOFR November 2022 October 2025 June 2018 200,000 2.8284 1-month Term SOFR November 2022 October 2025 December 2018 200,000 2.7715 1-month Term SOFR November 2022 July 2027 ____________________ (a) Plus applicable margin. (b) In October 2022, we amended the reference rate in all of our outstanding interest rate swap contracts to replace One-Month LIBOR with One-Month Term SOFR and certain credit spread adjustments. We did not record any gains or losses upon the conversion of the reference rates in these interest rate swap contracts, and we believe these amendments will not have a material impact on our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. 
 Under derivatives and hedging guidance, the interest rate swap agreements are considered cash flow hedges for a portion of our variable rate debt, and we apply hedge accounting to account for these instruments. The notional amounts and all other significant terms of the swap agreements are matched to the provisions and terms of the variable rate debt being hedged. We have performed sensitivity analyses to determine how market rate changes will affect the fair value of our unhedged floating rate debt. Such an analysis is inherently limited in that it reflects a singular, hypothetical set of assumptions. Actual market movements may vary significantly from our assumptions. Fair value sensitivity is not necessarily indicative of the ultimate cash flow or earnings effect we would recognize from the assumed market rate movements. We are exposed to cash flow risk due to changes in interest rates with respect to the unhedged floating rate balances owed at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, of 1.434 billion and 1.099 billion, respectively, including floating rate debt under our Revolving Credit Agreement (or, as of December 31, 2023, the 2021 Revolving and Term Credit Agreement and the 2022 Term Loan Agreement). A one percentage point increase in interest rates on our variable-rate debt at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, would decrease our annual pre-tax income by approximately 14.3 million and 11.0 million, respectively. All of our remaining debt instruments are at fixed rates, or effectively fixed under the interest rate swap agreements described above; therefore, changes in market interest rates under these instruments would not significantly impact our cash flows or results of operations, subject to counterparty default risk.

 The market price of diesel fuel is unpredictable and can fluctuate significantly. Because of the volume of fuel we purchase each year, a significant increase in the price of fuel could adversely affect our business and reduce our operating margins. To manage a portion of this risk, we periodically enter into fuel hedge agreements related to forecasted diesel fuel purchases, and we also enter into fixed price fuel purchase contracts. At September 30, 2024, we had no fuel hedge agreements in place; however, we have entered into fixed price diesel fuel purchase contracts for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as described below. For the year ending December 31, 2024, we expect to purchase approximately 91.4 million gallons of diesel fuel, of which 52.1 million gallons will be purchased at market prices and 39.3 million gallons will be purchased under our fixed price diesel fuel purchase contracts. We have performed sensitivity analyses to determine how market rate changes will affect the fair value of our unhedged, market rate diesel fuel purchases. Such an analysis is inherently limited in that it reflects a singular, hypothetical set of assumptions. Actual market movements may vary significantly from our assumptions. Fair value sensitivity is not necessarily indicative of the ultimate cash flow or earnings effect we would recognize from the assumed market rate movements. During the three month period of October 1, 2024 to December 31, 2024, we expect to purchase approximately 13.0 million gallons of diesel fuel at market prices; therefore, a 0.10 per gallon increase in the price of diesel fuel over the remaining three months in 2024 would decrease our pre-tax income during this period by approximately 1.3 million. We market a variety of recyclable materials, including compost, cardboard, mixed paper, plastic containers, glass bottles and ferrous and aluminum metals. We own and operate recycling operations and market collected recyclable materials to third parties for processing before resale. Where possible, to reduce our exposure to commodity price risk with respect to recycled materials, we have adopted a pricing strategy of charging collection and processing fees for recycling volume collected from third parties. In the event of a decline in recycled commodity prices, a 10 decrease in average recycled commodity prices from the average prices that were in effect during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, would have had a 17.5 million and 10.3 million impact on revenues, respectively. We have operations in Canada and, where significant, we have quantified and described the impact of foreign currency translation on components of income, including operating revenue and operating costs. However, the impact of foreign currency has not materially affected our results of operations in 2024 or 2023. A 0.01 change in the Canadian dollar to U.S. dollar exchange rate would impact our annual revenue and EBITDA by approximately 18.0 million and 8.0 million, respectively.

 Item 4. Controls and Procedures As required by Rule 13a-15(b) under the U.S. Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the Exchange Act, we carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our President and Chief Executive Officer and our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as such term is defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Exchange Act) as of the end of the fiscal quarter covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. In designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, our management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives, and our management is required to apply its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures. Based on this evaluation, our President and Chief Executive Officer and our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer concluded as of September 30, 2024, that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective at the reasonable assurance level such that information required to be disclosed in our Exchange Act reports: (1) is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms; and (2) is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our President and Chief Executive Officer and Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. During the quarter ended September 30, 2024, there was no change in our internal control over financial reporting that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
