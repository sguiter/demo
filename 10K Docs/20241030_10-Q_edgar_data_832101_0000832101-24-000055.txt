During the three months ended September 30, 2024, the Company delivered solid operating performance, despite continued challenging market headwinds. Market softness, largely within the Health Science Technologies segment, resulted in lower sales volumes, which were partly offset by price/cost and productivity across all segments. On September 5, 2024, the Company completed the previously-announced acquisition of Mott Corporation and its subsidiaries Mott ), expanding the Company s applied material science technology capabilities in high-value end markets.

Results of Operations 
 The following is a discussion and analysis of the Company s results of operations for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared with the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 
 Three Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30, (Dollars in millions, except per share amounts) 2024 2023 / bps Change 2024 2023 / bps Change Net sales 798.2 793.4 1 2,405.9 2,485.0 (3 Cost of sales 444.3 443.8 1,327.8 1,374.9 (3 Gross profit 353.9 349.6 1 1,078.1 1,110.1 (3 Gross margin 44.3 44.1 20 bps 44.8 44.7 10 bps Selling, general and administrative expenses 182.9 165.9 10 560.8 529.9 6 Restructuring expenses and asset impairments 3.0 4.1 (27 5.4 8.2 (34 Operating income 168.0 179.6 (6 511.9 572.0 (11 Gain on sale of business (1)

 (1) Activity recorded during the three months ended September 30, 2024 represents the finalization of the gain on the sale of Alfa Valvole, Srl resulting in a 0.6 million downward adjustment during the third quarter of 2024. 
 
 Net Sales 
 
 Net sales for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 increased 1 and decreased 3 , respectively, as compared to the same prior year periods. Organic net sales for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 were flat and decreased 3 , respectively, which reflected lower volumes, largely as a result of continued unfavorable market conditions in the Health Science Technologies businesses. Price capture across all segments offset lower volumes during the three months ended September 30, 2024, but only partially offset lower volumes for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 
 
 In the three months ended September 30, 2024, net sales decreased 1 domestically and increased 2 internationally. In the nine months ended September 30, 2024, net sales decreased 3 domestically and 3 internationally. Sales to customers outside the U.S. were approximately 50 of total sales in each of the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. 
 
 Gross Profit and Gross Margin 
 
 Gross profit and gross margin for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 were positively impacted by strong price/cost and favorable operational productivity and were negatively impacted by higher employee-related costs, unfavorable mix and lower volume leverage. Gross profit and gross margin for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 were both favorably impacted by lower discretionary spending.

Table of Contents 

Selling, General and Administrative Expenses 
 
 Selling, general and administrative expenses for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 increased primarily due to the 5.6 million and 11.4 million impact from acquisitions, net of divestitures, including amortization, respectively, as well as higher employee-related costs and increased discretionary spending and transaction expenses as compared to the same prior year periods. 
 
 Restructuring Expenses and Asset Impairments 
 
 Restructuring expenses and asset impairments decreased in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 primarily due to lower severance costs compared with the same prior year periods. Severance costs during all periods were incurred in conjunction with cost mitigation efforts as a result of market conditions. 
 
 Gain on Sale of Business 
 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company completed the sale of Alfa Valvole, Srl Alfa Valvole for proceeds of 45.1 million, net of cash remitted, resulting in an initial gain on the sale of 4.6 million, net of a release of cumulative foreign currency translation losses of 5.5 million. During the three months ended September 30, 2024, the gain on the sale of Alfa Valvole was finalized, resulting in a downward adjustment to the gain on sale of 0.6 million for a final gain on sale of 4.0 million. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, the Company completed the sale of Micropump, Inc. Micropump for proceeds of 110.3 million, net of cash remitted, resulting in a pre-tax gain on the sale of 93.8 million. For additional information regarding the divestitures of Alfa Valvole and Micropump, refer to Note 2 , Acquisitions and Divestitures, in the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. 
 
 Other Expense (Income) Net 
 
 Other expense (income) net decreased in the three months ended September 30, 2024 primarily due to the unfavorable impact of foreign currency transactions as compared to the same prior year periods. Other expense (income) net for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 benefited from the absence of a 7.7 million credit loss reserve on a note receivable from a collaborative partner that did not reoccur during 2024. 
 
 Interest Expense Net 
 
 Interest expense net for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 decreased compared to the same periods in 2023 due to higher interest earned on cash balances in 2024, which increased approximately 3.2 million and 7.0 million, respectively. This benefit was offset by incremental interest expense during the three months ended September 30, 2024 due to a net increase in debt outstanding throughout the period, while the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was further favorably impacted by lower interest expense due to a net decrease in debt outstanding through the period, primarily on the Term Facility. 
 
 Income Taxes 
 
 The effective tax rate was 22.9 and 21.9 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, as compared to 20.2 and 21.4 during the same periods in 2023, respectively. One-time discrete tax benefits lowered the effective tax rates during nine months ended September 30, 2024 and both the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023. The three months ended September 30, 2024 did not benefit from these one-time items. For additional information, refer to Note 15 , Income Taxes, in the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. 
 
 In October 2021, members of the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development OECD and G20 Inclusive Framework on Base Erosion and Profit Shifting agreed to a two-pillar solution to address the tax challenges associated with the digitalization of the economy. In December 2021, the OECD released the Pillar Two Model Rules Pillar Two ), which define the global minimum tax and call for the taxation of large corporations at a minimum rate of 15 . Although it is uncertain when and how the rules will be fully enacted into law, based on the Company s initial assessment, nearly all of the jurisdictions in which the Company operates have an effective tax rate above the 15 threshold. Therefore, the Company does not expect a material impact from the Pillar Two income tax rules.

 Organic net sales were positively impacted by price capture during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024. Volumes were relatively flat during the three months ended September 20,2024 as improvement in the industrial market and strength in water were offset by both a down agriculture cycle and softness in the energy market. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, lower volumes, driven primarily by softness in agriculture, partially offset the benefit of price capture. 
 Excluding the accretive impact of divestitures, Adjusted EBITDA margin for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 decreased primarily due to higher employee-related costs, higher discretionary spending and unfavorable mix, partially offset by price/cost. The nine months ended September 30, 2024 were also negatively impacted by lower volumes, which were more than offset by favorable operational productivity.

 Adjusted EBITDA margin decreased slightly for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024. Positive price/cost offset higher employee related costs during both periods. Additionally, unfavorable mix negatively impacted the three months ended September 30, 2024. 

Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 
 Liquidity 
 
 Based on management s current expectations and currently available information, the Company believes current cash, cash from operations and cash available under the Revolving Facility will be sufficient to meet its cash requirements, including planned capital expenditures, interest and principal payments on all borrowings, pension and postretirement funding requirements, share repurchases and quarterly dividend payments to holders of the Company s common stock for the foreseeable future. Additionally, in the event that suitable businesses are available for acquisition upon acceptable terms, the Company may obtain all or a portion of the financing for these acquisitions through the incurrence of additional borrowings. The Company believes that additional borrowings through various financing alternatives remain available, if required. 
 
 Mott was acquired during the third quarter of 2024 for cash consideration of 986.2 million, net of cash acquired of 3.1 million. The acquisition was funded using a combination of cash on hand of 211.9 million, borrowings under the Company s Revolving Facility of 279.3 million, and the net proceeds from the issuance of the 4.950 Senior Notes of 495.0 million. For additional information regarding the borrowings under the Company s Revolving Facility and the 4.950 Senior Notes, refer to Note 8 , Borrowings, in the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements.

Operating Working Capital 
 
 Operating working capital, calculated as Receivables net plus Inventories net minus Trade accounts payable, is used by management as a measurement of operational results as well as the short-term liquidity of the Company. The following table details Operating working capital as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023: 
 
 (In millions) September 30, 2024 December 31, 2023 Change Organic Change Receivables net 475.1 427.8 47.3 14.7 Inventories net 488.2 420.8 67.4 21.4 Less: Trade accounts payable 210.4 179.7 30.7 16.1 Operating working capital 752.9 668.9 84.0 20.0

Table of Contents 

Operating working capital increased 84.0 million to 752.9 million at September 30, 2024. Acquisitions, divestitures and foreign currency translation increased Operating working capital by 64.0 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. Apart from these items, receivables increased due to strong price capture, which more than offset the impact of lower volumes; inventories increased to support planned production; and accounts payable increased as a result of higher inventory purchases and timing of payments. 
 
 Cash Flow Summary 
 
 The following table is derived from the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows: 
 
 Nine Months Ended September 30, (In millions) 2024 2023 Change Net cash flows provided by (used in): Operating activities 495.5 515.7 (20.2) Investing activities (991.8) (90.0) (901.8) Financing activities 606.7 (286.7) 893.4 
 
 Operating Activities 
 
 Cash flows provided by operating activities decreased 20.2 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the same prior year period primarily due to lower earnings in 2024 compared to the prior year and higher investments in operating working capital driven by higher inventory purchases to support planned production and increased receivables due to strong price capture, partially offset by lower cash payments including payments for taxes and variable compensation in 2024 compared to the prior year. 
 
 Investing Activities 
 
 Cash flows used in investing activities increased 901.8 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the prior year period. The net impact of acquisitions and divestitures increased cash used in investing activities 939.4 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the same prior year period, primarily related to the acquisition of Mott during the third quarter of 2024. This increase in cash outflows was partially offset by the absence of purchases of marketable securities from the prior year period and lower capital expenditures, which decreased cash used in investing activities by 24.6 million and 18.7 million, respectively, as compared to the prior year period. For additional information on the Company s acquisition and divestitures, refer to Note 2 , Acquisitions and Divestitures, in the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. 
 
 Financing Activities 
 
 Cash flows from financing activities increased 893.4 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the prior year period, primarily due to 774.8 million of net proceeds in connection with the financing of the acquisition of Mott. Additionally, repayments of the Term Facility were 125.0 million lower during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 than in the prior year period. These increases in cash flows were partly offset by slightly higher dividends paid to shareholders, which increased 10.7 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the prior year period. 
 
 Free Cash Flow 
 
 The Company believes free cash flow, a non-GAAP measure, is an important measure of performance because it provides a measurement of cash generated from operations that is available for payment obligations such as operating cash requirements, planned capital expenditures, interest and principal payments on all borrowings, pension and postretirement funding requirements and quarterly dividend payments to holders of the Company s common stock as well as for funding acquisitions and share repurchases. Free cash flow is calculated as cash flows provided by operating activities less capital expenditures.

Table of Contents 

The following table reconciles cash flows provided by operating activities to free cash flow: 
 
 Nine Months Ended September 30, (Dollars in millions) 2024 2023 Cash flows provided by operating activities 495.5 515.7 Less: capital expenditures 49.6 68.3 Free cash flow 445.9 447.4 

Cash Requirements 
 
 Subsequent Borrowings Activity 
 
 During October 2024 , the Company repaid 69.1 million of the 360.6 million outstanding under the Revolving Facility as well as the remaining 25.0 million balance outstanding under the Term Facility at September 30, 2024. 
 
 Capital Expenditures 
 
 Capital expenditures generally include machinery and equipment that support growth and improved productivity, tooling, business system technology, replacement of equipment and investments in new facilities. The Company believes it has s ufficient operating cash flows to continue to meet current obligations and invest in planned capital expenditures. Cash flows from operations were more than adequate to fund capital expenditures of 49.6 million and 68.3 million in the first nine months of 2024 and 2023, respectively. 
 
 Share Repurchases 
 
 There were no share repurchases during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. During the nine months ended September 30, 2023, the Company repurchased 5,400 shares at a cost of 1.1 million. As of September 30, 2024, the amount of share repurchase authorization remaining was 539.7 million. For additional information regarding the Company s share repurchase program, refer to Note 11 , Share Repurchases, in the Notes to Condensed Con solidated Financial Statements. 
 
 Dividends 
 
 Total dividend payments to common shareholders were 153.0 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared with 142.3 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 
 Covenants 
 
 The key financial covenants that the Company is required to maintain in connection with the Revolving Facility, the Term Facility, the 3.37 Senior Notes and the 5.13 Senior Notes, are a minimum interest coverage ratio of 3.0 to 1 and a maximum leverage ratio of 3.50 to 1. At September 30, 2024, the Company was in compliance with these financial covenants, as the Company s interest coverage ratio was 18.19 to 1 for covenant calculation purposes and the leverage ratio was 2.39 to 1. There are no financial covenants relating to the 2.625 Senior Notes, the 3.00 Senior Notes and the 4.950 Senior Notes; however, all are subject to cross-acceleration provisions.

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 
 
 The Company had 47.0 million of letters of credit as of September 30, 2024, primarily issued as security for insurance and other performance obligations. Of the 47.0 million of letters of credit, only 2.7 million reduced the Company s borrowing capacity under the Revolving Facility as of September 30, 2024. The Company has restricted cash of 18.1 million as of September 30, 2024, which represents cash held as collateral for standby letters of credit issued by Mott and is required to keep the balance in a separate account for the duration of the letters of credit. 
 
 Except as disclosed above, the Company has no off-balance sheet arrangements that currently have or are reasonably likely to have a material effect on the Company s consolidated financial condition, changes in financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources.

Non-GAAP Disclosures 
 
 Set forth below are reconciliations of Organic net sales, Adjusted gross profit, Adjusted gross margin, Adjusted net income attributable to IDEX, Adjusted diluted earnings per share EPS attributable to IDEX, Consolidated Adjusted earnings before interest, income taxes, depreciation and amortization Adjusted EBITDA and Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA margin to their respective most directly comparable U.S. GAAP measure. Management uses these metrics to measure performance of the Company since they exclude items that are not reflective of ongoing operations, as identified in the reconciliations below. Management also supplements its U.S. GAAP financial statements with adjusted information to provide investors with greater insight, transparency and a more comprehensive understanding of the information used by management in its financial and operational decision making. 
 
 Management uses Adjusted EBITDA as its principal measure of segment performance, and believes it is a useful indicator of the strength and performance of the Company and its segments ongoing business operations, as well as a way for investors to evaluate and compare operating performance and value companies within the Company s industry. Management believes that Adjusted EBITDA margin is useful for the same reason as Adjusted EBITDA. The definition of Adjusted EBITDA used here may differ from that used by other companies. 
 
 This report also references free cash flow. This non-GAAP measure is discussed and reconciled to its most directly comparable GAAP measure in the section above titled Free Cash Flow. 
 
 The non-GAAP financial measures disclosed by the Company should not be considered a substitute for, or superior to, financial measures prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Due to rounding, numbers presented throughout this and other documents may not recalculate precisely. The financial results prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP and the reconciliations from these results should be carefully evaluated.

PART II. OTHER INFORMATION 

Item 1. Legal Proceedings 
 
 The Company and its subsidiaries are party to legal proceedings arising in the ordinary course of business as described in Note 14 in Part I, Item 1, Commitments and Contingencies, in the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements and such disclosure is incorporated by reference into this Item 1. Legal Proceedings. 
 
 The Company s threshold for disclosing material environmental legal proceedings involving a government authority where potential monetary sanctions are involved is 1.0 million. 
 
 In addition, the Company and six of its subsidiaries are presently named as defendants in a number of lawsuits claiming various asbestos-related personal injuries, allegedly as a result of exposure to products manufactured with components that contained asbestos. These components were acquired from third party suppliers and were not manufactured by the Company or any of the defendant subsidiaries. To date, the majority of the Company s settlements and legal costs, except for costs of coordination, administration, insurance investigation and a portion of defense costs, have been covered in full by insurance, subject to applicable deductibles. However, the Company cannot predict whether and to what extent insurance will be available to continue to cover these settlements and legal costs, or how insurers may respond to claims that are tendered to them. Asbestos-related claims have been filed in jurisdictions throughout the United States and the United Kingdom. Most of the claims resolved to date have been dismissed without payment. The balance of the claims have been settled for various immaterial amounts. Only one case has been tried, resulting in a verdict for the Company s business unit. No provision has been made in the financial statements of the Company, other than for insurance deductibles in the ordinary course, and the Company does not currently believe the asbestos-related claims will have a material adverse effect on the Company s business, financial position, results of operations or cash flows.
