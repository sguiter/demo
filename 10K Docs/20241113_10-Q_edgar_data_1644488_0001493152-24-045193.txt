million and 
million, respectively. In addition, as of September 30, 2024, the Company had accumulated deficit of million and working
capital deficiency of million. These factors among other raise substantial doubt about the ability of the Company to continue
as a going concern for a reasonable period of time. 

In
order to continue as a going concern, the Company will need, among other things, additional capital resources. Management s plan
is to obtain such resources for the Company by obtaining capital from significant shareholders sufficient to meet its minimal operating
expenses and seeking third party equity and/or debt financing. However, management cannot provide any assurances that the Company will
be successful in accomplishing any of its plans. These financial statements do not include any adjustments related to the recoverability
and classification of assets or the amounts and classification of liabilities that might be necessary should the Company be unable to
continue as a going concern. 

, respectively. In addition, as of September 30, 2024, and March 31, 2024, cash and cash equivalents held in
bank accounts in foreign countries in the ordinary course of business were approximately million and million, respectively.
Amounts held by our merchant processor or held in bank accounts located in foreign countries are generally not insured by any federal
agency.

Cost
of goods sold includes actual product costs, vendor rebates and allowances, if any, inventory shrinkage and certain shipping and handling
costs, such as in-bound freight, associated with product sold. All other shipping and handling costs, including the cost to ship products
to customers, are included in selling and marketing expenses in our consolidated statements of operations when incurred. 

million. Since the likelihood of receiving the ERTC credit is probable and the amount is estimable, the Company has recorded its ERTC
claim in Other Receivable. Despite the extended time delay in the processing of the ERTC claims by the IRS, the Company believes that
its eligibility is reasonably assured and has not recorded any provision against the receivable. 

Through
the introduction of Paychex, the Company applied for an ERTC term loan Term Loan in August 2023 which objective is
to serve as a bridge funding until the ERTC is collected. The Term Loan that was approved came to 
million, and it was secured by the Company s assets and all ERTC proceeds that the Company is entitled to receive from the
IRS. Pursuant to the loan agreement with this lender Lender ), the first 
months of the Term Loan is deemed the interest-only period. During such period, the Term Loan carried a 
monthly interest, and the Company would make a monthly interest-only payment of 
to the Lender. In September 2023, the Company received net proceeds of approximately 
million which must be used solely and exclusively for working capital and other business purposes. In September 2024, on the
12 th month anniversary of the Term Loan, the Term Loan was automatically extended to 36 months from the loan funding
date. As a result, from September 2024 to August 2026 (the loan amortization period ), the Company is required to pay
 
monthly over the 24-month period to pay down the principal and related interest which is calculated at 
per month. The Term Loan was recorded as Other Borrowings. 

In
September 2024, the Company and the Lender entered into an agreement (the Agreement whereby the
Lender agreed to lend to the Company in exchange for a repayment of interest and principal that could be as much as using the Company s assets as collateral 
(the borrowing . The Company
has the option to paydown the borrowing early and recorded the payment obligation as Other Borrowings. In accordance with
the Agreement, and the Company would make 65 weekly payments of each
over a 15-month period to the Lender should the Company choose to repay the borrowing over the 15-month period. In September 2024, the Company received net proceeds of 
less transaction fees of ). During the month of September 2024, the Company made 2 weekly payments to the Lender totaled 
of which were
recorded as a reduction of Other Borrowings and the balance as interest expenses.

Overview 

Summary
Description of Business 

Sharing
Services Global Corporation and subsidiaries Sharing Services , we, or the Company aim to
build shareholder value by developing or acquiring businesses and technologies that increase the Company s product and services
portfolio, business competencies, and geographic reach.

the Company, through its subsidiaries, markets and distributes its health and wellness and other products primarily in the U.S. and Canada
using a direct selling business model. In addition, the Company s U.S. subsidiaries market our products and services through an
independent sales force, using their proprietary websites, including: www.thehappyco.com .

time to time of businesses and technologies that augment its product portfolio, complement its business competencies, and fit its growth
strategy. 

Financing
Arrangements

the Company has funded a substantial portion of its liquidity and cash needs through the issuance of notes or convertible notes and borrowings
under short-term financing arrangements, and issuance of equity securities. See Liquidity and Capital Resources below for
additional information about the Company s convertible notes and borrowings under short-term financing arrangements.

Results
of Operations 

The
Three months ended September 30, 2024, Compared to the Three months ended September 30, 2023 

Net
Sales 

For
the three months ended September 30, 2024, our consolidated net sales decreased by 0.3 million, or 13.5 , to 2.1 million, compared
to the three months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease in net sales mainly reflects: (a) the decline in orders from independent distributors;
(b) the decline in the number of independent distributors, resulting, in part, from recent product reformulations and increased competition
for independent distributors, and (c) the generally adverse impact on consumer buying trends resulting from the recent increase in consumer
good prices in the U.S. 

During
the three months ended September 30, 2024, and 2023, the Company derived substantially all its consolidated net sales from the sale of
its health and wellness products. 

Gross
Profit 

For
the three months ended September 30, 2024, our consolidated gross profit decreased by approximately 0.3 million, to 1.5 million, compared
to the three months ended September 30, 2023; and our consolidated gross margin was 70.1 and 72.2 , respectively. The gross margin was
about the same compared to the last year s which is mainly due to efforts to reduce our cost of goods sold and our shipping expenses. 

Selling
and Marketing Expenses 

For
the three months ended September 30, 2024, our consolidated selling and marketing expenses decreased by 0.1 million, to 0.7 million,
or 31.3 of consolidated net sales, compared to 0.7 million, or 30.9 of consolidated net sales, for the three months ended September
30, 2023. The 0.1 million decrease in consolidated selling and marketing expenses is primarily due to lower sales commissions (which
reflects the decrease in consolidated sales discussed above). 

General
and Administrative Expenses 

For
the three months ended September 30, 2024, our consolidated general and administrative expenses (which include corporate employee
compensation and benefits, stock-based compensation, professional fees, rent and other occupancy costs, certain consulting fees,
telephone and information technology expenses, insurance premiums, and other administrative expenses) decreased by approximately
 0.7 million, to 1.4 million. The 0.7 million decrease was primarily due to lower consulting expense of approximately 0.2
million, and lower employee compensation and compensation-related benefits of 0.3 million due to less headcount year over year. 

Change
in Fair Value of Embedded Derivatives 

For
the three months ended September 30, 2024, we recorded a non-cash income of approximately 364,000 in connection with the issuance of
five convertible promissory notes to our related parties Alset Inc. and HWH International Inc., representing the change in fair value
of embedded derivatives.

Six
months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the Six months ended September 30, 2023 

Net
Sales 

For
the six months ended September 30, 2024, our consolidated net sales decreased by 1.0 million, or 18.5 , to 4.3 million, compared to
the six months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease in net sales mainly reflects: (a) the decline in orders from independent distributors;
(b) the decline in the number of independent distributors, resulting, in part, from recent product reformulations and increased competition
for independent distributors, and (c) the generally adverse impact on consumer buying trends resulting from the recent increase in consumer
good prices in the U.S. 

During
the six months ended September 30, 2024, and 2023, the Company derived substantially all its consolidated net sales from the sale of
its health and wellness products. 

Gross
Profit 

For
the six months ended September 30, 2024, our consolidated gross profit decreased by approximately 0.8 million, to 3.0 million, compared
to the six months ended September 30, 2023; and our consolidated gross margin was 69.8 and 71.3 , respectively. The gross margin was
about the same compared to the last year s which is mainly due to efforts to reduce our cost of goods sold and our shipping expenses. 

Selling
and Marketing Expenses 

For
the six months ended September 30, 2024, our consolidated selling and marketing expenses decreased by 0.9 million, to 1.3 million,
or 29.9 of consolidated net sales, compared to 2.2 million, or 40.9 of consolidated net sales, for the six months ended September
30, 2023. The 0.9 million decrease in consolidated selling and marketing expenses is primarily due to lower sales commissions of
 0.7 million (which reflects the decrease in consolidated sales discussed above) and lower convention expenses of 0.2
million. 

General
and Administrative Expenses 

For
the six months ended September 30, 2024, our consolidated general and administrative expenses (which include corporate employee
compensation and benefits, stock-based compensation, professional fees, rent and other occupancy costs, certain consulting fees,
telephone and information technology expenses, insurance premiums, and other administrative expenses) decreased by approximately
 1.4 million, to 3.0 million. The 1.4 million decrease was primarily due to lower consulting expense of approximately 0.4
million, and lower employee compensation and compensation-related benefits of 0.6 million due to less headcount year over year. 

Change
in Fair Value of Embedded Derivatives 

For
the six months ended September 30, 2024, we recorded a non-cash income of approximately 176,000 in connection with the issuance of five
convertible promissory notes to our related parties Alset Inc. and HWH International Inc., representing the change in fair value of embedded
derivatives.

sale of assets. The Company recognized the transactions as extinguishment of debt of with a gain of 150,634, before income tax, in connection
therewith. In August 2023, Sharing Services and DSSI entered into an agreement pursuant to which DSSI agreed to cancel the promissory
note dated June 15, 2022, including the aggregate principal amount of the Note and unpaid interest of 26.2 million in exchange for 26,000
shares of Sharing Services Series D Preferred Stock, par value 0.0001 per share. The Company recognized a loss on extinguishment of
debt of 188,842 in connection therewith.

Net
Loss and Loss per Share

million for the six months ended September 30, 2023. For the six months ended September 30, 2024, and September 30, 2023, our basic and
diluted loss per share was 5.26 and 14.51, respectively. 

Liquidity
and Capital Resources 

We
broadly define liquidity as our ability to generate sufficient cash, from internal and external sources, to meet our obligations and
commitments. We believe that, for this purpose, liquidity cannot be considered separately from capital resources. 

Working
Capital 

Working
capital (total current assets minus total current liabilities). We had a deficiency in our working capital of approximately 5.1 million
as of September 30, 2024, compared to 4.2 million as of March 31, 2024. 

As
of September 30, 2024, and March 31, 2024, our cash and cash equivalents were 0.7 million and 0.9 million, respectively. Based upon
the current level of operations and anticipated investments necessary to grow our business, while we believe that existing cash balances
and anticipated funds from operations may be sufficient to meet our working capital requirements over the next 12 months, we will need
to obtain additional financing through the issuance of equity securities and convertible promissory notes. Please see NOTE 2 
GOING CONCERN. 

25 

Historical
Cash Flows

our primary sources of cash have been capital transactions involving the issuance of equity securities and secured and unsecured debt

Net
Cash Used in Operating Activities 

For
the six months ended September 30, 2024, net cash used in operating activities was 1.2 million, compared to 3.0 million for the six
months ended September 30, 2023. The 1.7 million decrease was primarily due to a decline in operating losses of 1.5 million (excluding
non-cash items, such as depreciation and amortization, stock-based compensation expense, provision for obsolete inventory losses, amortization
of debt discount, unrealized gain (loss) on investments, losses on impairment of investments in unconsolidated entities and notes receivable,
and gains on extinguishment of debt). 

Net
Cash Provided by Financing Activities 

For
the six months ended September 30, 2024, net cash provided by financing activities was 1.1 million, compared to 1.2 million for
the six months ended September 30, 2023. The 1.1 million represents proceeds from loans under convertible promissory notes
and other borrowings. 

Impact
of currency rate changes in cash 

For
the six months ended September 30, 2024, the impact of currency rate changes in cash was negative 6,414, compared to 160,759, for the
six months ended September 30, 2023.

Potential
Future Acquisitions 

The
Company, directly and through its subsidiaries, may make strategic acquisitions and purchases of equity interests in businesses that

with cash and cash equivalents, cash provided by operations, if any, and issuance of equity securities and debt. 

Capital

the quarter ended September 30, 2024, there were no capital expenditures for property and equipment (consisting of furniture and fixtures,
computer equipment and software, other office equipment and leasehold improvements) in the ordinary course of our business. 

Contractual
Obligations 

There
were no material changes to our contractual cash obligations during the six months ended September 30, 2024. 

Off-Balance
Sheet Financing Arrangements

of September 30, 2024, we had no off-balance sheet financing arrangements. 

Critical
Accounting Estimates

Accounting
Changes and Recent Accounting Pronouncements 

For
discussion of accounting changes and recent accounting pronouncements, see Note 3 of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements
contained elsewhere in this Quarterly Report. 

Item
3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk. 

The
Company is a Smaller Reporting Company, as defined in Rule 12b-2 of the Exchange Act, and, accordingly, is not required to provide the
information called for by this Item. 

Item
4. Controls and Procedures. 

Evaluation
of Disclosure Controls and Procedures. Our management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer CEO and our Chief Financial Officer CFO ), evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures, as defined
in Rule 13a-15(e) of the Exchange Act, as of the end of the fiscal period covered by this Quarterly Report, and concluded that, as of
September 30, 2024, due to material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting that have yet to be fully remediated,
the Company s disclosure controls and procedures were ineffective in providing reasonable assurance that information required to
be disclosed in reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time
periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to the Company s
management and its Board of Directors, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 

27 

Limitations
on the Company s Controls and Procedures. We do not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures will prevent all errors
and all fraud. Any system of controls and procedures, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute,
assurance that the objectives of the system will be met. Because of the limitations in all such systems, no evaluation can provide absolute
assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud (if any) within the Company have been detected. Furthermore, the design of any
system of disclosure controls and procedures is based in part upon assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be
no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions, regardless of how unlikely.
Because of these inherent limitations in a cost-effective system of controls and procedures, misstatements and/or omissions due to error
or fraud may occur undetected. 

Changes
in Internal Control over Financial Reporting. During our most recent fiscal quarter, there have been no changes in our internal control
over financial reporting that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial
reporting.
