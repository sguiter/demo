 At September 30, 2024, and December 31, 2023, there were and securities, respectively, in an unrealized loss position. Of these securities, had been in an unrealized loss position for 12 months or longer as of September 30, 2024. 
 We believe there were no fundamental issues such as credit losses or other factors with respect to any of our available-for-sale securities. The unrealized losses on investments in fixed-maturity securities were caused primarily by interest rate changes. We expect that the securities will not be settled at a price less than par value of the investments. Because the declines in fair value are attributable to changes in interest rates or market conditions and not credit quality, and because we have the ability and intent to hold our available-for-sale investments until a market price recovery or maturity, we do not consider any of our investments to have any decline in fair value due to expected credit losses at September 30, 2024.

of such price on or prior to December 31, 2024 (the True-Up Obligation ). The True-Up Obligation could be settled at our option in cash, Porch common stock, or a combination thereof. On March 27, 2024, we entered into a settlement agreement and mutual release of claims with the sellers of Floify to settle a post-closing dispute. As part of the of this agreement, the sellers of Floify agreed to terminate the True-Up Obligation in full and released from restriction approximately million of escrowed cash to us. We estimated the fair value of the True-Up Obligation as of the settlement date using the Monte Carlo simulation method. The fair value is based on the simulated market price of our common stock over the maturity date of the True-Up Obligation. As of March 27, 2024, the key inputs used to determine the fair value of million included the stock price of , strike price of , discount rate of and volatility of . Subsequent to the valuation, we recognized a gain on settlement in other income, net, in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Loss equal to the fair value of million. As of December 31, 2023, the key inputs used in the determination of the fair value of million included the stock price of , strike price of , discount rate of and volatility of . 
 We estimated the fair value of the business combination contingent consideration based on specific metrics related to the acquisition of Residential Warranty Services RWS in April 2022, using the discounted cash flow method. The fair value is based on a percentage of revenue of the contingent consideration through the maturity date of August 2026. As of September 30, 2024, the key inputs used to determine the fair value of million were management s cash flow estimates and the discount rate of . As of December 31, 2023, the key inputs used to determine the fair value of million were management s cash flow estimates and the discount rate of . 
 Private Warrants 
 We estimated the fair value of the private warrants using the Black-Scholes-Merton option pricing model. As of September 30, 2024, the key inputs used to determine the fair value included exercise price of , expected volatility of , remaining contractual term of years, and stock price of . As of December 31, 2023, the key inputs used to determine the fair value included exercise price of , expected volatility of , remaining contractual term of years, and stock price of . 
 Embedded Derivatives 
 In connection with the issuance of senior secured convertible notes in April 2023 (see Note 7) and in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification 815-15, Derivatives and Hedging Embedded Derivatives, certain features of the senior secured convertible notes were bifurcated and accounted for separately from the notes. The following features are recorded as derivatives. 
 Repurchase option. If more than million aggregate principal amount of the 2026 Notes remains outstanding on June 14, 2026, the 2028 Note holders have the right to require us to repurchase for cash on June 15, 2026, all or any portion of their 2028 Notes, in principal amounts of dollars or an integral number thereof, at a repurchase price equal to of the principal amount of the 2028 Notes to be repurchased, plus accrued and unpaid interest to, but excluding, the repurchase date. 
 Fundamental change option. If we undergo a fundamental change, as defined in the indenture governing the 2028 Notes and subject to certain conditions, holders of the 2028 Notes have the right to require us to repurchase for cash all or any portion of their 2028 Notes, in principal amounts of dollars or an integral multiple thereof, at a repurchase price equal to of the principal amount of the 2028 Notes to be repurchased, plus accrued and unpaid interest to, but excluding, the repurchase date. A fundamental change includes events such as a change in control, recapitalization, liquidation, dissolution, or delisting. 
 Asset sale repurchase option. If we sell assets and receive net cash proceeds of million in excess of the Asset Sale Threshold (as defined below) (such excess net cash proceeds, the Excess Proceeds ), we must 
 17 

of such Excess Proceeds at a repurchase price per 2028 Note equal to of the principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest to, but excluding, the relevant purchase date, if any. Asset Sale Threshold means million in the aggregate, provided that on and after the date on which the cumulative net cash proceeds received by the Company and its restricted subsidiaries from the sale of assets after April 20, 2023, exceeds million in the aggregate, the Asset Sale Threshold means . As of September 30, 2024, our remaining Asset Sale Threshold was million (See Note 15). 
 The inputs for determining fair value of the embedded derivatives are classified as Level 3 inputs. Level 3 fair value is based on unobservable inputs based on the best information available. These inputs include the probabilities of a repurchase, a fundamental change, and qualifying asset sales, ranging from to . 
 Level 3 Rollforward 
 Fair value measurements categorized within Level 3 are sensitive to changes in the assumptions or methodology used to determine fair value, and such changes could result in a significant increase or decrease in the fair value.

 Fair Value of Fixed Rate Debt 
 As of September 30, 2024, and December 31, 2023, the fair value of the 2026 Notes (see Note 7) was million and million, respectively. As of September 30, 2024, and December 31, 2023, the fair value of the 2028 Notes (see Note 7) was million and million, respectively. The fair value of the other notes approximate the unpaid principal balance. All debt, other than the convertible notes which are Level 2, is considered a Level 3 measurement.

 Terminated Reinsurance Contract 
 During the second quarter of 2023, HOA discovered that Vesttoo Ltd Vesttoo ), which arranged capital for one of our reinsurance contracts, faced allegations of fraudulent activity in connection with collateral it provided to HOA and certain other third parties, which allegations have since been confirmed. We communicated and met with regulators and other key stakeholders regarding the fraud committed and the terminated reinsurance contract. This reinsurance agreement provided partial quota share coverage as well as up to approximately million in a catastrophic event. 
 As a result of its findings, and in accordance with the terms of the reinsurance agreement, HOA terminated the associated contract on August 4, 2023, with an effective date of July 1, 2023. Had the contract not been terminated, the contract would have expired on December 31, 2023, and HOA would have been contracted to pay approximately million in additional premium payments during July through December 2023. Following the effective date of the termination, HOA seized available liquid collateral in the amount of approximately million from a reinsurance trust, of which HOA was the beneficiary and recognized a charge of million in provision for (recovery of) doubtful accounts in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income (Loss) for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. In addition, HOA is evaluating and intends to pursue all available legal claims and remedies to enforce its rights under the letter of credit required by the reinsurance agreement in the amount of million as additional collateral. We have been appointed to the statutory committee of unsecured creditors in the Chapter 11 bankruptcy of Vesttoo and are pursuing recovery of all losses and damages incurred as a result of terminating the reinsurance agreement due to fraud committed by third parties. 
 On January 19, 2024, we entered into a five -year business collaboration agreement with Aon Corp. and Aon Re, Inc. ("Aon") , resulting in payments to us of approximately million in January 2024 and additional cash payments through the end of the contract term. Of the cash payments that we have or will receive through the end of the contract term, million is non-refundable and immediately recognized in other income, net in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income (Loss). A portion of the remaining amount is potentially refundable to Aon if we breach the agreement, including if we directly or indirectly place reinsurance with brokers unaffiliated with Aon, subject to customary cure rights. The remaining amount will be recognized in other income, net, over the term of the agreement. As part of this agreement, Aon and Porch also signed a mutual release of claims arising from the Vesttoo fraud. Porch has not r eleased any claims against non-Aon parties related to these matters and intends to vigorously pursue recovery. In addition to this arrangement, we have also received cash recoveries from other parties in the amount of million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024.

separate mass tort actions brought by a single plaintiffs law firm in December 2019 and April/May 2020 in federal district courts throughout the United States. of the actions was dismissed with prejudice and appealed to the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals. While the appeal was pending, the remaining cases were consolidated in the United States District Court for the Western District of Washington, where Porch resides. On October 12, 2022, in a split decision, the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals reversed. Following remand, that case was also consolidated with the Western District of Washington action. Plaintiffs then filed a motion for leave to file a second amended complaint, which was granted in part and denied in part. The Second Amended Complaint was filed in July 2023. In September 2023, Defendants filed a Motion to Strike the Second Amended Complaint; this motion was denied. Defendants Motion to Dismiss was filed on February 15, 2024 and is fully briefed and awaiting a decision. The parties have each filed several notices of supplemental authority in support of their respective positions on the pending Motion to Dismiss. The parties also filed a required Joint Status Report and Discovery Plan on February 16, 2024. Discovery is stayed until Defendants Motion to Dismiss is decided. Plaintiffs seek actual, statutory, and/or treble damages, injunctive relief, and reasonable attorneys fees and costs. The action is at an early stage in the litigation process. It is not possible to determine the likelihood of an unfavorable outcome of these disputes, although it is reasonably possible that the outcome of these actions may be unfavorable. Further, it is not possible to estimate the range or amount of potential loss (if the outcome should be unfavorable). We intend to contest this case vigorously.

 In addition, in the ordinary course of business, we and our subsidiaries are (or may become) parties to litigation involving property, personal injury, contract, intellectual property and other claims, as well as stockholder derivative actions, class action lawsuits and other matters.

Although the results of legal proceedings and claims cannot be predicted with certainty, neither we nor any of our subsidiaries are currently a party to any legal proceedings the outcome of which, we believe, if determined adversely to us, would individually or in the aggregate have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.

 Average Monthly Revenue per Account in Quarter We view our ability to increase revenue generated from existing customers as a key component of our growth strategy. Average Monthly Revenue per Account in Quarter is defined as the average revenue per month generated across all home services company customer accounts in a quarterly period. Average Monthly Revenue per Account in Quarter is derived from all customers and total revenue. 
 Monetized Services We connect consumers with home services companies nationwide and offer a full range of products and services where homeowners can, among other things: (1) compare and buy home insurance policies (along with auto, flood and umbrella policies) and warranties with competitive rates and coverage; (2) arrange for a variety of services in connection with their move, from labor to load or unload a truck to full-service, long-distance moving services; (3) discover and install home automation and security systems; (4) compare internet and television options for their new home; (5) book small handyman jobs at fixed, upfront prices with guaranteed quality; and (6) compare bids from home improvement professionals who can complete bigger jobs. We track the number of monetized services performed through our platform each quarter and the revenue generated per service performed in order to measure market penetration with homebuyers and homeowners and our ability to deliver high-revenue services within those groups. Monetized Services is defined as the total number of services from which we generated revenue, including, but not limited to, new and renewing insurance and warranty customers, completed moving jobs, security installations, TV/Internet installations or other home projects, measured over the period. 
 Average Quarterly Revenue per Monetized Service We believe that shifting the mix of services delivered to homebuyers and homeowners toward higher revenue services is an important component of our growth strategy. Average Quarterly Revenue per Monetized Service is the average revenue generated per monetized service performed in a quarterly period. When calculating Average Quarterly Revenue per Monetized Service, average revenue is defined as total quarterly service transaction revenues generated from monetized services. 

Recent Developments 
 Reciprocal Exchange 
 On July 29, 2024, we filed a new and updated application to form and license a Texas reciprocal exchange (the Reciprocal with the Texas Department of Insurance TDI ). Our application was approved by the TDI on October 25, 2024, subject to customary administrative closing procedures that are expected to conclude this year. We expect to fund the Reciprocal during the fourth quarter of 2024 with a surplus note. We expect to sell HOA to the Reciprocal for an additional surplus note in the first quarter of 2025. Porch will operate the Reciprocal, providing services. The services to be provided include, but are not limited to, all matters related to underwriting, policy renewal, risk management, insurance portfolio management, financial management, and setting investment guidelines. In addition, Porch will maintain the Reciprocal s books and records and be responsible for its accounting and financial reporting. In exchange for the services to be provided, Porch will receive fees. The Reciprocal will pay all claims and claims adjustment expenses, reinsurance costs, agency commissions, and taxes and license fees. With the TDI approval, we intend to launch Porch Insurance, a new brand and product to be offered by the Reciprocal, including unique benefits for consumers. There is no impact to our consolidated financials for both the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024. 
 Recoveries of Losses on Terminated Reinsurance Contract 
 During the second quarter of 2023, HOA discovered that Vesttoo Ltd Vesttoo ), which arranged capital for one of our reinsurance contracts, faced allegations of fraudulent activity in connection with collateral it provided to HOA and certain other third parties, which allegations have since been confirmed. We communicated and met with regulators and other key stakeholders regarding the fraud committed and the terminated reinsurance contract. This reinsurance agreement provided partial quota share coverage as well as up to approximately 175 million in a catastrophic event. 
 As a result of its findings, and in accordance with the terms of the reinsurance agreement, HOA terminated the associated contract on August 4, 2023, with an effective date of July 1, 2023. Had the contract not been terminated, the contract would have expired on December 31, 2023, and HOA would have been contracted to pay approximately 20 million in additional premium payments during July through December 2023. Following the effective date of the termination, HOA seized

Table of Contents 

 available liquid collateral in the amount of approximately 47.6 million from a reinsurance trust, of which HOA was the beneficiary and recognized a charge of 48.2 million in provision for (recovery of) doubtful accounts in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income (Loss) for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. In addition, HOA is evaluating and intends to pursue all available legal claims and remedies to enforce its rights under the letter of credit required by the reinsurance agreement in the amount of 300 million as additional collateral. We have been appointed to the statutory committee of unsecured creditors in the Chapter 11 bankruptcy of Vesttoo and are pursuing recovery of all losses and damages incurred as a result of terminating the reinsurance agreement due to fraud committed by third parties. 
 On January 19, 2024, we entered into a five -year business collaboration agreement with Aon Corp. and Aon Re, Inc. ("Aon") , resulting in payments to us of approximately 25 million in January 2024 and additional cash payments through the end of the contract term. Of the cash payments that we have or will receive through the end of the contract term, 8.7 million is non-refundable and immediately recognized in other income, net in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income (Loss). A portion of the remaining amount is potentially refundable to Aon if we breach the agreement, including if we directly or indirectly place reinsurance with brokers unaffiliated with Aon, subject to customary cure rights. The remaining amount will be recognized in other income, net, over the term of the agreement. As part of this agreement, Aon and Porch also signed a mutual release of claims arising from the Vesttoo fraud. Porch has not r eleased any claims against non-Aon parties related to these matters and intends to vigorously pursue recovery. In addition to this arrangement, we have also received cash recoveries from other parties in the amount of 3.0 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 
 There can be no guarantee or assurance that HOA will be successful in obtaining sufficient supplemental coverage. Regardless of whether additional supplemental coverage is obtained, HOA will continue to remain responsible and committed with respect to all claims and claim settlement expenses under its policies, including claims incurred but not yet reported for prior periods and claims and expenses that are no longer subject to the reimbursement rights in favor of HOA under the terminated reinsurance contract. 
 Debt Repurchase 
 In February 2024, we repurchased 8.0 million aggregate principal amount of our 2026 Notes. We paid 3.0 million, or 37.5 of par value, plus accrued interest. We recognized a 4.9 million gain on extinguishment of debt, calculated as the difference between the reacquisition price and the net carrying amount of the portion of the 2026 Notes that was extinguished. 
 In September 2024, we repurchased 43.2 million aggregate principal amount of our 2026 Notes. We paid 20.2 million, or an average of 47 of par value, plus accrued interest. We recognized a 22.5 million gain on extinguishment of debt, calculated as the difference between the reacquisition price and the net carrying amount of the portion of the 2026 Notes that was extinguished. 
 Sale of Business 
 On January 31, 2024, we sold our insurance agency, Elite Insurance Group EIG ). The sale price was 12.2 million of which we have received 10.9 million in cash and recorded a receivable of 1.2 million as of September 30, 2024. We recorded a loss of 5.3 million in other income, net, in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income (Loss). 
 Weather Impact 
 Late in the first quarter of 2024, a Texas hailstorm resulted in approximately 16.5 million of gross losses. During the second quarter of 2024, a large hurricane-like windstorm affected Houston with straight-line and long-lived winds up to 100 miles per hour. This event resulted in approximately 20.5 million of gross losses. This sort of event impacts Houston at this level of severity once in every 10 years. In July 2024, Hurricane Beryl made landfall in Texas as a category 1 hurricane and impacted the Houston area, where HOA writes policies. Hurricane Beryl resulted in approximately 44.9 million of gross losses. In September 2024, Hurricane Helene resulted in approximately 4.6 million of gross losses. 
 Porch Common Shares Issued to HOA 
 We recently completed a contribution of a total of 18.3 million newly issued shares of our common stock to HOA. The contribution was completed in two transactions: 13.8 million shares on July 31, 2024, and 4.5 million shares on June 26, 2024. This contribution supports the planned transition of Porch s insurance underwriting business to a reciprocal exchange and helps to bolster HOA s balance sheet strength and rating after Texas May weather impacted surplus. In addition, the contribution increases HOA s long-term surplus position, which better positions HOA for any future third party surplus note capital raise, and is expected to support premium growth in 2025 and beyond. Should Porch s share price increase

 going forward, this would grow HOA s surplus, thereby supporting higher premium levels. While this increases HOA s surplus, there is no impact to the condensed consolidated financial statements. 

Results of Operations 

Key Factors Affecting Operating Results 
 We have been implementing our strategy as a vertical software platform for the home by providing software and services to approximately 28 thousand pre-and-post move home service providers including inspectors, real estate, title, and mortgage companies. Our Insurance segment continues to grow in scale through both premium growth and geographic expansion. The following key factors affected our operating results in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024: 
 Non-catastrophe gross loss ratio improved 11 percentage points from the prior year, driven by premium per policy increases and non-renewal of higher risk policies in insurance. 
 We continued our cost savings initiatives by hiring highly qualified individuals to replace external contracting services. 
 Effective April 1, 2024, we combined our three quota share reinsurance programs into one program covering all our business in all states and renewed all reinsurance programs. 
 We had cash recoveries on terminated reinsurance contracts of approximately 28 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 
 We repurchased 51.2 million of our 2026 senior convertible notes, at an average par value of 45.3 , for 23.2 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 
 Launched new Home Factors insights as we continue to test which property characteristics correlate to predicting losses and risk. 
 Continue to roll out further product enhancements in our Vertical Software businesses as we increase pricing while maintaining high customer retention. 
 We are approved in 16 states to use our unique data to improve risk accuracy in pricing policies for our customers. This means we can charge a lower price for policies which are low-risk and more accurately price higher risk policies.

 Revenue. Total revenue decreased by 18.4 million, or 14 , from 129.6 million in the three months ended September 30, 2023, to 111.2 million in the three months ended September 30, 2024. The decrease in revenue was driven by our Insurance segment as a result of higher reinsurance ceding and a reduction in policies in force. Prior year Insurance revenue increased as a result of the cancellation of the Vesttoo-related reinsurance coverage which decreased the impact of ceding. This change offset organic growth in the Insurance segment, including a 25 increase in premium per policy. 
 Cost of revenue . Cost of revenue decreased by 5.9 million, or 11 , from 53.0 million in the three months ended September 30, 2023, to 47.1 million in the three months ended September 30, 2024. The decrease was primarily the result of higher reinsurance ceding in the Insurance Segment. As a percentage of revenue, cost of revenue represented 42 of revenue in the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared with 41 in the three months ended September 30, 2023. 
 Selling and marketing. Selling and marketing expenses decreased by 12.9 million, or 32 , from 40.1 million in the three months ended September 30, 2023, to 27.2 million in the three months ended September 30, 2024. The decrease is primarily related to a decrease in the Insurance segment s variable policy acquisition and marketing expenses due to decrease in commission rates, the elimination of expenses in the current year due to the sale of the EIG business in the first quarter as described in Note 15 of the unaudited Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements, and a decrease in Vertical Software segment costs consistent with the decrease in revenue in that segment. As a percentage of revenue, selling and marketing expenses represented 24 of revenue in the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared with 31 in the three months ended September 30, 2023. 
 General and administrative. General and administrative expenses decreased by 3.8 million, or 13 , from 28.7 million in three months ended September 30, 2023, to 24.9 million in the three months ended September 30, 2024, primarily due to decreases in Insurance segment expenses, including a 1.5 million decrease in professional fees and a one-time 1.2 million guarantee assessment to the TDI that occurred in 2023.

 Provision for (recovery of) doubtful accounts. In the second quarter of 2023, we charged to provision for doubtful accounts approximately 48.2 million of reinsurance balance due from a reinsurer as described in Note 10 of the unaudited Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. In the third quarter of 2023, we reduced the provision for doubtful accounts related to Vesttoo by 7.0 million after experiencing improvement in loss reserves. In the three months ended September 30, 2024 we continued experiencing improvement in loss reserves and reduced the provision by 0.3 million. 
 Change in fair value of private warrant liability. The fair value of the private warrant liability changed less in the three months ended September 30, 2024, than in the three months ended September 30, 2023. Our common stock price drove the change and was relatively unchanged during the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to a decrease in the three months ended September 30, 2023. 
 Change in fair value of derivatives. The fair value of the derivatives decreased in the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to increasing in the three months ended September 30, 2023. The value is driven by various factors, including the fair value of the underlying debt and assumptions regarding timing of possible repurchase events. See Note 4 in the unaudited Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. 
 Gain on extinguishment of debt. In connection with the repurchase of a portion of the 2026 Notes, we recognized a 22.5 million gain on extinguishment of debt during the three months ended September 30, 2024. There was no corresponding debt extinguishment during the three months ended September 30, 2023. See Note 7 in the notes to the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements. 
 Investment income and realized gains, net of investment expenses. Investment income and realized gains, net of investment expenses, were 3.8 million and 2.5 million in the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Total investments balance was 197.8 million at September 30, 2024, and 115.4 million at September 30, 2023. A higher investment balance and well as reinvested securities at a higher interest rate were the primary reasons for the increased investment income. 
 Other income, net. Other income, net, increased by 0.8 million from 1.2 million in the three months ended September 30, 2023, to 2.0 million in the three months ended September 30, 2024. The increase is primarily due to 1.3 million of recoveries on reinsurance contracts in the three months ended September 30, 2024.

 For the three months ended September 30, 2024, Vertical Software segment revenue was 31.3 million or 28 of total revenue. For the three months ended September 30, 2023, Vertical Software segment revenue was 34.3 million or 26 of total revenue. The decrease in Vertical Software segment revenue was primarily driven in our moving business, which exited an unprofitable corporate relocations offering, redirecting focus to higher-margin services. This decline and was partially offset by price increase in our SaaS businesses, within software and service subscriptions.

Table of Contents 

 Insurance segment revenue was 79.9 million or 72 of total revenue for the three months ended September 30, 2024. Insurance segment revenue was 95.2 million or 74 of total revenue for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease was mainly driven by a reduction in policies in force and a higher reinsurance ceding in the current year as a result of the Vesttoo-related reinsurance coverage which decreased the impact of ceding in the prior year. This change offset organic growth in the Insurance segment, including a 25 increase in Annualized Premium per Policy. 
 SEGMENT ADJUSTED EBITDA (LOSS) 
 Segment Adjusted EBITDA (Loss) is defined as revenue less the following expenses associated with each segment: cost of revenue, selling and marketing, product and technology, general and administrative expenses, and provision for doubtful accounts. Segment Adjusted EBITDA (Loss) also excludes non-cash items or items that management does not consider reflective of ongoing core operations. See Note 16, Segment Information, in the notes to the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements included in Part I, Item 1, of this Quarterly Report for reconciliations to GAAP consolidated financial information for the periods presented. 
 The following table summarizes Segment Adjusted EBITDA (Loss) for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. 
 Three Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 Change Change Segment Adjusted EBITDA (Loss): Vertical Software 5,138 3,179 1,959 62 Insurance 24,829 19,038 5,791 30 Subtotal 29,967 22,217 7,750 35 Corporate and other (13,032) (13,378) 346 (3) Adjusted EBITDA (Loss) 16,935 8,839 8,096 92 
 
 Our Insurance segment had a Segment Adjusted EBITDA (Loss) of 24.8 million in the third quarter of 2024, representing 147 of Adjusted EBITDA (Loss) for the same period. The improvement over the same period last year was a result of lower non-catastrophic losses and our insurance profitability actions, including premium per policy increases of 25 , increasing deductibles, non-renewals of higher risk policies, and introducing coverage exclusions for select risks. These improvements were partially offset by the effects of hurricane Beryl. See Note 10 in the unaudited Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for tabular presentation of premiums and net losses. 
 Vertical Software Segment Adjusted EBITDA (Loss) was 5.1 million in the third quarter of 2024, which improved compared to prior year due to pricing increases and strong cost control, including a reduction in workforce and stronger emphasis on our more profitable services in our moving businesses.

 Revenue . The overall 7 increase in year-to-date revenue compared to the same period last year was primarily driven by the 13 , or 27.8 million, increase in revenue in our Insurance segment as a result of an increase in average premium per policy and lower reinsurance ceding partially offset by a reduction in policies in force. 
 Cost of revenue. The 16 increase in year-to-date cost of revenue was primarily the result of more severe weather in the current period. These were partially offset by the decline of our corporate relocation business. As a percentage of revenue, cost of revenue represented 64 of revenue in the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared with 59 in the same period of 2023. 
 Selling and marketing . The 12 decrease in year-to-date selling and marketing expenses compared to prior year is due to a decrease in Vertical Software segment costs consistent with the decrease in revenue in that segment and a decrease in costs in the Insurance segment related to the sale of the EIG business as described in Note 15 of the unaudited Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. As a percentage of revenue, selling and marketing expenses represented 28 of revenue in the current year-to-date period compared to 34 of revenue in the same period last year. 
 Provision for (recovery of) doubtful accounts. For the nine months ended September 30, 2023, we charged to provision for doubtful accounts approximately 41.2 million of reinsurance balance due from a reinsurer as described in Note 10 of the unaudited Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. During 2024, we experienced improvement in loss reserves related to Vesttoo of 1.4 million. We had no significant charges to the provision for doubtful accounts during 2024. 
 Impairment loss on intangible assets and goodwill. In the nine months ended September 30, 2023, we recorded a goodwill impairment charge of 55.2 million in our Insurance segment and a 2.0 million impairment charge on intangible assets in our Vertical Software segment. These impairments followed a sustained decrease in stock price, increased costs due to 
 39 

Table of Contents 

 inflationary pressures, hardening of the reinsurance markets, volatile weather, and a deterioration of the macroeconomic environment in the housing and real estate and insurance industries. There were no impairment losses on intangible assets and goodwill in the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 
 Interest expense. Year-to-date interest expense, increased by 10.5 million, or 50 , from 21.2 million in the same period in 2023. The increase is mainly due to interest at a higher weighted average rate on a higher aggregate debt balance after issuance of the 2028 Notes in April 2023. The following table details the components of interest expense, on the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income (Loss): 
 Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 Contractual interest expense 18,096 12,195 Amortization of debt issuance costs and discount 14,187 8,756 Capitalized Interest (357) Other (168) 279 Total interest expense 31,758 21,230 
 Change in fair value of derivatives. The fair value of the derivatives changed more in the nine months ended September 30, 2024, than in the three months ended September 30, 2023, as the current year includes a full nine months of change whereas the prior year includes only the period of time after the 2028 Notes were issued in April 2023. The value is driven by various factors, including the fair value of the underlying debt and assumptions regarding timing of possible repurchase events. See Note 4 in the unaudited Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. 
 Gain on extinguishment of debt. In connection with the issuance of the 2028 Notes and partial repurchase of the 2026 Notes, we recognized an 81.4 million gain on extinguishment of debt during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we recognized an 27.4 million gain on extinguishment of debt related to the partial repurchases of the 2026 Notes. See Note 7 in the unaudited Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. 
 Investment income and realized gains, net of investment expenses. Investment income and realized gains, net of investment expenses, were 11.0 million and 4.5 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Total investments balance was 197.8 million at September 30, 2024, and 115.4 million at September 30, 2023. A higher investment balance was the primary reason for the increased investment income. 
 Other income, net. Other income, net, increased by 23.6 million from 3.5 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2023, to 27.1 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2024. The increase is due to recoveries of losses on reinsurance contract of 14.8 million and gain on settlement of contingent consideration of 14.9 million. These are offset by loss on sale of EIG business of 5.3 million. See Note 12 in the unaudited Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for detail of other income, net, for each period presented.

 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, Vertical Software segment revenue was 91.3 million or 27 of total revenue. For the nine months ended September 30, 2023, Vertical Software segment revenue was 97.4 million or 31 of total revenue. The decrease in Vertical Software segment revenue was primarily driven by the strategic shift to more profitable moving services and the shutdown of our corporate relocation business, within move-related transaction, and was partially offset by price increase in our SaaS businesses, within software and service subscriptions. 
 Insurance segment revenue was 246.1 million or 73 of total revenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. Insurance segment revenue was 218.3 million or 69 of total revenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase is mainly driven by lower reinsurance ceding and as a 25 increase in Annualized Premium per Policy. These were partially offset by a reduction in policies in force. 
 SEGMENT ADJUSTED EBITDA (LOSS) 
 Segment Adjusted EBITDA (Loss) is defined as revenue less the following expenses associated with each segment: cost of revenue, selling and marketing, product and technology, general and administrative expenses, and provision for doubtful accounts. Segment Adjusted EBITDA (Loss) also excludes non-cash items or items that management does not consider reflective of ongoing core operations. See Note 16, Segment Information, in the notes to the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements included in Part I, Item 1, of this Quarterly Report for reconciliations to GAAP consolidated financial information for the periods presented. 
 The following table summarizes Segment Adjusted EBITDA (Loss) for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. 
 Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 Change Change Segment Adjusted EBITDA (Loss): Vertical Software 11,039 4,599 6,440 140 Insurance (5,376) (19,328) 13,952 (72) Subtotal 5,663 (14,729) 20,392 (138) Corporate and other (40,289) (41,448) 1,159 (3) Adjusted EBITDA (Loss) (34,626) (56,177) 21,551 (38) 
 
 Our Insurance segment had a Segment Adjusted EBITDA (Loss) of (5.4) million in the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to (19.3) million in the same period last year. The improvement over the same period last year was a

 result of lower non-catastrophic losses and our insurance profitability actions, including premium per policy increases of 25 , increasing deductibles, non-renewal of higher risk policies, and introducing coverage exclusions for select risks. These improvements were partially offset by the effects of severe weather events. See Note 10 in the unaudited Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for tabular presentation of premiums and net losses. 
 Vertical Software Segment Adjusted EBITDA (Loss) was 11.0 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2024, which improved compared to prior year due to pricing increases and strong cost control, including a reduction in workforce and stronger emphasis on our more profitable services in our moving businesses. 
 Corporate expenses were 40.3 million in the current year-to-date period, a 1.2 million decrease from the same period in the prior year due to successful cost reduction efforts across the company. Corporate expenses decreased to 12 of total revenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, from 13 in the same period in the prior year. 

Non-GAAP Financial Measures 
 This Quarterly Report includes non-GAAP financial measures, such as Adjusted EBITDA (Loss) and Adjusted EBITDA (Loss) as a percent of revenue. 
 We define Adjusted EBITDA (Loss) as net income (loss) adjusted for interest expense; income taxes; depreciation and amortization; gain or loss on extinguishment of debt; other expense (income), net; impairments of intangible assets and goodwill; impairments of property, equipment, and software; stock-based compensation expense; mark-to-market gains or losses recognized on changes in the value of contingent consideration arrangements, earnouts, warrants, and derivatives; restructuring costs; acquisition and other transaction costs; and non-cash bonus expense. Adjusted EBITDA (Loss) as a percent of revenue is defined as Adjusted EBITDA (Loss) divided by total revenue. 
 Our management uses these non-GAAP financial measures as supplemental measures of our operating and financial performance, for internal budgeting and forecasting purposes, to evaluate financial and strategic planning matters, and to establish certain performance goals for incentive programs. We believe that the use of these non-GAAP financial measures provides investors with useful information to evaluate our operating and financial performance and trends and in comparing our financial results with competitors, other similar companies and companies across different industries, many of which present similar non-GAAP financial measures to investors. However, our definitions and methodology in calculating these non-GAAP measures may not be comparable to those used by other companies. In addition, we may modify the presentation of these non-GAAP financial measures in the future, and any such modification may be material. 
 You should not consider these non-GAAP financial measures in isolation, as a substitute to or superior to financial performance measures determined in accordance with GAAP. The principal limitation of these non-GAAP financial measures is that they exclude specified income and expenses, some of which may be significant or material, that are required by GAAP to be recorded in our consolidated financial statements. We may also incur future income or expenses similar to those excluded from these non-GAAP financial measures, and the presentation of these measures should not be construed as an inference that future results will be unaffected by unusual or non-recurring items. In addition, these non-GAAP financial measures reflect the exercise of management judgment about which income and expense are included or excluded in determining these non-GAAP financial measures.

 The following table reconciles Net income (loss) to Adjusted EBITDA (Loss) for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 (dollar amounts in thousands).

 (2) Difference from Other Income, net in Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income (Loss) is primarily due to a portion of the income resulting from the Aon business collaboration agreement, disclosed in Note 10, that is not a non-GAAP adjustment. 
 (3) Primarily consists of costs related to forming a reciprocal exchange and professional fees related to share contributions to HOA (see Note 8) 
 
 Adjusted EBITDA (Loss) for the three months ended September 30, 2024, was 16.9 million, a 8.1 million improvement from Adjusted EBITDA (Loss) of 8.8 million for the same period in 2023. The improvement in Adjusted EBITDA (Loss) in 2024 is primarily driven by insurance profitability actions, including price increases implemented over the last year, as well as cost reductions across the business. We are seeing the benefit of prior year investments in sales and marketing and investments in establishing and maintaining the requirements of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act SOX and other internal controls across IT and accounting organizations. These improvements were partially offset by the effects of severe weather events, lower ceding, and the decline of the corporate relocation business in our Vertical Software segment. 
 Adjusted EBITDA (Loss) for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, was (34.6) million, a 21.6 million improvement from Adjusted EBITDA (Loss) of (56.2) million for the same period in 2023. The improvement in Adjusted EBITDA (Loss) in 2024 is primarily driven by insurance profitability actions, including price increases implemented over the last year, as well as cost reductions across the business. These improvements were partially offset by the effects of severe weather events and the decline of the corporate relocation business in our Vertical Software segment. 

Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 As of September 30, 2024, we had cash and cash equivalents of 206.7 million and restricted cash and cash equivalents of 10.0 million. Restricted cash and cash equivalents includes the following:

 (2) Pledged to the Department of Insurance in certain states as a condition of our Certificate of Authority for the purpose of meeting obligations to policyholders and creditors. 
 (3) Required under regulatory guidelines in 22 states and 19 states as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. 
 We have incurred net losses since our inception and have an accumulated deficit at September 30, 2024, and December 31, 2023, totaling 785.4 million and 722.1 million, respectively. 
 As of September 30, 2024, and December 31, 2023, we had 507.3 million and 558.7 million, respectively, of aggregate principal amount outstanding in convertible notes, promissory notes, line of credit, term loan facility, and advance funding arrangement. In February 2024, we repurchased 8.0 million aggregate principal amount of our 2026 Notes. We paid 3.0 million, or 37.5 of par value, plus accrued interest. We recognized a 4.9 million gain on extinguishment of debt, calculated as the difference between the reacquisition price and the net carrying amount of the portion of the 2026 Notes that was extinguished. In September 2024, we repurchased 43.2 million aggregate principal amount of our 2026 Notes. We paid 20.2 million, or an average of 47 of par value, plus accrued interest. We recognized a 22.5 million gain on extinguishment of debt, calculated as the difference between the reacquisition price and the net carrying amount of the portion of the 2026 Notes that was extinguished. 
 Based on our current operating and growth plan, management believes cash and cash equivalents at September 30, 2024, are sufficient to finance our operations, planned capital expenditures, working capital requirements, and debt service obligations for at least the next 12 months. As our operations evolve and we continue our growth strategy, including through acquisitions, we may elect or need to obtain alternative sources of capital, and we may finance additional liquidity needs in the future through one or more equity or debt financings. We may not be able to obtain equity or additional debt financing in the future when needed or, if available, the terms may not be satisfactory to us or could be dilutive to our stockholders. 
 Porch Group, Inc. is a holding company that transacts the majority of its business through operating subsidiaries, including insurance subsidiaries. Consequently, our ability to pay dividends and expenses is largely dependent on dividends or other distributions from our subsidiaries. Our insurance company subsidiaries are highly regulated and are restricted by statute as to the amount of dividends they may pay without the prior approval of their respective regulatory authorities. As of September 30, 2024, our insurance carrier, HOA, held cash and cash equivalents of 150.5 million and investments of 166.0 million. 
 We recently completed a contribution of a total of 18.3 million newly issued shares of our common stock to HOA. The contribution was completed in two transactions: 13.8 million shares on July 31, 2024, and 4.5 million shares on June 26, 2024. This contribution supports the planned transition of Porch s insurance underwriting business to a reciprocal exchange and helps to bolster HOA s balance sheet strength and rating after Texas May weather impacted surplus. In addition, the contribution increases HOA s long-term surplus position, which better positions HOA for any future third party surplus note capital raise, and is expected to support premium growth in 2025 and beyond. Should Porch s share price increase going forward, this would grow HOA s surplus, thereby supporting higher premium levels. While the shares contributed to HOA have been issued and are outstanding, as provided under Delaware law, these shares will neither be entitled to vote nor be counted for quorom purposes so long as HOA (or any successor transferee) holds the shares and is a direct or indirect subsidiary of Porch or is otherwise controlled, directly or indirectly, by Porch. For accounting purposes, the shares contributed to HOA are considered treasury stock because HOA is a subsidiary that is included in our consolidated financial results. While this increases HOA s surplus, there is no impact to the condensed consolidated financial statements. 
 Insurance companies in the United States are also required by state law to maintain a minimum level of policyholder s surplus. Insurance regulators in the states in which we operate have a risk-based capital standard designed to identify property and casualty insurers, or reinsurers, that may be inadequately capitalized based on inherent risks of the insurer s

 assets and liabilities and its mix of net written premium. Insurers falling below a calculated threshold may be subject to varying degrees of regulatory action. See Note 10 in the unaudited Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for a description of our reinsurance programs. 
 We may, at any time and from time to time, seek to retire or purchase our outstanding debt or equity through cash purchases and/or exchanges for equity or debt, in open-market purchases, privately negotiated transactions or otherwise. Such repurchases or exchanges, if any, will be upon such terms and at such prices as we may determine, and will depend on prevailing market conditions, liquidity requirements, contractual restrictions and other factors. The amounts involved may be material. 
 The following table provides a summary of cash flow data for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023: 
 Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 Change Change Net cash provided by (used in) operating activities (5,080) 74,898 (79,978) (107) Net cash used in investing activities (52,209) (34,203) (18,006) 53 Net cash provided by (used in) financing activities (23,265) 92,414 (115,679) (125) Change in cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash (80,554) 133,109 (213,663) (161) 
 
 Operating Cash Flows 
 Net cash provided by (used in) operating activities was (5.1) million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. Net cash used in operating activities includes cash outflows to cover losses from severe weather during the year and timing of working capital disbursements. These outflows of cash were partially offset by positive cash flow from the non-recurring cash receipt of 25 million related to the Aon agreement (see Note 10 in the notes to the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements). 
 Net cash provided by (used in) operating activities was 74.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Net cash provided by (used in) operating activities consists of net loss of 131.4 million, adjusted for non-cash items and the effect of changes in working capital. Non-cash adjustments include impairment loss on goodwill and intangible assets of 57.2 million, stock-based compensation expense of 20.3 million, depreciation and amortization of 18.5 million, non-cash interest expense of 20.2 million, loss (gain) on remeasurement of contingent consideration of (3.6) million, and loss (gain) on remeasurement of private warrant liability of (0.6) million. Net changes in working capital were net proceeds of cash of 130.1 million, primarily due to increases in deferred revenue, losses and loss adjustment expense reserves and other insurance liabilities, offset by higher reinsurance balance due. 
 Investing Cash Flows 
 Net cash used in investing activities was 52.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. Net cash used in investing activities is primarily related to proceeds from sale of EIG of 10.9 million and maturities and sales of investments of 44.0 million offset by purchases of investments of 98.1 million and investments in developing internal-use software of 8.6 million. 
 Net cash used in investing activities was 34.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Net cash used in investing activities is primarily related to acquisitions, net of cash acquired of 2.0 million, purchases of investments of 59.9 million, investments in developing internal-use software of 6.9 million, and purchases of property and equipment of 0.8 million. This was offset by the cash inflows related to maturities and sales of investments of 35.3 million. 
 Financing Cash Flows 
 Net cash provided by (used in) financing activities was (23.3) million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. Net cash provided by (used in) financing activities is primarily related to the repurchase of the 2026 Notes of 23.2 million. 
 Net cash provided by (used in) financing activities was 92.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Net cash provided by financing activities is primarily related to proceeds from issuance of the 2028 Notes of 112.1 million offset by 5.6 million of stock repurchases. 

Critical Accounting Estimates 
 Our critical accounting policies, including the assumptions and judgements underlying them, are disclosed in the 2023 Annual Report, including those policies as discussed in Note 1 to the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements include in

 the 2023 Annual Report. There have been no material changes to these policies during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 
 Since the date of incorporation, we have not engaged in any off-balance sheet arrangements, as defined in the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC ). 

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 
 We are exposed to a variety of market and other risks, including the effects of changes in interest rates, and inflation, as well as risks to the availability of funding sources, hazard events, and specific asset risks. 
 Interest Rate Risk 
 The market risk inherent in our financial instruments and financial position represents the potential loss arising from adverse changes in interest rates. As of September 30, 2024, and December 31, 2023, we have interest-bearing debt of 507.3 million and 558.7 million, respectively. Our 0.75 convertible senior notes due in September 2026 (the 2026 Notes have a principal balance of 173.8 million as of September 30, 2024, a fixed coupon rate of 0.75 , and an effective interest rate of 1.3 . Our 6.75 senior secured convertible notes due in October 2028 (the 2028 Notes have a principal balance of 333.3 million as of September 30, 2024, a fixed coupon rate of 6.75 , and an effective interest rate of 17.9 . Interest expense includes both contractual interest expense and amortization of debt issuance costs and discount. The following table details the interest expense recognized for both the 2026 and 2028 Notes: 
 Three Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 2024 2023 Contractual interest expense for 2026 Notes 399 422 1,220 1,720 Contractual interest expense for 2028 Notes 5,625 5,625 16,875 10,063 Amortization of debt issuance costs and discount for 2026 Notes 295 299 882 1,215 Amortization of debt issuance costs and discount for 2028 Notes 4,711 3,914 13,295 6,713 11,030 10,260 32,272 19,711 
 Because the coupon rates are fixed, interest expense on the 2026 Notes and the 2028 Notes will not change if market interest rates increase. Other debt as of September 30, 2024, totaled 0.2 million and is variable-rate. A 1 increase in interest rates in our variable rate indebtedness would result in a nominal change in annual interest expense. 
 As of September 30, 2024, our insurance segment has a 197.8 million portfolio of fixed income securities and an unrealized gain (loss) of (0.9) million, as described in Note 3 in the notes to the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements included in Part I, Item 1, of this Quarterly Report. In a rising interest rate environment, the portfolio would result in unrealized losses. 
 As of September 30, 2024, accounts receivable and reinsurance balances due were 21.3 million and 103.4 million, respectively, were not interest-bearing assets, and are generally collected in less than 180 days. As such, we do not consider these assets to have material interest rate risk. 
 Inflation Risk 
 We believe our operations have been negatively affected by inflation and the change in the interest rate environment. General economic factors beyond our control and changes in the global economic environment, specifically fluctuations in inflation, including access to credit under favorable terms, could result in lower revenues, higher costs, and decreased margins and earnings in the foreseeable future. While we take action wherever possible to reduce the impact of the effects of inflation, in the case of sustained inflation across several of the markets in which we operate, it could become increasingly difficult to effectively mitigate the increases to costs. In addition, the effects of inflation on consumers budgets could result in the reduction of consumer spending habits, specifically in the move and post-move markets. If unable to take actions to effectively mitigate the effect of the resulting higher costs, our profitability and financial position could be materially and adversely impacted.

 Foreign Currency Risk 
 There was no material foreign currency risk for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. Our activities to date have been conducted primarily in the United States. 
 Other Risks 
 We are exposed to a variety of market and other risks, including risks to the availability of funding sources, reinsurance providers, weather and other catastrophic hazard events, and specific asset risks. 

Item 4. Controls and Procedures 
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 Under the supervision and with the participation of management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, we evaluated the effectiveness of disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act )). Based on this evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures to ensure that information required to be disclosed in reports we file or submit under the Exchange Act is (i) recorded, processed, summarized, evaluated and reported, as applicable, within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms and (ii) accumulated and communicated to management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures were effective as of September 30, 2024. 
 Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) during the most recent fiscal quarter that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 
 Limitations on Effectiveness of Controls and Procedures 
 Our disclosure controls and procedures are designed to provide reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives. Our management recognizes that any control system, no matter how well designed and operated, is based upon certain judgments and assumptions and cannot provide absolute assurance that its objectives will be met.

 PART II OTHER INFORMATION 
 
 Item 1. Legal Proceedings 
 See Note 14, Commitments and Contingencies, in the notes to the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements included in Part I, Item 1, of this Quarterly Report, which is incorporated by reference into this Part II, Item 1, for a description of certain litigation and legal proceedings. 
 In addition, in the ordinary course of business, we and our subsidiaries are (or may become) parties to litigation involving property, personal injury, contract, intellectual property and other claims, stockholder derivative actions, class action lawsuits and other matters. The amounts that may be recovered in such matters may be subject to insurance coverage. Although the results of legal proceedings and claims cannot be predicted with certainty, neither we nor any of our subsidiaries are currently a party to any legal proceedings the outcome of which, we believe, if determined adversely to us, would individually or in the aggregate have a material adverse effect on the business, financial condition or results of operations. 

Item 1A. Risk Factors 
 Except as set forth below, as of the date of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, there have been no material changes from the risk factors disclosed in Part 1, Item 1A, of the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, as filed with the SEC on March 15, 2024. 
 Regulatory factors could impact the value at which Homeowners of America Insurance Company HOA carries contributed shares on its statutory financial statements, negatively impact HOA regulatory surplus, and require us to take additional steps to enable HOA to adhere to regulatory requirements and maintain its financial stability rating. 
 As a Texas domestic property and casualty insurer, HOA is subject to various regulatory requirements, including minimum surplus as regards to policyholders and requirements relating to the credit quality, liquidity and diversification of investments. The amount of surplus and investments maintained by HOA also impacts its financial stability rating. Pursuant to the contribution transactions described in Note 8 of the unaudited Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements, a total of million shares of common stock were contributed to HOA primarily to support its compliance with requirements under Texas law relating to surplus and to maintain its financial stability rating. The value at which the contributed shares are carried on the statutory financial statements of HOA is subject to ongoing regulatory risks, including the following: 
 Valuation of the contributed shares for purposes of HOA statutory financial statements remains subject to continuing oversight by the Texas Department of Insurance TDI ), which may in the future require that the shares be recorded at a more steeply discounted value than TDI initially approved depending upon our results of operation and other future events, including excess losses incurred by the HOA insurance business due to severe weather events. 
 Other restrictions under Texas law on the total amount HOA may invest in an affiliate such as Porch Group, Inc., which could limit the portion of the contributed shares value that can be included as admitted assets on its statutory financial statements. 
 These and other regulatory factors beyond our control or that we have not anticipated could negatively impact the value at which the contributed shares are recorded on the selling stockholder s statutory financial statements in future filings with TDI, which could negatively impact the selling stockholder s surplus position and its Demotech, Inc. financial stability rating. In such event, our strategy to bolster the selling stockholder s surplus through the contribution of shares may prove ineffective, and we may need to contribute cash or other admitted assets or take other steps to enable the selling stockholder to adhere to Texas regulatory requirements, including as to surplus, and to maintain its financial stability rating. Our ability to effectively maintain the selling stockholder s surplus position due to these factors will be subject to numerous risks, such as whether we have sufficient cash or other assets that would count as admitted assets of the selling stockholder under Texas insurance law available for additional contributions to the selling stockholder or the availability of additional debt or equity financing in the event that we do not. The availability of additional debt or equity financing is subject to numerous risks, including the trading price of our common stock at such time, other market conditions, and restrictions under the indentures governing our outstanding convertible senior notes on the incurrence of additional indebtedness.

 A sustained decline in the price of our common stock would negatively impact HOA regulatory surplus, which may require us to contribute additional funds or shares to enable HOA to adhere to regulatory requirements and maintain its financial stability rating. 
 
 The shares of our common stock held by HOA represent a significant portion of its surplus as regards to policyholders. The value at which HOA carries these shares for regulatory financial reporting purposes will fluctuate over time with changes in the trading price of our common stock. A decline in the trading price of our common stock (whether sustained or temporary but at quarter end) would negatively impact the amount of surplus that HOA reports on its statutory financial statements. It is possible that this could require us to contribute additional funds to enable HOA to adhere to regulatory requirements relating to surplus and to maintain its financial stability rating. In such case, if we do not have sufficient cash resources on hand to fund needed contributions, we may need to raise additional capital through equity or debt financings or contribute additional shares of our common stock instead. Additional equity financings could result in significant additional dilution to existing stockholders, and we face significant restrictions on our ability to obtain additional debt financing due to the restrictive covenants under the indentures governing our outstanding convertible senior notes. As a result of these and other factors, additional capital may not be available on terms that are acceptable, if at all, which, if acceptable to TDI, could require us to contribute additional shares of our common stock to HOA to enable it to remain in compliance with regulatory requirements and maintain its financial stability rating, which could be delayed if such additional contribution were subject to shareholder approval under applicable Nasdaq listing rules. The contribution of additional shares of common stock to HOA and the possibility that HOA may sell such additional shares could cause the price of our common stock to decline and make it more difficult for us to raise funds through the sale of equity. 
 Future sales of our common stock by HOA could cause our stock price to decline and be dilutive. 
 Although HOA holds the shares of common stock described in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q primarily to strengthen its surplus position and maintain its financial stability rating, HOA may sell all or a portion of the shares from time to time in the future as it may deem necessary or appropriate to support the needs of its business, including, for example, to generate additional cash to pay claims and expenses, to improve liquidity and asset diversification, to otherwise meet applicable regulatory requirements and maintain its financial stability rating, or to finance the acquisition of new business. In addition, HOA could be forced to sell shares if insurance regulatory authorities disallow the shares to be recorded as admitted assets on its statutory financial statements or require the shares to be recorded at a greater discount than initially approved by TDI. Additionally, if HOA is placed under receivership by TDI, the receiver may sell shares in connection with the liquidation or rehabilitation of HOA. The timing and amount of any such sales, and the offering price and proceeds thereof, cannot be predicted as of the date of this prospectus. Market conditions, the method of distribution and other factors could make it difficult for the selling shareholder to sell shares when necessary to meet underlying needs or objectives. The sale of shares of our common stock by HOA in the public market, or the perception by the market that those sales could occur, may cause the market price of our common stock to decline. Such sales, or the possibility that such sales may occur, also could make it more difficult for us to raise funds through the sale of equity in the future. Once shares are sold by HOA to unrelated parties, they will no longer be treated as treasury shares for financial reporting purposes, may be dilutive to earnings per share, will be entitled to vote and will count for quorum purposes.
