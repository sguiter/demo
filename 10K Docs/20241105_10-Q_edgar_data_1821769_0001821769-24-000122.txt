Among shares issued in the transaction, the Company issued approximately restricted shares that are subject to time based vesting and issued approximately restricted shares that are subject to time and performance based vesting over the four and , respectively, following the date of issue. These restricted shares are subject to certain individuals maintaining employment with the Company and, therefore, are accounted for under ASC 718. The Company recognized million and million of stock-based compensation expense related to the vesting of these shares during three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively. The Company recognized million and million of stock-based compensation expense related to the vesting of these shares during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively. 
 Unvested Earnout Shares 
 A portion of the earnout shares (discussed in Note 10 below) may be issued to individuals with unvested equity awards. While the payout of these shares requires achievement of share price targets based on the volume weighted average price of the Company s common stock, the individuals are required to complete the remaining service period associated with these unvested equity awards to be eligible to receive the earnout shares. As a result, these unvested earn-out shares are equity-classified awards and have an aggregated grant date fair value of million or per share. The Company recognized million and million of stock-based compensation expense related to the vesting of these shares during three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively. The Company recognized and million of stock-based compensation expense related to the vesting of these shares during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively. As of September 30, 2024, there was remaining compensation cost related to unvested earnout shares, except for forfeitures. Refer to Note 10, Earnout Liability.

 earnout shares of the Company s Class A common stock if earnout milestones are met. The earnout milestones represent independent criteria, each of which entitles the eligible stockholders to aggregate earn-out shares if the milestone is met. 
 The earnout liability is remeasured at the end of each reporting period. The change in fair value of the earnout liability is recorded as part of other income (expense), net in the consolidated statements of operations. 
 The estimated fair value of the earnout liability was determined using a Monte Carlo analysis of 20,000 simulations of the future path of the Company s stock price over the earnout period. The assumptions utilized in the calculation are based on the achievement of certain stock price milestones including projected stock price, volatility, and risk-free rate. 
 Equity volatility rate 

As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the earnout liability had a fair value of million and million, respectively, which resulted in a gain in the fair value of the earnout liability of million and million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively. As of September 30, 2023, the earnout liability had a fair value of million, which resulted in a gain in the fair value of the earnout liability of million and a loss in the fair value of the earnout liability of million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively.

 Concentration of Credit Risk 
 Financial instruments that potentially subject the Company to concentrations of credit risk consisted principally of cash, cash equivalents and trade receivables. The Company maintains its cash and cash equivalents with high-credit quality financial institutions. At times, such amounts may exceed federally insured limits. The Company has not experienced any losses on cash or cash equivalents held at financial institutions. The Company does not have any off-balance-sheet credit exposure related to its customers. 

The Company has a customer deposit from a primary customer of million and million, as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively, and the Company intends to apply a portion of the customer deposit to outstanding accounts receivable. 
 As of September 30, 2024, the Company reassessed the risk pooling of its accounts receivable and determined that certain customer trade receivables associated with a customer have an expected term greater than one year. These receivables were discounted to present value using a discounted cash flow model based on the Company s expectation of the timing of future payments over the next years and are presented as accounts receivable noncurrent within the condensed consolidated balance sheets. A million allowance for credit losses was recorded associated with this reassessment. 
 
 Concentration of Supplier Risk 
 The Company currently relies on a single foundry to produce wafers for GaN ICs and a separate single foundry to produce wafers for SiC MOSFETs. Loss of the relationship with either of these suppliers could have a substantial negative effect on the Company. Additionally, the Company relies on a limited number of third-party subcontractors and suppliers for testing, packaging and certain other tasks. Disruption or termination of supply sources or subcontractors, including due to pandemics or natural disasters such as an earthquake or other causes, could delay shipments and could have a material adverse effect on the Company. Although there are generally alternate sources for these materials and services, qualification of the alternate sources could cause delays sufficient to have a material adverse effect on the Company. A significant amount of the Company s third-party subcontractors and suppliers, including the third-party foundry that supplies wafers for GaN ICs, are located in Taiwan. A significant amount of the Company s assembly and test operations are conducted by third-party contractors in Taiwan and the Philippines. 
 The Company entered into an agreement to purchase raw materials from a supplier from September 29, 2022 through December 31, 2025, and accordingly made a million deposit to be received as invoice credits toward future purchases. The Company is not obligated to purchase from this supplier, however, if the Company does not meet minimum purchase requirements during the term, the Company may forfeit all or a portion of its million deposit. Currently the Company is not projecting to meet the minimum purchase requirements, therefore, the Company does not expect to receive any credits within the next 12 months beginning in the fourth quarter of 2024.

The effective tax rate for 2024 differs from the prior year primarily due to tax expense in foreign as a result of tax expense in foreign jurisdictions not impacted by valuation allowance. In each quarter, the Company updates its estimated annual effective tax rate, and if the estimated annual effective tax rate changes, a cumulative adjustment is recorded in that quarter. The Company's quarterly income tax provision and quarterly estimate of the annual effective tax rate are subject to volatility due to several factors, including the Company s ability to accurately predict the proportion of the Company s income (loss) before provision for income taxes in multiple jurisdictions, the tax effects of the Company s stock-based compensation, and the effects of its foreign entities. 
 The Company had unrecognized tax benefits for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. The Company recognizes interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in operating expenses. such interest and penalties were recognized during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023.

 Three Months Ended September 30, 2024 Compared to the Three Months Ended September 30, 2023 
 Revenue 
 Revenue for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was 21.7 million compared to 22.0 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023, a decrease of 0.3 million, or 1 . The slight decline in sales was due to the decline in high power markets partially offset by growth in mobile compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. 
 Cost of Revenues 
 Cost of revenues for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was 13.1 million compared to 14.9 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023, a decrease of 1.8 million or 12 . The decrease was primarily driven by an inventory write-off of 2.0 million that occurred during the three months ended September 30, 2023 slightly offset by product mix. 
 Research and Development Expense 
 Research and development expense for the three months ended September 30, 2024 of 17.8 million increased by 1.3 million, or 8 , when compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. This is primarily driven by an increase in headcount-related expenses and software costs as we build out our target end markets. 
 Selling, General and Administrative Expense 
 Selling, general and administrative expense for the three months ended September 30, 2024 of 15.0 million increased by 0.6 million, or 4 , when compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023, driven by increases in professional fees, salaries and benefits and a 0.8 million increase in the allowance for expected credit losses, offset by lower stock-based compensation expense.

TABLE OF CONTENTS 

 Amortization of Intangible Assets 
 Amortization of intangible assets remained the same as we did not acquire new intangible assets. 
 
 Other Income (Expense), net 
 Dividend income consists of income earned on our money market treasury funds that are recorded as cash equivalents on our consolidated balance sheet. Decrease of 0.4 million is primarily due to decreases in our investment balances in September 2024 compared to September 2023. 
 During the three months ended September 30, 2024, we recognized a 9.2 million gain from the change in fair value of our earn-out liabilities. The decrease in the gain of our earn-out liabilities of 25.3 million was primarily a result of the decrease of the closing price of our Class A common stock listed on the Nasdaq, resulting in the decrease in the estimated fair value of the earnout shares from 4.53 as of September 30, 2023 to 0.46 as of September 30, 2024. 
 Income Tax Provision 
 Income tax provision for the three months ended September 30, 2024 increased 0.1 million when compared to the income tax benefit of 0.0 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. We expect our tax rate to remain close to zero in the near term due to full valuation allowances against deferred tax assets. 
 
 Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 Compared to the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2023 
 Revenue 
 Revenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 65.3 million compared to 53.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, an increase of 11.9 million, or 22 . Sales have increased due to strong mobile and consumer markets. 
 Cost of Revenues 
 Cost of revenues for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 39.2 million compared to 33.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, an increase of 5.9 million or 18 . The increase was primarily driven by increases in mobile and consumer product revenue partially offset by the inventory write-off of 2.0 million from September 2023. 
 
 Research and Development Expense 
 Research and development expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 of 57.0 million increased by 6.3 million, or 12 , when compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. This is primarily driven by an increase in product development as it relates to EV, enterprise and solar. Additionally, salaries and benefits have increased as we build out our target end markets. 
 Selling, General and Administrative Expense 
 Selling, general and administrative expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 of 46.5 million decreased by 0.1 million, or , when compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease is primarily driven by a decrease in stock-based compensation expense of 4.1 million offset by increases in professional fees, sales force expenses, and coupled with the increase in the allowance for expected credit losses described above. 
 
 Amortization of Intangible Assets 
 Amortization of intangible assets remained fairly consistent as we did not acquire new intangible assets.

TABLE OF CONTENTS 

 Other Income (Expense), net 
 Net interest (expense) income for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was (0.1) million compared to 1.3 million net interest income (expense) for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, primarily due to the higher interest rate received on money markets funds in the prior year. 
 Increase of 2.1 million in dividend income is primarily due to the timing of when we transferred money into our money market treasury funds. As a result, the prior-year figure reflects only six months of activity compared to nine months in the current period. 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we recognized a 42.9 million gain from the change in fair value of our earn-out liabilities. The increase in the gain of our earn-out liabilities of 68.4 million was primarily a result of the decrease of the closing price of our Class A common stock listed on the Nasdaq, resulting in the decrease in the estimated fair value of the earnout shares from 4.53 as of September 30, 2023 to 0.46 as of September 30, 2024. 
 Income Tax Provision (Benefit) 
 Income tax provision for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 increased 0.3 million when compared to the income tax benefit of 0.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. We expect our tax rate to remain close to zero in the near term due to full valuation allowances against deferred tax assets. 
 
 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 Our primary use of cash is to fund our operating expenses, working capital requirements, and outlays for strategic investments and acquisitions. In addition, we use cash to conduct research and development, incur capital expenditures, and fund our debt service obligations. 
 We expect to continue to incur net operating losses and negative cash flows from operations and we expect our research and development expenses, general and administrative expenses and capital expenditures will continue to increase. We expect our expenses and capital requirements to increase in connection with our ongoing initiatives to expand our operations, product offerings and end customer base. 
 As of September 30, 2024, we had cash and cash equiva lents of 98.6 million. We currently expect to fund our cash requirements through the use of cash on hand. We believe that our current levels of cash and cash equivalents are sufficient to finance our operations, working capital requirements and capital expenditures for the foreseeable future. 
 We expect our operating and capital expenditures to increase as we increase headcount, expand our operations and grow our end customer base. If additional funds are required to support our working capital requirements, acquisitions or other purposes, we may seek to raise funds through additional equity or debt financing or from other sources. If we raise additional funds through the issuance of equity, the percentage ownership of our equity holders could be significantly diluted, and these newly issued securities may have rights, preferences or privileges senior to those of existing equity holders. If we raise additional funds by obtaining loans from third parties, the terms of those financing arrangements may include negative covenants or other restrictions on our business that could impair our operating flexibility and would also require us to incur interest expense. We can provide no assurance that additional financing will be available at all or, if available, that we would be able to obtain additional financing on terms favorable to us. 
 
 Cash Flows 
 The following table summarizes our consolidated cash flows for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 (in thousands):

TABLE OF CONTENTS 

 Operating Activities 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, net cash used in operating activities was 48.6 million, which primarily reflects a net loss of 44.7 million. This decrease to operating cash flows is partially offset by adjustments for non-cash share-based compensation of 38.0 million, depreciation of 2.2 million, non-cash gains of 42.9 million in earnout liabilities, amortization of intangible assets of 14.3 million, and an aggregate cash used in operating assets and liabilities of 18.2 million. Specifically, increases in accounts receivables of 1.5 million, decreases in accounts payable, accrued compensation and other expenses of 9.9 million, decline in customer deposits and deferred revenue of 8.9 million, partially offset by decreases in inventories and prepaid expenses and other current assets of 3.0 million. 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2023, net cash used in operating activities was 17.4 million, which primarily reflects a net loss of 113.4 million. This decrease to operating cash flows are partially offset by adjustments for non-cash share-based compensation of 41.8 million, non-cash losses of 25.5 million in earnout liabilities, amortization of intangible assets of 14.0 million, and an aggregate cash provided by operating assets and liabilities of 11.5 million. Specifically, increases in deferred revenue of 13.3 million, accrued compensation expense of 12.2 million, increases in accrued expenses of 3.2 million, and increases in account payable of 2.5 million, partially offset by a 8.4 million increase in account receivable and 1.6 million increase in other assets, a 0.9 million increase in prepaid expenses and other, and a decrease in operating lease liabilities of 1.5 million. 
 
 Investing Activities 
 Net cash used in investing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 of 8.7 million was primarily due to 2.5 million cash funding of a joint venture and 6.2 million for purchases of fixed assets. 
 Net cash used in investing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 of 4.4 million was primarily due to 1.0 million cash funding of a joint venture and 3.4 million for purchases of fixed assets. 
 Financing Activities 
 Net cash provided by financing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 of 3.1 million was primarily due to proceeds from stock option exercises of 0.4 million and proceeds from our employee stock purchase plan of 2.7 million. 
 Net cash provided by financing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 of 88.2 million was primarily due to proceeds from the issuance of common stock in May 2023 of 86.9 million and proceeds from stock option exercises of 1.8 million, offset by the payment of May 2023public offering costs of 0.5 million. 

Contractual Obligations, Commitments and Contingencies 
 
 In the ordinary course of business, we enter into contractual arrangements that may require future cash payments. As of September 30, 2024, our non-cancellable contractual arrangements consisted entirely of lease obligations. Refer to Note 8 - Leases for further information. 

Off-Balance Sheet Commitments and Arrangements 
 As of September 30, 2024, we did not have any off-balance sheet arrangements as defined in Item 303(a)(4)(ii) of Regulation S-K. 
 
 Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 
 The preparation of our financial statements and related disclosures in accordance with U.S. GAAP requires our management to make judgments, assumptions and estimates that affect the amounts reported in our accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes included elsewhere in this quarterly report. Our management bases its estimates and judgments on historical experience, current economic and industry conditions and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. 
 The methods, estimates, and judgments that we use in applying our accounting policies have a significant impact on the results that we report in our condensed consolidated financial statements. Some of our accounting policies require us to make difficult and subjective judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates regarding matters that are inherently uncertain. 
 34 

TABLE OF CONTENTS 

 There have been no material changes to our critical accounting policies and estimates from the information in Item 7, Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations , included in our 2023 annual report on Form 10-K. 

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 
 
 Market Conditions 
 Adverse changes in the global economic landscape have impacted, and may continue to affect, the demand for our products. This impact includes alterations in customer order behaviors, such as cancellations, and shifts in vendor inventory levels. 
 
 Commodity Risk 
 We face exposure to market price fluctuations of specific commodity raw materials, notably gold, which are integrated into our end products or utilized by our suppliers in production. Rising commodity prices result in increased costs passed on to us by suppliers, either through general price hikes or commodity surcharges. While our interactions with suppliers typically occur through purchase orders rather than long-term contracts, we strive to secure firm pricing aligned with planned production volumes. 
 
 Item 4. Controls and Procedures. 
 
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 
 Our management, with the supervision and involvement of our Principal Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer, has evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) as of the end of the period covered by this report, pursuant to Exchange Act Rule 13a-15. Based upon this evaluation, our chief executive officer and chief financial officer have concluded that, as of September 30, 2024, as a result of the material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting discussed below and filed in our amended annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 on July 23, 2024 with the SEC, our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective. 
 
 A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the Company s annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. The following material weaknesses have been identified: 
 
 The Company did not fully maintain components of the COSO framework, including elements of the control environment, risk assessment, control activities, and monitoring activities components, relating to: (i) sufficiency of processes related to identifying and analyzing risks to the achievement of objectives across the entity, (ii) sufficiency of competent personnel with appropriate levels of knowledge, experience, and training in accounting for complex and non-routine transactions, and internal control matters to perform assigned responsibilities and have appropriate accountability for the design and operation of internal control over financial reporting; (iii) performing control activities in accordance with established policies in a timely manner, and (iv) performing ongoing evaluation to ascertain whether the components of internal controls are present and functioning. 
 
 The entity level material weaknesses contributed to other material weaknesses within the Company s system of internal control over financial reporting as follows: 
 
 35 

TABLE OF CONTENTS 

 The Company did not design and implement effective controls, such that, personnel within the Company have incompatible duties which allow for the creation, review and processing of journal entries without independent review and authorization, which affects substantially all financial statement account balances and disclosures. 
 The Company did not design and implement effective controls over the accounting for share-based payments, including the long-term incentive plan awards and earnout liability. 
 The Company did not design and implement effective controls over the accounting for its license and release agreement. 
 The Company did not design and implement effective controls over the inputs and assumptions used in the valuation of the earnout liability and information utilized to classify awards as either equity or liability. 
 The Company did not maintain effective controls over its determination of reportable segments for purposes of segment reporting and reporting units for purposes of goodwill. 
 
 These material weaknesses did not result in a misstatement to the consolidated financial statements or disclosures. Based on additional procedures and post-closing review, management concluded that the condensed consolidated financial statements included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q present fairly, in all material respects, our financial position, results of operations and cash flows for the periods presented, in conformity with principles generally accepted in the United States. 
 
 Remediation Plan 
 
 We have commenced developing a plan to enhance the design and operating effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting, including maintaining sufficient contemporaneous documentation of management review controls over accounting for share-based payments, including the long-term incentive plan awards, earnout liability, as well as the accounting for the Company s license and release agreement, which we believe will address the material weakness described above. At least on an annual basis or as warranted due to organizational changes, we will perform a segment/reporting unit analysis. We expect our remediation will be complete prior to the end of the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024. 
 
 We have hired a Director of Information Technology at the end of 2023 to, among other responsibilities, segregate financial accounting systems access and system changes between IT and accounting department. The Company will continue to review and modify system access for accounting personnel to ensure proper segregation of duties around manual journal entries. 
 
 We have implemented enhanced workflows within our ERP system across key financial processes, including journal entry approvals, sales invoice approvals, expense payments, and cash application workflows, to strengthen control activities, ensure proper authorization, and maintain accurate documentation. Additionally, we improved the segregation of duties by refining access controls and reassigning responsibilities to prevent conflicts, reducing the risk of unauthorized transactions. We also expanded our analysis around the sensitivity of our long-term incentive plan awards and earnout liability. Specifically, for the earnout liability, we performed a more thorough review of the volatility component to improve the precision of our financial estimates and ensure compliance with applicable accounting standards. 
 
 Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
 
 Other than the material weaknesses and remediation plan described above, there have been no significant changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f)) that occurred during our most recent fiscal quarter that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company s internal control over financial reporting.

 PART II OTHER INFORMATION 
 
 Item 1. Legal Proceedings. 
 From time to time we may be involved in various disputes and litigation matters that arise in the ordinary course of business. We are currently not a party to any material legal proceedings. 

Item 1A. Risk Factors. 
 There are no material changes from the risk factors previously disclosed in Part I Item 1A, Risk Factors, of our annual report on Form 10-K/A for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023, filed with the SEC on July 23, 2024, and in Part II Item 1A, Risk Factors, of our quarterly reports on Form 10 Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2024, filed with the SEC on May 15, 2024 and for the quarter ended June 30, 2024, filed with the SEC on August 5, 2024, except as discussed below. 
 We depend on a few key distributors and the loss of one or more of these distributors could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
 We cannot assure that any of our current or future distributors will not cease purchasing products from us in favor of products of other suppliers, significantly reduce orders or seek price reductions in the future, and any such event could have a material adverse effect on our revenue, profitability, and results of operations. 
 Furthermore, a significant portion of our revenue and accounts receivable is derived from one distributor. See Note 11 , Significant Customers and Credit Concentrations , included in this Form 10-Q for the percentages of revenues and accounts receivable attributable to this one distributor. A downturn in the industry or lower sales could materially adversely affect our business and results of operations. 
 We employ modeling techniques to support the valuation of our accounts receivable and to project the timing and amount of expected collections. While these models are designed to provide reliable insights, they involve certain inherent risks, especially if any assumptions or inputs prove inaccurate, incomplete, or less indicative of future outcomes than anticipated. 
 As part of our risk management efforts, we use a discounted cash flow model for certain accounts receivable, informed by historical trends and robust assumptions. However, should these assumptions or historical patterns deviate from actual results, there is potential for variance in the model s accuracy, which could affect decisions based on these forecasts. 

Item 2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds. 
 On September 25, 2024, we issued 24,000 shares of our common stock to a professional advisor in exchange for consulting services provided to a subsidiary. The issuance was made in reliance on the exemption from registration provided by Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, for transactions by an issuer not involving a public offering. The Company did not receive any cash proceeds from the issuance. The advisor represented its intention to acquire the securities for investment only and not with a view to or for sale in connection with any distribution thereof. Appropriate legends have been applied to the book-entry positions reflecting the shares issued in the transaction. 
 
 Item 5. . 
 Termination of 10b5-1 Trading Plans of Directors and Executive Officers 
 , , , a trading plan adopted on March 13, 2024 which was intended to satisfy the affirmative defense conditions of Rule 10b5 1(c) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. 
 
 Rule 10b5 1 plans are generally in the form of prearranged written plans to buy or sell company stock at predetermined times or prices. Such plans are designed to provide an affirmative defense against insider trading liability, provided they satisfy the conditions of Rule 10b5 1(c), including, but not limited to, a condition requiring directors and executive officers of public companies to observe a waiting period of at least 90 days, after the plan adoption date, before any trades can be executed under the plan. 
 
 The company does not undertake any obligation to report the establishment, modification or termination of any Rule 10b5 1 trading plans by directors or executive officers, except to the extent required by law.
