 We have land banking financing arrangements with a third-party land banker to repurchase land that we sold to the land banker as a method of acquiring finished lots in staged takedowns, while limiting risk and minimizing the use of funds from our available cash or other financing sources. In consideration for this repurchase option, we paid a non-refundable commitment fee. Based on our right to control the ultimate economic outcome of these finished lots, these assets will continue to be held as real estate not owned within our inventory and a corresponding obligation was established within our accrued liabilities as discussed in Note 3 to recognize this relationship. While we are not legally obligated to repurchase the balance of the lots, we will be subject to certain performance obligations, financial and other penalties if the lots are not purchased. We do not have any ownership interest or title to the assets that we have sold to the land banker and we do not guarantee any of the land banker s liabilities. 
 We build and lease a number of single-family homes in select, existing communities. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we transferred million of home assets from real estate inventory to rental properties within property and equipment, net.

The lease term may include options to extend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that we will exercise that option. As our leases do not provide an implicit rate, we use our incremental borrowing rate based on the information available at commencement date in determining the present value of lease payments. ROU assets, as included in other assets on the consolidated balance sheets, were million and million as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively.

 The housing market remains healthy, with overall demand supported by strong fundamentals, including household formation and migration trends, the ongoing impact of years of underproduction, and a lock-in effect limiting the supply of existing homes available for sale. On top of these dynamics are a resilient employment market and our customers positive outlook on the stability of their jobs. On the other side of the demand equation is constrained affordability, which remains the main challenge for our customers. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we had 4,495 home closings, compared to 4,971 home closings during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 We sell homes under the LGI Homes and Terrata Homes brands. Our 138 active communities at September 30, 2024 included 18 Terrata Homes communities. At September 30, 2023, we had 106 active communities, including 11 Terrata Homes communities.

 (1) Gross margin is home sales revenues less cost of sales. 
 (2) Calculated as a percentage of home sales revenues. 
 (3) Adjusted gross margin is a non-GAAP financial measure used by management as a supplemental measure in evaluating operating performance. We define adjusted gross margin as gross margin less capitalized interest and adjustments resulting from the application of purchase accounting included in the cost of sales. Our management believes this information is useful because it isolates the impact that capitalized interest and purchase accounting adjustments have on gross margin. However, because adjusted gross margin information excludes capitalized interest and purchase accounting adjustments, which have real economic effects and could impact our results, the utility of adjusted gross margin information as a measure of our operating performance may be limited. In addition, other companies may not calculate adjusted gross margin information in the same manner that we do. Accordingly, adjusted gross margin information should be considered only as a supplement to gross margin information as a measure of our performance. Please see Non-GAAP Measures for a reconciliation of adjusted gross margin to gross margin, which is the GAAP financial measure that our management believes to be most directly comparable. 
 (4) EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure used by management as a supplemental measure in evaluating operating performance. We define EBITDA as net income before (i) interest expense, (ii) income taxes, (iii) depreciation and amortization and (iv) capitalized interest charged to the cost of sales. Our management believes that the presentation of EBITDA provides useful information to investors regarding our results of operations because it assists both investors and management in analyzing and benchmarking the performance and value of our business. EBITDA provides an indicator of general economic performance that is not affected by fluctuations in interest rates or effective tax rates, levels of depreciation or amortization and items considered to be

 unusual or non-recurring. Accordingly, our management believes that this measure is useful for comparing general operating performance from period to period. Other companies may define this measure differently and, as a result, our measure of EBITDA may not be directly comparable to the measures of other companies. Although we use EBITDA as a financial measure to assess the performance of our business, the use of this measure is limited because it does not include certain material costs, such as interest and taxes, necessary to operate our business. EBITDA should be considered in addition to, and not as a substitute for, net income in accordance with GAAP as a measure of performance. Our presentation of EBITDA should not be construed as an indication that our future results will be unaffected by unusual or non-recurring items. Our use of EBITDA is limited as an analytical tool, and you should not consider this measure in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under GAAP. Please see Non-GAAP Measures for reconciliations of EBITDA to net income, which is the GAAP financial measure that our management believes to be most directly comparable.

 Home sales revenues for the three months ended September 30, 2024 were 651.9 million, an increase of 34.3 million, or 5.6 , from 617.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in home sales revenues was primarily due to an increase in the average sales price per home closed and a slight increase in homes closed during the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. The average sales price per home closed during the three months ended September 30, 2024 was 371,004, an increase of 18,326, or 5.2 , from the average sales price per home closed of 352,678 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in the average sales price per home closed was primarily due to geographic mix, largely in our Northwest and West segments, and a favorable pricing environment. The overall increase in home closings was a result of a higher average community count during the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. The overall increase in average community count relates to timing associated with new community openings, offset by the close out of some communities and transition between certain active communities during the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. The overall decrease in absorption rate generally relates to the impact of ongoing affordability constraints, new community openings, and the overall increase in community count.

 Home sales revenues in our Central reportable segment decreased by 19.2 million, or 10.4 , during the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023, due to a 9.3 decrease in the number of homes closed and a 1.3 decrease in the average sales price per home closed. The decrease in home closings was the result of a lower absorption rate, partially offset by an increase in the average community count. 
 Home sales revenues in our Southeast reportable segment increased by 5.6 million, or 3.8 , during the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023, due to a 3.1 increase in the number of homes closed and a 0.6 increase in the average sales price per home closed. The increase in home closings was the result of an increase in the average community count, partially offset by a lower absorption rate. 
 Home sales revenues in our Northwest reportable segment increased by 15.4 million, or 22.8 , during the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023, due to a 14.5 increase in the number of homes closed and a 7.2 increase in the average sales price per home closed. The increase in home closings was the result of an increase in the average community count, partially offset by a lower absorption rate. 
 Home sales revenues in our West reportable segment increased by 55.7 million, or 58.7 , during the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023, due to a 45.0 increase in the number of homes closed and a 9.4 increase in the average sales price per home closed.

 Home sales revenues in our Florida reportable segment decreased by 23.2 million, or 19.1 , during the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023, primarily due to a 24.3 decrease in the number of homes closed, partially offset by a 6.9 increase in the average sales price per home closed. The decrease in home closings was the result of a lower absorption rate, partially offset by a higher average community count. 
 Cost of Sales and Gross Margin (home sales revenues less cost of sales). Cost of sales increased for the three months ended September 30, 2024 to 488.4 million, an increase of 29.6 million, or 6.5 , from 458.7 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023, primarily due to an increase in lot costs and higher capitalized interest. Gross margin for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was 163.5 million, an increase of 4.7 million, or 3.0 , from 158.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. Gross margin as a percentage of home sales revenues was 25.1 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 25.7 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. This decrease in gross margin as a percentage of home sales revenues was primarily due to the impact of increased sales incentives offered and a combination of an increase in lot costs and higher capitalized interest during the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. 
 Selling Expenses. Selling expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2024 were 55.2 million, an increase of 5.4 million, or 10.9 , from 49.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in selling expenses was primarily due to an increase in advertising expense and an increase in personnel costs as a result of an increase in communities for the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. Sales commissions decreased to 27.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 from 27.9 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023, primarily due to a decrease in outside commissions, partially offset by an increase in our in-house commissions due to an overall increase in revenues during the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. Selling expenses as a percentage of home sales revenues were 8.5 and 8.1 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The increase in selling expenses as a percentage of home sales revenues was primarily due to higher advertising and other personnel expenses incurred during the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. 
 General and Administrative. General and administrative expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2024 were 28.0 million, an increase of 1.2 million, or 4.6 , from 26.7 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023.

Other income, net of other expenses was 11.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, an increase of 4.4 million from 7.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in other income, net of other expenses, primarily reflects gains realized from the sale of residential lots and the increase in income associated with our investment in unconsolidated entities during the three months ended September 30, 2024. 
 Operating Income and Net Income before Income Taxes. Operating income for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was 80.3 million, a decrease of 2.0 million, or 2.4 , from 82.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease in operating income was primarily attributed to lower gross margin and higher advertising and other costs associated with the increase in average community count. Net income before income taxes for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was 91.9 million, an increase of 2.4 million, or 2.7 , from 89.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in net income before income taxes was primarily attributed to gains realized from the sale of residential lots during the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023.

The decrease in our effective tax rate to 24.3 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 from 25.1 for the three months ended September 30, 2023 was primarily a result of a decrease in the rate for the compensation limitation under Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code, as amended. 
 Net Income . Net income for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was 69.6 million, an increase of 2.5 million, or 3.8 , from 67.0 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023.

 Home sales revenues for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 were 1.6 billion, a decrease of 105.0 million, or 6.0 , from 1.8 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease in home sales revenues was primarily due to a 9.6 decrease in homes closed, offset by an increase in the average sales price per home closed during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The overall decrease in home closings was a result of a lower absorption rate, partially offset by a higher average community count, during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The overall increase in average community count relates to timing associated with new community openings, offset by the close out of some communities and transition between certain active communities during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The average sales price per home closed during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 366,007, an increase of 13,932, or 4.0 , from the average sales price per home closed of 352,075 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in the average sales price per home closed was primarily due to geographic mix and a favorable pricing environment. The overall decrease in absorption rate generally relates to the impact of ongoing affordability constraints, new community openings, and the overall increase in community count. 
 Included within our home sales revenues for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 113.7 million in wholesale revenues resulting from 379 home closings, representing 8.4 of the 4,495 total homes closed during the nine months ended September 30, 2024.

The increase in gross margin as a percentage of home sales revenues during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023 was primarily due to a higher average sales price per home closed, partially offset by a combination of higher lot costs and higher capitalized interest as a percentage of revenue as well as the impact of sales incentives offered during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 
 Selling Expenses. Selling expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 were 149.2 million, an increase of 7.4 million, or 5.2 , from 141.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in selling expenses was primarily due to an increase in advertising expense and an increase in personnel costs as a result of an increase in communities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. Sales commissions decreased to 72.2 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from 77.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, primarily due to a decrease in outside commissions and our in-house commissions. Selling expenses as a percentage of home sales revenues were 9.1 and 8.1 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The increase in selling expenses as a percentage of home sales revenues was primarily due to higher advertising and other personnel expenses during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 General and Administrative. General and administrative expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 were 90.0 million, an increase of 5.7 million, or 6.7 , from 84.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in general and administrative expenses was primarily a result of increased indirect overhead expenses and professional fees, partially offset by a decrease in payroll related costs during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. General and administrative expenses as a percentage of home sales revenues were 5.5 and 4.8 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The increase in general and administrative expenses as a percentage of home sales revenues was primarily due to leverage from community count growth during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 Other Income, Net. Other income, net of other expenses was 25.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, an increase of 5.5 million from 19.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in other income, net

 of other expenses, primarily reflects gains realized from the sale of residential lots and the increase in income associated with our investment in unconsolidated entities. 
 Operating Income and Net Income before Income Taxes. Operating income for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 166.6 million, a decrease of 6.9 million, or 4.0 , from 173.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The overall decreases in operating income and net income before income taxes were primarily due to overall lower home closings at a lower absorption rate and higher advertising and other costs associated with the increase in average community count during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Net income before income taxes for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 191.8 million, a decrease of 1.4 million, or 0.7 , from 193.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Our reportable segments contributed to net income before income taxes during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as follows: Central - 47.0 million, or 24.5 ; Southeast - 67.6 million, or 35.2 ; Northwest - 19.6 million, or 10.2 ; West - 40.9 million, or 21.3 ; and Florida - 19.6 million, or 10.2 . 
 Income Taxes . Income tax provision for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 46.6 million, an increase of 0.6 million, or 1.2 , from income tax provision of 46.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in our effective tax rate to 24.3 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from 23.8 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 was primarily a result of an increase in the compensation cost in excess of deductions for share-based payments, partially offset by the compensation limitation under Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code, as amended. 
 Net Income . Net income for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 145.2 million, a decrease of 1.9 million, or 1.3 , from 147.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease in net income was primarily attributed to overall lower homes closed and lower home sales revenues, partially offset by a higher gross margin during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 
 Non-GAAP Measures 
 In addition to the results reported in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States GAAP ), we have provided information in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q relating to adjusted gross margin and EBITDA. 
 Adjusted Gross Margin 
 Adjusted gross margin is a non-GAAP financial measure used by management as a supplemental measure in evaluating operating performance. We define adjusted gross margin as gross margin less capitalized interest and adjustments resulting from the application of purchase accounting included in the cost of sales. Our management believes this information is useful because it isolates the impact that capitalized interest and purchase accounting adjustments have on gross margin. However, because adjusted gross margin information excludes capitalized interest and purchase accounting adjustments, which have real economic effects and could impact our results, the utility of adjusted gross margin information as a measure of our operating performance may be limited. In addition, other companies may not calculate adjusted gross margin information in the same manner that we do. Accordingly, adjusted gross margin information should be considered only as a supplement to gross margin information as a measure of our performance.

 The following table reconciles adjusted gross margin to gross margin, which is the GAAP financial measure that our management believes to be most directly comparable (dollars in thousands):

 (1) Adjustments result from the application of purchase accounting for acquisitions and represent the amount of the fair value step-up adjustments included in cost of sales for real estate inventory sold after the acquisition dates. 
 (2) Calculated as a percentage of home sales revenues. 
 EBITDA 
 EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure used by management as a supplemental measure in evaluating operating performance. We define EBITDA as net income before (i) interest expense, (ii) income taxes, (iii) depreciation and amortization and (iv) capitalized interest charged to the cost of sales. Our management believes that the presentation of EBITDA provides useful information to investors regarding our results of operations because it assists both investors and management in analyzing and benchmarking the performance and value of our business. EBITDA provides an indicator of general economic performance that is not affected by fluctuations in interest rates or effective tax rates, levels of depreciation or amortization and items considered to be unusual or non-recurring. Accordingly, our management believes that this measure is useful for comparing general operating performance from period to period. Other companies may define this measure differently and, as a result, our measure of EBITDA may not be directly comparable to the measures of other companies. Although we use EBITDA as a financial measure to assess the performance of our business, the use of this measure is limited because it does not include certain material costs, such as interest and taxes, necessary to operate our business. EBITDA should be considered in addition to, and not as a substitute for, net income in accordance with GAAP as a measure of performance. Our presentation of EBITDA should not be construed as an indication that our future results will be unaffected by unusual or non-recurring items. Our use of EBITDA is limited as an analytical tool, and you should not consider this measure in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under GAAP. Some of these limitations are: 
 (i) it does not reflect every cash expenditure, future requirements for capital expenditures or contractual commitments, including for purchase of land; 
 (ii) it does not reflect the interest expense or the cash requirements necessary to service interest or principal payments on our debt; 
 (iii) although depreciation and amortization are non-cash charges, the assets being depreciated and amortized will often have to be replaced or require improvements in the future, and EBITDA does not reflect any cash requirements for such replacements or improvements; 
 (iv) it does not adjust for all non-cash income or expense items that are reflected in our statements of cash flows; 
 (v) it does not reflect the impact of earnings or charges resulting from matters we consider not to be indicative of our ongoing operations; and 
 (vi) other companies in our industry may calculate it differently than we do, limiting its usefulness as a comparative measure. 
 Because of these limitations, our EBITDA should not be considered as a measure of discretionary cash available to us to invest in the growth of our business or as a measure of cash that will be available to us to meet our obligations. We compensate for these limitations by using our EBITDA along with other comparative tools, together with GAAP measures, to assist in the evaluation of operating performance. These GAAP measures include operating income, net income and cash flow data. We have significant uses of cash flows, including capital expenditures, interest payments and other non-recurring charges, which are not reflected in our EBITDA. EBITDA is not intended as an alternative to net income as an indicator of our operating 
 29 

Table of Contents 

 performance, as an alternative to any other measure of performance in conformity with GAAP or as an alternative to cash flows as a measure of liquidity. You should therefore not place undue reliance on our EBITDA calculated using these measures. 
 The following table reconciles EBITDA to net income, which is the GAAP financial measure that our management believes to be most directly comparable (dollars in thousands):

 Backlog 
 We sell our homes under standard purchase contracts, which generally require a homebuyer to pay a deposit at the time of signing the purchase contract. The amount of the required deposit is minimal (typically 1,000 to 10,000). We permit our retail homebuyers to cancel the purchase contract and obtain a refund of their deposit in the event mortgage financing cannot be obtained within a certain period of time, as specified in their purchase contract. Typically, our retail homebuyers provide documentation regarding their ability to obtain mortgage financing within 14 days after the purchase contract is signed. If we determine that the homebuyer is not qualified to obtain mortgage financing or is not otherwise financially able to purchase the home, we will terminate the purchase contract. If a purchase contract has not been cancelled or terminated within 14 days after the purchase contract has been signed, then the homebuyer has met the preliminary criteria to obtain mortgage financing. Only purchase contracts that are signed by homebuyers who have met the preliminary criteria to obtain mortgage financing are included in new (gross) orders. 
 Our backlog consists of homes that are under a purchase contract that has been signed by homebuyers who have met the preliminary criteria to obtain mortgage financing but have not yet closed and wholesale contracts with varying terms. Since our business model is generally based on building move-in ready homes before a purchase contract is signed, the majority of our homes in backlog are currently under construction or complete. Ending backlog represents the number of homes in backlog from the previous period plus the number of net orders (new orders for homes less cancellations) generated during the current period minus the number of homes closed during the current period. Our backlog at any given time will be affected by cancellations, the number of our active communities and the timing of home closings. Homes in backlog are generally closed within one to two months, although home closings have been, and may continue to be, delayed. In addition, we may experience cancellations of purchase contracts at any time prior to closing. It is important to note that net orders, backlog and cancellation metrics are operational, rather than accounting data, and should be used only as a general gauge to evaluate performance. Backlog may be impacted by customer cancellations for various reasons that are beyond our control, and in light of our minimal required deposit, there is little negative impact to the potential homebuyer from the cancellation of the purchase contract. 
 Our net orders decreased for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The number of homes in our backlog at September 30, 2024 decreased 21.0 compared to September 30, 2023. The decreases generally relate to the impact of ongoing affordability constraints and our decision to limit the use of incentives to the level required to achieve predetermined closing targets during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023.

 Land Acquisition Policies and Development 
 We had 138 and 117 active communities as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. Generally, it takes us two to three years to turn raw or undeveloped land into an active community. To mitigate our exposure to real estate inventory risks, we have utilized, on a limited and strategic basis, land banking financing arrangements. 
 Our lot inventory decreased to 68,564 owned or controlled lots as of September 30, 2024 from 71,081 owned or controlled lots as of December 31, 2023, primarily related to our discipline in the evaluation and selective approval of new land deals. 
 We have land banking financing arrangements with a third-party land banker to repurchase land that we sold to the land banker as a method of acquiring finished lots in staged takedowns, while limiting risk and minimizing the use of funds from our available cash or other financing sources. In consideration for this repurchase option, we paid a non-refundable commitment fee. Based on our right to control the ultimate economic outcome of these finished lots, these assets will continue to be held as real estate not owned within our inventory and a corresponding obligation was established within our accrued liabilities, as discussed in Note 3 , Accrued Expenses and Other Liabilities to our consolidated financial statements included in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, to recognize this relationship. While we are not legally obligated to repurchase the balance of the lots, we will be subject to certain performance obligations, financial and other penalties if the lots are not purchased. We do not have any ownership interest or title to the assets that we have sold to the land banker and we do not guarantee any of the land banker s liabilities. 
 The table below shows (i) home closings by reportable segment for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and (ii) our owned or controlled lots by reportable segment as of September 30, 2024.

 Homes in Inventory 
 When entering a new community, we intend to build a sufficient number of move-in ready homes to meet our budgets. We base future home starts on home closings. As homes are closed, we start more homes to maintain our inventory. As of September 30, 2024, we had a total of 2,491 completed homes, including information centers, and 1,977 homes in progress. 
 Raw Materials and Labor 
 When constructing homes, we use various materials and components. We generally contract for our materials and labor at a fixed price for the anticipated construction period of our homes. This allows us to mitigate the risks associated with increases in building materials and labor costs between the time construction begins on a home and the time it is closed. Typically, the raw materials and most of the components used in our business are readily available in the United States. We purchase some components and materials centrally to achieve volume discounts, a practice that often reduces costs and ensures timely deliveries. We typically do not store significant inventories of construction materials, except for work in progress materials for homes under construction. In addition, the majority of our raw materials are supplied to us by our subcontractors and are included in the price of our contract with such subcontractors. Most of the raw materials necessary for our subcontractors are standard items carried by major suppliers. Our construction work is substantially completed by third-party subcontractors, most of whom are non-unionized. We continue to monitor the supply markets to achieve the best prices available. Typically, the price changes that most significantly influence our operations are price increases in labor, commodities and lumber. In future quarters, we could see various cost pressures associated with inflation similar to the cost pressures experienced in the last few years. Generally, we have successfully increased the sales prices of our homes to absorb these increased costs or have successfully made cost-effective changes as we endeavor to keep our homes affordable. 
 Seasonality 
 In all of our reportable segments, we have historically experienced similar variability in our results of operations and in capital requirements from quarter to quarter due to the seasonal nature of the homebuilding industry. We generally close more homes in our second, third and fourth quarters. Thus, our revenues may fluctuate on a quarterly basis and we may have higher capital requirements in our second, third and fourth quarters in order to maintain our inventory levels. Our revenues and capital requirements are generally similar across our second, third and fourth quarters. 
 As a result of seasonal activity, our quarterly results of operations and financial position at the end of a particular quarter, especially the first quarter, are not necessarily representative of the results we expect at year end. We expect this seasonal pattern to continue in the long term. 
 
 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 Overview 
 As of September 30, 2024, we had 60.9 million of cash and cash equivalents. Cash flows for each of our active communities depend on the status of the development cycle and can differ substantially from reported earnings. 
 Our principal uses of capital are operating expenses, land and lot purchases, lot development, home construction, interest costs on our indebtedness and the payment of various liabilities. In addition, we may purchase land, lots, homes under construction or other assets as part of an acquisition and repurchase shares of our common stock. Early stages of development or expansion require significant cash outlays for land acquisitions, land development, plats, vertical development, construction of information centers, general landscaping and other amenities. Because these costs are a component of our inventory and are not recognized in our statement of operations until a home closes, we incur significant cash outflows prior to recognition of home sales revenues. In the later stages of an active community, cash inflows may exceed home sales revenues reported for financial statement purposes, as the costs associated with home and land construction were previously incurred. 
 Short-term Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 We generally rely on our ability to finance our operations by generating operating cash flows and borrowing under the Credit Agreement to adequately fund our short-term working capital obligations and to purchase land and other assets, develop lots and homes and repurchase shares of our common stock. As needed, we will consider accessing the debt and equity capital markets as part of our ongoing financing strategy. We rely on our ability to obtain performance, payment and completion surety bonds as well as letters of credit to finance our projects. Furthermore, we utilize, on a limited and strategic basis, land banking financing arrangements to access short-term liquidity. 
 As of the date of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, we believe that we will be able to fund our current and foreseeable liquidity needs for at least the next twelve months with our cash on hand, cash generated from operations and cash expected to be available from the Credit Agreement or through accessing debt or equity capital, as needed. However, our ability to engage in the transactions described above may be constrained by volatile or tight economic, capital, credit and financial market 
 32 

Table of Contents 

 conditions, as well as moderated investor or lender interest or capacity and our liquidity, leverage and net worth, and we can provide no assurance as to successfully completing, the costs of, or the operational limitations arising from any one or series of such transactions. 
 Long-term Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 We believe that our long-term principal uses of liquidity and capital resources will be inventory related purchases concerning land, lot development, repurchases of shares of our common stock, other capital expenditures, and principal and interest payments on our debt obligations maturing between 2025 and 2029. We believe that we will be able to fund our long-term liquidity needs with cash generated from operations and cash expected to be available to borrow under the Credit Agreement or through accessing debt or equity capital, as needed, although no assurance can be provided that such additional debt or equity capital will be available when needed or on terms that we find attractive. Additionally, we plan to further utilize, on a limited and strategic basis, land banking financing arrangements to maximize long-term liquidity for lot development projects where we have sufficient finished lot availability in certain markets. To the extent these sources of capital are insufficient to meet our needs, we may also conduct additional public or private offerings of our securities, refinance our indebtedness, or dispose of certain assets to fund our operating activities and capital needs. 
 Revolving Credit Facility 
 On October 9, 2024, we entered into a Fifth Amendment to Fifth Amended and Restated Credit Agreement with several financial institutions, and Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as administrative agent (the Fifth Amendment ), which amended the 2023 Credit Agreement (as so amended by the Fifth Amendment, the Credit Agreement ). The Credit Agreement provides for a 1.205 billion revolving credit facility, which can be increased at the request of the Company by up to 95.0 million, subject to the terms and conditions of the Credit Agreement. The Credit Agreement matures on April 28, 2028 with respect to 1.085 billion, or 90.0 , of the 1.205 billion of commitments thereunder and on April 28, 2025 with respect to 10.0 of the commitments thereunder. 
 Before each anniversary of the Credit Agreement, we may request a one-year extension of its maturity date. The Credit Agreement is guaranteed by, among others, each of our subsidiaries that have gross assets of at least 0.5 million, other than subsidiaries whose sole purpose is to own and operate single-family rental homes. 
 The borrowings and letters of credit outstanding under the Credit Agreement, together with the outstanding principal balance of our 4.000 Senior Notes due 2029 (the 2029 Senior Notes and our 8.750 Senior Notes due 2028 (the 2028 Senior Notes ), may not exceed the borrowing base under the Credit Agreement. The borrowing base primarily consists of a percentage of commercial land, land held for development, lots under development and finished lots held by the Company and its subsidiaries that guarantee the obligations under the Credit Agreement. As of September 30, 2024, the borrowing base under the 2023 Credit Agreement was 2.0 billion, of which the maximum available to borrow is 1.9 billion. As of September 30, 2024, borrowings under the 2023 Credit Agreement and the outstanding principal amount of the 2029 Senior Notes and the 2028 Senior Notes totaled approximately 1.6 billion, 26.1 million of letters of credit were outstanding and 314.5 million was available to borrow under the 2023 Credit Agreement. 
 Borrowings under the Credit Agreement bear interest, payable monthly in arrears, at the Company s option, at either (1) the Adjusted Term SOFR (defined as a term SOFR that is based on a fixed 1, 3 or 6 month interest period, as selected by the Company, plus a 10, 15 or 25 basis point adjustment, respectively), which rate is subject to a 50 basis point floor, plus an applicable margin ranging from 145 basis points to 210 basis points (the Applicable Margin based on the Company s leverage ratio as determined in accordance with a pricing grid, or (2) the Base Rate (defined as a term SOFR that is based on a daily variable 1 month interest period plus a 10 basis point adjustment), subject to a 50 basis point floor, plus the Applicable Margin. At September 30, 2024, the Applicable Margin was 1.85 , and SOFR was 4.85 , subject to the 0.50 SOFR floor as included in the 2023 Credit Agreement. 
 The Credit Agreement contains various financial covenants, including a minimum tangible net worth, a leverage ratio, a minimum liquidity amount and an EBITDA to interest expense ratio. The Credit Agreement contains various covenants that, among other restrictions, limit the amount of our additional debt and our ability to make certain investments. At September 30, 2024, we were in compliance with all of the covenants contained in the 2023 Credit Agreement. 
 Senior Notes Offering 
 On November 21, 2023, we issued 400.0 million aggregate principal amount of the 2028 Senior Notes in an offering to persons reasonably believed to be qualified institutional buyers in the United States pursuant to Rule 144A Rule 144A under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the Securities Act ), and to certain non-U.S. persons in transactions outside the United States pursuant to Regulation S Regulation S under the Securities Act. Interest on the 2028 Senior Notes accrues at a rate of 8.750 per annum, payable semi-annually in arrears on June 15 and December 15 of each year. The 2028 Senior Notes mature on December 15, 2028. The terms of the 2028 Senior Notes are governed by an Indenture, dated as of July 6, 2018, and

 On June 28, 2021, we issued 300.0 million aggregate principal amount of the 2029 Senior Notes in an offering to persons reasonably believed to be qualified institutional buyers in the United States pursuant to Rule 144A and to certain non-U.S. persons in transactions outside the United States pursuant to Regulation S. Interest on the 2029 Senior Notes accrues at a rate of 4.000 per annum, payable semi-annually in arrears on January 15 and July 15 of each year. The 2029 Senior Notes mature on July 15, 2029. The terms of the 2029 Senior Notes are governed by an Indenture, dated as of July 6, 2018, and Third Supplemental Indenture thereto, dated as of June 28, 2021, as may be supplemented from time to time, among us, our subsidiaries that guarantee our obligations under the Credit Agreement and Wilmington Trust, National Association, as trustee. 
 Letters of Credit, Surety Bonds and Financial Guarantees 
 We are often required to provide letters of credit and surety bonds to secure our performance under construction contracts, development agreements and other arrangements. The amount of such obligations outstanding at any time varies in accordance with our pending development activities. In the event any such bonds or letters of credit are drawn upon, we would be obligated to reimburse the issuer of such bonds or letters of credit. 
 Under these letters of credit, surety bonds and financial guarantees, we are committed to perform certain development and construction activities and provide certain guarantees in the normal course of business. Outstanding letters of credit, surety bonds and financial guarantees under these arrangements totaled 376.3 million as of September 30, 2024. Although significant development and construction activities have been completed related to the improvements at these sites, the letters of credit and surety bonds are not generally released until all development and construction activities are completed. We do not believe that it is probable that any outstanding letters of credit, surety bonds or financial guarantees as of September 30, 2024 will be drawn upon. 
 Stock Repurchase Program 
 In February 2022, our Board of Directors (the Board approved a 200.0 million increase to our previously authorized stock repurchase program, pursuant to which we may purchase up to 550.0 million of shares of our common stock through open market transactions, privately negotiated transactions or otherwise in accordance with applicable laws. During the three months ended September 30, 2024, we did not repurchase any shares of our common stock. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we repurchased 172,990 shares of our common stock for 18.0 million to be held as treasury stock. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, we did not repurchase any shares of our common stock. A total of 3,112,462 shares of our common stock has been repurchased since our stock repurchase program commenced. As of September 30, 2024, we may purchase up to 193.5 million of shares of our common stock under our stock repurchase program. The timing, amount and other terms and conditions of any repurchases of shares of our common stock under our stock repurchase program will be determined by our management at its discretion based on a variety of factors, including the market price of our common stock, corporate considerations, general market and economic conditions and legal requirements. Our stock repurchase program may be modified, discontinued or suspended at any time. 
 Cash Flows 
 Operating Activities 
 Net cash used in operating activities was 200.7 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. The primary drivers of operating cash flows are typically cash earnings and changes in inventory levels, including land acquisition and development. Net cash used in operating activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily driven by cash outflow from the 390.9 million decrease in the net change in real estate inventory, which was primarily related to our homes under construction and land acquisitions and development level of activity and partially offset by net income of 145.2 million. 
 Net cash used in operating activities was 22.7 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The primary drivers of operating cash flows are typically cash earnings and changes in inventory levels, including land acquisition and development. Net cash used in operating activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2023 was primarily driven by cash outflow from the 194.4 million increase in the net change in real estate inventory, which was primarily related to our homes under construction and land acquisitions and development level of activity and partially offset by net income of 147.1 million.

 Inflation 
 Our business can be adversely impacted by inflation, primarily from higher land, financing, labor, material and construction costs. In addition, inflation can lead to higher mortgage rates, which can significantly affect the affordability of mortgage financing to homebuyers. See Industry and Economic Risks Inflation could adversely affect our business and financial results in Item 1A. Risk Factors in Part I of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023. 
 Material Cash Requirements 
 As of September 30, 2024, there have been no material changes to our known contractual and other obligations appearing in the Material Cash Requirements section of Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023. 
 
 Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 
 The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. Management bases its estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. On an ongoing basis, management evaluates such estimates and judgments and makes adjustments as deemed necessary. Actual results could differ from these estimates using different estimates and assumptions, or if conditions are significantly different in the future. 
 We believe that there have been no significant changes to our critical accounting policies and estimates during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to those disclosed in Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023.

 You should not place undue reliance on forward-looking statements. Each forward-looking statement speaks only as of the date of the particular statement. We expressly disclaim any intent, obligation or undertaking to update or revise any forward-looking statements to reflect any change in our expectations with regard thereto or any change in events, conditions or circumstances on which any such statements are based. All subsequent written and oral forward-looking statements attributable to us or persons acting on our behalf are expressly qualified in their entirety by the cautionary statements contained in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. 
 
 ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 
 Our operations are interest rate sensitive. As overall housing demand is adversely affected by increases in interest rates, a significant increase in mortgage rates may negatively affect the ability of homebuyers to secure adequate financing. Higher interest rates could adversely affect our revenues, gross margin and net income. 
 Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Interest Rate Risk 
 We utilize both fixed-rate debt 300.0 million aggregate principal amount of the 2029 Senior Notes, 400.0 million aggregate principal amount of the 2028 Senior Notes and certain inventory related obligations) and variable-rate debt (our 1.205 billion Credit Agreement) as part of financing our operations. We do not have the obligation to prepay the 2029 Senior Notes, the 2028 Senior Notes or our fixed-rate inventory related obligations prior to maturity, and, as a result, interest rate risk and changes in fair market value should not have a significant impact on our fixed-rate debt. 
 We are exposed to market risks related to fluctuations in interest rates on our outstanding variable rate indebtedness. We currently do not hold derivatives for trading or speculative purposes, but we may do so in the future. Many of the statements contained in this section are forward looking and should be read in conjunction with our disclosures under the heading Cautionary Statement about Forward-Looking Statements above. 
 As of September 30, 2024, we had 863.3 million of variable rate indebtedness outstanding under the 2023 Credit Agreement. All of the outstanding borrowings under the Credit Agreement are (and, as of September 30, 2024, all of the outstanding borrowings under the 2023 Credit Agreement were) at variable rates based on SOFR. The interest rate for our variable rate indebtedness as of September 30, 2024 was SOFR plus 1.85 . At September 30, 2024, SOFR was 4.85 , subject to the 0.50 SOFR floor as included in the 2023 Credit Agreement. A hypothetical 100 basis point increase in the average interest rate above the SOFR floor on our variable rate indebtedness would increase our annual interest cost by approximately 8.6 million. 
 Based on the current interest rate management policies we have in place with respect to our outstanding indebtedness, we do not believe that the future interest rate risks related to our existing indebtedness will have a material adverse impact on our financial position, results of operations or liquidity. 
 
 ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 
 Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 Under the supervision and with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, management has evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) or 15d-15(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act )) as of September 30, 2024. Based upon that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures are effective to ensure information is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission s rules and forms and is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 
 Our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, does not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures will prevent all errors and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, have been detected. These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error and mistake. Additionally, controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people or by management s override of controls. 
 The design of any system of controls also is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions. 
 37 

Table of Contents 

 Over time, a control may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or because the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. Because of the inherent limitations in a cost-effective control system, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and may not be detected. 
 Changes in Internal Controls 
 No change in our internal control over financial reporting as such term is defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(f) occurred during the three months ended September 30, 2024 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
