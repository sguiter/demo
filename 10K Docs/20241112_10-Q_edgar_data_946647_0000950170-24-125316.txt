 September 30, 2024 and 2023 

, Premier and Wesbanco announced the signing of the definitive Merger Agreement under which Premier will merge into Wesbanco in a stock-for-stock transaction. Refer to Note 17. The Bank is primarily engaged in community banking. It attracts deposits from the general public through its offices and website, and uses those and other available sources of funds to originate residential real estate loans, commercial real estate loans, commercial loans, home improvement and home equity loans and consumer loans. In addition, the Bank invests in U.S. Treasury and federal government agency obligations, obligations of states and political subdivisions, mortgage-backed securities ("MBS") that are issued by federal agencies, collateralized mortgage obligations CMOs ), and corporate bonds. The Bank s deposits are insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation FDIC ). The Bank is a member of the Federal Home Loan Bank FHLB System. PFC Capital was formed as an Ohio limited liability company in 2016 for the purpose of providing mezzanine funding for customers. Mezzanine loans are offered by PFC Capital to customers in the Company s market area and are expected to be repaid from the cash flow from operations of the business. First Insurance Group of the Midwest, Inc. ("First Insurance") is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Premier that conducted business as an insurance agency throughout Premier s markets. First Insurance offered property and casualty insurance, life insurance and group health insurance. On June 30, 2023, the Company completed the sale of substantially all of the assets (including million of goodwill and intangibles) of First Insurance to Risk Strategies Corporation Buyer ). Consideration included a combination of cash and a subordinated note resulting in net cash received of million after certain transaction costs at closing, the assumption of certain leases, and contingent consideration subject to certain performance criteria by the Buyer to be determined after the year ended December 31, 2026. The Company recorded a pre-tax gain on sale of million, transaction costs of million and taxes of million for a million increase to equity in 2023. The Company tests goodwill at least annually and, more frequently, if events or changes in circumstances indicate that it may be more likely than not that there is a possible impairment. Due to the Company s signing of the definitive agreement for the merger transaction with Wesbanco, the Company conducted a quantitative interim goodwill impairment assessment at September 30, 2024. The impairment assessment compares the fair value of identified reporting unit with their carrying amount (including goodwill). If the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to the excess. The Company's interim assessment estimated fair value on income and market approaches. The income approach incorporated a discounted cash flow model that involves management assumptions and consideration of future economic forecasts available. The market approach incorporates a combination of price to book value and price to earnings, adjusted based on companies similar to the reporting unit and adjusted for selected multiples, along with a control premium based on a review of transactions in the banking industry. Results of the interim assessment indicated

 to to account for other factors that may impact the value of collateral. In determining the value of individually analyzed collateral dependent loans and OREO, significant unobservable inputs may be used, which include but are not limited to physical condition of comparable properties sold, net operating income generated by the property and investor rates of return. Mortgage servicing rights On a quarterly basis, mortgage servicing rights are evaluated for impairment based upon the fair value of the rights as compared to the carrying amount. If the carrying amount of an individual tranche exceeds fair value, impairment is recorded on that tranche so that the servicing asset is carried at fair value. Fair value is determined at a tranche level based on a model that calculates the present value of estimated future net servicing income. The valuation model utilizes assumptions that market participants would use in estimating future net servicing income and are validated against available market data (Level 2). Mortgage banking derivative The fair value of mortgage banking derivatives is evaluated monthly based on derivative valuation models using quoted prices for similar assets adjusted for specific attributes of the commitments and other observable market data at the valuation date (Level 2). Interest rate swaps The Company periodically enters into interest rate swap agreements with its commercial customers who desire a fixed rate loan term that is longer than the Company is willing to extend. The Company then enters into a reciprocal swap agreement with a third party that offsets the interest rate risk from the interest rate swap extended to the customer. The interest rate swaps are derivative instruments which are carried at fair value on the statement of financial condition. The Company uses an independent third party to perform a market valuation analysis for both swap positions (Level 2).

As of September 30, 2024 , options to acquire Premier shares were outstanding at option prices based on the market value of the underlying shares on the date the options were granted. The fair value of each option award is estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes model. Expected volatilities are based on historical volatilities of the Company s common shares. The Company uses historical data to estimate option exercise and post-vesting termination behavior. The expected term of options granted is based on historical data and represents the period of time that options granted are expected to be outstanding, which takes into account that the options are not transferable. The risk-free interest rate for the expected term of the option is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of the grant. There were options granted during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023.

The Company had realized gains or losses from the sale of available-for-sale securities in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 , the Company had realized gains or losses and in realized gains, respectively, from the sale of investment securities. It is expected that the securities would not be settled at less than the amortized cost of the Company's investment because the decline in fair value is attributable to changes in interest rates and relative spreads and not credit quality. Management does not intend to sell these investments and it is not expected that the Company will be required to sell the investments before recovery of its amortized cost basis. Quarterly, the Company evaluates if any security has a fair value less than its amortized cost. Once these securities are identified, in order to determine whether a decline in fair value resulted from a credit loss or other factors, the Company performs further analysis as outlined below: Review the extent to which the fair value is less than the amortized cost and observe the security s

 If the Company determines that a credit loss exists, the credit portion of the allowance will be measured using a DCF analysis using the effective interest rate as of the security s purchase date. The amount of credit loss the Company records will be limited to the amount by which the amortized cost exceeds the fair value. As of September 30, 2024, management determined that no credit loss exists and that the unrealized losses are due to the increased interest rate environment.

Loan Modifications As of January 1, 2023, the Company adopted the modified retrospective method under ASU 2022-02, "Troubled Debt Restructurings and Vintage Disclosures" which eliminated troubled debt restructuring accounting for entities that have adopted ASU 2016-13, the current expected credit losses model. Occasionally, the Company modifies loans by providing principal forgiveness on certain of its real estate loans. When principal forgiveness is provided, the amortized cost basis of the loan is written off against the allowance for credit losses. The amount of the principal forgiveness is deemed to be uncollectible; therefore, that portion of the loan is written off, resulting in a reduction of amortized cost basis and a corresponding adjustments to the allowance for credit losses. In some cases, the Company will modify a certain loan by providing multiple types of concessions. Typically, one type of concession, such as a term extension, is granted initially. If the borrower continues to experience financial difficulty, another concession, such as principal forgiveness or reduction of rate, may be granted. Of the loans modified as of September 30, 2024 , million were on non-accrual status and partial charge-offs have in some cases been taken against the outstanding balance. The allowance for credit losses incorporates an estimate of lifetime expected credit losses and is recorded on each loan upon loan origination or acquisition. The starting point for the estimate of the allowance for credit losses is historical loss information, which includes losses from modifications of loans to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty. The Company uses probability of default/loss given default, discounted cash flows or remaining life method to determine the allowance for credit losses. An assessment of whether a borrower is experiencing financial difficulty is made on the date of a modification. Because the effect of most modifications made to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty is already included in the allowance for credit losses because of the measurement methodologies used to estimate the allowance, a change to the allowance for credit losses is generally not recorded upon modification.

 of the modified loans are current and modified loans pertaining to three commercial loan relationships are on nonaccrual status as of September 30, 2024. Credit Quality Indicators Loans are categorized into risk categories based on relevant information about the ability of borrowers to service their debt such as: current financial information, historical payment experience, credit documentation, public information, and current economic trends, among other factors. Loans are analyzed individually by classifying the loans by credit risk. This analysis includes all non-homogeneous loans, such as commercial and commercial real estate loans and certain homogeneous mortgages, home equity and consumer loans. This analysis is performed on a quarterly basis. Premier uses the following definitions for risk ratings: Special Mention. Loans classified as special mention have a potential weakness that deserves management s close attention. If left uncorrected, these potential weaknesses may result in deterioration of the repayment prospects for the loan or of the institution's credit position at some future date. Substandard. Loans classified as substandard are inadequately protected by the current net worth and paying capacity of the obligor or of the collateral pledged, if any. Loans so classified have a well-defined weakness or weaknesses that jeopardize the liquidation of the debt. They are characterized by the distinct possibility that the institution will sustain some loss if the deficiencies are not corrected. Doubtful. Loans classified as doubtful have all the weaknesses inherent in those classified as substandard, with the added characteristic that the weaknesses make collection or liquidation in full, on the basis of currently existing facts, conditions, and values, highly questionable and improbable. Loans not meeting the criteria above that are analyzed individually as part of the above described process are considered to be pass rated loans.

According to the accounting standard, an entity may make an accounting policy election not to measure an ACL for accrued interest receivable if the entity writes off the applicable accrued interest receivable balance in a timely manner. The Company has made the accounting policy election not to measure an ACL for accrued interest receivables for all loan segments. In addition, ASC Topic 326 requires the Company to establish a liability for anticipated credit losses for unfunded commitments. To accomplish this, the Company must first establish a loss expectation for extended (funded) commitments. This loss expectation, expressed as a ratio to the amortized cost basis, is then applied to the portion of unfunded commitments not considered unilaterally cancelable and is considered by the Company s management as likely to fund over the life of the instrument. At September 30, 2024 , the Company had billion in unfunded commitments and set aside million in anticipated credit losses. This reserve is recorded in other liabilities as opposed to the ACL. The determination of ACL is complex and the Company makes decisions on the effects of matters that are inherently uncertain. Evaluations of the loan portfolio and individual credits require certain estimates, assumptions and judgments as to the facts and circumstances related to particular situations or credits. There may be significant changes in the ACL in future periods determined by prevailing factors at that point in time along with future forecasts.

Purchased Credit Deteriorated Loans Under ASU Topic 326, when loans are purchased with evidence of more than insignificant deterioration of credit, they are accounted for as PCD. PCD loans acquired in a transaction are marked to fair value and a mark on yield is recorded. In addition, an adjustment is made to the ACL for the expected loss on the acquisition date. These loans are assessed on a regular basis and subsequent adjustments to the ACL are recorded on the income statement.

Interest Rate Swaps The Company maintains an interest rate protection program for commercial loan customers. Under this program, the Company provides a customer with a fixed rate loan while creating a variable rate asset for the Company by the customer entering into an interest rate swap with terms that match the loan. The Company offsets its risk exposure by entering into an offsetting interest rate swap with an unaffiliated institution. The Company had interest rate swaps associated with commercial loans with a notional value o f m illion and fair value of million in other assets and million in other liabilities at September 30, 2024. As of December 31, 2023, the Company had interest rate swaps associated with commercial loans with a notional value of million and fair value of million in other assets and million in other liabilities.

Interest Rate Swaps Designated as Cash Flow Hedge and Fair Value Hedge In May 2021, the Company entered into derivative instruments designated as a cash flow hedge. In June 2023, the Company entered into derivative instruments designated as a fair value hedge and another designated as a cash flow hedge. For a derivative instrument that is designated and qualifies as a cash flow hedge, the change in fair value of the derivative instrument is reported as a component of other comprehensive income (loss) and reclassified into earnings in the same period or periods during which the hedged transaction affects earnings. For a derivative instrument that is designated and qualified as a fair value hedge, the change in fair value is recorded to the hedged item and reclassified into earnings in the same period or periods during which the hedged transaction affects earnings. An interest rate swap with notional amount totaling million as of September 30, 2024 was designated as a cash flow hedge to hedge the risk of variability in cash flows (future interest receipts) attributable to changes in the contractually specified SOFR benchmark interest rate on the Company s floating rate loan pool. The gross aggregate fair value of the swap of million is recorded in other liabilities in the unaudited Consolidated Balance Sheets at September 30, 2024, with changes in fair value recorded net of tax in other comprehensive income (loss).

 Non-GAAP Financial Measures 
 In addition to results presented in accordance with GAAP, this report includes non-GAAP financial measures. The Company believes these non-GAAP financial measures provide additional information that is 
 46 

Table of Contents 

 useful to investors in helping to understand the underlying performance and trends of the Company. The Company monitors the non-GAAP financial measures and the Company s management believes they are helpful to investors because they provide an additional tool to use in evaluating the Company s financial and business trends and operating results. In addition, the Company s management uses these non-GAAP measures to compare the Company s performance to that of prior periods for trend analysis and for budgeting and planning purposes. Fully taxable-equivalent FTE is an adjustment to net interest income to reflect tax-exempt income on an equivalent before-tax basis. 
 Non-GAAP financial measures have inherent limitations, which are not required to be uniformly applied and are not audited. Readers should be aware of these limitations and should be cautious with respect to the use of such measures. To mitigate these limitations, the Company has practices in place to ensure that these measures are calculated using the appropriate GAAP or regulatory components in their entirety and to ensure that our performance is properly reflected to facilitate consistent period-to-period comparisons. The Company s method of calculating these non-GAAP measures may differ from methods used by other companies. Although the Company believes the non-GAAP financial measures disclosed in this report enhance investors' understanding of our business and performance, these non-GAAP measures should not be considered in isolation, or as a substitute for those financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. 
 The following tables present a reconciliation of non-GAAP measures to their respective GAAP measures for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023.

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 
 Premier has established various accounting policies that govern the application of GAAP in the preparation of its consolidated condensed financial statements. Certain accounting estimates involve significant judgments and assumptions by management, which have a material impact on the carrying value of certain assets and liabilities and management considers such estimates to be critical accounting policies. The judgments and assumptions used by management are based on historical experience and other factors, which are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. Because of the nature of the judgments and assumptions made by management, actual results could differ from these judgments and estimates, which could have a material impact on the carrying value of assets and liabilities and the results of operations of Premier.

 The Company tests goodwill at least annually and, more frequently, if events or changes in circumstances indicate that it may be more likely than not that there is a possible impairment. Due to the Company s signing of the definitive agreement for the merger transaction with Wesbanco, the Company conducted a quantitative interim goodwill impairment assessment at September 30, 2024. The impairment assessment compares the fair value of identified reporting unit with their carrying amount (including goodwill). If the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to the excess. The Company's interim assessment estimated fair value on income and market approaches. The income approach incorporated a discounted cash flow model that involves management assumptions and consideration of future economic forecasts available. The market approach incorporated a combination of price to book value and price to earnings, adjusted based on companies similar to the reporting unit and adjusted for selected multiples, along with a control premium based on a review of transactions in the banking industry. Significant assumptions in the assessments were employed and included, but were not limited to, prospective financial information, growth rates, terminal value, discount rates, control premiums and comparable multiples from publicly traded companies in our industry. Results of the interim assessment was a fair value of approximately 1.2 billion compared to a carrying amount of approximately 1.0 billion indicating no goodwill impairment as of September 30, 2024. Changes in the economic environment, operations of the reporting unit or other adverse events could result in goodwill impairment as a result of a future evaluation. 
 
 Premier has core deposit and other intangible assets resulting from acquisitions which are subject to amortization. Premier determines the amount of identifiable intangible assets based upon independent core deposit and customer relationship analyses at the time of the acquisition. Intangible assets with finite useful lives are evaluated for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying amount may not be recoverable. No events or changes in circumstances that would indicate that the carrying amount of any identifiable intangible assets may not be recoverable had occurred during the three months ended September 30, 2024.

 Regulation The Company is subject to regulation, examination and oversight by the Federal Reserve Board Federal Reserve and the SEC. The Bank is subject to regulation, examination and oversight by the FDIC and the Division of Financial Institutions of the Ohio Department of Commerce ("ODFI").

 Changes in Financial Condition 
 The Company's total assets increased 103.4 million, totaling 8.7 billion at September 30, 2024 compared to 8.6 billion at December 31, 2023. The increase is primarily attributable to an increase in securities, partially offset by a decline in loans. The increase in securities was funded by increases in advances from the FHLB. 
 Net loans decreased 150.3 million to 6.5 billion at September 30, 2024 compared to 6.7 billion at December 31, 2023. The following table sets forth the composition of the Company's loan portfolio by type of loan at the dates indicated.

(1) Interest on certain tax-exempt loans and securities is not taxable for federal income tax purposes. In order to compare the tax-exempt yields on these assets to taxable yields, the interest earned on these assets is adjusted to a pre-tax equivalent amount based on the marginal corporate federal income tax rate of 21 . 

(2) Annualized 

(3) Net interest margin is net interest income divided by average interest-earning assets. See Non-GAAP Financial Measure discussion for further details. 

Results of Operations 
 Three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 
 For the three months ended September 30, 2024, the Company reported net income of 16.7 million compared to net income of 24.7 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. On a per share basis, basic and diluted earnings per common share were 0.46 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and basic and diluted earnings per common share were 0.69 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease from 2023 to 2024 is primarily due to fluctuations in net interest income, mortgage banking income and transaction costs, which are described in further detail below.

 Net Interest Income 
 The Company s net interest income is determined by its interest rate spread (i.e. the difference between the yields on its interest-earning assets and the rates paid on its interest-bearing liabilities) and the relative amounts of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities. 
 Net interest income was 50.2 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2024, down from 54.3 million for the same period in 2023. Average earning assets for the quarter ended September 30, 2024 were 8.0 billion the same as the quarter ended September 30, 2023. The tax-equivalent net interest margin was 2.50 for the quarter ended September 30, 2024, a decrease of 23 basis points from 2.73 for the same period in 2023. The decrease in margin between the 2024 and 2023 quarters was primarily due to funding cost increasing at a faster pace than the Company earned on assets. The yield on interest-earning assets increased 22 basis points to 4.99 for the quarter ended September 30, 2024 compared to 4.77 for the same period in 2023. The cost of interest-bearing liabilities between the two periods increased 52 basis points to 3.26 in the third quarter of 2024 from 2.74 in the third quarter of 2023. 
 Interest income increased 5.3 million to 100.2 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2024, from 94.9 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2023. This increase is primarily due to an increase in the yield on loans and securities. Income from loans increased to 88.9 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2024, compared to 86.6 million for the same period in 2023. Average loan balances declined to 6.7 billion for the three months ended September 30, 2024 from 6.8 billion for the third quarter of 2023, but the yield on loans increased 21 basis points in the third quarter of 2024 to 5.33 compared to 5.12 in the third quarter of 2023. Interest income from investments increased 3.0 million to 10.0 million in the third quarter of 2024 compared to 7.0 million for the same period in 2023. This is primarily due to an increase in the yield on securities of 65 basis points to 3.11 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 2.46 for the same period in 2023, and an increase in average balance of 155.7 million. Income from interest-earning deposits increased slightly to 654,000 in the third quarter of 2024 compared to 652,000 for the same period in 2023. Income from FHLB stock dividends decreased to 595,000 in the third quarter of 2024 compared to 690,000 in the same quarter of 2023 as a result of a decrease in average FHLB stock balances of 3.7 million. 
 Interest expense increased 9.4 million to 50.0 million in the third quarter of 2024 compared to 40.6 million for the same period in 2023. An increase in the cost of interest-bearing liabilities of 52 basis points is the primary reason for this change. Interest expense related to interest-bearing deposits was 45.5 million in the third quarter of 2024 compared to 34.9 million for the same period in 2023. Interest expense recognized by the Company related to FHLB advances was 3.3 million in the third quarter of 2024 compared to 4.6 million for the same period in 2023 due to a decrease in average balances of 89.3 million when comparing the third quarter of 2024 to the same quarter in 2023. Expenses on subordinated debentures remained steady at 1.2 million in the third quarter of 2024 compared to the same period in 2023. 
 Allowance for Credit Losses 
 The ACL represents management s assessment of the estimated credit losses the Company will receive over the life of the loan. ACL requires a projection of credit losses over the contract lifetime of the credit adjusted for prepayment tendencies. Management analyzes the adequacy of the ACL regularly through reviews of the loan portfolio. Consideration is given to economic conditions, changes in interest rates and the effect of such changes on collateral values and borrower s ability to pay, changes in the composition of the loan portfolio and trends in past due and non-performing loan balances. The ACL is a material estimate that is susceptible to significant fluctuation and is established through a provision for credit losses based on management s evaluation of the inherent risk in the loan portfolio. In addition to extensive in-house loan monitoring procedures, the Company utilizes an outside party to conduct an independent loan review of commercial loan and commercial real estate loan relationships. The Company s goal is to have 45-50 of the portfolio reviewed annually using a risk based approach. Management utilizes the results of this outside loan review to assess the effectiveness of its internal

 loan grading system as well as to assist in the assessment of the overall adequacy of the ACL associated with these types of loans. 
 The ACL is made up of two basic components. The first component of the ACL is the specific reserve in which the Company sets aside reserves based on the analysis of individual analyzed credits. In establishing specific reserves, the Company analyzes all substandard, doubtful and loss graded loans quarterly and makes judgments about the risk of loss based on the cash flow of the borrower, the value of any collateral and the financial strength of any guarantors. If the loan is individually analyzed and cash flow dependent, then a specific reserve is established for the discount on the net present value of expected future cash flows. If the loan is individually analyzed and collateral dependent, then any shortfall is either charged off or a specific reserve is established. The Company also considers the impacts of any Small Business Administration or Farm Service Agency guarantees. The specific reserve portion of the ACL was 13.8 million as of September 30, 2024, and 4.3 million as of December 31, 2023. 
 The second component is a general reserve, which is used to record credit loss reserves for groups of homogeneous loans in which the Company estimates the potential losses over the contractual lifetime of the loan adjusted for prepayment tendencies. In addition, the future economic environment is incorporated in projection with loss expectations to revert to the long-run historical mean after such time as management can no longer make or obtain a reasonable and supportable forecast. For purposes of the general reserve analysis, the six loan portfolio segments are further segregated into fifteen different loan pools to allocate the ACL. Residential real estate is further segregated into owner occupied and nonowner occupied for ACL. Commercial real estate is split into owner occupied, nonowner occupied, multifamily, agriculture land and other commercial real estate. Commercial credits are comprised of commercial working capital, agriculture production and other commercial credits. Construction is broken out into construction other and residential construction and consumer is broken out into consumer direct, consumer indirect and home equity. The Company utilizes three different methodologies to analyze loan pools. 
 The DCF methodology was selected as the appropriate method for loan segments with longer average lives and regular payment structures. This method is applied to a majority of the Company s real estate loans. DCF generates cash flow projections at the instrument level where payment expectations are adjusted for prepayment and curtailment to produce an expected cash flow stream that is net of estimated credit losses. This expected cash flow stream is compared to the contractual cash flows to establish a valuation account for these loans. 
 The PD/LGD methodology was selected as most appropriate for loan segments with average lives of three years or less and/or irregular payment structures. This methodology was used for home equity and commercial portfolios. A loan is considered to default if one of the following is detected: 
 Becomes 90 days or more past due; 

Is placed on nonaccrual; 

Is marked as a modification; or 

Is partially or wholly charged-off. 

The default rate is measured on the current life of the loan segment using a weighted average of the maximum possible quarters. The PD is then combined with a LGD derived from historical charge-off data to construct a default rate. This loss rate is then supplemented with adjustments for reasonable and supportable forecasts of relevant economic indicators, particularly the unemployment rate forecast from the Federal Open Market Committee's Summary of Economic Projections. LGD is determined on a dollar-ratio basis, measuring the ratio of net charged off principal to defaulted principal. 
 54 

Table of Contents 

 The consumer portfolio contains loans with many different payment structures, payment streams and collateral. The remaining life method was deemed most appropriate for consumer direct loans and DCF for consumer indirect. The weighted average remaining life uses an annual charge-off rate over several vintages to estimate credit losses. The average annual charge-off rate is applied to the contractual term adjusted for prepayments. The DCF method was selected for consumer indirect due to the loan segments' longer average remaining life in addition to regular payment structure. 
 Additionally, CECL requires a reasonable and supportable forecast when establishing the ACL. The Company estimates losses over an approximate one-year forecast period using Moody s baseline economic forecasts, and then reverts to longer term historical loss experience over a three-year period. 
 The quantitative general allowance increased to 31.2 million at September 30, 2024, up from 28.1 million at December 31, 2023. As a part of the CECL model in certain calculations, especially DCF, projected loan losses are correlated to the levels of the unemployment rate over the life of the loans in addition to the fluctuation of loan balances. The increase in the quantitative general allowance during 2024 is attributed to changes in prepayment speeds, unemployment forecasts, risk migration and loss rates. 
 In addition to the quantitative analysis, a qualitative analysis is performed each quarter to provide additional general reserves on loan portfolios that are not individually analyzed for various factors. The overall qualitative factors are based on nine sub-factors. The nine sub-factors have been aggregated into three qualitative factors: economic, environment and risk. 
 ECONOMIC 
 1) Changes in international, national and local economic business conditions and developments, including the condition of various market segments. 

2) Changes in the value of underlying collateral for collateral dependent loans. 

ENVIRONMENT 
 3) Changes in the nature and volume in the loan portfolio. 

4) The existence and effect of any concentrations of credit and changes in the level of such concentrations. 

5) Changes in lending policies and procedures, including underwriting standards and collection, charge-off and recovery practices. 

6) Changes in the quality and breadth of the loan review process. 

7) Changes in the experience, ability and depth of lending management and staff. 

RISK 
 8) Changes in the trends of the volume and severity of delinquent and classified loans, and changes in the volume of non-accrual loans and other loan modifications. 

9) Changes in other external factors, such as regulatory, legal and technological environments. 

The qualitative analysis indicated a general reserve of 31.0 million at September 30, 2024, compared to 44.1 million at December 31, 2023. Overall, the factors decreased in the third quarter as a result of the twelve month trend showing improvement in the economic and environmental factors listed above, which offset the increase in nonaccrual loans that negatively impacted the qualitative reserves.

 The Company s general reserve percentages for main loan segments, not otherwise classified, ranged from 0.384 for construction other loans to 1.321 for CRE owner occupied loans at September 30, 2024. 
 Under ASU Topic 326, when loans are purchased with evidence of more than insignificant deterioration of credit, they are accounted for as PCD. PCD loans acquired in a transaction are marked to fair value and a mark on yield is recorded. In addition, an adjustment is made to the ACL for the expected loss through retained earnings on the acquisition date. These loans are assessed on a regular basis and subsequent adjustments to the ACL are recorded on the income statement. The outstanding balance and related allowance on these loans as of September 30, 2024 is 12.5 million and 211,000, respectively. 
 As a result of the quantitative and qualitative analyses, along with the change in specific reserves and the change in net charge-offs in the quarter, the Company s provision for credit losses for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 was a reduction in expense of 475,000 and an expense of 3.3 million, respectively. This is compared to an expense of 245,000 and 5.6 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively. The ACL was 76.1 million at September 30, 2024 and 76.5 million at December 31, 2023. The ACL represented 1.16 of loans, net of undisbursed loan funds and deferred fees and costs at September 30, 2024, compared to 1.14 at December 31, 2023. In management s opinion, the overall ACL of 76.1 million as of September 30, 2024 is adequate to cover current estimated credit losses. 
 Management also assesses the value of OREO as of the end of each accounting period and recognizes write-downs to the value of that real estate in the income statement if conditions dictate. In the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, total write-downs of real estate held for sale and other repossessed assets were 62,000 and 135,000, respectively. Management believes that the values recorded at September 30, 2024 for OREO and repossessed assets represent the realizable value of such assets. 
 Total classified loans increased to 120.2 million at September 30, 2024, compared to 69.7 million at December 31, 2023, an increase of 50.6 million, primarily due to two commercial relationships, one which is still accruing and the other which was placed on nonaccrual. Management monitors collateral values of all loans included on the watch list that are collateral dependent and believes that allowances for such loans at September 30, 2024 were appropriate. Of the 82.0 million in non-accrual loans at September 30, 2024, 49.5 million, or 60.4 , are less than 90 days past due. Non-performing assets include loans that are on non-accrual, OREO and other assets held for sale. Non-performing assets at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 by category, were as follows:

 Non-Interest Income 
 Total non-interest income was 12.6 million in the third quarter of 2024 compared to 13.3 million for the same period in 2023. The decrease is primarily a result of a decrease in mortgage banking income. 
 Service Fees. Service fees and other charges decreased by 809,000 from 6.9 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023 to 7.8 million for the same period in 2024. 
 Mortgage Banking Activity. In the third quarter of 2024, income of 1.2 million was recorded for mortgage banking compared to income of 3.3 million in the third quarter of 2023. Mortgage banking gains decreased 2.0 million to a gain of 691,000 in the third quarter of 2024 from a gain of 2.6 million in the third quarter of 2023, primarily as a result of fluctuations in gain margins and an aged loans portfolio sale in 2024. Mortgage loan servicing revenue was relatively flat at 1.8 million in the third quarter of 2024 compared to 1.9 million in the same period in 2023. Amortization of mortgage servicing rights remained steady at 1.3 million in the third quarter of 2024 and 2023. The valuation adjustment in mortgage servicing assets was a decrease of 16,000 in the third quarter of 2024 compared with an adjustment of 131,000 in the third quarter of 2023. These fluctuations have primarily resulted from changes in the level of interest rates and prepayment speeds. 
 Gain (loss) on Equity Securities. The Company recognized a gain on equity securities of 410,000 for the third quarter of 2024, compared to a gain of 256,000 for the third quarter of 2023. This is attributable to changes in valuations in the equity securities portfolio as a result of market conditions. 
 Insurance Commissions . As a result of the sale of First Insurance, the Company did not generate insurance commission income after June 30, 2023.

Table of Contents 

 Net Interest Income 
 Net interest income was 149.0 million for the first nine months of 2024 compared to 164.5 million in the first nine months of 2023. Average interest-earning assets increased to 8.0 billion in the first nine months of 2024 compared to 7.9 billion in the first nine months of 2023. This increase was primarily due to organic loan growth and an increase in average securities. 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, total interest income was 295.0 million compared to 269.2 million for the same period in 2023. Interest expense increased by 41.3 million to 146.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 104.7 million for the same period in 2023. 
 Net interest margin for the first nine months of 2024 was 2.49 , down 29 basis points from the 2.78 margin reported for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease in net interest margin was primarily due the increase in rates on interest-bearing liabilities outpacing the increases in repricing of interest-bearing assets. 
 Provision for Credit Losses 
 The provision for credit losses on loans and unfunded commitments was 2.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 3.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Charge-offs for the first nine months of 2024 were 4.6 million and recoveries of previously charged off loans totaled 978,000 for net charge-offs of 3.6 million. By comparison, 4.1 million of charge-offs were recorded in the same period of 2023 and 2.2 million of recoveries were realized for net charge-offs of 1.9 million. 
 Non-Interest Income 
 Total non-interest income decreased 41.9 million to 37.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from 79.1 million recognized for the same period in 2023, primarily as a result of the sale of First Insurance on June 30, 2023. 
 Service Fees. Service fees and other charges were 21.2 million for the first nine months of 2024, an increase of 667,000 from the same period in 2023. 
 Mortgage Banking Activity. Total revenue from the sale and servicing of mortgage loans decreased 349,000 to 5.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, up from 5.9 million for the same period in 2023, which was primarily attributable to a decline in gains due to margins. Mortgage banking gains decreased 637,000 to 3.4 million for the first nine months of 2024 from 4.0 million for the same period in 2023. Mortgage loan servicing revenue decreased slightly to 5.5 million in the first nine months of 2024compared to 5.6 million for the same period in 2023. The amortization of mortgage servicing rights were relatively flat with an expense of 3.8 million for the first nine months of 2023 to an expense of 3.9 million for the first nine months of 2024. The Company recorded a positive valuation adjustment of 594,000 in the first nine months of 2024 compared to a positive adjustment of 155,000 in the first nine months of 2023. 
 Gain on Sale of Insurance Agency. The Company sold First Insurance to Risk Strategies Corporation in the second quarter of 2023 and recognized a gain on the sale of 36.3 million. 
 Gain (loss) on Equity Securities. The Company recognized a gain on equity securities of 197,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to a loss of 1.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. These amounts are attributable to changes in valuations in the equity securities portfolio as a result of market conditions. 
 Insurance Commission Income. Income from the sale of insurance was 8.9 million in the first nine months of 2023. As a result of the sale of First Insurance, the Company did not generate insurance commission income after June 30, 2023.

 Other Non-Interest Expenses . Other non-interest expenses decreased 1.4 million to 16.3 million for the first nine months of 2024 from 17.7 million for the same period in 2023. 
 Liquidity 
 As a regulated financial institution, the Company is required to maintain appropriate levels of liquid assets to meet short-term funding requirements. The Company s liquidity, primarily represented by cash and cash equivalents, is a result of its operating, investing and financing activities. 
 The principal source of funds for the Company are deposits, loan repayments, maturities of securities, borrowings from financial institutions and other funds provided by operations. The Bank also has the ability to borrow from the FHLB. While scheduled loan repayments and maturing investments are relatively predictable, deposit flows and early loan repayments are more influenced by interest rates, general economic conditions and competition. Investments in liquid assets maintained by the Company and the Bank are based upon management s assessment of (i) the need for funds, (ii) expected deposit flows, (iii) yields available on short-term liquid assets, and (iv) objectives of the asset and liability management program. 
 The Bank s Asset/Liability Committee ALCO is responsible for establishing and monitoring liquidity guidelines, policies and procedures. ALCO uses a variety of methods to monitor the liquidity position of the Bank including liquidity analyses that measure potential sources and uses of funds over future periods out to one year. ALCO also performs contingency funding analyses to determine the Bank s ability to meet potential liquidity needs under stress scenarios that cover varying time horizons ranging from immediate to longer term. 
 62 

Table of Contents 

 At September 30, 2024, the Company had approximately 3.1 billion of liquidity, comprised of cash and cash equivalents, unencumbered securities, additional FHLB and lines of credit borrowing capacity, brokered deposits subject to policy limits and the Federal Reserve Discount Window through the Borrower-In-Custody collateral programs. 
 Liquidity risk arises from the possibility that the Company may not be able to meet its financial obligations and operating cash needs or may become overly reliant upon external funding sources. In order to manage this risk, the Company s Board of Directors has established a liquidity policy that identifies primary sources of liquidity, establishes procedures for monitoring and measuring liquidity and quantifies minimum liquidity requirements. This policy designates ALCO as the body responsible for meeting these objectives. ALCO reviews liquidity on a quarterly basis and approves significant changes in strategies that affect balance sheet or cash flow positions. Management reviews liquidity on a monthly basis. 
 Capital Resources 
 Capital is managed at the Bank and on a consolidated basis. Capital levels are maintained based on regulatory capital requirements and the economic capital required to support credit, market, liquidity and operational risks inherent in the business, as well as flexibility needed for future growth and new business opportunities. 
 In July 2013, the Federal Reserve and FDIC approved the final rules implementing the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision's capital guidelines for U.S. banks (commonly known as Basel III). The Company is in compliance with the Basel III guidelines.

 Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitati ve Disclosures About Market Risk 
 As discussed in detail in the Company s 2023 Form 10-K, the Company's ability to maximize net income is dependent on management s ability to plan and control net interest income through management of the pricing and mix of assets and liabilities. Because a large portion of assets and liabilities of the Company are monetary in

 nature, changes in interest rates and monetary or fiscal policy affect its financial condition and can have significant impact on the net income of the Company. 
 The Company monitors its exposure to interest rate risk on a quarterly basis through simulation analysis that measures the impact changes in interest rates can have on net interest income. The simulation technique analyzes the effect of a presumed 100 basis point shift in interest rates (which is consistent with management s estimate of the range of potential interest rate fluctuations) and takes into account prepayment speeds on amortizing financial instruments, loan and deposit volumes and rates, borrowings, derivative positions and non-maturity deposit assumptions (such as beta and decay rates) and capital requirements. This simulation analysis incorporates key assumptions which can have a material impact on results. Sensitivity testing of these assumptions are performed to provide ALCO with the understanding of how sensitivity results differ should actual results vary from those assumed. 
 Asset Prepayments: Prepayment assumptions are utilized for loan and investment portfolios and are the result of 3rd party model forecasts and/or historical studies. Generally, the constant prepayment rates assumed increase in lower rate scenarios and decrease in higher rate scenarios. 

Loan and Deposit Volumes and Rates: The simulation analysis assumes a static balance sheet with new asset and liability pricing assumptions determined by a review of recent production results per category. 

Deposit Beta: Dynamic deposit betas are assumed resulting from a 3rd party model incorporating historical experience and market rates to determine forecasted expectations. 

The table below presents, for the twelve months subsequent to September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, an estimate of the change in net interest income that would result from an immediate (shock) change in interest rates, moving in a parallel fashion over the entire yield curve, relative to the measured base case scenario. Based on our net interest income simulation as of September 30, 2024, net interest income sensitivity to changes in interest rates for the twelve months subsequent to September 30, 2024, increased in the rising rate environment and decreased in the falling rate environment for the shock compared to the sensitivity profile for the twelve months subsequent to December 31, 2023. The change in modeling results from the prior period shown is largely due to updated deposit beta assumptions used which decreased liability sensitivity for the period.

To analyze the impact of changes in interest rates in a more realistic manner, non-parallel interest rate scenarios are also simulated. These non-parallel interest rate scenarios indicate that net interest income may increase from the base case scenario should the yield curve change by different increments on different points on the curve. For example, in a steep down 200 basis points shock scenario where short-term rates (e.g., 1 year or less) decline while long-term rates (e.g., 7 years or more) remain generally unchanged, annual net interest income would increase by an estimated 10.91 for the twelve months subsequent to September 30, 2024.

 In addition to the simulation analysis, Premier also uses an economic value of equity EVE analysis to measure risk in the balance sheet incorporating all cash flows over the estimated remaining life of all balance sheet positions. The EVE analysis generally calculates the net present value of Premier s assets and liabilities in rate shock environments that range from -400 basis points to +400 basis points. This analysis also incorporates key assumptions which can have material impacts to modeled results and are consistent with the methodologies used in the net interest income sensitivity analysis. Deposit decay (or attrition) is a key assumption in EVE analysis and is the result of the same dynamic model used to generate deposit beta assumptions. The results of this analysis are reflected in the following table for the quarter ended September 30, 2024, and the year ended December 31, 2023.

Item 4. Controls and Procedures 
 An evaluation of the Company's disclosure controls and procedures was carried out under the supervision and with the participation of the Company s management, including the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the Company s disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) as of September 30, 2024. Based upon that evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that, as of September 30, 2024, the Company s disclosure controls and procedures were effective. No changes occurred in the Company s internal controls over financial reporting in connection with the evaluation required by Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) during the quarter ended September 30, 2024, that materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company s internal control over financial reporting. 
 PART II-OTHER INFORMATION 
 Item 1. Legal Proceedings 
 Premier and its subsidiaries are involved in various legal proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of its business. While the ultimate liability with respect to litigation matters and claims cannot be determined at this time, management believes any resulting liability and other amounts relating to pending matters, individually or in the aggregate, are not likely to be material to the Company s consolidated financial position or results of operations. 
 Item 1A. Ris k Factors 
 	The following revised risk factors supplement, and should be read in conjunction with, the risk factors disclosed in the 2023 Form 10-K. Any of the risks described in 2023 Form 10-K, as well as the risk described below, could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Additional risks and uncertainties that are not presently known to us or that we deem immaterial may also adversely impact 
 66 

Table of Contents 

 our business or financial results. Except as set forth below, there are no material changes related to risk factors from the risk factors described in Item 1A of the 2023 Form 10-K. 
 Premier s loan portfolio includes a concentration of commercial real estate loans and commercial loans, which involve risks specific to real estate value and the successful operations of these businesses. 
 The Company s portfolio of commercial real estate loans totaled 2.9 billion of total loans at September 30, 2024, and 2.8 billion of total loans at December 31, 2023. The Company's commercial real estate loans typically have higher principal amounts than residential real estate loans, and many of our commercial real estate borrowers have more than one loan outstanding. As a result, an adverse development on one loan can expose the Company to greater risk of loss on other loans. Additionally, repayment of the loans is generally dependent, in large part, on sufficient income from the properties securing the loans to cover operating expenses and debt service. Economic conditions and events outside of the control of the borrower or lender, including sustained inflation and rising interest rates, could negatively impact the future cash flows and market values of the affected properties. The Company underwrites commercial real estate loans primarily based upon the cash flow available to cover the debt service and secondarily based upon the value of the property securing the loan. Loan approval is primarily concentrated with credit officers or loan committee if the relationship is over 10 million. The Company maintains a robust risk identification and monitoring process of existing loans which includes portfolio concentration monitoring, stress test requirements and ongoing individual loan risk analysis. The Company's policy requires all commercial real estate loans 2.5 million and greater to be individually reviewed annually by the Company's credit department to assess risks and affirm the loan grade. Therefore, over 75 of the commercial real estate portfolio is reviewed annually by the credit department. Additionally, an independent loan review covers 40-50 of the commercial portfolio annually to validate credit risk management practices. 
 The Company's portfolio of commercial loans totaled 969.8 million and 1.1 billion at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively, of total loans. Commercial loans generally expose the Company to a greater risk of nonpayment and loss than commercial real estate or residential real estate loans since repayment of such loans often depends on the successful operations and income stream of the borrowers. The Company's commercial loans are primarily made based on the identified cash flow of the borrower and secondarily on the underlying collateral provided by the borrower such as accounts receivable, inventory, machinery or real estate. In the case of loans secured by accounts receivable, the availability of funds for the repayment of these loans may be substantially dependent on the ability of the borrower to collect amounts due from its customers. The collateral securing other loans may depreciate over time, may be difficult to appraise and may fluctuate in value based on the success of the business. Credit support provided by the borrower for most of these loans and the probability of repayment is based on the liquidation of the pledged collateral and enforcement of a personal guarantee, if any exists. 
 The Company targets its business lending towards small- and medium-sized businesses, many of which have fewer financial resources than larger companies and may be more susceptible to economic downturns. If general economic conditions negatively impact these businesses, the Company's results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected. 
 Risks Related to the Merger 
 The Company is subject to business uncertainties and contractual restrictions while the Merger Agreement is pending, which could adversely affect the Company's our business and operations. 
 Under the terms of the Merger Agreement, the Company is subject to certain restrictions on the conduct of its business prior to completing the transactions described in the Merger Agreement, which may adversely affect Premier's ability to execute certain of its business strategies. Such limitations could negatively affect its businesses and operations prior to the completion of the Merger. 
 67 

Table of Contents 

 While the Merger Agreement is pending, parties with which the Company does business may experience uncertainty, including with respect to current or future business relationships with Premier or the combined business. It is possible that some customers, suppliers and other persons with whom Premier has a business relationship may delay or defer certain business decisions or might decide to seek to terminate, change or renegotiate their relationships with the Company in connection with the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, which could negatively affect Premier's revenues, earnings and cash flows, as well as the market price of shares of Premier's common stock, regardless of whether these transactions are completed.
