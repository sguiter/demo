Allowance for credit losses on Held-to-Maturity Securities 

Total 

There were no gross realized
gains or gross realized losses from the sale of available-for-sale investment securities during the three and nine months ended
September 30, 2024, and 1.2 million gross realized losses from the sale of available -for-sale securities during the three and
nine months ended September 30, 2023. 

 For available-for-sale
securities, management evaluates all investments in an unrealized loss position on a quarterly basis, or more frequently when
economic or market conditions warrant such evaluation. If the Company has the intent to sell the security or it is more likely
than not that the Company will be required to sell the security, the security is written down to fair value and the entire loss
is recorded in earnings. 

 If either of
the above criteria is not met, the Company evaluates whether the decline in fair value is the result of credit losses or other
factors. In making the assessment, the Company may consider various factors including the extent to which fair value is less than
amortized cost, performance on any underlying collateral, downgrades in the ratings of the security by a rating agency, the failure
of the issuer to make scheduled interest or principal payments and adverse conditions specifically related to the security. If
the assessment indicates that a credit loss exists, the present value of cash flows expected to be collected are compared to the
amortized cost basis of the security and any excess is recorded as an allowance for credit loss, limited by the amount that the
fair value is less than the amortized cost basis. Any amount of unrealized loss that has not been recorded through an allowance
for credit loss is recognized in other comprehensive income. 

 Changes in the allowance for
credit loss are recorded as provision for (or reversal of) credit loss expense. Losses are charged against the allowance for credit
loss when management believes an available-for-sale security is confirmed to be uncollectible or when either of the criteria regarding
intent or requirement to sell is met. At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, there was no allowance for credit loss related
to the available-for-sale securities portfolio.

At September 30, 2024, the Company
had no securities held-to-maturity that were past due 30 days or more as to principal or interest payments. The Company had no
securities held-to-maturity classified as non-accrual at September 30, 2024. 

 Management
measures expected credit losses on held-to-maturity debt securities on a collective basis by major security type. The held-to-maturity
portfolio consists of mortgage-backed and municipal securities. Securities are generally rated BBB- or higher. Securities are
analyzed individually to establish a CECL reserve. 

 The estimate
of expected credit losses is primarily based on the ratings assigned to the securities by debt rating agencies and the average
of the annual historical loss rates associated with those ratings. The Company then multiplies those loss rates, as adjusted for
any modifications to reflect current conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts as considered necessary, by the remaining
lives of each individual security to arrive at a lifetime expected loss amount. Management classifies the held-to-maturity portfolio
into the following major security types: mortgage-backed securities or state and local governments. 

 All the mortgage-backed securities MBS held by the Company are issued by government-sponsored corporations. These securities are either explicitly
or implicitly guaranteed by the U.S. government, are highly rated by major rating agencies and have a long history of no credit
losses. As a result, no allowance for credit losses was recorded on held-to-maturity MBS as of September 30, 2024 and December
31, 2023. The state and local governments securities held by the Company are highly rated by major rating agencies. 

 The Company monitors the credit
quality of the debt securities held to maturity through the use of credit ratings (Moody s) on a quarterly basis. In the
event that Moody s does not provide a rating, the comparable S P rating is used and converted to a Moody s rating.
The following table summarizes the amortized cost of debt securities held to maturity at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023,

Total loans, net of deferred loan fees and costs 

The Company categorizes loans
into risk categories based on relevant information about the ability of borrowers to service their debt, including current financial
information, historical payment experience, credit documentation, public information, and current economic trends, among other
factors. The Company analyzes loans individually by classifying the loans as to credit risk. This analysis is performed on a monthly
basis. Loans not meeting the criteria below that are analyzed individually as part of the analysis are considered as pass rated
loans. The Company uses the following definitions for risk ratings: 

 Special Mention .
Loans classified as special mention have a potential weakness that deserves management s close attention. If left uncorrected,
these potential weaknesses may result in deterioration of the repayment prospects for the loan or of the institution s credit
position at some future date. Special mention assets are not adversely classified and do not expose an institution to sufficient
risk to warrant adverse classification. 

 Substandard .
Loans classified as substandard are inadequately protected by the current net worth and paying capacity of the obligor or of the
collateral pledged, if any. Loans so classified have a well-defined weakness or weaknesses that jeopardize the liquidation of
the debt. They are characterized by the distinct possibility that the institution will sustain some loss if the deficiencies are
not corrected. 

 Doubtful . Loans
classified as doubtful have all the weaknesses inherent in those classified as substandard, with the added characteristic that
the weaknesses make collection or liquidation in full, on the basis of currently existing facts, conditions, and values, highly
questionable and improbable.

The Company recognized 6,800
and 29,200 of interest income on non-accrual loans during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, and the company
recognized 5,100 and 93,700 of interest income on non-accrual loans during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023,
respectively. 

 For the three and nine months
ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023 1,600 and less than 1,000 of accrued interest was written off by reversing interest
income. 

 There were no collateral dependent
loans that were individually evaluated at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. 

 Unfunded Commitments 

 The Company maintains an allowance
for off-balance sheet credit exposures such as unfunded balances for existing lines of credit, commitments to extend future credit,
as well as both standby and commercial letters of credit when there is a contractual obligation to extend credit and when this
extension of credit is not unconditionally cancellable (i.e., commitment cannot be cancelled at any time). The allowance for off-balance
sheet credit exposures is adjusted as a provision for credit loss expense. The estimate includes consideration of the likelihood
that funding will occur, which is based on a historical funding study derived from internal information, and an estimate of expected
credit losses on commitments expected to be funded over its estimated life, which are the same loss rates that are used in computing
the allowance for credit losses on loans. The allowance for credit losses for unfunded loan commitments is separately classified
on the balance sheet within Other Liabilities and was and at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively.

Loans -The
valuation of loans receivable is estimated using the exit price notion which incorporates factors, such as enhanced credit risk,
illiquidity risk and market factors that sometimes exist in exit prices in dislocated markets. This credit risk assumption is
intended to approximate the fair value that a market participant would realize in a hypothetical orderly transaction. The Company s
loan portfolio is initially fair valued using a segmented approach. The Company divides its loan portfolio into the following
categories: variable rate loans, individually evaluated loans and all other loans. The results are then adjusted to account for
credit risk as described above. 

 Other
Real Estate Owned OREO -OREO is carried at the lower of carrying value or fair value on a non-recurring basis.
Fair value is based upon independent appraisals or management s estimation of the collateral and is considered a Level 3
measurement. 

 Derivative
Financial Instruments- Fair value is estimated using discounted cash flow models where future floating cash flows are projected
and discounted back. Derivative financial instruments are classified as Level 2. 

 Accrued
Interest Receivable -The fair value approximates the carrying value and is classified as Level 1. 

 Deposits -The
fair value of demand deposits, savings accounts, and money market accounts is the amount payable on demand at the reporting date.
The fair value of fixed-maturity certificates of deposits is estimated by discounting the future cash flows using rates currently
offered for deposits of similar remaining maturities. Deposits are classified as Level 2. 

Federal
Home Loan Bank Advances -Fair value is estimated based on discounted cash flows using current market rates for borrowings with
similar terms and are classified as Level 2. 

 Short
Term Borrowings -The carrying value of short term borrowings (securities sold under agreements to repurchase and demand notes
to the Treasury) approximates fair value. These are classified as Level 2. 

 Junior
Subordinated Debentures -The fair values of junior subordinated debentures are estimated by using discounted cash flow analyses
based on incremental borrowing rates for similar types of instruments. These are classified as Level 2. 

 Accrued
Interest Payable -The fair value approximates the carrying value and is classified as Level 1. 

 Commitments
to Extend Credit -The fair value of these commitments is immaterial because their underlying interest rates approximate market.

The Company has a large percentage
of loans with real estate serving as collateral. Loans to borrowers which are experiencing financial difficulty are primarily
valued on a nonrecurring basis at the fair value of the underlying real estate collateral. Such fair values are obtained using
independent appraisals, which the Company considers to be Level 3 inputs. Third party appraisals are generally obtained when
management determines that the borrower is experiencing financial difficulty or at the time it is transferred to OREO. This internal
process consists of evaluating the underlying collateral to independently obtained comparable properties. With respect to less
complex or smaller credits, an internal evaluation may be performed. Generally, the independent and internal evaluations are updated
annually. Factors considered in determining the fair value include, among others, geographic sales trends, the value of comparable
surrounding properties and the condition of the property.

statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act
of 1934. Forward-looking statements may relate to, among other matters, the financial condition, results of operations, plans,
objectives, future performance, and business of our company. Forward-looking statements are based on many assumptions and estimates
and are not guarantees of future performance. Our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in any forward-looking

 will, expect, anticipate, predict, project, potential, 
 continue, assume, believe, intend, plan, forecast, 
 goal, and estimate, as well as similar expressions, are meant to identify such forward-looking statements.
Potential risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those anticipated in our forward-looking
statements include, without limitation, those described under the heading Risk Factors in our Annual Report on Form
10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 as filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC on
March 21, 2024 and the following: 

credit losses as a result of, among other
 potential factors, declining real estate values, increasing interest rates, increasing unemployment, or changes in customer
 payment behavior or other factors; 

the amount of our loan portfolio collateralized
 by real estate and weaknesses in the real estate market; 

restrictions or conditions imposed by our
 regulators on our operations; 

the adequacy of the level of our allowance
 for credit losses and the amount of credit loss provisions required in future periods; 

examinations by our regulatory authorities,
 including the possibility that the regulatory authorities may, among other things, require us to increase our allowance for
 credit losses, write-down assets, or take other actions; 

risks associated with actual or potential
 information gatherings, investigations or legal proceedings by customers, regulatory agencies or others; 

reduced earnings due to higher credit impairment
 charges resulting from additional decline in the value of our securities portfolio, specifically as a result of increasing
 default rates, and loss severities on the underlying real estate collateral; 

increases in competitive pressure in the
 banking and financial services industries; 

changes in the interest rate environment,
 which are affected by many factors beyond our control, including inflation, recession, unemployment, money supply, domestic
 and international events and changes in the United States and other financial markets, and that could reduce anticipated or
 actual margins; temporarily reduce the market value of our available-for-sale investment securities and temporarily reduce
 accumulated other comprehensive income or increase accumulated other comprehensive loss, which temporarily could reduce shareholders 
 equity; 

enterprise risk management may not be effective
 in mitigating risk and reducing the potential for losses; 

changes in political conditions or the
 legislative or regulatory environment, including governmental initiatives affecting the financial services industry, including
 as a result of the presidential administration and congressional elections; 

general economic conditions resulting in,
 among other things, a deterioration in credit quality; 

changes occurring in business conditions
 and inflation, including the impact of inflation on us, including a decrease in demand for new mortgage loan and commercial
 real estate loan originations and refinancings, an increase in competition for deposits, and an increase in non-interest expense,
 which may have an adverse impact on our financial performance; 

changes in access to funding or increased
 regulatory requirements with regard to funding, which could impair our liquidity; 

FDIC assessment which has increased, and
 may continue to increase, our cost of doing business; 

cybersecurity risk related to our dependence
 on internal computer systems and the technology of outside service providers, as well as the potential impacts of third party
 security breaches, which subject us to potential business disruptions or financial losses resulting from deliberate attacks
 or unintentional events; 

changes in deposit flows, which may be
 negatively affected by a number of factors, including rates paid by competitors, general interest rate levels, regulatory
 capital requirements, and returns available to customers on alternative investments; 

changes in technology, including the increasing
 use of artificial intelligence; 

28 

our current and future products, services,
 applications and functionality and plans to promote them; 

changes in monetary and tax policies, including
 potential changes in tax laws and regulations; 

changes in accounting standards, policies,
 estimates and practices as may be adopted by the bank regulatory agencies, the Financial Accounting Standards Board, the SEC
 and the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board; 

our assumptions and estimates used in applying
 critical accounting policies, which may prove unreliable, inaccurate or not predictive of actual results; 

the rate of delinquencies and amounts of
 loans charged-off; 

the rate of loan growth in recent years
 and the lack of seasoning of a portion of our loan portfolio; 

our ability to maintain appropriate levels
 of capital, including levels of capital required under the capital rules implementing Basel III; 

our ability to successfully execute our
 business strategy; 

our ability to attract and retain key personnel; 

our ability to retain our existing customers,
 including our deposit relationships; 

our use of brokered deposits may be an
 unstable and/or an expensive deposit source to fund earning asset growth; 

our ability to obtain brokered deposits
 as an additional funding source could be limited; 

adverse changes in asset quality and resulting
 credit risk-related losses and expenses; 

the potential effects of events beyond
 our control that may have a destabilizing effect on financial markets and the economy, such as epidemics and pandemics (including
 COVID-19), war or terrorist activities, such as the war in Ukraine, the Middle East conflict, and the conflict between China
 and Taiwan, disruptions in our customers supply chains, disruptions in transportation, essential utility outages or
 trade disputes and related tariffs; 

disruptions due to flooding, severe weather
 or other natural disasters; and 

other risks and uncertainties described
 under Risk Factors below. 

Because
of these and other risks and uncertainties, our actual future results may be materially different from the results indicated by
any forward-looking statements. For additional information with respect to factors that could cause actual results to differ from
the expectations stated in the forward-looking statements, see Risk Factors under Part I, Item 1A of our Annual
Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. In addition, our past results of operations do not necessarily indicate
our future results. Therefore, we caution you not to place undue reliance on our forward-looking information and statements. 

 All forward-looking
statements in this report are based on information available to us as of the date of this report. Although we believe that the
expectations reflected in our forward-looking statements are reasonable, we cannot guarantee that these expectations will be achieved.
We undertake no obligation to publicly update or otherwise revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information,
future events, or otherwise, except as required by applicable law.

Overview 

 The following
discussion describes our results of operations for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the three
and nine months ended September 30, 2023 and analyzes our financial condition as of September 30, 2024 as compared to December
31, 2023. Like most community banks, we derive most of our income from interest we receive on our loans and investments. Our primary
sources of funds for making these loans and investments are our deposits and borrowings, on which we pay interest. Consequently,
one of the key measures of our success is our amount of net interest income, or the difference between the income on our interest-earning
assets, such as loans and investments, and the expense on our interest-bearing liabilities, such as deposits and borrowings. Another
key measure is the spread between the yield we earn on our interest-earning assets and the rate we pay on our interest-bearing
liabilities. There are risks inherent in all loans, so we maintain an allowance for credit losses to absorb our estimate of expected
credit losses on existing loans that may become uncollectible. We establish and maintain this allowance by recording a provision
for or release of credit losses against our earnings. In the following section, we have included a detailed discussion of this
process. 

 In addition
to earning interest on our loans and investments, we earn income through fees and other expenses we charge to our customers. We
describe the various components of this non-interest income, as well as our non-interest expense, in the following discussion. 

 The following
discussion and analysis identifies significant factors that have affected our financial position and operating results during
the periods included in the accompanying financial statements. We encourage you to read this discussion and analysis in conjunction
with the financial statements and the related notes and the other statistical information also included in this report. 

 Unless the context
requires otherwise, references to the Company, we, us, our, or similar
references mean First Community Corporation and its subsidiaries. References to the Bank mean First Community Bank. 

Recent Organizational Events 

 Recent or
Planned Transitions. On December 14, 2023, we announced promotions and additions to our Executive Leadership Team. Effective
January 1, 2024, Joseph A. Drew Painter and Vaughan R. Dozier, Jr. became Executive Vice Presidents in the roles
of Co-Chief Commercial and Retail Banking Officers. In their roles as Co-Chief Commercial and Retail Banking Officers, Mr. Painter
and Mr. Dozier are responsible for leading the Bank s network of banking offices. 

Effective July
1, 2024, J. Ted Nissen became the Chief Executive Officer of the Bank while still retaining the role of President and he also
joined the Company s and the Bank s boards of directors. Michael C. Crapps continues in his role as President and
Chief Executive Officer of the Company. In his role as Chief Executive Officer of the Bank, Mr. Nissen is responsible for the
leadership of day-to-day operations of the Bank including its mortgage and financial planning lines of business. Mr. Crapps will
continue to focus on board governance, investor relations, strategy development and growth decisions, client retention and prospecting,
and leadership development. 

Effective December
31, 2024, Tanya A. Butts intends to retire from her roles as Executive Vice President and Chief Operations/Risk Officer of the
Company and Bank. We selected Sarah Donley, our Senior Vice President and Controller and a 27-year employee, as Ms. Butts 
successor following a transition period. 

On June 27, 2024,
we closed our banking office located at 771 Broad Street in downtown Augusta, Georgia. We have three other banking offices in the Central
Savannah River Area (CRSA) including locations in Augusta and Evans, Georgia and in Aiken, South Carolina. Cost savings are estimated
to be approximately 327,000 annually on a go-forward basis. 

30 

Recent Industry Events 

Effect of Governmental
Monetary Policies. Our earnings are affected by domestic economic conditions and the monetary and fiscal policies of the United States
government and its agencies. The Federal Reserve s monetary policies have had, and are likely to continue to have, an important
impact on the operating results of commercial banks through its power to implement national monetary policy in order, among other things,
to curb inflation or combat a recession. The monetary policies of the Federal Reserve have major effects upon the levels of bank loans,
investments, deposits and borrowings through its open market operations in United States government securities and through its regulation
of the discount rate on borrowings of member banks and the reserve requirements against member banks deposits. It is not possible
to predict the nature or impact of future changes in monetary and fiscal policies. During 2023, market interest rates increased 1.00 
due to an increase in inflation. The target range of federal funds was 5.25 - 5.50 from July 26, 2023 to September 17, 2024. On September
18, 2024, the FOMC reduced the target range of federal funds by 0.50 to 4.75 - 5.00 . The target range of federal funds was 4.75 -
5.00 at September 30, 2024 compared to 5.25 - 5.50 at September 30, 2023. Changes in market interest rates can have a significant
impact on the level of income and expense recorded on a large portion of our interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities,
and on the market value of all interest-earning assets, other than those possessing a short term to maturity. Furthermore, changes in
market interest rates can have a significant impact on the level of mortgage originations and related mortgage banking income. 

During 2023,
concerns arose with respect to the financial condition of a number of banking organizations in the United States, in particular
those with exposure to certain types of depositors and large portfolios of investment securities. On March 10, 2023, Silicon Valley
Bank was closed by the California Department of Financial Protection and Innovation and the FDIC was appointed receiver of Silicon
Valley Bank. On March 11, 2023, Signature Bank was similarly closed and placed into receivership and concurrently the Federal
Reserve Board announced it will make available additional funding to eligible depository institutions to assist eligible banking
organizations with potential liquidity needs. On May 1, 2023, First Republic Bank was closed and its assets were seized. For almost
a year, regulatory agencies had not closed any further banks with assets greater than 150 million since the closure of First
Republic Bank; however, on April 26, 2024, Republic First Bank closed and was taken over by the FDIC, which simultaneously announced
that Fulton Bank would acquire the assets and deposits of Republic First Bank. While our business, balance sheet, and depositor
profile differ substantially from banking institutions that are the focus of the greatest scrutiny, the operating environment
and public trading prices of financial services sector securities can be highly correlated, in particular in times of stress,
which may adversely affect the trading price of our common stock and potentially our results of operations. These bank failures
have created market volatility for the financial sector; however, the ultimate ramifications of these events have yet to be seen
but will likely result in continued increases in FDIC assessments and may result in additional bank failures throughout the remainder
of 2024. These events have not caused any significant changes in deposit balances at the Company since the date of the balance
sheet. 

Critical Accounting Estimates

We have
adopted various accounting policies that govern the application of accounting principles generally accepted in the United States
and with general practices within the banking industry in the preparation of our financial statements. Our significant accounting
policies are described in the notes to our unaudited consolidated financial statements as of September 30, 2024 and our notes
included in the consolidated financial statements in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 as filed
with the SEC on March 21, 2024. 

 Certain
accounting policies inherently involve a greater reliance on the use of estimates, assumptions and judgments and, as such, have
a greater possibility of producing results that could be materially different than originally reported, which could have a material
impact on the carrying values of our assets and liabilities and our results of operations. We consider these accounting policies
and estimates to be critical accounting policies. We have identified the determination of the allowance for credit losses, income
taxes and deferred tax assets and liabilities, goodwill and other intangible assets, and derivative instruments to be the accounting
areas that require the most subjective or complex judgments and, as such, could be most subject to revision as new or additional
information becomes available or circumstances change, including overall changes in the economic climate and/or market interest
rates. Therefore, management has reviewed and approved these critical accounting policies and estimates and has discussed these
policies with our Audit and Compliance Committee. A brief discussion of each of these areas appears in our Annual Report on Form

Comparison of Results of
Operations for Three Months Ended September 30, 2024 to the Three Months Ended September 30, 2023 

 Net Income 

 Our net
income for the three months ended September 30, 2024 increased 2.1 million to 3.9 million, or 0.50 diluted earnings per common
share, as compared to 1.8 million, or 0.23 diluted earnings per common share, for the three months ended September 30, 2023.
The 2.1 million increase in net income between the two periods is primarily due to a 1.3 million increase in net interest income,
a 490,000 decrease in provision for credit losses, and a 1.7 million increase in total non-interest income, partially offset
by a 718,000 increase in total non-interest expense and a 682,000 increase in income tax expense. 

The 1.3 million increase in net interest
 income results from a 177.5 million increase in average earning assets between the two periods. 

The 16,000 release of provision for credit
 losses during the three months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily due to a 23.1 million reduction in unfunded commitments
 net of unconditionally cancellable commitments and a two basis points reduction in our qualitative factor for reasonable and
 supportable forecast alternative scenarios due to a slight reduction in the probability of a recession partially offset by
 a 7.5 million increase in loans held-for-investment, a slight extension in the average life of the loan portfolio due to
 lower loan prepayments, and 68,000 in net charge-offs. 

The 474,000 provision for
 credit losses during the three months ended September 30, 2023 is primarily related to a 59.5 million increase in loans
 held-for-investment and a 45.4 million increase in unfunded commitments net of unconditionally cancellable commitments,
 which was partially offset by reductions in our qualitative factors related to forecast alternative scenarios due to a
 resilient consumer and economy and changes in staff and markets due to the seasoning of our Rock Hill, South Carolina
 team and market, which was added in the first quarter of 2022. 

The 1.7 million increase in non-interest
 income is primarily related to increases in mortgage banking income of 64,000, investment advisory fees and non-deposit commissions
 of 408,000, ATM debit card income of 15,000, and bank owned life insurance of 14,000; and a decrease in loss on sale of
 securities of 1.2 million, partially offset by decreases in deposit service charges of 12,000 and gain on sale of other
 assets of 41,000. 

During the three months ended September
 2023, we sold 39.9 million of book value U.S. Treasuries in our available-for-sale investment securities portfolio. While
 this sale created a one-time pre-tax loss of 1.2 million, it provided additional liquidity which was used to pay down borrowings
 and fund loan growth. The weighted average book yield of the securities sold was 1.75 and the projected earn back period
 is 1.6 years. Such measures transition the balance sheet to be more efficient, improves net interest margin, and positions
 us for higher earnings in the future. 

The 718,000 increase in non-interest expense
 is primarily due to increases in salaries and employee benefits of 809,000, occupancy of 17,000, FDIC insurance assessment
 of 79,000, core banking and electronic processing and services of 90,000, ATM/debit card processing of 63,000, legal and
 professional of 26,000, and investment advisory services of 24,000 partially offset by decreases in equipment of 25,000,
 marketing and public relations of 132,000, other real estate expense of 10,000, loan processing costs of 49,000, correspondent
 services of 23,000, and debit card and fraud expense of 250,000. 

Debit card and fraud losses increased 247,000
 to 277,000 during the three months ended September 30, 2023 compared to 30,000 during the same period in 2022. Debit
 card losses were 46,000 and check fraud losses were 230,000 during the third quarter of 2023. We experienced
 an extraordinary spike in mail check fraud losses during the third quarter of 2023. Historically, our fraud losses have
 been well under those of peers. We believe the third quarter 2023 spike, with over three times the normal customer-reported
 incidences, was directly related to confirmed local mail thefts within our markets, as well as fraudsters targeting smaller
 counterfeit check amounts to avoid early detection. Our current case volumes, as reported by customers, suggest
 that the spike has abated. However, because fraud risk is ever evolving, we have responded with countermeasures including
 deploying additional resources, and conducting a formal customer education marketing campaign called THINK TWICE ,
 which requests customers who have been a victim of fraud to enhance their check authorization processes and upgrade to our
 current fraud detection system. 

Our effective tax rate was 22.89 during
 the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 20.90 during the three months ended September 30, 2023. 

32 

Net Interest Income 

 Net interest
income is our primary source of revenue. Net interest income is the difference between income earned on assets and interest paid
on deposits and borrowings used to support such assets. Net interest income is determined by the rates earned on our interest-earning
assets and the rates paid on our interest-bearing liabilities, the relative amounts of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing
liabilities, and the degree of mismatch and the maturity and repricing characteristics of our interest-earning assets and interest-bearing
liabilities. 

Net interest
income increased 1.3 million, or 10.8 , to 13.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 from 12.1 million for
the three months ended September 30, 2023. Our net interest margin remained flat at 2.95 during the three months ended September
30, 2024 compared to 2.95 during the three months ended September 30, 2023. Our net interest margin, on a taxable equivalent
basis, was 2.96 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 2.96 for the three months ended September 30, 2023.
Average earning assets were 1.8 billion for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 1.6 billion in the same period of
2023. 

The 1.3 million increase in net interest
 income results from a 177.5 million increase in average earning assets between the two periods. 

The increase in average earning assets
 was primarily due to increases of 134.5 million in loans and 88.5 million in interest bearing deposits in other banks, partially
 offset by a decrease of 45.5 million in total securities. 

The increase in our earning asset yield
 was due to a change in the mix of our earning assets from lower yielding securities to higher yielding loans and short-term
 investments, which resulted in a higher percentage of earning assets in higher yielding loans and short-term investments,
 due to an increase in market interest rates, and due to a pay-fixed/receive-floating interest rate swap (the Pay-Fixed
 Swap Agreement described below. 

Investment securities represented 27.0 
 of average total earning assets for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 32.7 during the same period in
 2023. This decline was primarily due to the sale of 39.9 million of book
 value U.S. Treasuries in our available-for-sale investment securities portfolio during the third quarter of 2023 and
 normal principal cash flows from the investment securities portfolio. 

Short-term investments represented 6.5 
 of average total earning assets for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 1.8 during the same period in 2023. 

Loans represented 66.5 of average total
 earning assets for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 65.5 during the same period in 2023. 

During 2022 and 2023, market interest rates
 increased due to an increase in inflation. Market interest rates declined by 0.50 in the third quarter of 2024 primarily
 due to a reduction in inflation and a slight increase in unemployment. The target range of federal funds was 4.75 
 - 5.00 at September 30, 2024 compared to 5.25 - 5.50 at September 30, 2023. 

Effective May 5, 2023, we entered into
 Pay-Fixed Swap Agreement for a notional amount of 150.0 million that was designated as a fair value hedge in order to hedge
 the risk of changes in the fair value of the fixed rate loans included in the closed loan portfolio. This fair value hedge
 converts the hedged loans from a fixed rate to a synthetic floating SOFR rate. The Pay-Fixed Swap Agreement will mature on
 May 5, 2026 and we will pay a fixed coupon rate of 3.58 while receiving the overnight SOFR rate. This interest
 rate swap positively impacted interest on loans by 681,000 during the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to
 a positive impact of interest on loans of 626,000 during the three months ended September 30, 2023. Loan yields
 and net interest margin both benefited during the three months ended September 30, 2024 with an increase of 23 basis points
 and 15 basis points, respectively. Loan yields and net interest margin both benefited during the three months ended September
 30, 2023 with an increase of 25 basis points and 16 basis points, respectively. 

33 

Average loans
increased 134.5 million, or 12.6 , to 1.2 billion for the three months ended September 30, 2024 from 1.1 billion for the same
period in 2023. Our loan (including loans held-for-sale) to deposit ratio on average during the three months ended September 30,
2024 was 74.0 , as compared to 74.4 during same period in 2023. The yield on loans increased 59 basis points to 5.73 during
the three months ended September 30, 2024 from 5.14 during the same period in 2023 due to an increase in market interest rates. 

Average
securities for the three months ended September 30, 2024 decreased 45.5 million, or 8.5 , to 487.6 million from 533.1 million
during the same period in 2023. Short-term investments and CDs increased 88.5 million to 118.0 million during the three months
ended September 30, 2024 from 29.5 million during the same period in 2023. The increase in short-term investments was due to
our decision to hold excess liquidity in interest bearing deposits at the Federal Reserve Bank. The yield on our securities portfolio
increased to 3.53 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 from 3.42 for the same period in 2023. The yield on our short-term
investments improved to 5.23 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 from 4.51 . 

 The yields on
earning assets for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 were 5.10 and 4.56 , respectively. 

The cost
of interest-bearing liabilities was 2.96 during the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 2.27 during the same period
in 2023. The cost of deposits, including demand deposits, was 2.03 during the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared
to 1.32 during the same period in 2023. The cost of funds, including demand deposits, was 2.21 during the three months ended
September 30, 2024 compared to 1.64 during the same period in 2023. We continue to focus on growing our pure deposits (demand
deposits, interest-bearing transaction accounts, savings deposits, money market accounts, and IRAs) plus customer cash management
repurchase agreements as these accounts tend to be low-cost funding and assist us in controlling our overall cost of funds. Average
pure deposits plus customer cash management repurchase agreements increased 47.0 million or 3.5 to 1.4 billion during the three
months ended September 30, 2024 from 1.3 billion during the same period in 2023. During the three months ended September 30,
2024, pure deposits plus customer cash management repurchase agreements averaged 82.6 of total deposits plus customer cash management
repurchase agreements as compared to 89.7 during the same period of 2023. This reduction is related to a higher rate of growth
in our certificates of deposit compared to pure deposits due to the higher interest rate environment. The growth in certificates
of deposit is related to both customer certificates of deposit and brokered certificates of deposit. We began issuing brokered
certificates of deposit during the third quarter of 2023 to supplement our funding mix. As of September 30, 2024, we had 22.4
million in brokered certificates of deposit ranging in initial terms from 18 months to three years, with the three year term callable
after six months. We had 48.1 million and 48.1 million in brokered certificates of deposit at December 31, 2023 and at September
30, 2023, respectively.

Non-interest
Income and Non-interest Expense 

Non-interest
income during the three months ended September 30, 2024 increased 1.7 million to 3.6 million from 1.9 million during the same
period in 2023. The increase in non-interest income was primarily related to increases of 64,000 in mortgage banking income,
 408,000 in investment advisory fees and non-deposit commissions, 38,000 in other non-interest income, and a decrease of 1.2
million in loss on sale of securities, partially offset by decreases of 12,000 in deposit service charges and 41,000 in gain
on sale of other assets. 

Mortgage banking
income increased 64,000 to 575,000 during the three months ended September 30, 2024 from 511,000 during the same period in
2023. Total production in the mortgage line of business in the three months ended September 30, 2024 was 38.1 million, which
was comprised of 19.5 million in secondary market loans, 8.7 million in adjustable rate mortgages (ARMs), and 9.9 million in
commitments for new construction residential real estate loans. Fee revenue from the mortgage line of business was 575,000 for
the three months ended September 30, 2024, which includes 571,000 associated with the secondary market loans with a gain-on-sale
margin of 2.92 . This compares to production year-over-year of 41.7 million which was comprised of 17.3 million in secondary
market loans, 11.4 million in ARMs, and 13.0 million in commitments for new construction residential real estate loans during
the three months ended September 30, 2023. Fee revenue from the mortgage line of business was 511,000, which includes 508,000
associated with the secondary market loans with a gain-on-sale margin of 2.93 during the three months ended September 30, 2023. 

With the headwinds of
rising interest rates, we began to market an adjustable rate mortgage (ARM) product during the second quarter of 2022 to provide borrowers
with an alternative to fixed-rate mortgages and to help offset anticipated mortgage production challenges. Currently, we are offering
5/6, 7/6, and 10/6 ARM loans that are originated for our loans held-for-investment portfolio. Furthermore, we added a new construction
residential real estate team and product during the latter part of 2022. As these ARM and new construction residential real estate loans
are being held on our balance sheet as loans held-for-investment, the result is additive to loan growth and interest income but results
in less gain on sale fee income, which is reported in noninterest income as mortgage banking income. 

36 

Investment advisory
fees rose 408,000 to 1.6 million during the three months ended September 30, 2024 from 1.2 million during the same period in
2023. Total assets under management increased to 901.6 million at September 30, 2024 compared to 755.4 million at December 31,
2023 and 674.5 million at September 30, 2023. Our net new assets were 6.0 million during the three months ended September 30,
2024. Furthermore, our investment performance for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was 3.5 compared to 5.5 for the
S P 500; and our investment performance for the 12-month period ended September 30, 2024 was 29.2 compared to 34.4 for the
S P 500. Our customers assets under management are not fully invested in only equities. Our assets under management
include bonds and cash. 

Loss on sale
of securities improved by 1.2 million to zero during the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to a loss of 1.2 million
during the same period in 2023. The 1.2 million loss on sale of securities during the three months ended September 30, 2023 was
related to the previously mentioned 39.9 million sale of book value U.S. Treasuries in our available-for-sale investment securities
portfolio. 

Gain on sale
of other assets declined 41,000 to 5,000 during the three months ended September 30, 2024 from 46,000 during the same period
in 2023 due to a sale of other real estate owned during the three months ended September 30, 2023. 

Other non-interest
income increased 35,000 to 1.2 million during the three months ended September 30, 2024 from 1.1 million during the same period
in 2023. The 35,000 increase was primarily due to increased in ATM debit card income of 15,000 and bank owned life insurance
of 14,000. 

The following
table shows the components of non-interest income for the three-month periods ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023.

Non-interest
expense increased 718,000 during the three months ended September 30, 2024 to 12.0 million compared to 11.3 million during
the same period in 2023. The 718,000 increase in non-interest expense is primarily due to increases in salaries and employee
benefits, occupancy, FDIC insurance assessments, partially offset by decreases in equipment, marketing and public relations, other
real estate expense, net, and other non-interest expense. 

Salary and benefits expense increased 809,000
 to 7.4 million during the three months ended September 30, 2024 from 6.6 million during the same period in 2023. This increase
 is primarily a result of normal salary adjustments, higher mortgage banking and financial planning and investment advisory
 commissions, and higher incentive accruals related to higher performance levels. We had 260 full-time employees and nine part-time
 employees at September 30, 2024 compared to 253 full-time employees and 12 part-time employees at September 30, 2023. 

Occupancy fees increased
 17,000 to 793,000 during the three months ended September 30, 2024 from 776,000 during the same period in 2023 primarily
 due to higher building and yard maintenance costs. 

FDIC assessments increased 79,000 to 290,000
 during the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 211,000 during the same period in 2023 due to an increase in
 our FDIC assessment rate and our assets. 

Equipment
expense declined 25,000 to 391,000 during the three months ended September 30, 2024 from 416,000 during the same period in 2023 primarily
due to lower equipment depreciation. 

37 

Marketing and public relations
 costs declined 132,000 to 477,000 during the three months ended September 30, 2024 from 609,000 during the same period
 in 2023 primarily due to the timing of planned media production and campaigns. Marketing expenses, while planned
 and budgeted on an annual basis, can vary significantly between quarters depending on the needs of the company.

Income Tax Expense 

We incurred income
tax expense of 1.1 million and 464,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Our effective tax
rate was 22.89 and 20.90 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. 

 Comparison of Results of Operations
for Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 to the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2023 

Net Income 

Our net income
for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 increased 1.2 million to 9.7 million, or 0.14 diluted earnings per common share,
from 8.5 million, or 1.12 diluted earnings per common share for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in net
income between the two periods is primarily due to a 1.6 million increase in net interest income, a 163,000 decline in provision
for credit losses, and a 2.9 million increase in total non-interest income, partially offset by a 3.2 million increase in total
non-interest expense and a 303,000 increase in income tax expense. 

The 1.6 million increase in
 net interest income results from an increase of 156.2 million in average earning assets, partially offset by a reduction
 of 15 basis points in the net interest margin between the two periods. 

The 567,000 provision for credit losses
 during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 is primarily related to a 62.6 million increase in loans held-for-investment,
 a slight extension in the average life of the loan portfolio due to lower loan prepayments, and 95,000 in net charge-offs
 partially offset by two basis points of reduction in our qualitative factors primarily related to our reasonable and supportable
 forecast alternative scenarios qualitative factor due to a slight reduction in the probability of a recession and a 48.3
 million reduction in our unfunded commitments net of unconditionally cancellable commitments. The 730,000 provision for credit
 losses during the nine months ended September 30, 2023 is primarily related to a 110.8 million increase in loans held-for-investment,
 a 60.2 million increase in unfunded commitments net of unconditionally cancellable commitments, and an increase in our changes
 in staff, markets, and product qualitative factor related to our new residential construction mortgage team and product partially
 offset by a reduction in our qualitative factors for changes in staff, markets, and products due to the seasoning of our Rock
 Hill, South Carolina team and market, which was added in the first quarter of 2022, and a reduction in our qualitative factors
 due to a 4.8 million reduction in non-accrual loans. 

The 2.9 million increase in non-interest
 income is primarily related to increases in deposit service charges of 30,000, mortgage banking income of 619,000, investment
 advisory fees and non-deposit commissions of 1.1 million, other non-interest income of 28,000, and a decrease in loss on
 sale of securities of 1.2 million partially offset by a decrease of 146,000 in gain on sale of other assets. Other
 non-interest income includes non-recurring income of 95,000 during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 related to a
 gain on insurance proceeds of 101,000 partially offset by a loss on disposition of assets on the closing of our downtown
 Augusta, Georgia banking office of 6,000. Other non-interest income includes non-recurring income of 121,000
 during the nine months ended September 30, 2023 is related to a bank owned life insurance claim of 93,000 and gains on insurance
 proceeds of 28,000. 

Non-interest expense increased 3.2 million
 primarily due to an increase of 2.4 million in salaries and employee benefits, 256,000 in FDIC insurance assessments, 255,000
 in other real estate expense, and 503,000 in other non-interest expense, partially offset by decreases of 98,000 in occupancy,
 91,000 in equipment, 24,000 in marketing and public relations 

Our effective tax rate was 21.42 during
 the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 21.55 during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The
 reduction in the effective tax rate was due to a non-recurring adjustment of 149,000 during the nine months ended September
 30, 2024. 

39 

Net Interest Income 

Net interest
income is our primary source of revenue. Net interest income is the difference between income earned on assets and interest paid
on deposits and borrowings used to support such assets. Net interest income is determined by the rates earned on our interest-earning
assets and the rates paid on our interest-bearing liabilities, the relative amounts of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing
liabilities, and the degree of mismatch and the maturity and repricing characteristics of our interest-earning assets and interest-bearing
liabilities. 

Net interest income
increased 1.6 million, or 4.3 , to 38.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from 36.6 million for the nine months
ended September 30, 2023. Our net interest margin decreased by 15 basis points to 2.89 during the nine months ended September 30, 2024
from 3.04 during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Our net interest margin, on a taxable equivalent basis, was 2.89 for the
nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 3.06 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Average earning assets increased
 156.2 million, or 9.7 , to 1.8 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 1.6 billion in the same period of
2023. 

The 1.6 million increase in net interest
 income results from increases of 156.2 million in average earning assets, partially offset by a reduction of 15 basis points
 in the net interest margin between the two periods. 

The increase in average earning assets
 was primarily due to a 152.6 million increase in average loans and a 64.5 million increase in average interest bearing deposits
 in other banks, partially offset by a 60.8 million decrease in total securities. 

The increase in our earning asset yield
 was due to a change in the mix of our earning assets from lower yielding securities to higher yielding loans and short-term
 investments, which resulted in a higher percentage of earning assets in higher yielding loans and short-term investments,
 due to the higher market interest rate environment, and due to a pay-fixed/receive-floating interest rate swap (the Pay-Fixed
 Swap Agreement described below. 

o 
 Investment securities represented 27.9 
 of average total earning assets for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 34.4 during the same period in 2023. 

o 
 Short-term investments represented 5.6 
 of average total earning assets for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 2.1 during the same period in 2023. 

o 
 Loans represented 66.5 of average total
 earning assets for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 63.5 during the same period in 2023. 

o 
 During 2022 and 2023, market interest rates
 increased due to an increase in inflation, however, the Federal Reserve began lowering interest rates in the third quarter
 of 2024. The target range of federal funds was 4.75 - 5.00 at September 30, 2024 compared to 5.25 - 5.50 at
 September 30, 2023. 

o 
 Effective May 5, 2023, we entered into
 Pay-Fixed Swap Agreement for a notional amount of 150.0 million that was designated as a fair value hedge in order to hedge
 the risk of changes in the fair value of the fixed rate loans included in the closed loan portfolio. This fair value hedge
 converts the hedged loans from a fixed rate to a synthetic floating SOFR rate. The Pay-Fixed Swap Agreement will mature on
 May 5, 2026 and we will pay a fixed coupon rate of 3.58 while receiving the overnight SOFR rate. This interest
 rate swap positively impacted interest on loans by 2.0 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. Loan
 yields and net interest margin both benefited during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 with an increase of 24 basis
 points and 15 basis points, respectively. During the nine months ended September 30, 2023, the interest rate swap
 positively impacted interest on loans by 962,000, and loan yields and net interest margin both benefited, with an increase
 of 13 and eight basis points, respectively. 

40 

Average loans
increased 152.6 million, or 14.9 , to 1.2 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from 1.0 billion for the same
period in 2023. Our loan (including loans held-for-sale) to deposit ratio on average during the nine months ended September 30,
2024 was 74.9 , as compared to 72.7 during the same period in 2023. Our growth in average loans during the nine months ended
September 30, 2024 from the same period in 2023 of 152.6 million was exceeded by our increase in deposits of 162.9 million during
the same period. The yield on loans increased 72 basis points to 5.59 during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from 4.87 
during the same period in 2023 due to an increase in market interest rates and the Pay-Fixed Swap Agreement. 

Average securities
for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 declined 60.8 million, or 11.0 , to 492.7 million from 553.5 million during the
same period in 2023. The decline in securities was due to the deployment of lower yielding securities into higher yielding loans.
Short-term investments increased 64.5 million to 98.5 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from 34.1 million
during the same period in 2023. The increase in short-term investments was due to our decision to hold excess liquidity in interest
bearing deposits at the Federal Reserve Bank. The yield on our securities portfolio increased to 3.62 for the nine months ended
September 30, 2024 from 3.29 for the same period in 2023. The yield on our short-term investments increased to 5.11 for the
nine months ended September 30, 2024 from 4.80 for the same period in 2023. 

The yields on
earning assets for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 were 5.01 and 4.33 , respectively. 

The cost of interest-bearing
liabilities was 2.92 during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 1.83 during the same period in 2023. The cost of deposits,
including demand deposits, was 1.97 during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 0.96 during the same period in 2023.
The cost of funds, including demand deposits, was 2.18 during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 1.31 during the
same period in 2023. We continue to focus on growing our pure deposits (demand deposits, interest-bearing transaction accounts, savings
deposits, money market accounts, and IRAs) plus customer cash management repurchase agreements as these accounts tend to be low-cost
funding and assist us in controlling our overall cost of funds. Average pure deposits plus customer cash management repurchase agreements
increased 14.8 million or 1.1 to 1.4 billion during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from 1.4 billion during the same period
in 2023. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, pure deposits plus customer cash management repurchase agreements averaged
83.2 of total deposits plus customer cash management repurchase agreements as compared to 91.2 during the same period of 2023. This
reduction is related to a higher rate of growth in our certificates of deposit compared to pure deposits due to the higher interest rate
environment. The growth in certificates of deposit is related to both customer certificates of deposit and brokered certificates of deposit.
We began issuing brokered certificates of deposit during the third quarter of 2023 to supplement our funding mix. As of September 30,
2024, we had 22.4 million in brokered certificates of deposit ranging in initial terms from 18 months to three years, with the three
year term callable after six months. We had 48.1 million and 48.1 million in brokered certificates of deposit at December 31, 2023
and at September 30, 2023, respectively.

Non-interest
Income and Non-interest Expense 

Non-interest
income during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 increased 2.9 million to 10.4 million from 7.5 million during the same
period in 2023. The increase in non-interest income was primarily related to increases in deposit service charges, mortgage banking
income, investment advisory fees and non-deposit commissions, and other non-interest income and a decline in loss on sale of other
securities, partially offset by a decrease in gain on sale of other assets. 

Deposit service
charges increased 30,000 to 722,000 during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from 692,000 during the same period in
2023 due to higher service charges and non-sufficient funds and overdraft fees. 

Mortgage banking
income increased by 619,000 to 1.7 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from 1.0 million during the same
period in 2023. Secondary mortgage production during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 55.3 million compared to 35.5
million during the same period in 2023 while the gain on sale margin increased to 2.97 during the nine months ended September
30, 2024 from 2.92 during the same period in 2023. 

With the headwinds
of rising interest rates, we began to market an adjustable rate mortgage (ARM) product during the second quarter of 2022 to provide
borrowers with an alternative to fixed-rate mortgages and to help offset anticipated mortgage production challenges. Currently,
we are offering 5/6, 7/6, and 10/6 ARM loans that are originated for our loans held-for-investment portfolio. Furthermore, we
added a new construction residential real estate team and product during the latter part of 2022. As these ARM and new construction
residential real estate loans are being held on our balance sheet as loans held-for-investment, the result is additive to loan
growth and interest income but results in less gain on sale fee income, which is reported in noninterest income as mortgage banking
income. 

43 

Investment advisory
fees increased 1.1 million to 4.5 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from 3.3 million during the same
period in 2023. Total assets under management increased to 901.6 million at September 30, 2024 compared to 755.4 million at
December 31, 2023 and 674.5 million at September 30, 2023. Our net new assets were 29.4 million during the nine months ended
September 30, 2024. Furthermore, our investment performance for the nine-month period from December 31, 2023 to September 30,
2024 was 15.5 compared to 20.8 for the S P 500; and our investment performance for the 12-month period from September 30,
2023 to September 30, 2024 was 29.2 compared to 34.4 for the S P 500. Our customers assets under management are not
fully invested in only equities. Our assets under management include bonds and cash. We continue to focus on both the mortgage
banking income as well as the investment advisory fees and commissions. 

Loss on sale
of securities improved by 1.2 million to zero during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to a loss of 1.2 million
during the same period in 2023. The 1.2 million loss on sale of securities during the three months ended September 30, 2023 was
related to the previously mentioned 39.9 million sale of book value U.S. Treasuries in our available-for-sale investment securities
portfolio. 

Gain (loss) on
sale of other assets declined 146,000 to a gain of 5,000 during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from 151,000 during
the same period in 2023 due an income tax recovery in 2024 on a previously sold other real estate owned property and due to a
sale of other real estate owned during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 

Other non-interest
income increased 28,000 to 3.5 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from 3.5 million during the same period
in 2023. The 28,000 increase in other non-interest income was due to an increase in recurring bank owned life insurance of 43,000
partially offset by declines in ATM debit card income of 42,000 and other non-recurring noninterest income of 26,000. Other
noninterest income non-recurring income declined 26,000 to 95,000 during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from 121,000
during the same period in 2023. Non-recurring income of 95,000 during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 is related to
a gain on insurance proceeds of 101,000 partially offset by a loss on disposition of assets on the closing of our downtown Augusta,
Georgia banking office of 6,000. Non-recurring income of 121,000 during the nine months ended September 30, 2023 is related
to a bank owned life insurance claim of 93,000 and gains on insurance proceeds of 28,000.

Non-interest
expense increased 3.2 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 to 35.6 million compared to 32.5 million during
the same period in 2023. The increase in non-interest expense is primarily due to increases in salaries and employee benefits,
FDIC insurance assessments, other real estate expense, and other expense partially offset by decreases in occupancy fees, equipment
expense, and marketing and public relations expense. 

Salary and benefits expense increased 2.4
 million to 21.8 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from 19.5 million during the same period in 2023.
 This increase is primarily a result of normal salary adjustments, higher mortgage banking and financial planning and investment
 advisory commissions, and higher incentive accruals related to higher performance. We had 260 full-time employees and nine
 part-time employees at September 30, 2024 compared to 253 full-time employees and 12 part-time employees at September 30,
 2023. 

FDIC assessments increased 256,000 to
 870,000 during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 614,000 during the same period in 2023 due to an increase
 in our FDIC assessment rate and our assets. 

Other real estate expenses increased 255,000
 to 113,000 during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from 142,000 in contra expenses or credits during the same period
 in the prior year primarily due to a reversal in accruals for real estate taxes on a non-accrual loan in the prior year period,
 which were either paid by the borrower or recovered as a result of the sale of the real estate; and due to a 78,000 write-down
 of an other real estate owned property during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 

44 

Other non-interest
 expense increased 503,000 to 8.1 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from 7.5 million during the same
 period in 2023. 

- 
 Core
banking and electronic processing and services increased 120,000 to 2.0 million from 1.9 million as a result of higher customer activity
and enhanced technology. 

- 
 ATM/debit card processing
 increased 144,000 to 932,000 from 788,000 primarily due to higher customer activity, a debit card marketing campaign, and
 enhanced technology. 

- 
 Software subscriptions
 and services increased 173,000 to 913,000 from 740,000 primarily due to new subscriptions and services and higher renewal
 prices. 

- 
 Telephone expense
 increased 83,000 to 408,000 from 325,000 due to a change in our telecommunications vendor, which resulted in paying two
 vendors for a period of time, and due to a 29,000 write-off of the remainder of a contract related to the closing of our
 downtown Augusta, Georgia banking office. 

- 
 Debit and fraud losses
 declined 231,000 to 149,000 from 380,000 due to the previously mentioned spike in mail check fraud losses during the third
 quarter of 2023. 

- 
 Loan processing and
 closing costs declined 99,000 to 182,000 from 281,000 primarily due to lower average new loan sizes in 2024 and fees paid
 for a home equity campaign in 2023. 

- 
 Legal
and professional fees increased 242,000 to 981,000 from 739,000 due to higher legal and audit expenses. 

- 
 Shareholder expense
 increased 57,000 to 207,000 from 150,000 due to higher printing and filing expenses. 

Occupancy
fees declined 98,000 to 2.3 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from 2.4 million during the same period in 2023
primarily due to lower building and yard maintenance costs, real estate taxes, and lease expense. 

Equipment
expense declined 91,000 to 1.0 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from 1.1 million during the same period in
2023 primarily due to lower equipment depreciation, equipment maintenance and repairs, and auto expense. 

Marketing and public relations declined
 24,000 to 1.3 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from 1.3 million during the same period in 2023 primarily
 due to the timing of planned media production and campaigns. Marketing expenses, while planned and budgeted on an annual
 basis, can vary significantly between quarters depending on the needs of the company.

Income Tax Expense 

We incurred income
tax expense of 2.7 million and 2.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Our effective
tax rate was 21.42 and 21.55 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The decrease in the effective
tax rate was primarily due to a 149,000 non-recurring reduction to income tax expense during the nine months ended September
30, 2024. 

Provision and Allowance for Credit
Losses 

On January
1, 2023, we adopted CECL, which resulted in a day one reduction of 14,000 to the allowance for credit losses on loans offset
by increases of 398,000 to the allowance for credit losses on unfunded commitments and 43,500 to the allowance for credit
losses on held-to-maturity investments. Furthermore, deferred tax assets increased 90,000 and retained earnings declined 337,000.
Compared to the day one CECL results, the allowance for credit losses on loans increased 945,000 to 12.3 million at December
31, 2023 from 11.3 million at January 1, 2023; the allowance for credit losses on unfunded commitments increased 199,000 to
 597,000 as of December 31, 2023 from 398,000 as of January 1, 2023; and the allowance for credit losses on held-to-maturity
investments declined 14,000 to 30,000 at December 31, 2023 from 43,500 at January 1, 2023. Compared to December 31, 2023, the
allowance for credit losses on loans increased 666,000 to 12.9 million at September 30, 2024 from 12.3 million at December
31, 2023; the allowance for credit losses on unfunded commitments declined 188,000 to 409,000 as of September 30, 2024 from
 597,000 as of December 31, 2023; and the allowance for credit losses on held-to-maturity investments declined 6,000 to 24,000
at September 30, 2024 from 30,000 at December 31, 2023. As of September 30, 2024, the combined allowance for credit losses
for loans, unfunded commitments, and investments was 13.4 million compared to 12.9 million at December 31,
2023 and 12.5 million at September 30, 2023. 

The 567,000
provision for credit losses during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 is primarily related to a 62.6 million increase in
loans held-for-investment, a slight extension in the average life of the loan portfolio due to lower loan prepayments, and 95,000
in net charge-offs partially offset by 2.0 basis points of reduction in our qualitative factors primarily related to our reasonable
and supportable forecast alternative scenarios qualitative factor and a 48.3 million reduction in our unfunded commitments net
of unconditionally cancellable commitments. The 730,000 provision for credit losses during the nine months ended September 30,
2023 is primarily related to a 110.8 million increase in loans held-for-investment, a 60.2 million increase in unfunded commitments
net of unconditionally cancellable commitments, and an increase in our changes in staff, markets, and product qualitative factor
related to our new residential construction mortgage team and product partially offset by a reduction in our qualitative factors
for changes in staff, markets, and products due to the seasoning of our Rock Hill, South Carolina team and market, which was added
in the first quarter of 2022, and a reduction in our qualitative factors due to a 4.8 million reduction in non-accrual loans. 

The allowance
for credit losses on loans as a percentage of total loans held-for-investment was 1.08 at September 30, 2024, 1.08 at December
31, 2023, and 1.08 at September 30, 2023. 

The total ACL
is composed of three parts: the ACL for loans, the ACL for unfunded commitments, and the ACL for HTM investments. The ACL for
loans is further composed of the allowance for individually assessed loans, the allowance for collectively assessed expected losses,
the allowance for collectively assessed qualitative adjustments, and the allowance for collectively assessed additional allowance.
The allowance for collectively assessed qualitative adjustments is calculated using a set of qualitative factors, which at September
30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 included the following factors:

We have a significant
portion of our loan portfolio with real estate as the underlying collateral. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023,
approximately 91.5 and 91.7 , respectively, of the loan portfolio had real estate collateral. When loans, whether commercial
or personal, are granted, they are based on the borrower s ability to generate repayment cash flows from income sources
sufficient to service the debt. Real estate is generally taken to reinforce the likelihood of the ultimate repayment and as a
secondary source of repayment. We work closely with all our borrowers that experience cash flow or other economic problems, and
we believe that we have the appropriate processes in place to monitor and identify problem credits. There can be no assurance
that charge-offs of loans in future periods will not exceed the allowance for credit losses as estimated at any point in time
or that provisions for credit losses will not be significant to a particular accounting period. The allowance is also subject
to examination and testing for adequacy by regulatory agencies, which may consider such factors as the methodology used to determine
adequacy and the size of the allowance relative to that of peer institutions. Such regulatory agencies could require us to adjust
our allowance based on information available to them at the time of their examination. 

The non-performing
asset ratio was 0.04 of total assets with the nominal level of 874,000 in non-performing assets at September 30, 2024 compared
to 0.05 and 864,000 at December 31, 2023. Non-accrual loans increased to 119,000 at September 30, 2024 from 27,000 at December
31, 2023. We had one accruing loan past due 90 days or more at 211,000 at September 30, 2024 compared to 215,000 at December
31, 2023. Loans past due 30 days or more represented 0.11 of the loan portfolio at September 30, 2024 compared to 0.06 at December
31, 2023. The ratio of classified loans plus OREO and repossessed assets declined to 1.15 of total bank regulatory risk-based
capital at September 30, 2024 from 1.25 at December 31, 2023. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we experienced
net loan charge offs of 43,000 (charge-offs of 85,000 less recoveries of 42,000) and net overdraft charge-offs of 52,000 (charge-offs
of 64,000 and recoveries of 12,000). In comparison, we experienced net loan recoveries of 40,000 and net overdraft charge-offs
of 35,000 during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 

There were three loans
totaling 331,000 (0.03 of total loans) included on non-performing status (non-accrual loans and loans past due 90 days and still accruing)
at September 30, 2024. Two of these loans were on non-accrual status. The largest loan of the two is 117,000 and is secured by real
estate. The balance of the remaining loan on non-accrual status is 2,000. This loan is secured by a second mortgage lien. We had one
loan that was accruing loans past due 90 days or more at September 30, 2024. At both September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we considered
loan relationships exceeding 500,000 and on non-accrual status as individually assessed loans for the allowance for credit losses. At
both September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we had no individually assessed loans. The specific allowance for individually assessed
loans is based on the fair value of collateral method or present value of expected cash flows method. For collateral dependent loans,
the fair value of collateral method is used and the fair value is determined by an independent appraisal less estimated selling costs.
There was no specific allowance for credit losses on our individually assessed loans at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. At
September 30, 2024, we had 1.1 million in loans that were delinquent 30 days to 89 days representing 0.09 of total loans compared to
 498,000 or 0.04 of total loans at December 31, 2023.

Accrual of interest
is discontinued on loans when management believes, after considering economic and business conditions and collection efforts that
a borrower s financial condition is such that the collection of interest is doubtful. A delinquent loan is generally placed
in non-accrual status when it becomes 90 days or more past due. At the time a loan is placed in non-accrual status, all interest,
which has been accrued on the loan but remains unpaid is reversed and deducted from earnings as a reduction of reported interest
income. No additional interest is accrued on the loan balance until the collection of both principal and interest becomes reasonably
certain. 

Financial Position 

Assets increased
 115.9 million, or 6.3 (8.5 annualized), to 1.9 billion at September 30, 2024 from 1.8 billion at December 31, 2023. The increase
in assets was primarily due to increases in interest-bearing bank balances of 77.6 million and loans held-for-investment of 62.6
million, partially offset by decreases in investment securities available-for-sale of 12.7 million, investment securities held-to-maturity
of 5.0 million, and other assets of 2.3 million. 

49 

Loans and loans held-for-sale 

 Loans held-for-sale
decreased to 3.9 million at September 30, 2024 from 4.4 million at December 31, 2023. Loans (excluding loans held-for-sale)
increased 62.6 million, or 5.5 (7.4 annualized), to 1.2 billion at September 30, 2024 from 1.1 billion at December 31, 2023.
Total loan production, excluding mortgage secondary market and new construction residential real estate, was 138.3 million during
the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 147.1 million during the same period in 2023. Advances from unfunded commercial
construction loans available for draws were 71.3 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. Payoffs and paydowns
totaled 84.8 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 58.4 million during the same period in 2023. 

Total mortgage
production during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 123.7 million, 55.3 million of the production was originated
to be sold in the secondary market, 32.9 million of the loan production was originated as ARM loans for our loans held-for-investment
portfolio, and 35.5 million of the loan production was commitments for new construction residential real estate loans. Total
mortgage production during the nine months ended September 30, 2023 was 97.1 million, 35.5 million of the production was originated
to be sold in the secondary market, 22.5 million of the loan production was originated as ARM loans for our loans held-for-investment
portfolio, and 39.1 million of the loan production was commitments for new construction residential real estate loans. As these
ARM and new construction residential real estate loans are being held on our balance sheet as loans held-for-investment, the result
is additive to loan growth and interest income but results in less gain on sale fee income, which is reported in noninterest income
as mortgage banking income. The increase in mortgage production was due to higher secondary market, ARM, and construction residential
real estate loan production. 

The loan-to-deposit
ratio (including loans held-for-sale) at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 was 73.0 and 75.3 , respectively. The loan-to-deposit
ratio (excluding loans held-for-sale) at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 was 72.8 and 75.1 , respectively. 

One of our goals
as a community bank has been, and continues to be, to grow our assets through quality loan growth by providing credit to small
and mid-size businesses and individuals within the markets we serve. We remain committed to meeting the credit needs of our local
markets. Based on our loan portfolio as of September 30, 2024, the non-owner occupied commercial real estate loans and the construction
and land development loans were approximately 304 and 83 of total risk-based capital, respectively. Furthermore, our three-year
growth in non-owner occupied commercial real estate loans was 40 from September 30, 2021 to September 30, 2024. We have expertise
and a long history in originating and managing commercial real estate loans. We have a strong credit underwriting process, which
includes management and board oversight. We perform rigorous monitoring, stress testing, and reporting of these portfolios at
the management and board levels, and we continue to monitor the level of the concentration in commercial real estate loans within

In the context
of this discussion, a real estate mortgage loan is defined as any loan, other than loans for construction purposes and advances
on home equity lines of credit, secured by real estate, regardless of the purpose of the loan. Advances on home equity lines of
credit are included in consumer loans. We follow the common practice of financial institutions in our market areas of obtaining
a security interest in real estate whenever possible, in addition to any other available collateral. This collateral is taken
to reinforce the likelihood of the ultimate repayment of the loan and tends to increase the magnitude of the real estate loan
components. We generally limit the loan-to-value ratio to 80 .

Investment Securities 

 Investment securities
declined 19.4 million to 486.8 million, net of allowance for credit losses on investments of 24,000, at September 30, 2024
from 506.2 million, net of allowance for credit losses on investments of 30,000, at December 31, 2023. The decline was primarily
related to normal principal cash flows. 

On June 1, 2022,
we reclassified 224.5 million in investments to held-to-maturity (HTM) from available-for-sale (AFS). These securities were transferred
at fair value at the time of the transfer, which became the new cost basis for the securities held to maturity. The pretax unrealized
net holding loss on the available-for-sale securities on the date of transfer totaled approximately 16.7 million, and continued
to be reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss. This net unrealized loss is being amortized to interest
income over the remaining life of the securities as a yield adjustment. There were no gains or losses recognized as a result of
this transfer. The remaining pretax unrealized net holding loss on these investments was 12.7 million 10.0 million net of tax)
at September 30, 2024. Our HTM investments totaled 212.2 million and represented approximately 44 of our total investments at
September 30, 2024. Our AFS investments totaled 269.5 million or approximately 55 of our total investments at September 30,
2024. Our investments at cost totaled 5.1 million or approximately 1 of our total investments at September 30, 2024. The
unrealized losses on our investment securities are related to an increase in market interest rates, which has a temporary negative
impact on the fair value of our investment securities portfolio and on accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), which is
included in shareholders equity. 

At September
30, 2024, the estimated weighted average life of our total investment portfolio was 5.7 years, the modified duration was 4.4,
the effective duration was 3.4, and the weighted average tax equivalent book yield was 3.70 . 

 Other short-term
investments increased 77.6 million to 144.4 million at September 30, 2024 from 66.8 million at December 31, 2023 due to our
decision to temporarily hold excess liquidity in interest-bearing bank deposits at the Federal Reserve Bank. This additional liquidity
will be used to fund loan growth and or reduce borrowings and brokered certificates of deposit.

Deposits 

 Deposits
increased 133.1 million, or 8.8 (11.8 annualized), to 1.6 billion at September 30, 2024 compared to 1.5 billion at December
31, 2023. Our pure deposits, which are defined as total deposits less certificates of deposits, increased 64.5 million, or 5.0 
(6.7 annualized), to 1.3 billion at September 30, 2024 from 1.3 billion at December 31, 2023. We continue to focus on growing
our pure deposits in order to better manage our overall cost of funds. Certificates of deposits increased 68.6 million to 294.4
million at September 30, 2024 from 225.8 million at December 31, 2023. 

 We began
issuing brokered certificates of deposit during the third quarter of 2023 to supplement our funding mix. As of September 30, 2024,
we had 22.4 million in brokered certificates of deposit ranging in initial terms from 18 months to three years, with the three
year term callable after six months. We had 48.1 million and 48.1 million in brokered certificates of deposit at December 31,
2023 and at September 30, 2023, respectively. 

 Total uninsured
deposits were 492.5 million and 436.6 million at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. Included in uninsured
deposits at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 were 97.9 million and 82.8 million of deposits of states or political subdivisions
in the U.S., which are secured or collateralized, respectively. Total uninsured deposits, excluding these deposits that are secured
or collateralized, totaled 404.3 million, or 24.6 , of total deposits at September 30, 2024 and 353.8 million, or 23.4 , of
total deposits at December 31, 2023. The average balance of all customer deposit accounts at September 30, 2024 was 24,281. The
average balance for consumer accounts was 13,152 and the average balance for non-consumer accounts was 52,782.

Borrowed funds.
 Borrowed funds consist of fed funds purchased, securities sold under agreements to repurchase, FHLB advances and long-term
debt. Our long-term debt is a result of issuing 15.0 million in trust preferred securities. Short-term borrowings in the form
of securities sold under agreements to repurchase averaged 69.1 million, 70.0 million, and 71.5 million during the three months
ended September 30, 2024, December 31, 2023, and September 30, 2023, respectively. The average rates paid during these periods
were 2.91 , 2.79 , and 2.48 , respectively. The balances of securities sold under agreements to repurchase were 66.9 million,
 62.9 million, and 67.2 million at September 30, 2024, December 31, 2023, and September 30, 2023, respectively. The repurchase
agreements all mature within one to four days and are generally originated with customers that have other relationships with us
and tend to provide a stable and predictable source of funding. Federal funds purchased averaged 40,000, zero, and 1.6 million
during the three months ended September 30, 2024, December 31, 2023, and September 30, 2023, respectively. The average rates paid
during these periods were 0.00 , 0.00 , and 5.00 , respectively. Federal funds purchased were 3.7 million, zero, and zero at
September 30, 2024, December 2023, and September 30, 2023, respectively. As a member of the FHLB, the Bank has access to advances
from the FHLB for various terms and amounts. FHLB advances averaged 50.0 million, 84.0 million, and 83.3 million during the
three months ended September 30, 2024, December 31, 2023, and September 30, 2023, respectively. The average rates paid during
these periods were 5.14 , 5.07 , and 5.14 , respectively. The balances of FHLB advances were 50.0 million, 90.0 million, and
 80.0 million at September 30, 2024, December 31, 2023, and September 30, 2023, respectively. 

The 50.0 million
in FHLB advances at September 30, 2024 had maturity dates between December 9, 2024, and November 3, 2026 with interest rates between
4.81 and 5.26 . 

We issued
 15.5 million in trust preferred securities on September 16, 2004. During the fourth quarter of 2015, we redeemed 500,000 of
these securities. Until the cessation of LIBOR on September 30, 2023, the securities accrued and paid distributions quarterly
at a rate of three month LIBOR plus 257 basis points, thereafter, such distributions to be paid quarterly transitioned to an adjusted
Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR) index in accordance with the Federal Reserve s final rule implementing the Adjustable
Interest Rate Act. The remaining debt may be redeemed in full anytime with notice and matures on September 16, 2034. Trust preferred
securities averaged 15.0 million during the three months ended September 30, 2024, December 31, 2023, and September 30, 2023.
The average rates during these periods were 8.24 , 8.33 , and 8.19 , respectively. The balances of trust preferred securities
were 15.0 million as of September 30, 2024, December 31, 2023, and September 30, 2023. 

 Total shareholders 
equity increased 12.3 million, or 9.3 , to 143.3 million at September 30, 2024 from 131.1 million at December 31, 2023. Shareholders 
equity was 7.4 of total assets at September 30, 2024 and 7.2 at December 31, 2023. The 12.3 million increase in shareholders 
equity was due to a 6.5 million increase in retention of earnings resulting from 9.7 million in net income less 3.3 million
in dividends, a 521,000 increase due to employee and director stock awards, a 313,000 increase due to dividend reinvestment
plan (DRIP) purchases, and a 5.0 million improvement in accumulated other comprehensive loss. The improvement in other accumulated
other comprehensive loss for the period was due to improvements in the accumulated other comprehensive loss on available-for-sale
securities, net of tax expense, of 3.9 million and the reclassification adjustment for amortization of unrealized losses on securities
transferred from available-for-sale to held-to-maturity, net of tax expense, of 1.0 million. 

On April 20,
2022, we announced that our board of directors approved the repurchase of up to 375,000 shares of our common stock (the 2022
Repurchase Plan ), which represented approximately 5 of our shares outstanding at the time of the announcement. No repurchases
were made under the 2022 Repurchase Plan prior to its expiration at the market close on December 31, 2023. 

On May 14, 2024,
we announced that our Board of Directors approved a plan to utilize up to 7.1 million of capital to repurchase shares of our
common stock (the 2024 Repurchase Plan ), which represented approximately 5.3 of total shareholders equity
at the time of the announcement. No repurchases have been made under the 2024 Repurchase Plan. The 2024 Repurchase Plan expires
at the market close on May 13, 2025.

Market Risk Management 

Market risk reflects
the risk of economic loss resulting from adverse changes in market prices and interest rates. The risk of loss can be measured
in either diminished current market values or reduced current and potential net income. Our primary market risk is interest rate
risk. We have established an Asset/Liability Committee of the board of directors (the ALCO ), which has members from
our board of directors and management to monitor and manage interest rate risk. Our ALCO 

monitors our compliance with regulatory
 guidance in the formulation and implementation of our interest rate risk program; 

reviews the results of our interest rate
 risk modeling quarterly to assess whether we have appropriately measured our interest rate risk, mitigated our exposures appropriately
 and confirmed that any residual risk is acceptable; 

monitors and manages the pricing and maturity
 of our assets and liabilities in order to diminish the potential adverse impact that changes in interest rates could have
 on our net interest income; and 

has established policies, policy guidelines,
 and strategies with respect to interest rate risk exposure and liquidity. 

Further, our
ALCO and board of directors explicitly review our ALCO policies at least annually and review our ALCO assumptions and policy limits
quarterly. 

We employ a monitoring
technique to measure our interest sensitivity gap, which is the positive or negative dollar difference between assets
and liabilities that are subject to interest rate repricing within a given period of time. Simulation modeling is performed to
assess the impact varying interest rates and balance sheet mix assumptions will have on net interest income. We model the impact
on net interest income for several different changes in the yield curve. We model the impact on net interest income in an increasing
and decreasing rate environment of 100, 200, 300, and 400 basis points. We also periodically stress certain assumptions such as
loan prepayment rates, deposit decay rates and interest rate betas to evaluate our overall sensitivity to changes in interest
rates. Policies have been established in an effort to maintain the maximum anticipated negative impact of these modeled changes
in net interest income at no more than 10 , 15 , 20 , and 20 , respectively, in a 100, 200, 300, and 400 basis point change in
interest rates over the first 12-month period subsequent to interest rate changes. Interest rate sensitivity can be managed by
repricing assets or liabilities, selling securities available-for-sale, replacing an asset or liability at maturity, by adjusting
the interest rate during the life of an asset or liability, or by the use of derivatives such as interest rate swaps and other
hedging instruments. Managing the amount of assets and liabilities repricing in the same time interval helps to hedge the risk
and minimize the impact on net interest income of rising or falling interest rates. Neither the gap analysis or
asset/liability modeling are precise indicators of our interest sensitivity position due to the many factors that affect net interest
income including, the timing, magnitude, and frequency of interest rate changes as well as changes in the volume and mix of earning
assets and interest-bearing liabilities. 

Based on the many
factors and assumptions used in simulating the effect of changes in interest rates, the following table estimates the hypothetical
percentage change in net interest income at September 30, 2024 and at December 31, 2023 over the subsequent 12 months. We were
liability sensitive at September 30, 2024 and primarily liability sensitive at December 31, 2023. In 2023, we increased our
non-maturity deposit interest rate betas in increasing rate environments, which increased our liability sensitivity. This was
partially offset by the previously mentioned 150.0 million Pay-Fixed Swap Agreement that we entered into effective May 5, 2023.
Furthermore, we reduced the average life on our non-maturity deposits at June 30, 2024. As a
result, our modeling, at September 30, 2024, reflects a decrease in net interest
income in a rising interest rate environment during the first 12-month period subsequent to interest rate changes. The negative
impact of rising rates on net interest income is slightly more liability sensitive during the second 12-month period subsequent to
interest rate changes. In a declining interest rate environment, the model reflects increases in net interest income during both the first 12-month period and the second 12-month period subsequent to interest rate
changes. The increase and decrease of 100, 200, 300, and 400 basis points, respectively, reflected in the table below assume
a simultaneous and parallel change in interest rates along the entire yield curve. As a result, our modeling, at December 31, 2023,
reflects a decrease in net interest income in a rising interest rate environment during the first 12-month period subsequent to
interest rate changes. The negative impact of rising rates on net interest income is slightly less liability sensitive during the
second 12-month period subsequent to interest rate changes. In a declining interest rate environment, the model reflects increases
in net interest income in the down 100 basis point and down 200 basis point scenarios and declines in net interest income in the
down 300 basis point and 400 basis point scenarios during the first 12-month period subsequent to interest rate changes. The
positive impact in the down 100 and down 200 basis point scenarios of declining rates changes to a fairly neutral impact on net
interest income during the second 12-month period subsequent to interest rate changes. The increase and decrease of 100, 200, 300,
and 400 basis points, respectively, reflected in the table below assume a simultaneous and parallel change in interest rates along
the entire yield curve.

During the second
12-month period after 100 basis point, 200 basis point, 300 basis point, and 400 basis point simultaneous and parallel increases
in interest rates along the entire yield curve, our net interest income is projected to decline
2.24 , 5.46 , 9.49 , and 13.65 , respectively, at September 30, 2024, and 1.94 , 4.67 , 7.63 , and 10.68 , respectively,
at December 31, 2023. During the second 12-month period after 100 basis point, 200 basis point, 300 basis point, and 400 basis
point simultaneous and parallel reduction in interest rates along the entire yield curve, our net interest income is projected
to increase 1.88 , 3.04 , 2.24 , and 0.39 , respectively, at September

valuation analysis projecting future cash flows from assets and liabilities to determine the Present Value of Equity PVE over a range of changes in market interest rates. The sensitivity of PVE to changes in interest rates is a measure of the sensitivity
of earnings over a longer time horizon. Policies have been established in an effort to maintain the maximum anticipated negative
impact of these modeled changes in PVE at no more than 15 , 20 , 25 , and 25 , respectively, in a 100, 200, 300, and 400 basis
point change in market interest rates. Our PVE declines in all of the down interest rate
scenarios and the up 400 basis point scenarios at September 30, 2024. However, our PVE increases slightly in the up
100, up 200, and up 300 basis point scenarios at September 30, 2024. Based on PVE, we were primarily asset sensitive at December
31, 2023.

Liquidity and Capital Resources 

Liquidity management
involves monitoring sources and uses of funds in order to meet our day-to-day cash flow requirements while maximizing profits. Liquidity
represents our ability to convert assets into cash or cash equivalents without significant loss and to raise additional funds by increasing
liabilities. Liquidity management is made more complicated because different balance sheet components are subject to varying degrees
of management control. For example, the timing of maturities of the investment portfolio is very predictable and subject to a high degree
of control at the time investment decisions are made. However, net deposit inflows and outflows are far less predictable and are not
subject to nearly the same degree of control. Asset liquidity is provided by cash and assets which are readily marketable, or which can
be pledged or will mature in the near future. Liability liquidity is provided by access to core funding sources, principally the ability
to generate customer deposits in our market area. In addition, liability liquidity is provided through the ability to borrow against
approved lines of credit (federal funds purchased) from correspondent banks, to borrow on a secured basis through the Federal Reserve
Discount Window, and to borrow on a secured basis through securities sold under agreements to repurchase. Furthermore, the Bank is a
member of the FHLB and has the ability to obtain advances for various periods of time. These advances are secured by eligible securities
pledged by the Bank or assignment of eligible loans within the Bank s portfolio. 

We began issuing
brokered certificates of deposit during the third quarter of 2023 to supplement our funding mix. As of September 30, 2024, we
had 22.4 million in brokered certificates of deposit ranging in initial terms from 18 months to three years, with the three year
term callable after six months. We had 48.1 million and 48.1 million in brokered certificates of deposit at December 31, 2023
and at September 30, 2023, respectively. We believe that we have ample liquidity to meet the needs of our customers through our
low-cost deposits, ability to borrow against approved lines of credit (federal funds purchased) from correspondent banks, ability
to borrow on a secured basis through the Federal Reserve Discount Window, and ability to obtain advances secured by certain securities
and loans from the FHLB. 

We generally
maintain a high level of liquidity and adequate capital, which along with continued retained earnings, we believe will be sufficient
to fund the operations of the Bank for at least the next 12 months. Furthermore, we believe that we will have access to adequate
liquidity and capital to support the long-term operations of the Bank. 

The Bank maintains
federal funds purchased lines in the total amount of 77.5 million with three financial institutions and 10.0 million through
the Federal Reserve Discount Window. We utilized 3.7 million of our federal funds purchased lines at September 30, 2024 and none
at December 31, 2023. The FHLB of Atlanta has approved a line of credit of up to 25.00 of the Bank s total assets, which,
when utilized, is collateralized by a pledge against specific investment securities and/or eligible loans. We had 50.0 million
in FHLB advances at September 30, 2024 compared to 90.0 million at December 31, 2023. The FHLB advances at September 30, 2024
had maturity dates between December 9, 2024, and November 3, 2026 with interest rates between 4.81 and 5.26 . At September 30,
2024, we have remaining credit availability under this facility in excess of 421.1 million, subject to collateral requirements.
Combined, we have total remaining credit availability, subject to collateral requirements, in excess of 505.0 million as compared
to uninsured deposits excluding deposits of states or political subdivisions in the U.S., which are secured or collateralized,
of 404.3 million as previously noted. 

Through the operations
of our Bank, we have made contractual commitments to extend credit in the ordinary course of our business activities. These commitments
are legally binding agreements to lend money to our customers at predetermined interest rates for a specified period of time.
At September 30, 2024, we had issued commitments to extend unused credit of 174.8 million, including 63.5 million in unused
home equity lines of credit, through various types of lending arrangements. At December 31, 2023, we had issued commitments to
extend unused credit of 214.2 million, including 53.1 million in unused home equity lines of credit, through various types of
lending arrangements. We evaluate each customer s credit worthiness on a case-by-case basis. The amount of collateral obtained,
if deemed necessary by us upon extension of credit, is based on our credit evaluation of the borrower. Collateral varies but may
include accounts receivable, inventory, property, plant and equipment, commercial and residential real estate. We manage the credit
risk on these commitments by subjecting them to normal underwriting and risk management processes. 

We regularly
review our liquidity position and have implemented internal policies establishing guidelines for sources of asset-based liquidity
and evaluate and monitor the total amount of purchased funds used to support the balance sheet and funding from non-core sources. 

 Regulatory capital
rules known as the Basel III rules or Basel III, impose minimum capital requirements for bank holding companies and banks. Basel
III was released in the form of enforceable regulations by each of the applicable federal bank regulatory agencies. Basel III
is applicable to all banking organizations that are subject to minimum capital requirements, including federal and state banks
and savings and loan associations, as well as to bank and savings and loan holding companies, other than small bank holding
companies. A small bank holding company is generally a qualifying bank holding company or savings and loan holding company
with less than 3.0 billion in consolidated assets. More stringent requirements are imposed on advanced approaches 
banking organizations-generally those organizations with 250 billion or more in total consolidated assets or 10 billion or more
in total foreign exposures. 

57 

Based
on the foregoing, as a small bank holding company, we are generally not subject to the capital requirements at the holding company
level unless otherwise advised by the Federal Reserve; however, our Bank remains subject to the capital requirements. Accordingly,
the Bank is required to maintain the following capital levels: 

a Common Equity Tier 1 risk-based capital
 ratio of 4.5 ; 

a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 6 ; 

a total risk-based capital ratio of 8 ;
 and 

a leverage ratio of 4 . 

Basel III also
established a capital conservation buffer above the regulatory minimum capital requirements, which must consist
entirely of Common Equity Tier 1 capital, which was phased in over several years. The fully phased-in capital conservation buffer
of 2.5 , which became effective on January 1, 2019, resulted in the following effective minimum capital ratios for the Bank beginning
in 2019: (i) a Common Equity Tier 1 capital ratio of 7.0 , (ii) a Tier 1 capital ratio of 8.5 , and (iii) a total capital ratio
of 10.5 . Under Basel III, institutions are subject to limitations on paying dividends, engaging in share repurchases, and paying
discretionary bonuses if their capital levels fall below the buffer amount. These limitations establish a maximum percentage of
eligible retained income that could be utilized for such actions. 

Under Basel III,
Tier 1 capital includes two components: Common Equity Tier 1 capital and additional Tier 1 capital. The highest form of capital,
Common Equity Tier 1 capital, consists solely of common stock (plus related surplus), retained earnings, accumulated other comprehensive
income, otherwise referred to as AOCI, and limited amounts of minority interests that are in the form of common stock. Additional
Tier 1 capital is primarily comprised of noncumulative perpetual preferred stock, Tier 1 minority interests and grandfathered
trust preferred securities. Tier 2 capital generally includes the allowance for credit losses up to 1.25 of risk-weighted assets,
qualifying preferred stock, subordinated debt and qualifying Tier 2 minority interests, less any deductions in Tier 2 instruments
of an unconsolidated financial institution. AOCI is presumptively included in Common Equity Tier 1 capital and often would operate
to reduce this category of capital. When implemented, Basel III provided a one-time opportunity at the end of the first quarter
of 2015 for covered banking organizations to opt out of a large part of this treatment of AOCI. We made this opt-out election
and, as a result, retained our pre-existing treatment for AOCI. 

On December 21,
2018, the federal banking agencies issued a joint final rule to revise their regulatory capital rules to (i) address the upcoming
implementation of a new credit impairment model, the CECL model; (ii) provide an optional three-year phase-in period for the day-one
adverse regulatory capital effects that banking organizations are expected to experience upon adopting CECL; and (iii) require
the use of CECL in stress tests beginning with the 2023 capital planning and stress testing cycle for certain banking organizations
that are subject to stress testing. As part of its response to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, in the first quarter of 2020,
U.S. federal regulatory authorities issued an interim final rule that provided banking organizations that adopted the CECL during
the 2020 calendar year with the option to delay for two years the estimated impact of CECL on regulatory capital relative to regulatory
capital determined under the prior incurred loss methodology, followed by a three-year transition period to phase out the aggregate
amount of the capital benefit provided during the initial two-year delay (i.e., a five-year transition in total). In connection
with our adoption of CECL on January 1, 2023, we did not elect to utilize the three-year phase-in period for the day-one adverse
regulatory capital effects or the five-year CECL transition. 

In November 2019,
the federal banking regulators published final rules implementing a simplified measure of capital adequacy for certain banking
organizations that have less than 10.0 billion in total consolidated assets. Under the final rules, which went into effect on
January 1, 2020, depository institutions and depository institution holding companies that have less than 10 billion in total
consolidated assets and meet other qualifying criteria, including a leverage ratio of greater than 9 , off-balance-sheet exposures
of 25 or less of total consolidated assets, and trading assets plus trading liabilities of 5 or less of total consolidated assets,
are deemed qualifying community banking organizations and are eligible to opt into the community bank leverage
ratio framework. A qualifying community banking organization that elects to use the community bank leverage ratio framework
and that maintains a leverage ratio of greater than 9 is considered to have satisfied the generally applicable risk-based and
leverage capital requirements under the Basel III rules and, if applicable, is considered to have met the well capitalized 
ratio requirements for purposes of its primary federal regulator s prompt corrective action rules, discussed below. We do
not have any immediate plans to elect to use the community bank leverage ratio framework but may make such an election in the
future. 

58 

As outlined
above, we are generally not subject to the Federal Reserve capital requirements unless advised otherwise because we qualify as
a small bank holding company. Our Bank remains subject to capital requirements including a minimum leverage ratio and a minimum
ratio of qualifying capital to risk weighted assets. As of September 30, 2024, the Bank met all capital adequacy
requirements under the rules on a fully phased-in basis.

Under
the Basel III rules, we anticipate that the Bank will remain a well capitalized institution for at least the next 12 months. Furthermore,
based on our strong capital, conservative underwriting, and internal stress testing, we believe that we will have access to adequate
capital to support the long-term operations of the Bank. However, the Bank s reported and regulatory capital ratios could
be adversely impacted by future credit losses related to an economic recession. 

As
a bank holding company, our ability to declare and pay dividends is dependent on certain federal and state regulatory considerations,
including the guidelines of the Federal Reserve. The Federal Reserve has issued a policy statement regarding the payment of dividends
by bank holding companies. In general, the Federal Reserve s policies provide that dividends should be paid only out of
current earnings and only if the prospective rate of earnings retention by the bank holding company appears consistent with the
organization s capital needs, asset quality and overall financial condition. The Federal Reserve s policies also require
that a bank holding company serve as a source of financial strength to its subsidiary bank(s) by standing ready to use available
resources to provide adequate capital funds to those banks during periods of financial stress or adversity and by maintaining
the financial flexibility and capital-raising capacity to obtain additional resources for assisting its subsidiary banks where
necessary. In addition, under the prompt corrective action regulations, the ability of a bank holding company to pay dividends
may be restricted if a subsidiary bank becomes undercapitalized. These regulatory policies could affect our ability to pay dividends
or otherwise engage in capital distributions. Our Board of Directors approved a cash dividend for the third quarter of 2024 of
 0.15 per common share. This dividend is payable on November 12, 2024 to shareholders of record of our common stock as of
October 29, 2024. 

 As we are a legal
entity separate and distinct from the Bank and do not conduct stand-alone operations, our ability to pay dividends depends on
the ability of the Bank to pay dividends to us, which is also subject to regulatory restrictions. As a South Carolina-chartered
bank, the Bank is subject to limitations on the amount of dividends that it is permitted to pay. Unless otherwise instructed by
the South Carolina Board of Financial Institutions, the Bank is generally permitted under South Carolina State banking regulations
to pay cash dividends of up to 100 of net income in any calendar year without obtaining the prior approval of the South Carolina
Board of Financial Institutions. The FDIC also has the authority under federal law to enjoin a bank from engaging in what in its
opinion constitutes an unsafe or unsound practice in conducting its business, including the payment of a dividend under certain
circumstances.

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative
Disclosures About Market Risk. 

Not applicable. 

 Item 4. Controls and Procedures. 

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls
and Procedures 

Management, including
our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, has evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures
(as defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e)) as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based upon that
evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were
effective to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports we file and submit under the Exchange Act is (i)
recorded, processed, summarized and reported as and when required and (ii) accumulated and communicated to our management, including
our Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 

The design of
any system of controls and procedures is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events. There can
be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions, regardless of
how remote. 

Changes in Internal Control over
Financial Reporting 

There has been
no change in our internal control over financial reporting during the three months ended September 30, 2024 that has materially
