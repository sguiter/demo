 Accordingly, unless indicated otherwise, all the current period and historical per share data, number of shares issued and outstanding, stock awards, and other common stock equivalents for the periods presented in this Interim Report on Form 10-Q have been adjusted retroactively, where applicable, to reflect the Reverse Stock Split. There was change to the shares authorized or in the par value per share of common stock of . The Reverse Stock Split affected all stockholders uniformly and did not alter any stockholder s percentage interest in the Company s equity. The Company did not issue fractional shares in connection with the Reverse Stock Split. Stockholders who were otherwise entitled to fractional shares of common stock were instead entitled to receive a proportional cash payment. The number of shares of common stock issuable under the Company's equity incentive plans and exercisable under the outstanding warrants were also proportionately adjusted.

The Company has a limited history of operations and has incurred negative cash flows from operating activities and losses from operations in the past as reflected in the accumulated deficit of million as of September 30, 2024.

Management believes that existing cash and cash equivalents, marketable securities, and the Standby Equity Purchase Agreement (the "Facility Agreement," Note 10) will be sufficient to fund operating and capital expenditure requirements through at least from the date of issuance of these condensed consolidated financial statements.

The fair value of the private placement and Series A warrant liabilities is based on significant unobservable inputs, which represent Level 3 measurements within the fair value hierarchy. In determining the fair value of the warrant liabilities, the Company used the Black-Scholes option-pricing model to estimate the fair value using unobservable inputs including the expected term, expected volatility, risk-free interest rate, and dividend yield.

In Novem ber 2023, the Company made an investment in shares of preferred stock of a private company for a cash consideration of mill ion, which is classified as non-marketable equity investment. The Company s investment in the private company represents less than of total capitalization. The Company neither has significant influence over the private company nor does the investment amount to a controlling financial interest in the private company. The Company elected to apply the measurement alternative, and as such, records the investment at cost minus impairment, if any, plus or minus changes resulting from qualifying observable price changes in orderly transactions. During the period ended September 30, 2024, the Company did not identify any impairment or observable price changes for this non-marketable equity investment.

The PIPE Shares are recorded as outstanding common stock. Standby Equity Purchase Agreement On November 8, 2023, the Company also entered into a Standby Equity Purchase Agreement (as amended from time to time, the Facility Agreement with entities affiliated with Sylebra, pursuant to which the Company will have the right, but not the obligation to sell to Sylebra up to million of its shares of convertible redeemable non-voting preferred stock, subject to satisfaction of certain conditions, by November 8, 2026. Each sale the Company requests under the Facility Agreement (each, an Advance and collectively, the Advances may be for a number of shares of preferred stock with an aggregate value of at least million but not more than million (except with Sylebra s consent). When a nd if issued, the preferred stock will be issued at a price per share of . Holders of the preferred stock will be entitled to a quarterly dividend at the rate of per annum payable in cash or in kind at the option of the Company. The preferred stock will have an initial liquidation preference of per share, plus accrued dividends. The preferred stock will have no voting rights as a class or series except in such instances as required by Delaware law or certain matters enumerated in the Facility Agreement related to the protection of the preferred stock. The prefe rred stock will be convertible at the option of the holders into the number of shares of common stock equal to divided by the then-applicable conversion price. At any time after the two year anniversary of any issuance of any series of preferred stock, the Company will have the option to convert all (but not less than all) of any series of then-outstanding preferred stock by paying a make-whole payment, in either stock or cash, equal to three years of dividends, provided that the closing price of the common stock exceeds of the then-applicable conversion price for at least out of consecutive trading days prior to the date of conversion. To the extent, if any, a conversion would result in the holder thereof becoming the beneficial owner of more than of the Company s outstanding common stock, the Company will issue to such holder a pre-funded warrant in the form attached to the Facility Agreement. The preferred stock will be subject to customary pre-emptive rights. unit volume , the trading price of the common stock being below at the time of the Advance request and other customary conditions.

The issuance costs related to the Facility Agreement were expensed as incurred as it failed to meet the equity classification guidance under ASC 815-40, and were deemed to be a derivative asset. The fair value of the derivative asset was not material as of and for the period ended September 30, 2024. In addition, upo n receipt of stockholder approval in December 2023, the Company issued to Sylebra Series A Warrants to purchase shares of common stock at an exercise price of . The Company analyzed the Series A Warrants and determined that they are freestanding and do not exhibit any of the characteristics within ASC 480, and as such do not meet the characteristics of a liability under ASC 480. However, Series A Warrants do not meet all requirements for equity classification under ASC 815, and therefore are classified as a liability on the Company s consolidated balance sheets. As of September 30, 2024, the Company had Series A Warrants outstanding. The Series A Warrants were issued as consideration for entering into the Facility Agreement as discussed above. Each Series A Warrant is currently exercisable and expires in December 2027. Holders shall not have the right to exercise the Series A Warrants to the extent such person would beneficially own in excess of of the Company s outstanding common stock immediately after giving effect to such exercise. The exercise p rice and number of shares of common stock issuable upon exercise of the Series A Warrants may be adjusted in certain circumstances including in the event of a stock dividend or split, subsequent rights offerings, pro rata purchases, merger, reorganization, recapitalization, or spin-off. However, the Series A Warrants will not be adjusted for issuances of shares of common stock at a price below their respective exercise prices. The Series A Warrants do not entitle the holders to any voting rights, dividends or other rights as a stockholder of the Company prior to being exercised for common stock.

If satisfaction of the performance condition is not probable, stock-based compensation cost recognition is deferred until it becomes probable. The Company reassesses the probability as to whether satisfaction of the performance condition is prob able on a quarterly basis, and stock-based compensation cost is adjusted based on the portion of the requisite service provided. These PBRSUs neither carry rights to dividends nor voting rights until the shares are issued or transferred to the recipient. Awards are forfeited if an employee leaves the Company before the PBRSUs vest or the performance period lapses. The weighted-average grant date PBRSU fair value of per share is determined based upon the market closing price of the Company s com mon stock on the date of grant. As of September 30, 2024, the total unrecognized compensation expense related to the performance-based PBRSUs was million, which is expected to be amortized over a weighted-average period of years. In May 2023, the Company also granted a total of market-based PBRSUs to certain executives that vest over a multi-year period, upon continued service and wh en the volume-weighted average price per share VWAP Average of the Company s common stock for the preceding 30 consecutive trading days equals or exceeds the target stock price for the indicated year. The Company recognizes stock-based compensation based upon the grant date fair value on an accelerated attribution basis over the requisite service period of the award. Provided that the requisite service is rendered, the total fair value of the market-based PBRSUs at the date of grant is recognized as compensation expense even if the market condition is not achieved. However, the number of shares that ultimately vest can vary significantly with the achievement of the specified market criteria. These PBRSUs neither carry rights to dividends nor voting rights until the shares are issued or transferred to the recipient. Awards are forfeited if an employee leaves the Company before the PBRSUs vest. The weighted-average grant date fair value of the market-based PBRSUs was per share. -

Litigation From time to time, the Company is involved in actions, claims, suits, and other proceedings in the ordinary course of business, including assertions by third parties relating to intellectual property infringement, breaches of contract or warranties, or employment-related matters. When it is both probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated, the Company records a liability for such loss contingencies. The Company s estimates regarding potential losses and materiality are based on the Company s judgment and assessment of the claims utilizing currently available information. Although the Company will continue to reassess its reserves and estimates based on future developments, the Company s objective assessment of the legal merits of such claims may not always be predictive of the outcome and actual results may vary from the Company s current estimates. Litigation other matters On March 7, 2024, a putative class action lawsuit was filed in the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware against InterPrivate Acquisition Management LLC, InterPrivate LLC, and former directors and officers of IPV. The lawsuit is captioned Louis Smith v. Ahmed M. Fattouh, et al., (Del. Ch. 2024). On June 3, 2024, a second putative class action lawsuit was filed in the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware against IPV and Soroush Salehian and Mina Rezk (collectively, the Delaware Stockholder Litigation ). Among other remedies, the complaints seek damages and attorneys fees and costs. In connection with the Business Combination, the Company agreed to assume certain indemnification obligations to IPV s former directors and officers. On July 2, 2024, the Company and the parties to the Delaware Stockholder Litigation entered into a term sheet, which is being memorialized into a formal settlement agreement and which will be subject to court approval, to fully and finally resolve the Delaware Stockholder Litigation. In connection with the settlement, the Company has agreed to pay a total settlement cost of million in exchange for a release of all claims related to the business combination and expects to recover million from insurance carrier. The settlement is being paid pursuant to the Company s indemnification obligations and from available director and officer insurance policies. As of September 30, 2024, the Company has accrued a contingent liability of million in other current liabilities on the accompanying condensed consolidated balance sheets in connection with the settlement of the Delaware Stockholder Litigation, and a million insurance recovery in other current assets on the accompanying condensed consolidated balance sheets. The Company has also incurred legal expenses in connection with the Delaware Stockholder Litigation, which have been expensed as incurred and are included in general and administrative expenses in the accompanying condensed consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss.

 Item 2. Management s Discus sion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. 
 The following discussion of Aeva s results of operations and financial condition should be read in conjunction with the information set forth in the condensed consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. This discussion may contain forward-looking statements based upon Aeva s current expectations, estimates, and projections that involve risks and uncertainties. Actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements due to, among other considerations, the matters discussed in Part I, Item 1A of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 (the 2023 Form 10-K under the heading Risk Factors and Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements. Unless the context otherwise requires, all references in this section to we, our, us the Company or Aeva refer to the business of Aeva Technologies, Inc., a Delaware corporation, and its subsidiaries. 
 On March 18, 2024, we filed a Certificate of Amendment to our Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation (the Amendment with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware to effect a 1-for-5 reverse stock split (the Reverse Stock Split of shares of common stock, 0.0001 par value (the common stock ). Pursuant to the Reverse Stock Split, every five (5) shares of issued and outstanding shares of common stock were combined into one (1) share of common stock. All share and per share amounts presented herein have been retroactively adjusted to reflect the Reverse Stock Split. There was no change to the shares authorized or in the par value per share of common stock of 0.0001. 
 The Reverse Stock Split affected all stockholders uniformly and did not alter any stockholder s percentage interest in the Company s equity. The Company did not issue fractional shares in connection with the Reverse Stock Split. Stockholders who were otherwise entitled to fractional shares of common stock were instead entitled to receive a proportional cash payment. The number of shares of common stock issuable under our equity incentive plans and exercisable under the outstanding warrants were also proportionately adjusted. 
 Overview 
 Our vision is to bring perception to broad applications. Through our Frequency Modulated Continuous Wave ("FMCW") sensing technology, we believe we are introducing the world s first 4D LiDAR-on-chip that, along with our proprietary software applications, has the potential to enable the adoption of LIDAR across broad applications. 
 Founded in 2017 by former Apple engineers Soroush Salehian and Mina Rezk and led by a multidisciplinary team of engineers and operators experienced in the field of sensing and perception, Aeva s mission is to bring the next wave of perception technology to broad applications from automated driving to industrial automation, consumer device applications, and security. Our 4D LiDAR-on-chip combines silicon photonics technology that is proven in the telecom industry with precise instant velocity measurements and long-range performance for commercialization. 
 As a development stage company, we work closely with our customers on the development and commercialization of their programs and the utilization of our products in such programs. Thus far, our customers have purchased prototype products and engineering services from us for use in their research and development programs. We are expanding our manufacturing capacity through third-party manufacturers to meet our customers anticipated demand for the production of our products. 
 Unlike legacy 3D LiDAR, which relies on Time-of-Flight ToF technology and measures only depth and reflectivity, Aeva s solution leverages a proprietary FMCW technology to measure velocity in addition to depth, reflectivity and inertial motion. We believe the ability of Aeva s solution to measure instant velocity for every pixel is a significant advantage over ToF-based sensing solutions. Furthermore, Aeva s technology is free from interference from other LiDAR and sunlight, and our core innovations within FMCW are intended to enable autonomous vehicles to see at significantly higher distances of up to 500 meters. 
 We believe Aeva is uniquely positioned to provide a superior solution with the potential to enable higher level of automation for vehicles. Furthermore, we believe the advantages of our 4D LiDAR-on-chip allow us to provide the first LiDAR solution that is fully integrated onto a chip with superior performance at scale, with the potential to drive new categories of perception across industrial automation, consumer devices, and security markets. 
 Key Factors Affecting Aeva s Operating Results 
 We believe that Aeva's future performance and success depends to a substantial extent on our ability to capitalize opportunities, which in turn is subject to significant risks and challenges, including those discussed in Part I, Item 1A of the 2023 Form 10-K under the heading Risk Factors. 
 Pricing, Product Cost and Margins. Our pricing and margins will depend on the volumes and the features, as well as specific market applications of the solutions we provide to our customers. We have customers with technologies in various stages of development across different market segments. We anticipate that our prices will vary by market and application due to market-specific product and commercial requirements, supply and demand dynamics and product lifecycles. 
 Aeva s future performance will depend on our ability to deliver on economies of scale. Our customers will require that our perception solutions be manufactured and sold at per-unit prices that are competitive. Our ability to compete in key markets will depend on the success of our efforts to efficiently and reliably produce cost-effective perception solutions that are competitively priced and affordable for our commercial-stage customers. 
 Additionally, the macroeconomic conditions in the industry, the growing emergence of competition in advanced assisted driving sensing and software technologies globally can negatively impact pricing, margins and market share. If Aeva does not generate the margins we expect upon commercialization of our perception solutions, Aeva may be required to raise additional debt or equity capital, which may not be available or may only be available on terms that are onerous or highly dilutive to our stockholders.

Table of Contents 

 Commercialization of LiDAR-based Applications. We expect that our results of operations, including revenue and gross margins, will fluctuate on a quarterly basis for the foreseeable future as our customers continue on research and development projects and begin to commercialize advanced driver assist, autonomous and industrial automation solutions that rely on LiDAR technology. As more customers reach the commercialization phase and as the market for LiDAR solutions matures, these fluctuations in our operating results may become less pronounced. 
 Sales Volume . Each product program will have an expected range of sales volumes, depending on the end market demand for our customers products as well as market application. This can depend on several factors, including market penetration, product capabilities, size of the end market that the product addresses and our end customers ability to sell their products. In addition to end market demand, sales volumes also depend on whether our customer is in the development or production phase. In certain cases, we may provide volume discounts or strategic customer pricing on sales of our solutions, which may or may not be offset by lower manufacturing costs related to higher volumes which in turn could adversely impact our gross margins. Aeva s ability to ultimately achieve profitability is dependent upon progression of existing relationships to production and our ability to meet required volumes and required cost targets and gross margins. Delays of our current and future customers programs could result in Aeva being unable to achieve our revenue targets and profitability in the time frame we anticipate. Such delays could result in Aeva requiring to raise additional debt or equity capital, which may not be available or may only be available on terms that are onerous or highly dilutive to our stockholders. 
 Basis of Presentation 
 Our condensed consolidated financial statements include the accounts of our wholly owned subsidiaries. We have eliminated intercompany accounts and transactions.

 Selling and marketing expenses increased by 0.2 million, or 4 , to 5.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, from 5.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase was primarily due to an increase in payroll related expenses. 
 Litigation settlement, net 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we recorded a litigation settlement expense (net) of 11.5 million, related to the Delaware Stockholder Litigation (as defined in Note 15 to our condensed consolidated financial statements). 
 Interest income 
 Interest income decreased by 0.2 million, or 3 , during the nine months ended September 30, as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease was due to a decrease in the overall balance of interest-bearing cash equivalents and marketable securities, partially offset by a change in the interest rate. 
 Other income (expense), net 
 Other income increased by 1.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, primarily due to a decrease in the fair value of Series A warrant liability during nine months ended September 30, 2024. 
 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 Sources of Liquidity 
 Aeva s capital requirements will depend on many factors, including production capacity and sales volume, the timing and spending to support research and development efforts, investments in information technology, the expansion of sales and marketing activities, and market adoption of new and enhanced products and features. 
 On November 8, 2023, we entered into Subscription Agreements providing for the purchase of common stock resulting in net proceeds of 20.6 million November PIPE ). Also on November 8, 2023, we entered into a Standby Equity Purchase Agreement (as amended from time to time, the Facility Agreement with entities affiliated with Sylebra. Pursuant to the Facility Agreement, we have the right, but not the obligation, to sell to Sylebra up to 125.0 million of shares of preferred stock, at our request until November 8, 2026, subject to the terms of the Facility Agreement and the satisfaction of certain conditions as described in Note 10 to our condensed consolidated financial statements. Each sale we request under the Facility Agreement may be for a number of shares of preferred stock with an aggregate value of at least 25.0 million but not more than 50.0 million (except with Sylebra s consent). We paid Sylebra a facility fee in the amount of 2.5 million, an origination fee in the amount of 0.6 million, and an administrative fee in the amount of 0.3 million and reimbursed 0.4 million to Sylebra for its fees and expenses. In addition, we issued to Sylebra Series A warrants to purchase 3,000,000 shares of common stock at an exercise price of 5.00. 
 On July 2, 2024, Aeva and the parties to the Delaware Stockholder Litigation entered into a term sheet, which is being memorialized into a formal settlement agreement and which will be subject to court approval, to fully and finally resolve the Delaware Stockholder Litigation. In connection with the settlement, we have agreed to pay a total settlement cost of 14.0 million in exchange for a release of all claims related to the business combination and expect to recover 2.5 million from insurance carrier. The settlement is being paid pursuant to our indemnification obligations and from available director and officer insurance policies. As of September 30, 2024, we have accrued a contingent liability of 14.0 million connection with the settlement of the Delaware Stockholder Litigation, and a 2.5 million insurance recovery. See Note 15 to our condensed consolidated financial statements for more information about the Delaware Stockholder Litigation. 
 To date, we have incurred negative cash flows from operating activities and incurred losses from operations as reflected in our accumulated deficit of 575.7 million as of September 30, 2024. We expect to continue to incur operating losses due to continued investments that we intend to make in our business, including development of products. As of September 30, 2024, Aeva had cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities totaling 134.8 million. Aeva also has the ability to draw on the Facility Agreement up to 125.0 million through November 8, 2026 in exchange for the issuance of preferred shares, and we intend to draw down on the Facility Agreement if and as required by our capital needs. We believe that our liquidity, including financing available to us through the Facility Agreement, will be sufficient for Aeva to fund operating and capital expenditure for at least 12 months from the date of issuance of these unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements.

(26,870) 

Operating Activities 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, net cash used in operating activities was 86.0 million, attributable to a net loss of 116.1 million and a net change in net operating assets and liabilities of 9.9 million, partially offset by non-cash charges of 20.2 million. Non-cash charges primarily consisted of 17.1 million in stock-based compensation, 4.0 million in depreciation and amortization expense, 2.6 million in amortization of right of use assets and 1.2 million in inventory reserves and others, partially offset by 1.8 million change in the fair value of warrant liability and by a 2.9 million in accretion of discount on available for sale securities. The change in net operating assets and liabilities was primarily due to a 15.6 million increase in other current liabilities arising from a 14.0 million accrual for litigation settlement cost, a 0.3 million decrease in other non-current assets, and a 2.0 million increase in accrued liabilities, partially offset by a 1.6 million decrease in accrued employee cost, a 2.6 million increase in other current assets, a 2.7 million decrease in lease liability, a 0.6 million increase in inventories and a 0.6 million decrease in accounts payable. 
 Investing Activities 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, net cash provided by investing activities was 78.3 million, attributable to maturity of available-for-sale investments of 144.1 million, partially offset by purchase of investments of 62.8 million and purchase of property, plant and equipment of 3.0 million. 
 Financing Activities 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, net cash used in financing activities was attributable to payment of taxes withheld on net settled vesting of restricted stock units. 
 
 Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 
 As of September 30, 2024, Aeva has not engaged in any off-balance sheet arrangements, as defined in the rules and regulations of the SEC. 
 Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 
 We prepare our financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates, assumptions and judgments that can significantly impact the amounts Aeva reports as assets, liabilities, revenue, costs and expenses and the related disclosures. We base our estimates on historical experience and other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances. Aeva s actual results could differ significantly from these estimates under different assumptions and conditions. We believe that the accounting policies discussed below are critical to understanding our historical and future performance as these policies involve a greater degree of judgment and complexity. 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 there were no significant changes to our critical accounting policies and estimates. For a more detailed discussion of our critical accounting policies and estimates, please refer to our 2023 Form 10-K and Note 1 to our condensed consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. 
 Recent Accounting Pronouncements 
 See Note 1 to our condensed consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for recently adopted accounting pronouncements and recently issued accounting pronouncements not yet adopted as of the date of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.

 Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk. 
 Aeva is exposed to market risk in the ordinary course of our business. Market risk represents the risk of loss that may impact our financial position due to adverse changes in financial market prices and rates. Our market risk exposure is primarily a result of fluctuations in interest rates. There has been no material change in our exposure to market risks from that discussed in Part II, Item 7A, Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk of the 2023 Form 10-K. 
 
 Item 4 . Controls and Procedures. 
 
 Evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures 
 Our management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer, evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of September 30, 2024. The term disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act, means controls and other procedures of a company that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to the company s management, including its principal executive and principal financial officers, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Based on the evaluation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of September 30, 2024, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that, as of such date, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective at the reasonable assurance level. 
 
 Changes in internal control over financial reporting 
 There was no change in our internal control over financial reporting identified in connection with the evaluation required by Rule 13a-15(d) and 15d-15(d) of the Exchange Act that occurred during the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 
 Inherent limitation on the effectiveness of internal control 
 Our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, does not expect that our disclosure controls or our internal control over financial reporting will prevent all errors and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, have been detected. These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty, and that breakdowns can occur because of a simple error or mistake. Additionally, controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people or by management override of the controls. The design of any system of controls is also based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions; over time, controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or the degree of compliance with policies or procedures may deteriorate. Because of the inherent limitations in a cost-effective control system, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected.
