Financing costs (debt and equity) on the remaining portion of the total Unit 3 and the common facilities construction costs continued to be recovered through the NCCR tariff or deferred. Georgia Power deferred as a regulatory asset the debt component of financing costs as well as the remaining depreciation expense until Unit 4 costs were placed in retail base rates as described below. The regulatory assets for the debt component of financing costs and depreciation expense are being recovered over years beginning May 2024, as approved by the Georgia PSC, with a remaining balance of million and million, respectively, at September 30, 2024. The equity component of financing costs million at September 30, 2024) represents an unrecognized ratemaking amount that is not reflected on Georgia Power's balance sheets. This amount will be recognized in Georgia Power's statements of income in the periods it is billable to customers. 
 After considering construction and capital costs already in retail base rates of billion and million of associated retail rate base items for Unit 3 and common facilities, Georgia Power included in retail rate base the remaining billion of construction and capital costs as well as million of associated retail rate base items effective with the April 29, 2024 in-service date for Unit 4, pursuant to the approved Prudency Stipulation. Annual retail base revenues increased approximately million and the average retail base rates were adjusted by approximately (net of the elimination of the NCCR tariff described below) effective May 1, 2024.

 The remaining net book value of Plant Daniel Units 1 and 2 was approximately million at September 30, 2024, and Mississippi Power is continuing to depreciate these units using the current approved rates. Mississippi Power expects to reclassify the net book value remaining at retirement to a regulatory asset to be amortized over a period to be determined by the Mississippi PSC in future proceedings, consistent with a 2020 Mississippi PSC order. The Plant Watson and Plant Greene County units are expected to be fully depreciated upon retirement. The ultimate outcome of this matter cannot be determined at this time.

 million were awarded to the Kemper County energy facility. In 2018, Mississippi Power filed with the DOE its request for property closeout certification under the contract related to the million of total grants received. In 2020, Mississippi Power and Southern Company executed an agreement with the DOE completing Mississippi Power's request, which enabled Mississippi Power to proceed with full dismantlement of the abandoned gasifier-related assets and site restoration activities. In connection with the DOE closeout discussions, in 2019, the Civil Division of the Department of Justice informed Southern Company and Mississippi Power of a civil investigation related to the DOE grants. In August 2023, the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Georgia unsealed a civil action in which defendants Southern Company, SCS, and Mississippi Power are alleged to have violated certain provisions of the False Claims Act by fraudulently inducing the DOE to disburse funds pursuant to the grants. The federal government declined to intervene in the action. In October 2023, the plaintiff, a former SCS employee, filed an amended complaint, again alleging certain violations of the False Claims Act. The plaintiff seeks to recover all damages incurred personally and on behalf of the federal government caused by the defendants' alleged violations, as well as treble damages and attorneys' fees, among other relief. On February 2, 2024, the defendants moved to dismiss the amended complaint. On August 28, 2024, the court granted the defendants' motion in part and denied it in part, dismissing the plaintiff's False Claims Act count along with its accompanying treble damages and attorneys' fees but allowing the employment retaliation claim to proceed. The plaintiff requested interlocutory appeal of the court's decision on October 4, 2024. On October 14, 2024, the defendants asserted counterclaims for conversion and misappropriation of trade secrets. An adverse outcome could have a material impact on Southern Company's and Mississippi Power's financial statements.

 The amount of possible loss, if any, from these matters cannot be estimated at this time. 
 
 other individual plaintiffs filed a putative class action complaint against Mississippi Power and the then-serving members of the Mississippi PSC in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Mississippi, which was amended in March 2019 to include additional plaintiffs. Mississippi Power received Mississippi PSC approval in 2013 to charge a mirror CWIP rate premised upon including in its rate base pre-construction and construction costs for the Kemper County energy facility prior to placing the Kemper County energy facility into service. The Mississippi Supreme Court reversed that approval and ordered Mississippi Power to refund the amounts paid by customers under the previously-approved mirror CWIP rate. The plaintiffs allege that the initial approval process, and the amount approved, were improper and make claims for gross negligence, reckless conduct, and intentional wrongdoing. They also allege that Mississippi Power underpaid customers by up to million in the refund process by applying an incorrect interest rate. The plaintiffs seek to recover, on behalf of themselves and their putative class, actual damages, punitive damages, pre-judgment interest, post-judgment interest, attorney's fees, and costs. The district court dismissed the amended complaint; however, in March 2020, the plaintiffs filed a motion seeking to name the new members of the Mississippi PSC, the Mississippi Development Authority, and Southern Company as additional defendants and add a cause of action against all defendants based on a dormant commerce clause theory under the U.S. Constitution. In July 2020, the plaintiffs filed a motion for leave to file a third amended complaint, which included the same federal claims as the proposed second amended complaint, as well as several additional state law claims based on the allegation that Mississippi Power failed to disclose the annual percentage rate of interest applicable to refunds. In November 2020, the district court denied each of the plaintiffs' pending motions and entered final judgment in favor of Mississippi Power. In January 2021, the district court denied further motions by the plaintiffs to vacate the judgment and to file a revised second amended complaint. In February 2021, the plaintiffs filed a notice of appeal with the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit. In March 2022, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit issued an opinion affirming the dismissal of the claims against the Mississippi PSC defendants but reversing the dismissal of the claims against Mississippi Power. In May 2022, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit denied a petition by Mississippi Power for a rehearing en banc and remanded the case to the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Mississippi for further proceedings. In June 2022, Mississippi Power filed with the trial court a motion to dismiss

In 2023, Southern Power received an award of approximately million and filed for confirmation in the Delaware Court of Chancery. Subsequently in 2023, First Solar filed a motion to dismiss the confirmation and, in February 2024, filed a petition to vacate the arbitration award in the Supreme Court of New York County, New York. In March 2024, Southern Power dismissed the proceeding in Delaware without prejudice and filed an opposition to First Solar's petition in the New York matter. On May 6, 2024, the Supreme Court of New York County, New York denied First Solar's petition to vacate and confirmed the arbitration award. This matter is now concluded. 
 At September 30, 2024, million of the award remains on the balance sheet as restricted cash and as a liability to fund future replacement costs. See Note (A) under "Cash, Cash Equivalents, and Restricted Cash" for additional information.

 Southern Company Gas' environmental remediation liability was million and million at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively, based on the estimated cost of environmental investigation and remediation associated with known former manufactured gas plant operating sites. Southern Company Gas has identified former manufactured gas plant site in North Carolina where environmental investigation and remediation are possible. Costs associated with this site cannot be reasonably estimated at this time. 
 The ultimate outcome of these matters cannot be determined at this time; however, as a result of the regulatory treatment for environmental remediation expenses described above, the final disposition of these matters is not expected to have a material impact on the financial statements of the applicable Registrants.

At September 30, 2024, Georgia Power recognized a receivable of million and a payable to the joint owners of Plants Hatch and Vogtle of million (based on their ownership interests) and credited the award to accounts where the original costs were charged, which reduced rate base, fuel, and cost of service for the benefit of customers, as previously authorized by the Georgia PSC.

 At December 31, 2023 Contract Assets At September 30, 2024 At December 31, 2023 Contract Liabilities At September 30, 2024 At December 31, 2023 
 Contract assets for Georgia Power primarily relate to retail customer fixed bill programs, where the payment is contingent upon Georgia Power's continued performance and the customer's continued participation in the program over a contract term, and unregulated service agreements, where payment is contingent on project completion. Contract liabilities for Georgia Power primarily relate to cash collections recognized in advance of revenue for unregulated service agreements. Southern Company Gas' contract assets relate to work performed on an energy efficiency enhancement and upgrade contract with the U.S. General Services Administration. Southern Company Gas receives cash advances from a third-party financial institution to fund work performed, of which approximately million had been received at September 30, 2024. These advances have been accounted for as long-term debt on the balance sheets. See Note 1 to the financial statements under "Affiliate Transactions" in Item 8 of the Form 10-K for additional information regarding the construction contract. At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, Southern Company's unregulated distributed generation business had contract assets of million and million, respectively, and contract liabilities of million and million, respectively, for outstanding performance obligations, all of which are expected to be satisfied within one year. 
 Revenues recognized in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, which were included in contract liabilities at December 31, 2023, were million and million, respectively, for Southern Company and for the other Registrants. Contract liabilities are primarily classified as current on the balance sheets as the corresponding revenues are generally expected to be recognized within one year. 
 Remaining Performance Obligations 
 Southern Company's subsidiaries may enter into long-term contracts with customers in which revenues are recognized as performance obligations are satisfied over the contract term. For the traditional electric operating companies and Southern Power, these contracts primarily relate to PPAs whereby electricity and generation capacity are provided to a customer. The revenue recognized for the delivery of electricity is variable; however, certain PPAs include a fixed payment for fixed generation capacity over the term of the contract. For Southern Company Gas, these contracts primarily relate to the U.S. General Services Administration contract described above. Southern Company's unregulated distributed generation business also has partially satisfied performance

Cash distributions from SP Solar are allocated to Southern Power and to the limited partner in accordance with their partnership interest percentage. Under the terms of the limited partnership agreement, distributions without limited partner consent are limited to available cash and SP Solar is obligated to distribute all such available cash to its partners each quarter. Available cash includes all cash generated in the quarter subject to the maintenance of appropriate operating reserves. 
 At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, SP Wind had total assets of billion, total liabilities of million and million, respectively, and noncontrolling interests of million and million, respectively. Under the terms of the limited liability agreement, distributions without Class A member consent are limited to available cash and SP Wind is obligated to distribute all such available cash to its members each quarter. Available cash includes all cash generated in the quarter subject to the maintenance of appropriate operating reserves. Cash distributions from SP Wind are generally allocated to Southern Power and to the financial investors in accordance with the limited liability agreement. 
 Southern Power consolidates both SP Solar and SP Wind, as the primary beneficiary, since it controls the most significant activities of each entity, including operating and maintaining their assets. Certain transfers and sales of the assets in the VIEs are subject to partner consent and the liabilities are non-recourse to the general credit of Southern Power. Liabilities consist of customary working capital items and do not include any long-term debt. 
 Other Variable Interest Entities 
 Southern Power has other consolidated VIEs that relate to certain subsidiaries that have either sold noncontrolling interests to tax equity investors or acquired less than a 100 interest from facility developers. These entities are considered VIEs because the arrangements are structured similar to a limited partnership and the noncontrolling members do not have substantive kick-out rights. 
 At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the other VIEs had total assets of billion, total liabilities of million and million, respectively, and noncontrolling interests of million and million, respectively.

Nicor Gas is also the borrower under a million credit arrangement expiring in 2025. 
 As reflected in the table above, in March 2024, Mississippi Power amended and restated a million multi-year credit arrangement, which, among other things, extended the maturity date from 2025 to 2027. In May 2024, (i) Alabama Power, Georgia Power, and Southern Company Gas Capital, along with Nicor Gas, extended the maturity

 million, million, and million, respectively, which extended the maturity dates from 2024 to 2025; and (iv) Georgia Power entered into two new credit arrangements aggregating million, which mature in 2025. In June 2024, Mississippi Power amended certain of its multi-year credit arrangements aggregating million, which extended the maturity dates from 2026 to 2027. 
 Subject to applicable market conditions, Southern Company and its subsidiaries expect to renew or replace their bank credit arrangements as needed, prior to expiration. In connection therewith, Southern Company and its subsidiaries may extend the maturity dates and/or increase or decrease the lending commitments thereunder. 
 These bank credit arrangements, as well as the term loan arrangements of the Registrants, Nicor Gas, and SEGCO, contain covenants that limit debt levels and contain cross-acceleration provisions to other indebtedness (including guarantee obligations) that are restricted only to the indebtedness of the individual company. The cross-acceleration provisions to other indebtedness would trigger an event of default if the applicable borrower defaulted on indebtedness, the payment of which was then accelerated. At September 30, 2024, the Registrants, Nicor Gas, and SEGCO were in compliance with all such covenants. None of the bank credit arrangements contain material adverse change clauses at the time of borrowings. 
 A portion of the unused credit with banks is allocated to provide liquidity support to certain revenue bonds of the traditional electric operating companies and the commercial paper programs of the Registrants, Nicor Gas, and SEGCO. At September 30, 2024, outstanding variable rate demand revenue bonds of the traditional electric operating companies with allocated liquidity support totaled approximately billion (comprised of approximately million at Alabama Power, million at Georgia Power, and million at Mississippi Power). In addition, at September 30, 2024, Alabama Power and Georgia Power had approximately million and million, respectively, of fixed rate revenue bonds outstanding that are required to be remarketed within the next 12 months. Alabama Power's million of fixed rate revenue bonds are classified as securities due within one year on its balance sheets as they are not covered by long-term committed credit. All other variable rate demand revenue bonds and fixed rate revenue bonds required to be remarketed within the next 12 months are classified as long-term debt on the balance sheets as a result of available long-term committed credit. 
 
 billion aggregate principal amount of Series 2024A Convertible Senior Notes due June 15, 2027 (Series 2024A Convertible Senior Notes). 
 Interest on the Series 2024A Convertible Senior Notes is payable semiannually, beginning December 15, 2024. The Series 2024A Convertible Senior Notes will mature on June 15, 2027, unless earlier converted or repurchased, but are not redeemable at the option of Southern Company. The Series 2024A Convertible Senior Notes are direct, unsecured, and unsubordinated obligations of Southern Company, ranking equally with all of Southern Company's other unsecured and unsubordinated indebtedness from time to time outstanding, and are effectively subordinated to all secured indebtedness of Southern Company. 
 Holders may convert their Series 2024A Convertible Senior Notes at their option prior to the close of business on the business day preceding March 15, 2027, but only under the following circumstances: 
 during any calendar quarter (and only during such calendar quarter), if the last reported sale price of Southern Company's common stock for at least trading days (whether or not consecutive) during the period of consecutive trading days ending on, and including, the last trading day of the immediately preceding calendar quarter is greater than or equal to of the conversion price on each applicable trading day as determined by Southern Company;

 upon the occurrence of certain corporate events specified in the indenture governing the Series 2024A Convertible Senior Notes. 
 On or after March 15, 2027, a holder may convert all or any portion of its Series 2024A Convertible Senior Notes at any time prior to the close of business on the second scheduled trading day immediately preceding the maturity date regardless of the foregoing conditions. 
 Southern Company will settle conversions of the Series 2024A Convertible Senior Notes by paying cash up to the aggregate principal amount of the Series 2024A Convertible Senior Notes to be converted and paying or delivering, as the case may be, cash, shares of common stock, or a combination of cash and shares of common stock, at Southern Company's election, in respect of the remainder, if any, of Southern Company's conversion obligation in excess of the aggregate principal amount of the Series 2024A Convertible Senior Notes being converted. The Series 2024A Convertible Senior Notes are initially convertible at a rate of 10.8166 shares of common stock per 1,000 principal amount converted, which is approximately equal to per share of common stock. The conversion rate will be subject to adjustment upon the occurrence of certain specified events but will not be adjusted for accrued and unpaid interest. In addition, upon the occurrence of a make-whole fundamental change (as defined in the indenture governing the Series 2024A Convertible Senior Notes), Southern Company will, in certain circumstances, increase the conversion rate by a number of additional shares of common stock for conversions in connection with the make-whole fundamental change. 
 Upon the occurrence of a fundamental change (as defined in the indenture governing the Series 2024A Convertible Senior Notes), holders of the Series 2024A Convertible Senior Notes may require Southern Company to purchase all or a portion of their Series 2024A Convertible Senior Notes, in principal amounts equal to 1,000 or an integral multiple thereof, for cash at a price equal to of the principal amount of the Series 2024A Convertible Senior Notes to be purchased plus any accrued and unpaid interest. 

Effect of stock-based compensation Diluted shares 
 For all periods presented, an immaterial number of stock-based compensation awards was excluded from the diluted EPS calculation because the awards were anti-dilutive. 
 For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, there was no dilution resulting from the Series 2024A Convertible Senior Notes, and the dilution resulting from the Series 2023A convertible senior notes was immaterial.

 Contingent Features 
 The Registrants do not have any credit arrangements that would require material changes in payment schedules or terminations as a result of a credit rating downgrade. There are certain derivatives that could require collateral, but not accelerated payment, in the event of various credit rating changes of certain Southern Company subsidiaries. Generally, collateral may be provided by a Southern Company guaranty, letter of credit, or cash. At September 30, 2024, the Registrants had collateral posted with derivative counterparties to satisfy these arrangements. 
 For Southern Company, the fair value of foreign currency derivative liabilities and interest rate derivative liabilities with contingent features, and the maximum potential collateral requirements arising from the credit-risk-related contingent features at a rating below BBB- and/or Baa3, was million at September 30, 2024. For Southern Power, the fair value of foreign currency derivative liabilities with contingent features, and the maximum potential collateral requirements arising from the credit-risk-related contingent features at a rating below BBB- and/or Baa3, was at September 30, 2024. For the traditional electric operating companies and Southern Power, energy-related derivative liabilities with contingent features and the maximum potential collateral requirements arising from the credit-risk-related contingent features, at a rating below BBB- and/or Baa3, were at September 30, 2024. The maximum potential collateral requirements arising from the credit-risk-related contingent features for the traditional electric operating companies and Southern Power include certain agreements that could require collateral in the event that one or more Southern Company power pool participants has a credit rating change to below investment grade. 
 Alabama Power and Southern Power maintain accounts with certain regional transmission organizations to facilitate financial derivative transactions and they may be required to post collateral based on the value of the positions in these accounts and the associated margin requirements. At September 30, 2024, cash collateral posted in these accounts was for Alabama Power and Southern Power. Southern Company Gas maintains accounts with brokers or the clearing houses of certain exchanges to facilitate financial derivative transactions. Based on the value of the positions in these accounts and the associated margin requirements, Southern Company Gas may be required to deposit cash into these accounts. At September 30, 2024, cash collateral held on deposit in broker margin accounts was million. 
 The Registrants are exposed to losses related to financial instruments in the event of counterparties' nonperformance. The Registrants generally enter into agreements and material transactions with counterparties that

 MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION 
 AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 

 OVERVIEW 
 Southern Company is a holding company that owns all of the common stock of three traditional electric operating companies (Alabama Power, Georgia Power, and Mississippi Power), Southern Power, and Southern Company Gas and owns other direct and indirect subsidiaries. The primary businesses of the Southern Company system are electricity sales by the traditional electric operating companies and Southern Power and the distribution of natural gas by Southern Company Gas. Southern Company's reportable segments are the sale of electricity by the traditional electric operating companies, the sale of electricity in the competitive wholesale market by Southern Power, and the sale of natural gas and other complementary products and services by Southern Company Gas. Southern Company Gas' reportable segments are gas distribution operations, gas pipeline investments, and gas marketing services. See Note (L) to the Condensed Financial Statements herein for additional information on segment reporting. Alabama Power, Georgia Power, and Mississippi Power each operate with one reportable business segment, since substantially all of their business is providing electric service to customers. Southern Power also operates its business with one reportable business segment, the sale of electricity in the competitive wholesale market. For additional information on the Registrants' primary business activities, see BUSINESS "The Southern Company System" in Item 1 of the Form 10-K. 
 The Registrants continue to focus on several key performance indicators. For the traditional electric operating companies and Southern Company Gas, these indicators include, but are not limited to, customer satisfaction, plant availability, electric and natural gas system reliability, and execution of major construction projects. Southern Company Gas also continues to focus on several operating metrics, including Heating Degree Days, customer count, and volumes of natural gas sold. Southern Company Gas measures weather and the effect on its business using Heating Degree Days. Generally, increased Heating Degree Days result in higher demand for natural gas on Southern Company Gas' distribution system. For Southern Power, key performance indicators include, but are not limited to, the equivalent forced outage rate and contract availability to evaluate operating results and help ensure its ability to meet its contractual commitments to customers. In addition, Southern Company and the Subsidiary Registrants focus on earnings per share and net income, respectively, as a key performance indicator. 
 
 Recent Developments 
 
 Alabama Power 
 On May 8, 2024, the Alabama PSC issued a consent order to lower Rate ECR from 3.270 cents per KWH to 3.015 cents per KWH, or approximately 135 million annually, effective with July 2024 billings. 
 On October 24, 2024, Alabama Power entered into an agreement to acquire all of the equity interests in Tenaska Alabama Partners, L.P. for a total purchase price of approximately 622 million, subject to working capital adjustments. Tenaska Alabama Partners, L.P. owns and operates Lindsay Hill Generating Station, an approximately 855-MW combined cycle generation facility, in Autauga County, Alabama. On October 30, 2024, Alabama Power filed a petition for a CCN with the Alabama PSC for authorization to procure additional generating capacity through the acquisition of the Lindsay Hill Generating Station. Alabama Power expects to complete the acquisition by the end of the third quarter 2025. 
 See Note (B) to the Condensed Financial Statements under "Alabama Power" herein for additional information. 
 
 Georgia Power 
 Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 Construction and Start-Up Status 
 Georgia Power placed Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 in service on July 31, 2023 and April 29, 2024, respectively. During the second quarter 2024, following Unit 4's in-service date, Southern Nuclear evaluated the remaining expected site demobilization costs and other contractor obligations and reduced the remaining estimate to complete forecast by approximately 21 million. Accordingly, Georgia Power recorded a pre-tax credit to income of approximately 21 million 16 million after tax) in the second quarter 2024 to recognize capital costs previously charged to income. Georgia Power's share of the total project capital cost forecast, including completion of site

 AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) 

 demobilization and remaining contractor obligations, is 10.7 billion. See Note (B) to the Condensed Financial Statements under "Georgia Power Nuclear Construction Cost and Schedule" herein for additional information. 
 Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 Regulatory Matters 
 Georgia Power included in retail rate base 5.462 billion of construction and capital costs as well as 647 million of associated retail rate base items effective with the April 29, 2024 in-service date for Unit 4, pursuant to the approved Prudency Stipulation. Annual retail base revenues increased approximately 730 million and the average retail base rates were adjusted by approximately 5 (net of the elimination of the NCCR tariff described below) effective May 1, 2024. 
 Further, as included in the approved Prudency Stipulation, since commercial operation for Unit 4 was not achieved by March 31, 2024, Georgia Power's ROE used to determine the NCCR tariff and calculate AFUDC was reduced to zero effective April 1, 2024. Effective May 1, 2024, following commercial operation of Unit 4, Georgia Power's NCCR tariff was eliminated. 
 See Note (B) to the Condensed Financial Statements under "Georgia Power Nuclear Construction Regulatory Matters" herein for additional information. 
 Rate Plans 
 In accordance with the terms of the 2022 ARP, on October 1, 2024, Georgia Power filed tariff adjustments to become effective January 1, 2025 that would result in a net increase in rates of 306 million pending approval by the Georgia PSC. The ultimate outcome of this matter cannot be determined at this time. See Note (B) to the Condensed Financial Statements under "Georgia Power Rate Plans" herein for additional information. 
 Integrated Resource Plan 
 On April 16, 2024, the Georgia PSC approved Georgia Power's updated IRP (2023 IRP Update) as modified by a stipulation among Georgia Power, the staff of the Georgia PSC, and certain intervenors. The 2023 IRP Update includes the authority to develop, own, and operate up to 1,400 MWs from three simple cycle combustion turbines at Plant Yates with the recoverable costs not to exceed the certified amount, which was approved by the Georgia PSC on August 20, 2024. See Note (B) to the Condensed Financial Statements under "Georgia Power Integrated Resource Plans" herein for additional information. 
 
 Mississippi Power 
 On April 26, 2024, Mississippi Power filed its 2024 IRP with the Mississippi PSC. The Mississippi PSC did not note any deficiencies within the review period; therefore, the filing is concluded. The 2024 IRP included a schedule to retire Plant Watson Unit 4 (268 MWs) and Plant Greene County Units 1 and 2 (206 MWs based on 40 ownership) and to retire early Plant Daniel Units 1 and 2 (502 MWs based on 50 ownership), all by the end of 2028. 
 On March 29, 2024, Mississippi Power filed a request with the FERC for an 8 million increase in annual wholesale base revenues under the MRA tariff and requested an effective date of May 29, 2024. On April 19, 2024, Cooperative Energy challenged the new rates in a filing with the FERC. On May 28, 2024, the FERC issued an order accepting Mississippi Power's request effective May 29, 2024, subject to refund, and establishing hearing and settlement judge procedures. The ultimate outcome of this matter cannot be determined at this time. 
 See Note (B) to the Condensed Financial Statements under "Mississippi Power" herein for additional information. 
 
 Southern Power 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, Southern Power completed construction of and placed in service the 150-MW South Cheyenne solar facility. In addition, Southern Power continued construction of the 200-MW first phase, the 180-MW second phase, and the 90-MW third phase of the Millers Branch solar facility. Subsequent to September 30, 2024, Southern Power committed to expand construction of the third phase of the

 Millers Branch solar project by 42 MWs of capacity, substantially all of which is contracted under a 15-year PPA, and commercial operation is projected to occur in the fourth quarter 2026. With the expansion of the third phase, the Millers Branch solar project will have a total generating capacity of 512 MWs. See Note (K) to the Condensed Financial Statements under "Southern Power" herein for additional information. 
 At September 30, 2024, Southern Power's average investment coverage ratio for its generating assets, including those owned with various partners, based on the ratio of investment under contract to total investment using the respective facilities' net book value (or expected in-service value for facilities under construction) as the investment amount was 97 through 2028 and 89 through 2033, with an average remaining contract duration of approximately 12 years. 
 
 Southern Company Gas 
 Atlanta Gas Light 
 On July 2, 2024, the Georgia PSC approved a stipulation related to Atlanta Gas Light's triennial Integrated Capacity and Delivery Plan filing, filed on February 1, 2024, which allows capital investments totaling approximately 0.6 billion annually for the years 2025 through 2027 with related revenue requirement recovery through either the annual GRAM filing or the System Reinforcement Rider surcharge adjustment. Additionally, the Georgia PSC approved a surcharge recovery mechanism for capital projects related to municipal, county, and Georgia Department of Transportation (GDOT) infrastructure work. Rate changes associated with the new surcharge, if approved, will be based on requests filed annually on September 1, with new rates to become effective January 1 of the following year. Finally, the stipulation requires Atlanta Gas Light to include an alternate rate plan for the three-year period of 2025 through 2027 with its 2025 GRAM filing. 
 On July 31, 2024, Atlanta Gas Light submitted its annual GRAM filing with the Georgia PSC, which includes projections for portions of the System Reinforcement Rider and municipal, county, and GDOT projects. The filing requests a traditional annual base rate increase of 120 million. In accordance with the approved Integrated Capacity and Delivery Plan filing, Atlanta Gas Light also included two alternative annual base rate increases for 2025 that provide for lower increases in 2025 with subsequent increases in 2026 and 2027. Resolution of the GRAM filing is expected by December 31, 2024, with new rates effective January 1, 2025. The ultimate outcome of this matter cannot be determined at this time. 
 Virginia Natural Gas 
 On June 7, 2024, the Virginia Commission approved the extension of Virginia Natural Gas' SAVE program through 2029. The extension of the program includes investments of 70 million in each year from 2025 through 2029, with a potential variance of up to 5 million allowed for the program, for a maximum total investment over the five-year extension of 355 million. 
 On August 1, 2024, Virginia Natural Gas filed a base rate case with the Virginia Commission seeking an increase in annual base revenues of 63 million, including 17 million related to the recovery of investments under the SAVE program, primarily to recover investments and increased costs associated with infrastructure and technology. The requested increase is based on a projected 12-month period beginning January 1, 2025, an ROE of 10.45 , and an equity ratio of 54.92 . Rate adjustments will be effective January 1, 2025, subject to refund. The Virginia Commission is expected to issue an order on the requested increase in the third quarter 2025. The ultimate outcome of this matter cannot be determined at this time.

The increases were primarily due to increases in retail electric revenues associated with rates and pricing, an after-tax charge of 120 million in the third quarter 2023 related to the construction of Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4, and increases in other revenues, partially offset by increases in interest expense, non-fuel operations and maintenance expenses, depreciation and amortization, taxes other than income taxes, and cost of other sales. Also contributing to the year-to-date 2024 increase was an increase in retail electric revenues associated with colder weather in the first quarter 2024 and warmer weather in the second quarter 2024 compared to the corresponding periods in 2023 and an increase in natural gas revenues from rate increases. 
 Retail Electric Revenues 
 In the third quarter 2024, retail electric revenues were 5.4 billion compared to 5.1 billion for the corresponding period in 2023. For year-to-date 2024, retail electric revenues were 13.8 billion compared to 12.6 billion for the corresponding period in 2023. Details of the changes in retail electric revenues were as follows:

 Year-To-Date 2023 
 (change in millions) change) (change in millions) change) Rates and pricing 458 8.9 1,051 8.3 Sales growth (decline) (39) (0.8) 24 0.2 Weather (15) (0.3) 279 2.2 Fuel and other cost recovery (177) (3.4) (158) (1.2) Retail electric revenues 227 4.4 1,196 9.5 
 Revenues associated with changes in rates and pricing increased in the third quarter and year-to-date 2024 when compared to the corresponding periods in 2023 primarily due to the inclusion of Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 in retail rates net of the elimination of the NCCR tariff at Georgia Power, customer bill credits in 2023 at Alabama Power related to the flowback of certain excess accumulated deferred income taxes, base tariff increases at Georgia Power in accordance with its 2022 ARP, higher contributions from commercial and industrial customers with variable demand-driven pricing at Georgia Power, and an increase in Rate CNP New Plant revenues at Alabama Power. See Note (B) to the Condensed Financial Statements under "Georgia Power Nuclear Construction Regulatory Matters" herein and Note 2 to the financial statements under "Alabama Power" and "Georgia Power" in Item 8 of the Form 10-K for additional information. 
 Revenues attributable to changes in sales decreased in the third quarter 2024 and increased for year-to-date 2024 when compared to the corresponding periods in 2023. Weather-adjusted residential KWH sales decreased 1.5 and 0.5 in the third quarter and year-to-date 2024, respectively, primarily due to decreased customer usage, partially offset by customer growth. Weather-adjusted commercial KWH sales increased 0.1 in the third quarter 2024 primarily due to customer growth, largely offset by decreased customer usage. Weather-adjusted commercial KWH sales increased 2.1 for year-to-date 2024 primarily due to increased customer usage, primarily driven by existing

 data centers, and customer growth. Industrial KWH sales increased 0.4 and 0.3 in the third quarter and year-to-date 2024, respectively, primarily due to increases in the pipeline, chemicals, and transportation sectors. 
 Fuel and other cost recovery revenues decreased 177 million and 158 million in the third quarter and year-to-date 2024, respectively, compared to the corresponding periods in 2023 primarily due to lower recoverable fuel and purchased power costs. Electric rates for the traditional electric operating companies include provisions to adjust billings for fluctuations in fuel costs, including the energy component of purchased power costs. Under these provisions, fuel revenues generally equal fuel expe nses, includi ng the energy component of PPA costs, and do not affect net income. The traditional electric operating companies each have one or more regulatory mechanisms to recover other costs such as environmental and other compliance costs, storm damage, new plants, and PPA capacity costs. See Note 2 to the financial statements in Item 8 of the Form 10-K and Note (B) to the Condensed Financial Statements herein for additional information. 
 Wholesale Electric Revenues 
 Third Quarter 2024 vs. Third Quarter 2023 Year-To-Date 2024 vs. Year-To-Date 2023 (change in millions) change) (change in millions) change) (6) (0.8) (11) (0.6) 
 In the third quarter 2024, wholesale electric revenues were 721 million compared to 727 million for the corresponding period in 2023. For year-to-date 2024, wholesale electric revenues were 1.92 billion compared to 1.93 billion for the corresponding period in 2023. The decreases in the third quarter and year-to-date 2024 were due to decreases in energy revenues of 38 million and 36 million, respectively, partially offset by increases in capacity revenues of 32 million and 25 million, respectively. The decreases in energy revenues were primarily due to decreases related to the average net cost of fuel and purchased power. Partially offsetting the year-to-date 2024 decrease in energy revenues was an increase in the volume of KWHs sold under natural gas and solar PPAs at Southern Power. The increases in capacity revenues were primarily due to a net increase in revenues from capacity contracts at Georgia Power and an increase in capacity revenues associated with natural gas PPAs at Southern Power. The changes for year-to-date 2024 in capacity and energy revenues also reflect decreases resulting from power sales agreements that ended in May 2023 at Alabama Power. 
 Wholesale electric revenues consist of revenues from PPAs and short-term opportunity sales. Wholesale electric revenues from PPAs (other than solar and wind PPAs) have both capacity and energy components. Capacity revenues generally represent the greatest contribution to net income and are designed to provide recovery of fixed costs plus a return on investment. Energy revenues will vary depending on fuel prices, the market prices of wholesale energy compared to the Southern Company system's generation, demand for energy within the Southern Company system's electric service territory, and the availability of the Southern Company system's generation. Increases and decreases in energy revenues that are driven by fuel prices are accompanied by an increase or decrease in fuel costs and do not have a significant impact on net income. Energy sales from solar and wind PPAs do not have a capacity charge and customers either purchase the energy output of a dedicated renewable facility through an energy charge or through a fixed price related to the energy. As a result, the ability to recover fixed and variable operations and maintenance expenses is dependent upon the level of energy generated from these facilities, which can be impacted by weather conditions, equipment performance, transmission constraints, and other factors. Wholesale electric revenues at Mississippi Power include FERC-regulated municipal and rural association sales under cost-based tariffs as well as market-based sales. Short-term opportunity sales are made at market-based rates that generally provide a margin above the Southern Company system's variable cost to produce the energy.

 In the third quarter 2024, other electric revenues were 222 million compared to 203 million for the corresponding period in 2023. The increase was primarily due to increases of 15 million in transmission revenues primarily associated with open access transmission tariff sales, 8 million in pole attachment revenues at Georgia Power, and 6 million in regulated outdoor lighting sales at Georgia Power, partially offset by a decrease of 7 million due to an arbitration award received in 2023 at Southern Power and a net increase of 7 million in realized losses associated with price stability products for retail customers on variable demand-driven pricing tariffs at Georgia Power. 
 For year-to-date 2024, other electric revenues were 631 million compared to 602 million for the corresponding period in 2023. The increase was primarily due to increases of 34 million in transmission revenues primarily associated with open access transmission tariff sales, 17 million in regulated outdoor lighting sales at Georgia Power, and 10 million in customer fees primarily at Georgia Power, partially offset by a net increase of 18 million in realized losses associated with price stability products for retail customers on variable demand-driven pricing tariffs at Georgia Power and a decrease of 14 million related to liquidated damages receipts associated with generation facility production guarantees and an arbitration award in 2023 at Southern Power. 
 Natural Gas Revenues 
 In the third quarter 2024, natural gas revenues were 682 million compared to 689 million for the corresponding period in 2023. For year-to-date 2024, natural gas revenues were 3.2 billion compared to 3.4 billion for the corresponding period in 2023. Details of the changes in natural gas revenues were as follows:

 Revenues from rate changes increased for year-to-date 2024 compared to the corresponding period in 2023 primarily due to rate increases, partially offset by a change in timing of revenues at Nicor Gas. See Note 2 to the financial statements under "Southern Company Gas Rate Proceedings" in Item 8 of the Form 10-K for additional information. 
 Revenues from gas costs and other cost recovery decreased for year-to-date 2024 compared to the corresponding period in 2023 primarily due to lower natural gas cost recovery associated with lower natural gas prices and lower demand associated with warmer weather. Natural gas distribution rates include provisions to adjust billings for fluctuations in natural gas costs. Therefore, gas costs recovered through natural gas revenues generally equal the amount expensed in cost of natural gas and do not affect net income from the natural gas distribution utilities. 
 Revenues from gas marketing services decreased for year-to-date 2024 compared to the corresponding period in 2023 primarily due to lower commodity prices.

 Alabama Power's net income in the third quarter 2024 was 493 million compared to 565 million for the corresponding period in 2023. The decrease was primarily due to an increase in non-fuel operations and maintenance expenses, an increase in depreciation, and a decrease in customer usage. These decreases to income were partially offset by an increase in Rate CNP New Plant revenues. 
 For year-to-date 2024, net income was 1.2 billion compared to 1.1 billion for the corresponding period in 2023. The increase was primarily due to an increase in retail electric revenues associated with colder weather in the first quarter 2024 and warmer weather in the second quarter 2024 in the Alabama Power service territory compared to the corresponding periods in 2023, as well as an increase in Rate CNP New Plant revenues and a decrease in capacity expenses. These increases to income were partially offset by increases in non-fuel operations and

 maintenance expenses, depreciation, and interest expense and lower AFUDC equity due to Plant Barry Unit 8 being placed in service in 2023. 
 Retail Revenues 
 In the third quarter 2024, retail revenues were 1.90 billion compared to 1.86 billion for the corresponding period in 2023. For year-to-date 2024, retail revenues were 5.12 billion compared to 4.71 billion for the corresponding period in 2023. Details of the changes in retail revenues were as follows: 
 Third Quarter 2024 vs. 
 Third Quarter 2023 
 Year-To-Date 2024 vs. 
 Year-To-Date 2023 
 (change in millions) change) (change in millions) change) Rates and pricing 124 6.7 356 7.6 Sales decline (17) (0.9) (7) (0.1) Weather (14) (0.8) 77 1.6 Fuel and other cost recovery (49) (2.6) (17) (0.4) Retail revenues 44 2.4 409 8.7 
 Revenues associated with changes in rates and pricing increased in the third quarter and year-to-date 2024 when compared to the corresponding periods in 2023 primarily due to customer bill credits in 2023 related to the flowback of certain excess accumulated deferred income taxes as well as an increase in Rate CNP New Plant revenues. See Note 2 to the financial statements under "Alabama Power" in Item 8 of the Form 10-K for additional information. 
 Revenues attributable to changes in sales decreased in the third quarter and year-to-date 2024 when compared to the corresponding periods in 2023. Weather-adjusted residential KWH sales were relatively flat in the third quarter 2024 and decreased 0.6 for year-to-date 2024 primarily due to a decrease in customer usage. Weather-adjusted commercial KWH sales decreased 0.4 in the third quarter 2024 primarily due to a decrease in customer usage. Weather-adjusted commercial KWH sales increased 0.7 for year-to-date 2024 primarily due to customer growth. Industrial KWH sales increased 0.6 and 0.1 in the third quarter and year-to-date 2024, respectively, primarily due to an increase in the pipeline and forest products sectors. 
 Fuel and other cost recovery revenues decreased in the third quarter and year-to-date 2024 when compared to the corresponding periods in 2023 primarily as a result of lower recoverable fuel costs. 
 Electric rates include provisions to recognize the recovery of fuel costs, purchased power costs, PPAs certificated by the Alabama PSC, and costs associated with the NDR. Under these provisions, fuel and other cost recovery revenues generally equal fuel and other cost recovery expenses and do not affect net income. See Note 2 to the financial statements under "Alabama Power" in Item 8 of the Form 10-K for additional information. 
 Wholesale Revenues Non-Affiliates 
 Third Quarter 2024 vs. Third Quarter 2023 Year-To-Date 2024 vs. Year-To-Date 2023 (change in millions) change) (change in millions) change) (17) (16.0) (99) (27.7) 
 In the third quarter 2024, wholesale revenues from sales to non-affiliates were 89 million compared to 106 million for the corresponding period in 2023. The decrease was primarily due to a 12.8 decrease in the volume of KWHs sold as a result of lower market demand. 
 For year-to-date 2024, wholesale revenues from sales to non-affiliates were 259 million compared to 358 million for the corresponding period in 2023. The decrease was primarily due to a 41.4 decrease in the volume of KWHs sold as a result of power sales agreements that ended in May 2023, partially offset by a 23.3 increase in the price of energy.

 MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION 
 AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) 

 Wholesale revenues from sales to non-affiliates will vary depending on fuel prices, the market prices of wholesale energy compared to the cost of Alabama Power's and the Southern Company system's generation, demand for energy within the Southern Company system's electric service territory, and the availability of the Southern Company system's generation. Increases and decreases in energy revenues that are driven by fuel prices are accompanied by an increase or decrease in fuel costs and do not affect net income. Short-term opportunity energy sales are also included in wholesale energy sales to non-affiliates. These opportunity sales are made at market-based rates that generally provide a margin above Alabama Power's variable cost to produce the energy. 
 Wholesale Revenues Affiliates

 In the third quarter 2024, wholesale revenues from sales to affiliates were 34 million compared to 14 million for the corresponding period in 2023. For year-to-date 2024, wholesale revenues from sales to affiliates were 103 million compared to 43 million for the corresponding period in 2023. The increases for the third quarter and year-to-date 2024 were primarily due to increases of 178.8 and 188.4 , respectively, in the volume of KWH sales due to affiliated company energy needs. 
 Wholesale revenues from sales to affiliated companies will vary depending on demand and the availability and cost of generating resources at each company. These affiliate sales are made in accordance with the IIC, as approved by the FERC. Energy revenues related to these transactions do not have a significant impact on earnings since this energy is generally sold at marginal cost and energy purchases are generally offset by energy revenues through Alabama Power's energy cost recovery clause.

 In the third quarter 2024, total fuel and purchased power expenses were 481 million compared to 524 million for the corresponding period in 2023. The decrease was due to a 34 million net decrease related to the average cost of fuel and purchased power and a 9 million net decrease related to the volume of KWHs generated and purchased. 
 For year-to-date 2024, total fuel and purchased power expenses were 1.3 billion compared to 1.4 billion for the corresponding period in 2023. The decrease was due to a 45 million net decrease related to the average cost of fuel and purchased power and a 26 million net decrease related to the volume of KWHs generated and purchased. 
 Fuel and purchased power energy transactions do not have a significant impact on earnings, since energy expenses are generally offset by energy revenues through Alabama Power's energy cost recovery clause.

 In the third quarter 2024, fuel expense was 384 million compared to 402 million for the corresponding period in 2023. The decrease was primarily due to a 15.6 decrease in the average cost per KWH generated by natural gas, which excludes tolling agreements, and a 13.8 decrease in the volume of KWHs generated by coal, partially offset by a 37.5 increase in the volume of KWHs generated by natural gas and an 18.6 decrease in the volume of KWHs generated by hydro facilities as a result of less rainfall. 
 For year-to-date 2024, fuel expense was 1.1 billion compared to 1.0 billion for the corresponding period in 2023. The increase was primarily due to a 35.4 increase in the volume of KWHs generated by natural gas and an 18.4 decrease in the volume of KWHs generated by hydro facilities as a result of less rainfall, partially offset by an 11.1 decrease in the average cost per KWH generated by natural gas, which excludes tolling agreements. 
 Purchased Power Non-Affiliates 
 In the third quarter 2024, purchased power expense from non-affiliates was 49 million compared to 42 million for the corresponding period in 2023. The increase was primarily due to an increase of 4.4 in the volume of KWHs purchased as Alabama Power and other Southern Company system units generally dispatched at a higher cost than available market resources. 
 For year-to-date 2024, purchased power expense from non-affiliates was 148 million compared to 197 million for the corresponding period in 2023. The decrease was primarily due to a decrease of 36.1 in the volume of KWHs purchased as a result of a PPA that ended in May 2023 and the availability of Plant Barry Unit 8 and Central Alabama Generating Station generation, partially offset by an increase of 14.1 in the average cost per KWH purchased. 
 Energy purchases from non-affiliates will vary depending on the market prices of wholesale energy as compared to the cost of the Southern Company system's generation, demand for energy within the Southern Company system's electric service territory, and the availability of the Southern Company system's generation.

 Georgia Power's net income in the third quarter 2024 was 1.1 billion compared to 0.8 billion for the corresponding period in 2023. For year-to-date 2024, net income was 2.2 billion compared to 1.5 billion for the corresponding period in 2023. The increases were primarily due to higher retail revenues associated with the inclusion of Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 in retail rates and base tariff increases in accordance with the 2022 ARP and an after-tax charge of 120 million in the third quarter 2023 related to the construction of Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4. Also contributing to the increase for year-to-date 2024 was warmer weather in the second quarter 2024 as compared to the corresponding period in 2023. See Note 2 to the financial statements under "Georgia Power" in Item 8 of the Form 10-K for additional information. 
 Retail Revenues 
 In the third quarter 2024, retail revenues were 3.2 billion compared to 3.0 billion for the corresponding period in 2023. For year-to-date 2024, retail revenues were 7.9 billion compared to 7.1 billion for the corresponding period in 2023. Details of the changes in retail revenues were as follows:

 Year-To-Date 2023 
 (change in millions) change) (change in millions) change) Rates and pricing 328 11.0 685 9.6 Sales growth (decline) (17) (0.6) 29 0.4 Weather 1 199 2.8 Fuel cost recovery (123) (4.1) (118) (1.7) Retail revenues 189 6.3 795 11.1 
 Revenues associated with changes in rates and pricing increased in the third quarter and year-to-date 2024 when compared to the corresponding periods in 2023. The increases were primarily due to the inclusion of Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 in retail rates net of the elimination of the NCCR tariff, base tariff increases in accordance with the 2022 ARP, and higher contributions from commercial and industrial customers with variable demand-driven pricing. See Note (B) to the Condensed Financial Statements under "Georgia Power Nuclear Construction Regulatory Matters" herein and Note 2 to the financial statements under "Georgia Power" in Item 8 of the Form 10-K for additional information. 
 Revenues attributable to changes in sales decreased in the third quarter 2024 and increased for year-to-date 2024 when compared to the corresponding periods in 2023. Weather-adjusted residential KWH sales decreased 2.1 and 0.4 in the third quarter and year-to-date 2024, respectively, primarily due to decreased customer usage, partially offset by customer growth. Weather-adjusted commercial KWH sales increased 0.6 and 2.5 in the third quarter and year-to-date 2024, respectively, primarily due to increased customer usage, primarily driven by existing data centers, and customer growth. Weather-adjusted industrial KWH sales decreased 0.4 in the third quarter 2024 primarily due to decreases in the paper and electronics sectors, partially offset by increases in the transportation and pipeline sectors. Weather-adjusted industrial KWH sales were flat for year-to-date 2024 primarily due to increases in the transportation and pipeline sectors, offset by decreases in the paper and electronics sectors. 
 Fuel revenues and costs are allocated between retail and wholesale jurisdictions. Retail fuel cost recovery revenues decreased in the third quarter and year-to-date 2024 when compared to the corresponding periods in 2023 due to lower recoverable fuel costs. Electric rates include provisions to adjust billings for fluctuations in fuel costs, 
 110

 In the third quarter 2024, wholesale revenues were 78 million compared to 69 million for the corresponding period in 2023. For year-to-date 2024, wholesale revenues were 198 million compared to 147 million for the corresponding period in 2023. The increases for the third quarter and year-to-date 2024 were primarily due to increases of 20 million and 59 million, respectively, related to net additional capacity from wholesale capacity contracts and 28 million and 53 million, respectively, related to the volume of KWH sales associated with higher market demand, partially offset by decreases of 36 million and 57 million, respectively, related to the average cost per KWH sold due to lower Southern Company system fuel and purchased power prices. 
 Wholesale revenues from sales to non-affiliates consist of PPAs and short-term opportunity sales. Wholesale revenues from PPAs have both capacity and energy components. Wholesale capacity revenues from PPAs are recognized in amounts billable under the contract terms and provide for recovery of fixed costs and a return on investment. Wholesale revenues from sales to non-affiliates will vary depending on fuel prices, the market prices of wholesale energy compared to the cost of Georgia Power's and the Southern Company system's generation, demand for energy within the Southern Company system's electric service territory, and the availability of the Southern Company system's generation. Increases and decreases in energy revenues that are driven by fuel prices are accompanied by an increase or decrease in fuel costs and do not have a significant impact on net income. Short-term opportunity sales are made at market-based rates that generally provide a margin above Georgia Power's variable cost of energy. 
 Wholesale revenues from sales to affiliated companies will vary depending on demand and the availability and cost of generating resources at each company. These affiliate sales are made in accordance with the IIC, as approved by the FERC. Energy revenues related to these transactions do not have a significant impact on earnings since this energy is generally sold at marginal cost. 
 Other Revenues

 Mississippi Power's net income for year-to-date 2024 was 186 million compared to 173 million for the corresponding period in 2023. The increase was primarily due to increases in affiliate wholesale capacity revenues and retail revenues largely due to certain regulatory assets that fully amortized in December 2023, partially offset by an increase in non-fuel operations and maintenance expenses. 
 Retail Revenues 
 In the third quarter 2024, retail revenues were 276 million compared to 284 million for the corresponding period in 2023. For year-to-date 2024, retail revenues were 739 million compared to 747 million for the corresponding period in 2023. Details of the changes in retail revenues were as follows:

 Revenues associated with changes in rates and pricing increased in the third quarter and year-to-date 2024 when compared to the corresponding periods in 2023 primarily due to certain regulatory assets that fully amortized in December 2023 and higher ECO Plan rates that became effective in June 2024. 
 Revenues attributable to changes in sales decreased in the third quarter and increased for year-to-date 2024 when compared to the corresponding periods in 2023. Weather-adjusted residential KWH sales decreased 7.1 and 2.2 in the third quarter and year-to-date 2024, respectively, primarily due to decreased customer usage. Weather-adjusted commercial KWH sales decreased 2.6 in the third quarter 2024 primarily due to decreased customer usage. Weather-adjusted commercial KWH sales increased 3.4 for year-to-date 2024 primarily due to increased customer usage. Industrial KWH sales i ncreased 2.0 in the third quarter 2024 primarily due to increases in the chemicals and pipeline sectors. Industrial KWH sales decreased 0.6 for year-to-date 2024 primarily due to a decrease in the petroleum sector. 
 Fuel and other cost recovery revenues decreased in the third quarter and year-to-date 2024 when compared to the corresponding periods in 2023 primarily as a result of lower recoverable fuel costs. Recoverable fuel costs include fuel and purchased power expenses reduced by the fuel and emissions portion of wholesale revenues from energy sold to customers outside Mississippi Power's service territory. Electric rates include provisions to adjust billings for fluctuations in fuel costs, including the energy component of purchased power costs. Under these provisions, fuel revenues generally equal fuel expenses, including the energy component of purchased power costs, and do not affect net income.

 In the third quarter 2024, wholesale revenues from sales to non-affiliates were 66 million compared to 77 million for the corresponding period in 2023. For year-to-date 2024, wholesale revenues from sales to non-affiliates were 179 million compared to 201 million for the corresponding period in 2023. The decreases for the third quarter and year-to-date 2024 were primarily due to decreases of 6 million and 9 million, respectively, associated with lower opportunity sales and decreases of 4 million and 11 million, respectively, associated with MRA customers largely due to lower recoverable fuel costs. 
 Wholesale revenues from sales to non-affiliates will vary depending on fuel prices, the market prices of wholesale energy compared to the cost of Mississippi Power's and the Southern Company system's generation, demand for energy within the Southern Company system's electric service territory, and the availability of the Southern Company system's generation. Increases and decreases in energy revenues that are driven by fuel prices are accompanied by an increase or decrease in fuel costs and do not have a significant impact on net income. In addition, Mississippi Power provides service under long-term contracts with rural electric cooperative associations and municipalities located in southeastern Mississippi under cost-based electric tariffs which are subject to regulation by the FERC. Short-term opportunity energy sales are also included in sales for resale to non-affiliates. These opportunity sales are made at market-based rates that generally provide a margin above Mississippi Power's variable cost to produce the energy. See Note 2 to the financial statements under "Mississippi Power Municipal and Rural Associations Tariff" in Item 8 of the Form 10-K for additional information.

 In the third quarter 2024, wholesale revenues from sales to affiliates were 57 million compared to 65 million for the corresponding period in 2023. The decrease was due to d ecreases of 19 million related to the volume of KWH sales and 5 million related to the price of energy driven by natural gas prices. These decreases were partially offset by an increase of 16 million in capacity revenues primarily associated with a new PPA with Georgia Power. 
 For year-to-date 2024, wholesale revenues from sales to affiliates w ere 166 million compared to 158 million for the corresponding period in 2023. The increase was due to an increase of 46 million in capacity revenues primarily associated with a new PPA with Georgia Power. This increase was partially offset by decreases of 30 million in capacity revenues mainly associated with Mississippi Power's lower availability of generation reserves to the Southern Company power pool and 8 million primarily related to the volume of KWH sales. 
 See Note 2 to the financial statements under "Mississippi Power Integrated Resource Plan" in Item 8 of the Form 10-K for additional information. 
 Wholesale revenues from sales to affiliated companies will vary depending on demand and the availability and cost of generating resources at each company. These affiliate sales are made in accordance with the IIC or other contractual agreements, as approved by the FERC. Energy revenues related to these transactions do not have a significant impact on earnings since this energy is generally sold at marginal cost.

 Total operating revenues include PPA capacity revenues, which are derived primarily from long-term contracts involving natural gas facilities, and PPA energy revenues from Southern Power's generation facilities. To the extent Southern Power has capacity not contracted under a PPA, it may sell power into an accessible wholesale market, or, to the extent those generation assets are part of the FERC-approved IIC, it may sell power into the Southern Company power pool. 
 Natural Gas Capacity and Energy Revenue 
 Capacity revenues generally represent the greatest contribution to operating income and are designed to provide recovery of fixed costs plus a return on investment. 
 Energy is generally sold at variable cost or is indexed to published natural gas indices. Energy revenues will vary depending on the energy demand of Southern Power's customers and their generation capacity, as well as the market prices of wholesale energy compared to the cost of Southern Power's energy. Energy revenues also include fees for support services, fuel storage, and unit start charges. Increases and decreases in energy revenues under PPAs that are driven by fuel or purchased power prices are accompanied by an increase or decrease in fuel and purchased power costs and do not have a significant impact on net income. 
 Solar and Wind Energy Revenue 
 Southern Power's energy sales from solar and wind generating facilities are predominantly through long-term PPAs that do not have capacity revenue. Customers either purchase the energy output of a dedicated renewable facility through an energy charge or pay a fixed price related to the energy generated from the respective facility and sold to the grid. As a result, Southern Power's ability to recover fixed and variable operations and maintenance expenses is dependent upon the level of energy generated from these facilities, which can be impacted by weather conditions, equipment performance, transmission constraints, and other factors. 
 See FUTURE EARNINGS POTENTIAL "Southern Power's Power Sales Agreements" in Item 7 of the Form 10-K for additional information regarding Southern Power's PPAs. 
 Operating Revenues Details 
 Details of Southern Power's operating revenues were as follows: 
 Third Quarter 2024 Third Quarter 2023 Year-To-Date 2024 Year-To-Date 2023 (in millions) PPA capacity revenues 147 134 390 360 PPA energy revenues 373 370 985 953 Total PPA revenues 520 504 1,375 1,313 Non-PPA revenues 71 131 191 327 Other revenues 9 18 31 46 Total operating revenues 600 653 1,597 1,686 
 In the third quarter 2024, total operating revenues were 600 million, reflecting a 53 million, or 8.1 , decrease from the corresponding period in 2023. The change in operating revenues was primarily due to the following: 
 PPA capacity revenues increased 13 million, or 9.7 , due to a net increase in MW capacity under contract from natural gas PPAs and an increase associated with a change in rates from natural gas PPAs.

 MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION 
 AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) 

 PPA energy revenues increased 3 million, or 0.8 , primarily due to an increase of 38 million related to the volume of KWHs sold primarily under natural gas and solar PPAs, largely offset by a decrease of 33 million driven by fuel and purchased power prices. 
 Non-PPA revenues decreased 60 million, or 45.8 , due to a decrease of 50 million related to the volume of KWHs sold through short-term sales and a decrease of 10 million driven by the market price of energy. 
 Other revenues decreased 9 million, or 50.0 , primarily due to a prior year receipt of an arbitration award for losses previously incurred. See Note (C) to the Condensed Financial Statements under "General Litigation Matters Southern Power" herein for additional information. 
 For year-to-date 2024, total operating revenues were 1.6 billion, reflecting an 89 million, or 5.3 , decrease from the corresponding period in 2023. The change in operating revenues was primarily due to the following: 
 PPA capacity revenues increased 30 million, or 8.3 , due to an increase associated with a change in rates from natural gas PPAs and a net increase in MW capacity under contract from natural gas PPAs. 
 PPA energy revenues increased 32 million, or 3.4 , primarily due to an increase of 56 million related to the volume of KWHs sold primarily under natural gas and solar PPAs, partially offset by a decrease of 19 million driven by fuel and purchased power prices. 
 Non-PPA revenues decreased 136 million, or 41.6 , primarily due to a decrease of 139 million related to the volume of KWHs sold through short-term sales. 
 Other revenues decreased 15 million, or 32.6 , primarily due to decreases in receipts of liquidated damages associated with generation facility production guarantees and a prior year receipt of an arbitration award for losses previously incurred. See Note (C) to the Condensed Financial Statements under "General Litigation Matters Southern Power" herein for additional information. 
 
 Fuel and Purchased Power Expenses 
 Details of Southern Power's generation and purchased power were as follows: 
 Third Quarter 2024 Third Quarter 2023 Year-To-Date 2024 Year-To-Date 2023 (in billions of KWHs) Generation 12.8 12.9 34.2 36.9 Purchased power 0.5 0.8 1.7 2.4 Total generation and purchased power 13.3 13.7 35.9 39.3 Total generation and purchased power 
 (excluding solar, wind, fuel cells, and tolling agreements) 
 8.3 8.5 21.5 24.7 
 Southern Power's PPAs for natural gas generation generally provide that the purchasers are responsible for either procuring the fuel (tolling agreements) or reimbursing Southern Power for substantially all of the cost of fuel relating to the energy delivered under such PPAs. Consequently, changes in such fuel costs are generally accompanied by a corresponding change in related fuel revenues and do not have a significant impact on net income. Southern Power is responsible for the cost of fuel for generating units that are not covered under PPAs. Power from these generating units is sold into the wholesale market or into the Southern Company power pool for capacity owned directly by Southern Power. 
 Purchased power expenses will vary depending on demand, availability, and the cost of generating resources throughout the Southern Company system and other contract resources. Load requirements are submitted to the Southern Company power pool on an hourly basis and are fulfilled with the lowest cost alternative, whether that is generation owned by Southern Power, an affiliate company, or external parties. Such purchased power costs are generally recovered through PPA revenues.

 Southern Company Gas 
 Southern Company Gas has various regulatory mechanisms, such as weather and revenue normalization and straight-fixed-variable rate design, which limit its exposure to weather changes within typical ranges in each of its utility's respective service territory. Southern Company Gas also utilizes weather hedges to limit the negative income impacts in the event of warmer-than-normal weather in Illinois for gas distribution operations and in Illinois and Georgia for gas marketing services. Therefore, weather typically does not have a significant net income impact. 
 During the Heating Season, natural gas usage and operating revenues are generally higher as more customers are connected to the gas distribution systems and natural gas usage is higher in periods of colder weather. In addition, because of a rate design change affecting volumetric rates ordered by the Illinois Commission in Nicor Gas' 2023 rate case, additional revenues are expected in the Heating Season, with a corresponding decrease expected in revenues in the second and third quarters of each year. This change will affect the comparison of the prior year revenue for the impacted quarters. Southern Company Gas' base operating expenses, excluding cost of natural gas and bad debt expense, are incurred relatively evenly throughout the year. Seasonality also affects the comparison of certain balance sheet items across quarters, including receivables, unbilled revenues, natural gas for sale, and notes payable. However, these items are comparable when reviewing Southern Company Gas' annual results. Thus, Southern Company Gas' operating results for the interim periods presented are not necessarily indicative of annual results and can vary significantly from quarter to quarter.

 Southern Company Gas' net income in the third quarter 2024 wa s 38 million compared to 82 million for the corresponding period in 2023. The decrease was primarily due to a 49 million decrease in net income at gas distribution operations. 
 For year-to-date 2024, net income was 555 million compared to 475 million for the corresponding period in 2023. The increase was primarily due to a 51 million increase in net income at gas distribution operations, a 13 million increase in net income at gas marketing services, and a 12 million increase in net income at all other. 
 Natural Gas Revenues 
 In the third quarter 2024, natural gas revenues, w ere 682 million co mpared to 689 million for the corresponding period in 2023. For year-to-date 2024, natural gas revenues were 3.2 billion compared to 3.4 billion for the corresponding period in 2023. Details of the changes in natural gas revenues were as follows:

 MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION 
 AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) 

 Revenues from gas costs and other cost recovery decreased for year-to-date 2024 compared to the corresponding period in 2023 primarily due to lower natural gas cost recovery associated with lower natural gas prices and lower demand associated with warmer weather. See "Cost of Natural Gas" herein for additional information. 
 Revenues from gas marketing services decreased for year-to-date 2024 compared to the corresponding period in 2023 primarily due to lower commodity prices.

 Excluding Atlanta Gas Light, which does not sell natural gas to end-use customers, natural gas distribution rates include provisions to adjust billings for fluctuations in natural gas costs. Therefore, gas costs recovered through natural gas revenues generally equal the amount expensed in cost of natural gas and do not affect net income from gas distribution operations. Cost of natural gas at gas distribution operations represented 77 and 81 of the total cost of natural gas in the third quarter and year-to-date 2024, respectively. See MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS RESULTS OF OPERATIONS "Southern Company Gas Cost of Natural Gas" in Item 7 of the Form 10-K and "Natural Gas Revenues" herein for additional information. 
 For year-to-date 2024, cost of natural gas was 0.9 billion compared to 1.2 billion for the corresponding period in 2023. The decrease reflects lower gas cost recovery as a result of a decrease of 22 in natural gas prices. 
 The following table details the volumes of natural gas sold during all periods presented:

 Gas Distribution Operations 
 Gas distribution operations is the largest component of Southern Company Gas' business and is subject to regulation and oversight by regulatory agencies in each of the states it serves. These agencies approve natural gas rates designed to provide Southern Company Gas with the opportunity to generate revenues to recover the cost of natural gas delivered to its customers and its fixed and variable costs, including depreciation, interest expense, operations and maintenance, taxes, and overhead costs, and to earn a reasonable return on its investments. 
 With the exception of Atlanta Gas Light, Southern Company Gas' second largest utility that operates in a deregulated natural gas market and has a straight-fixed-variable rate design that minimizes the variability of its revenues based on consumption, the earnings of the natural gas distribution utilities can be affected by customer consumption patterns that are a function of weather conditions, price levels for natural gas, and general economic conditions that may impact customers' ability to pay for natural gas consumed. Southern Company Gas has various regulatory and other mechanisms, such as weather and revenue normalization mechanisms and weather derivative instruments, that limit its exposure to changes in customer consumption, including weather changes within typical ranges in its natural gas d istribution utilities' service territories. See Note 2 to the financial statements under "Southern Company Gas" in Item 8 of the Form 10-K for additional information. 
 In the third quarter 2024, net income decreased 49 million, or 70.0 , when compared to the corresponding period in 2023, as described further below: 
 Operating revenues decreased 3 million primarily due to the change in timing of revenues at Nicor Gas, partially offset by rate increases. Gas costs recovered through natural gas revenues generally equal the amount expensed in cost of natural gas.

 Operating expenses increased 48 million primarily due to a 31 million increase in other operations and maintenance expense and an 18 million increase in depreciation resulting from additional assets placed in service. 
 Interest expense, net of amounts capitalized increased 10 million primarily due to higher interest rates and higher average outstanding debt. 
 Income taxes decreased 14 million primarily as a result of lower pre-tax earnings, including the change in timing of revenues at Nicor Gas. 
 For year-to-date 2024, net income increased 51 million, or 14.5 , when compared to the corresponding period in 2023, as described further below: 
 Operating revenues decreased 174 million primarily due to lower natural gas cost over recovery, partially offset by rate increases and a change in timing of revenues at Nicor Gas. Gas costs recovered through natural gas revenues generally equal the amount expensed in cost of natural gas. 
 Operating expenses decreased 282 million primarily due to a 322 million decrease in cost of natural gas as a result of lower gas prices and lower volumes sold compared to 2023 and the 30 million prior year regulatory disallowance at Nicor Gas, partially offset by higher depreciation resulting from additional assets placed in service, higher compensation and benefit expenses, and higher revenue taxes. The decrease in operating expenses also includes costs passed through directly to customers, primarily related to bad debt expenses, energy efficiency program, and revenue taxes. 
 Interest expense, net of amounts capitalized increased 29 million primarily due to higher interest rates and higher average outstanding debt. 
 Income taxes increased 26 million primarily as a result of higher pre-tax earnings. 
 See Note 2 to the financial statements under "Southern Company Gas Infrastructure Replacement Programs and Capital Projects Nicor Gas" in Item 8 of the Form 10-K for additional information. 
 Gas Pipeline Investments 
 Gas pipeline investments consists primarily of joint ventures in natural gas pipeline investments including SNG and Dalton Pipeline. See Note (E) to the Condensed Financial Statements under "Southern Company Gas" herein for additional information. 
 Gas Marketing Services 
 Gas marketing services provides energy-related products and services to natural gas markets and participants in customer choice programs that were approved in various states to increase competition. These programs allow customers to choose their natural gas supplier while the local distribution utility continues to provide distribution and transportation services. Gas marketing services is weather sensitive and uses a variety of hedging strategies, such as weather derivative instruments and other risk management tools, to partially mitigate potential weather impacts. 
 In the third quarter 2024, net loss was 2 million compared to net income of 2 million for the corresponding period in 2023. The change was primarily due to increases in compensation and benefit expenses. 
 For year-to-date 2024, net income increased 13 million, or 22.0 , when compared to the corresponding period in 2023 primarily due to retail margins and a decrease in cost of natural gas, partially offset by higher income taxes.

 FUTURE EARNINGS POTENTIAL 
 Each Registrant's results of operations are not necessarily indicative of its future earnings potential. The level of the Registrants' future earnings depends on numerous factors that affect the opportunities, challenges, and risks of the Registrants' primary businesses of selling electricity and/or distributing natural gas, as described further herein. 
 For the traditional electric operating companies, these factors include the ability to maintain constructive regulatory environments that allow for the timely recovery of prudently-incurred costs during a time of increasing costs, including those related to projected long-term demand growth, stringent environmental standards, including CCR rules, safety, system reliability and resiliency, fuel, restoration following major storms, and capital expenditures, including constructing new electric generating plants and expanding and improving the transmission and distribution systems; continued customer growth; and the trends of higher inflation and reduced electricity usage per customer, especially in residential and commercial markets. 
 Earnings in the electricity business will also depend upon maintaining and growing sales, considering, among other things, recent trends driving projected growth in electricity consumption including the increasing digitization of the economy and growth in data centers, an increase in industrial activity in the Southern Company system's electric service territory, and continued electrification of transportation. These growth opportunities could be offset by energy efficiency trends in each market. 
 Global and U.S. economic conditions continue to be affected by higher-than-expected inflation that arose from the COVID-19 pandemic and associated policy responses of governments and central banks. In response to elevated inflation levels, the U.S. Federal Reserve raised interest rates faster than any rate increase cycle in the last 40 years. The actions by the U.S. Federal Reserve have helped to slow the rate of inflation and curtail economic activity. Although target levels of inflation have yet to be achieved, the U.S. Federal Reserve has initiated rate cuts and is expected to continue policy rate reductions into 2025. The shifting economic policy variables and weakening of historic relationships among economic activity, prices, and employment have increased the uncertainty of future levels of economic activity which will directly impact future energy demand and operating costs. Weakening economic activity increases the risk of slowing or declining energy sales. See RESULTS OF OPERATIONS herein for information on energy sales in the Southern Company system's service territory during the first nine months of 2024. 
 The level of future earnings for Southern Power's competitive wholesale electric business depends on numerous factors including the parameters of the wholesale market and the efficient operation of its wholesale generating assets; Southern Power's ability to execute its growth strategy through the development, construction, or acquisition of renewable facilities and other energy projects while containing costs; regulatory matters; customer creditworthiness; total electric generating capacity available in Southern Power's market areas; Southern Power's ability to successfully remarket capacity as current contracts expire; renewable portfolio standards; continued availability of federal and state ITCs and PTCs, which could be impacted by future tax legislation; transmission constraints; cost of generation from units within the Southern Company power pool; and operational limitations. See MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS FUTURE EARNINGS POTENTIAL "Income Tax Matters" in Item 7 of the Form 10-K for information regarding the Inflation Reduction Act's expansion of the availability of federal ITCs and PTCs and Note (K) to the Condensed Financial Statements under "Southern Power" herein for information regarding construction projects. 
 The level of future earnings for Southern Company Gas' primary business of distributing natural gas and its complementary businesses in the gas pipeline investments and gas marketing services sectors depends on numerous factors. These factors include the natural gas distribution utilities' ability to maintain constructive regulatory environments that allow for the timely recovery of prudently-incurred costs, including those related to projected

 MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION 
 AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) 

 long-term demand growth, safety, system reliability and resiliency, natural gas, and capital expenditures, including expanding and improving the natural gas distribution systems; the completion and subsequent operation of ongoing infrastructure and other construction projects; customer creditworthiness; and certain policies to limit the use of natural gas, such as the potential in Illinois and across certain other parts of the U.S. for state or municipal bans on the use of natural gas or policies designed to promote electrification. The volatility of natural gas prices has an impact on Southern Company Gas' customer rates, its long-term competitive position against other energy sources, and the ability of Southern Company Gas' gas marketing services business to capture value from locational and seasonal spreads. Additionally, changes in commodity prices, primarily driven by tight gas supplies, geopolitical events, and diminished gas production, subject a portion of Southern Company Gas' operations to earnings variability and may result in higher natural gas prices. Additional economic factors may contribute to this environment. The demand for natural gas may increase, which may cause natural gas prices to rise and drive higher volatility in the natural gas markets on a longer-term basis. Alternatively, a significant drop in oil and natural gas prices could lead to a consolidation of natural gas producers or reduced levels of natural gas production. 
 Earnings for both the electricity and natural gas businesses are subject to a variety of other factors. These factors include weather; competition; developing new and maintaining existing energy contracts and associated load requirements with wholesale customers; customer energy conservation practices; the use of alternative energy sources by customers; government incentives to reduce overall energy usage; fuel, labor, and material prices in an environment of heightened inflation and material and labor supply chain disruptions; and the price elasticity of demand. Demand for electricity and natural gas in the Registrants' service territories is primarily driven by the pace of economic growth or decline that may be affected by changes in regional and global economic conditions, which may impact future earnings. 
 As part of its ongoing effort to adapt to changing market conditions, Southern Company continues to evaluate and consider a wide array of potential business strategies. These strategies may include business combinations, partnerships, and acquisitions involving other utility or non-utility businesses or properties, disposition of, or the sale of interests in, certain assets or businesses, internal restructuring, or some combination thereof. Furthermore, Southern Company may engage in new business ventures that arise from competitive and regulatory changes in the utility industry. Pursuit of any of the above strategies, or any combination thereof, may significantly affect the business operations, risks, and financial condition of Southern Company. In addition, Southern Power and Southern Company Gas regularly consider and evaluate joint development arrangements as well as acquisitions and dispositions of businesses and assets as part of their business strategies. See Note 15 to the financial statements in Item 8 of the Form 10-K, Note (K) to the Condensed Financial Statements herein, and "Construction Programs" herein for additional information.

 Environmental Laws and Regulations 
 Air Quality 
 On June 27, 2024, the U.S. Supreme Court stayed the 2015 Ozone National Ambient Air Quality Standards Good Neighbor federal implementation plan (FIP) pending the disposition of petitions for review of the FIP in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit and any petition for writ of certiorari to the U.S. Supreme Court. On September 12, 2024, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit granted the EPA's motion for partial voluntary

 AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) 

 remand of the FIP to address the administrative record deficiencies preliminarily identified by the U.S. Supreme Court. While the EPA completes its supplemental review, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit will hold challenges to the FIP in abeyance. 
 On October 21, 2024, the U.S. Supreme Court issued an order granting review of a decision by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit transferring challenges to the EPA's disapproval of interstate transport state implementation plans to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit. On October 24, 2024, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit placed the Alabama state implementation plan disapproval case in abeyance pending the U.S. Supreme Court's decision on the venue issue. 
 The ultimate impact of the FIP and associated legal matters cannot be determined at this time; however, implementation of the stayed FIP would likely result in increased compliance costs for the traditional electric operating companies. 
 Water Quality 
 On May 9, 2024, the EPA published the final rule revising the Steam Effluent Guidelines (ELG Final Rule), which establishes more stringent limits for flue gas desulfurization wastewater, bottom ash transport water, and combustion residual leachate to be met no later than December 31, 2029. The ELG Final Rule maintains the existing rule's permanent cessation of coal subcategory and the existing rule's voluntary incentive program and adds a new cessation subcategory which allows units to cease coal combustion by December 31, 2034 as opposed to meeting the new more stringent requirements. The ELG Final Rule also establishes limitations for legacy wastewater which will be effective 60 days from the date of publication. Numerous groups and states filed petitions for review challenging the rule in multiple federal circuit courts, and, on June 14, 2024, the challenges were consolidated in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit. On July 26, 2024, industry and state petitioners filed a motion to stay the rule pending judicial review, which was denied on October 10, 2024. The ultimate impact of the ELG Final Rule and associated legal matters cannot be determined at this time; however, it may result in significant compliance costs. 
 Coal Combustion Residuals 
 On May 8, 2024, the EPA published the final legacy CCR surface impoundments rule which establishes two new categories of federally regulated CCR, legacy surface impoundments and CCR management units (CCRMU). The rule requires legacy surface impoundments and CCRMUs to meet certain existing regulatory requirements, including a requirement to initiate closure within 42 months after the effective date of the final rule for legacy surface impoundments and within 54 months after the effective date of the final rule for CCRMUs. The final rule also includes an option to defer closure of previously closed units where certain criteria have been met. The final rule also includes enhanced reporting requirements. The EPA is also finalizing an alternative provision for closure by removal that will allow certifying completion of closure of a unit while conducting groundwater monitoring and corrective action during post-closure care. Numerous industry groups, electric generators, and states filed petitions for review challenging the rule in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit. On August 19, 2024, an industry petitioner filed a motion seeking to stay the legacy CCR rule pending judicial review. The ultimate impact of the final rule and associated legal matters cannot be determined at this time; however, it may result in significant compliance costs. 
 On June 7, 2024, the EPA published a final determination to deny the Alabama Department of Environmental Management's CCR permit program. Alabama Power's permits to close its CCR facilities remain valid under state law. In the absence of an EPA-approved state permit program, CCR facilities in Alabama will remain subject to both the federal and state CCR rules. The ultimate impact of this action cannot be determined at this time; however, it may result in significant compliance costs. 
 On June 28, 2024, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit issued a decision dismissing industry challenges to the EPA's January 11, 2022 actions and interpretations related to the closure performance standards in the 2015

 AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) 

 CCR rule. The ultimate impacts of this decision and the EPA's current positions cannot be determined at this time ; however, it may result in significant compliance costs . 
 Based on compliance requirements for closure and monitoring of CCR units pursuant to state and federal CCR rules, the traditional electric operating companies have periodically updated, and expect to continue periodically updating, their related cost estimates and ARO liabilities for each CCR unit as additional information related to compliance monitoring, closure methodologies and strategies, schedules, and/or costs becomes available. Some of these updates have been, and future updates may be, material. The cost estimates for Alabama Power are based on closure-in-place for all surface impoundments. The cost estimates for Georgia Power and Mississippi Power are based on a combination of closure-in-place for some surface impoundments and closure by removal for others. Additionally, the closure designs and plans in the States of Alabama and Georgia are subject to approval by environmental regulatory agencies. Absent continued recovery of ARO costs through regulated rates, results of operations, cash flows, and financial condition for Southern Company and the traditional electric operating companies could be materially impacted. 
 Greenhouse Gases 
 On May 9, 2024, the EPA published the final GHG rules for existing fossil fuel-fired steam electric generating units and new fossil fuel-fired combustion turbines and combined cycle generation facilities, which requires GHG limits for subcategories of both new and existing units. The new rules do not include standards for existing fossil fuel-fired combustion turbines and combined cycle generation facilities, which have been deferred to a future rulemaking. Requirements for existing coal-fired units are based on technologies such as carbon capture and sequestration (CCS) and natural gas co-firing. States have 24 months after the rule's publication to submit state plans for existing units. The rule allows states to consider remaining useful life and other factors to specify alternative, unit-specific emissions limits and compliance timelines for existing units, as needed to address reliability and other concerns. Existing source compliance will begin as early as January 1, 2030, depending on the subcategory. The final rule incorporates some limited reliability mechanisms including a provision for short-term grid emergencies and a "reliability assurance mechanism" that allows for a one-time, up to one year, extension of existing coal unit retirement dates specified in an approved state plan. The standards for new combustion turbines and combined cycles include subcategories for low, intermediate, and base load operations. Compliance with new source standards begins when the unit comes online, with requirements for CCS beginning on January 1, 2032. The EPA also simultaneously repealed the Affordable Clean Energy rule. Numerous industry groups, electric generators, and states have filed petitions for review challenging the rule in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit. A total of eight stay motions were filed seeking a stay of the rule pending judicial review, which were denied by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit on July 19, 2024. On October 16, 2024, the U.S. Supreme Court denied emergency stay applications filed by numerous industry groups, electric generators, and states. The ultimate impact of the final rules and associated legal matters cannot be determined at this time; however, it may result in significant compliance costs. 
 
 Regulatory Matters 
 See Note 2 to the financial statements in Item 8 of the Form 10-K, OVERVIEW "Recent Developments" herein, and Note (B) to the Condensed Financial Statements herein for a discussion of regulatory matters related to Alabama Power, Georgia Power, Mississippi Power, and Southern Company Gas, including items that could impact the applicable Registrants' future earnings, cash flows, and/or financial condition. 
 
 Construction Programs 
 The Southern Company system strategy continues to include developing and constructing new electric generating facilities, expanding and improving the electric transmission and electric and natural gas distribution systems, and undertaking projects to comply with environmental laws and regulations. 
 The traditional electric operating companies are engaged in continuous construction programs to accommodate existing and estimated future loads on their respective systems. Major generation construction projects are subject to 
 132

 state PSC approval in order to be included in retail rates. See Note 2 to the financial statements in Item 8 of the Form 10-K and Note (B) to the Condensed Financial Statements herein under "Georgia Power Integrated Resource Plans" for information regarding Georgia Power's construction of three simple cycle combustion turbines at Plant Yates. 
 See Note (K) to the Condensed Financial Statements under "Southern Power" herein for information relating to Southern Power's construction of renewable energy facilities. 
 Southern Company Gas is engaged in various infrastructure improvement programs designed to update or expand the natural gas distribution systems of the natural gas distribution utilities to improve reliability and resiliency, reduce emissions, and meet operational flexibility and growth. The natural gas distribution utilities recover their investment and a return associated with these infrastructure programs through their regulated rates. See Note 2 to the financial statements in Item 8 of the Form 10-K and Note (B) to the Condensed Financial Statements herein under "Southern Company Gas Infrastructure Replacement Programs and Capital Projects" for additional information on Southern Company Gas' construction program. 
 SNG is developing an approximately 3 billion proposed pipeline project, designed to meet customer demand by increasing SNG's existing pipeline capacity by approximately 1.2 billion cubic feet per day. Subject to the satisfaction or waiver of various conditions, including the receipt of all required approvals by regulators, including the FERC, the operator of the joint venture anticipates the project will be completed in 2028. Southern Company Gas' share of the total project costs would be 50 . The ultimate outcome of this matter cannot be determined at this time. See Note 7 to the financial statements in Item 8 of the Form 10-K and Note (E) to the Condensed Financial Statements herein under "Southern Company Gas" for additional information on SNG. 
 See FINANCIAL CONDITION AND LIQUIDITY "Cash Requirements" herein for additional information regarding the Registrants' capital requirements for their construction programs. 
 
 Income Tax Matters 
 See Note (G) to the Condensed Financial Statements herein and MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS FUTURE EARNINGS POTENTIAL "Income Tax Matters" in Item 7 of the Form 10-K for additional information. 
 Inflation Reduction Act 
 Alabama Power and Georgia Power have nuclear generating facilities that may qualify to generate and claim PTCs under the Inflation Reduction Act beginning in 2024, subject to the issuance of additional guidance by the U.S. Treasury Department and the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). The ultimate outcome of this matter cannot be determined at this time. 
 Additionally, the Inflation Reduction Act enacted a new 15 corporate alternative minimum tax (CAMT) on adjusted financial statement income, as defined in the law, beginning in 2023. On September 12, 2024, the U.S. Treasury Department and the IRS issued a notice of proposed regulations that would address the application of the CAMT. Southern Company is evaluating the proposed regulations and was not subject to the CAMT for the 2023 tax year based on interpretations of the early guidance. However, Southern Company believes it may be subject to the CAMT for the 2024 tax year dependent upon the final assessment of the tax treatment of Georgia Power's storm restoration costs. If applicable, the CAMT will primarily be satisfied by tax credits. As such, the CAMT could materially impact operating cash flows of certain Registrants but will not impact the Registrants' net income. Application of the CAMT is subject to the issuance of additional guidance by the U.S. Treasury Department and the IRS and the ultimate outcome of this matter cannot be determined at this time. See Note (B) to the Condensed Financial Statements under "Georgia Power Storm Damage Recovery" herein for additional information. 
 Georgia State Tax Legislation 
 On April 18, 2024, the State of Georgia enacted tax legislation that reduced the corporate income tax rate from 5.75 to 5.39 effective for the 2024 tax year. This legislation reduced the amount of Southern Company's and 
 133 

Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements 
 
 MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION 
 AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) 

 certain subsidiaries' income tax expense in the State of Georgia and existing state net accumulated deferred tax liabilities, increased regulatory liabilities at Georgia Power and Southern Company Gas, and reduces Georgia Power's ability to utilize certain state tax credits in the State of Georgia. The legislation did not have a material impact on the net income of the applicable Registrants. 
 Natural Gas Safe Harbor Method 
 On April 30, 2024, the IRS issued Revenue Procedure 2024-23, which gives additional implementation guidance on the natural gas safe harbor tax method of accounting for qualifying repair deductions. Southern Company and Southern Company Gas intend to submit a tax accounting method change for qualifying expenditures with the filing of the 2024 federal income tax return. The new tax method of accounting is expected to result in a material net positive cash flow in 2024 for Southern Company Gas; however, the timing of this positive cash flow could be delayed by application of the CAMT. This will not have a material impact on Southern Company. The ultimate outcome of this matter cannot be determined at this time. 
 
 General Litigation and Other Matters 
 The Registrants are involved in various matters being litigated and/or regulatory and other matters that could affect future earnings, cash flows, and/or financial condition. The ultimate outcome of such pending or potential litigation against each Registrant and any subsidiaries or regulatory and other matters cannot be determined at this time; however, for current proceedings and/or matters not specifically reported herein or in Notes (B) and (C) to the Condensed Financial Statements herein, management does not anticipate that the ultimate liabilities, if any, arising from such current proceedings and/or matters would have a material effect on such Registrant's financial statements. See Notes (B) and (C) to the Condensed Financial Statements for a discussion of various contingencies, including matters being litigated, regulatory matters, and other matters which may affect future earnings potential. 
 
 ACCOUNTING POLICIES 
 See MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS ACCOUNTING POLICIES in Item 7 of the Form 10-K for a complete discussion of the Registrants' critical accounting policies and estimates, as well as recently issued accounting standards. 
 Application of Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 
 The Registrants prepare their financial statements in accordance with GAAP. Significant accounting policies are described in the notes to the financial statements in Item 8 of the Form 10-K. In the application of these policies, certain estimates are made that may have a material impact on the Registrants' results of operations and related disclosures. Different assumptions and measurements could produce estimates that are significantly different from those recorded in the financial statements. 
 Recently Issued Accounting Standards 
 In November 2023, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Accounting Standards Update 2023-07, Segment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures (ASU 2023-07), which requires entities to disclose significant segment expenses, other segment items, the title and position of the chief operating decision maker (CODM), and information related to how the CODM assesses segment performance and allocates resources, among certain other required disclosures. Additionally, current annual disclosures will be required in interim periods. The new standard is effective, on a retrospective basis, for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023 and interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024, with early adoption permitted. The Registrants are currently evaluating the impact ASU 2023-07 will have on their financial statement disclosures.

 FINANCIAL CONDITION AND LIQUIDITY 
 Overview 
 See MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS FINANCIAL CONDITION AND LIQUIDITY "Overview" in Item 7 of the Form 10-K for additional information. The financial condition of each Registrant remained stable at September 30, 2024. The Registrants intend to continue to monitor their access to short-term and long-term capital markets as well as their bank credit arrangements to meet future capital and liquidity needs. See "Cash Requirements," "Sources of Capital," and "Financing Activities" herein for additional information. 
 At the end of the third quarter 2024, the market price of Southern Company's common stock was 90.18 per share (based on the closing price as reported on the NYSE) and the book value was 30.39 per share, representing a market-to-book ratio of 297 , compared to 70.12, 28.83, and 243 , respectively, at the end of 2023. Southern Company's common stock dividend for the third quarter 2024 was 0.72 per share compared to 0.70 per share in the third quarter 2023. 
 
 Cash Requirements 
 See MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS FINANCIAL CONDITION AND LIQUIDITY "Cash Requirements" in Item 7 of the Form 10-K for a description of the Registrants' significant cash requirements. 
 The Registrants' significant cash requirements include estimated capital expenditures associated with their construction programs and, for the traditional electric operating companies, operating cash flows related to fuel cost under recovery, as well as storm restoration costs for Georgia Power. The fuel cost under recovery balances are primarily the result of higher than forecasted prices for natural gas and purchased power. The regulatory asset balance related to storm damage is primarily the result of significant damage to Georgia Power's transmission and distribution facilities caused by Hurricane Helene during September 2024. See Note (B) to the Condensed Financial Statements herein for additional information. 
 The construction programs are subject to periodic review and revision, and actual construction costs may vary from these estimates because of numerous factors. These factors include: changes in business conditions; changes in load projections; changes in environmental laws and regulations; the outcome of any legal challenges to environmental rules; changes in electric generating plants, including unit retirements and replacements and adding or changing fuel sources at existing electric generating units, to meet regulatory requirements; changes in FERC rules and regulations; state regulatory agency approvals; changes in the expected environmental compliance program; changes in legislation, regulation, and/or tariff policy; the cost, availability, and efficiency of construction labor, equipment, and materials; project scope and design changes; abnormal weather; delays in construction due to judicial or regulatory action; storm impacts; and the cost of capital. In addition, there can be no assurance that costs related to capital expenditures and AROs will be fully recovered. Additionally, expenditures associated with Southern Power's planned acquisitions may vary due to market opportunities and the execution of its growth strategy. 
 In October 2024, Alabama Power's Board of Directors approved updates to its construction program that is currently 
 estimated to total 2.2 billion for 2025, 2.1 billion for each of 2026, 2027, and 2028, and 2.0 billion for 2029. These amounts include capital expenditures related to nuclear fuel and LTSAs. These amounts also include estimated capital expenditures to comply with environmental laws and regulations, but do not include any potential compliance costs associated with any future regulation of CO 2 emissions from fossil fuel-fired electric generating units. 
 See Note (B) to the Condensed Financial Statements under "Georgia Power Integrated Resource Plans" herein for information regarding Georgia Power's 2023 IRP Update, which includes incremental cash requirements for capital expenditures through 2027 of approximately 700 million. 
 Southern Power's construction program includes the Millers Branch solar project. The remaining aggregate construction costs for this project are expected to be between 570 million and 700 million, including estimated capital expenditures associated with the phase three expansion of the Millers Branch solar project, which was

 committed to subsequent to September 30, 2024. The ultimate outcome of this matter cannot be determined at this time. See Note (K) to the Condensed Financial Statements under "Southern Power" herein for additional information. 
 Long-term debt maturities and the interest payable on long-term debt each represent a significant cash requirement for the Registrants. See "Financing Activities" herein for information on changes in the Registrants' long-term debt balances since December 31, 2023. 
 
 Sources of Capital 
 See MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS FINANCIAL CONDITION AND LIQUIDITY "Sources of Capital" in Item 7 of the Form 10-K for additional information. Southern Company intends to meet its future capital needs through operating cash flows, borrowings from financial institutions, and debt, hybrid, and/or equity issuances. Equity capital can be provided from any combination of Southern Company's stock plans, private placements, or public offerings. 
 The Subsidiary Registrants plan to obtain the funds to meet their future capital needs from sources similar to those they used in the past, which were primarily from operating cash flows, external securities issuances, borrowings from financial institutions, and equity contributions from Southern Company. Operating cash flows provide a substantial portion of the Registrants' cash needs. Georgia Power intends to utilize a mix of senior note issuances, short-term floating rate bank loans, and commercial paper issuances to continue funding operating cash flows related to fuel cost under recovery and storm restoration costs. See Note (B) to the Condensed Financial Statements under "Georgia Power Storm Damage Recovery" herein for additional information. 
 The amount, type, and timing of any financings in 2024, as well as in subsequent years, will be contingent on investment opportunities and the Registrants' capital requirements and will depend upon prevailing market conditions, regulatory approvals (for certain of the Subsidiary Registrants), and other factors. See "Cash Requirements" and "Financing Activities" herein for additional information. 
 Southern Power utilizes tax equity partnerships as one of its financing sources, where the tax partner takes significantly all of the federal tax benefits. These tax equity partnerships are consolidated in Southern Power's financial statements and are accounted for using HLBV methodology to allocate partnership gains and losses. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, Southern Power's tax equity funding for existing tax equity partnerships was immaterial. See Note 1 to the financial statements under "General" in Item 8 of the Form 10-K for additional information. 
 By regulation, Nicor Gas is restricted, up to its retained earnings balance, in the amount it can dividend or loan to affiliates and is not permitted to make money pool loans to affiliates. At September 30, 2024, the amount of subsidiary retained earnings restricted to dividend totaled 1.6 billion. This restriction did not impact Southern Company Gas' ability to meet its cash obligations, nor does management expect such restriction to materially impact Southern Company Gas' ability to meet its currently anticipated cash obligations. 
 Certain Registrants' current liabilities frequently exceed their current assets because of long-term debt maturities and the periodic use of short-term debt as a funding source, as well as significant seasonal fluctuations in cash needs. The Registrants generally plan to refinance long-term debt as it matures. The following table shows the amount by which current liabilities exceeded current assets at September 30, 2024 for the applicable Registrants: 
 At September 30, 2024 Southern Company Georgia Power Mississippi Power Southern Company Gas (in millions) Current liabilities in excess of current assets 1,125 1,540 32 80 
 The Registrants believe the need for working capital can be adequately met by utilizing operating cash flows, as well as commercial paper, lines of credit, and short-term bank notes, as market conditions permit. In addition, under 
 136 

Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements 
 
 MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION 
 AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) 

 certain circumstances, the Subsidiary Registrants may utilize equity contributions and/or loans from Southern Company. 
 Bank Credit Arrangements 
 At September 30, 2024, unused committed credit arrangements with banks were as follows: 
 At September 30, 2024 Southern Company parent Alabama Power Georgia Power Mississippi Power Southern 
 Power (a) 
 Southern Company Gas (b) 
 SEGCO Southern Company (in millions) Unused committed credit 1,998 1,350 2,026 275 600 1,598 30 7,877 
 (a) At September 30, 2024, Southern Power also had two continuing letters of credit facilities for standby letters of credit, of which 21 million was unused. Southern Power's subsidiaries are not parties to its bank credit arrangements or letter of credit facilities. 
 (b) Includes 798 million and 800 million at Southern Company Gas Capital and Nicor Gas, respectively. 
 Subject to applicable market conditions, the Registrants, Nicor Gas, and SEGCO expect to renew or replace their bank credit arrangements as needed, prior to expiration. In connection therewith, the Registrants, Nicor Gas, and SEGCO may extend the maturity dates and/or increase or decrease the lending commitments thereunder. 
 A portion of the unused credit with banks is allocated to provide liquidity support to certain revenue bonds of the traditional electric operating companies and the commercial paper programs of the Registrants, Nicor Gas, and SEGCO. At September 30, 2024, outstanding variable rate demand revenue bonds of the traditional electric operating companies with allocated liquidity support totaled approximately 1.7 billion (comprised of approximately 796 million at Alabama Power, 819 million at Georgia Power, and 69 million at Mississippi Power). In addition, at September 30, 2024, Alabama Power and Georgia Power had approximately 207 million and 157 million, respectively, of fixed rate revenue bonds outstanding that are required to be remarketed within the next 12 months. Alabama Power's 207 million of fixed rate revenue bonds are classified as securities due within one year on its balance sheets as they are not covered by long-term committed credit. All other variable rate demand revenue bonds and fixed rate revenue bonds required to be remarketed within the next 12 months are classified as long-term debt on the balance sheets as a result of available long-term committed credit. 
 See Note 8 to the financial statements in Item 8 of the Form 10-K and Note (F) to the Condensed Financial Statements herein under "Bank Credit Arrangements" for additional information. 
 Short-term Borrowings 
 The Registrants, Nicor Gas, and SEGCO make short-term borrowings primarily through commercial paper programs that have the liquidity support of the committed bank credit arrangements described above. Southern Power's subsidiaries are not issuers or obligors under its commercial paper program. Commercial paper and short-

 Credit Rating Risk 
 At September 30, 2024, the Registrants did not have any credit arrangements that would require material changes in payment schedules or terminations as a result of a credit rating downgrade. 
 There are certain contracts that could require collateral, but not accelerated payment, in the event of a credit rating change of certain Registrants to BBB and/or Baa2 or below. These contracts are primarily for physical electricity and natural gas purchases and sales, fuel purchases, fuel transportation and storage, energy price risk management, transmission, interest rate management, and, for Georgia Power, services at Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4. 
 The maximum potential collateral requirements under these contracts at September 30, 2024 were as follows: 
 Credit Ratings Southern Company ) 
 Alabama Power Georgia Power Mississippi Power Southern 
 Power ) 
 Southern Company Gas (in millions) At BBB and/or Baa2 36 1 35 At BBB- and/or Baa3 443 2 60 1 381 At BB+ and/or Ba1 or below 1,915 382 767 294 1,273 13 
 ) Southern Power has PPAs that could require collateral, but not accelerated payment, in the event of a downgrade of Southern Power's credit. The PPAs require credit assurances without stating a specific credit rating. The amount of collateral required would depend upon actual losses resulting from a credit downgrade. Southern Power had 106 million of cash collateral posted related to PPA requirements at September 30, 2024. 
 The amounts in the previous table for the traditional electric operating companies and Southern Power include certain agreements that could require collateral if either Alabama Power or Georgia Power has a credit rating change to below investment grade. Generally, collateral may be provided by a Southern Company guaranty, letter of credit, or cash. Additionally, a credit rating downgrade could impact the ability of the Registrants to access capital markets and would be likely to impact the cost at which they do so. 
 On May 2, 2024, S P upgraded the issuer credit rating for Southern Company to A- from BBB+. Due to S P's

 rating methodology, the upgrade of Southern Company's issuer credit rating resulted in the upgrade of the senior unsecured long-term debt ratings of Mississippi Power, Southern Company Gas Capital, and Atlanta Gas Light to A- from BBB+, the senior unsecured long-term debt rating of Georgia Power to A from BBB+, the senior unsecured long-term debt rating of Alabama Power to A from A-, and the senior unsecured long-term debt ratings of Southern Company and Southern Power to BBB+ from BBB.

Any installment of interest on the bonds of this Supplemental Indenture may, at the Company s option, be paid by mailing checks for such interest payable to or upon the written order of the person entitled thereto to the address of such person as it appears on the registration books. The bonds of this Supplemental Indenture shall be registrable, transferable and exchangeable in the manner provided in Sections 4.08 and 4.09 of the Indenture, at either of such offices or agencies. 
 Section 4. The bonds of this Supplemental Indenture, upon the mailing of notice and in the manner provided in Section 7.01 of the Indenture (except that no published notice shall be required for the bonds of this Supplemental Indenture) and with the effect provided in Section 7.02 thereof, shall be redeemable at the option of the Company, as a whole at any time or in part from time to time, at a redemption price equal to 100 of the principal amount of the bonds of this Supplemental Indenture to be redeemed plus accrued and unpaid interest of the principal amount being redeemed to the date of redemption plus the Make-Whole Amount applicable thereto, as calculated by the Company. Make-Whole Amount means, with respect to any bond of this Supplemental Indenture, an amount equal to the excess, if any, of the Discounted Value of the Remaining Scheduled Payments with respect to the Called Principal of such bond of this Supplemental Indenture over the amount of such Called Principal, provided that the Make-Whole Amount may in no event be less than zero. For the purposes of determining the Make-Whole Amount, the following terms have the following meanings 
 Called Principal means, with respect to any bond of this Supplemental Indenture, the principal of such bond of this Supplemental Indenture that is to be redeemed. 
 Discounted Value means, with respect to the Called Principal of any bond of this Supplemental Indenture, the amount obtained by discounting all Remaining Scheduled Payments with respect to such Called Principal from their respective scheduled due dates to the Settlement Date with respect to such Called Principal, in accordance with accepted financial practice and at a discount factor (applied on the same periodic basis as that on which interest on the bond of this Supplemental Indenture is payable) equal to the Reinvestment Yield with respect to such Called Principal. 
 Reinvestment Yield means, with respect to the Called Principal of any bond of this Supplemental Indenture, the sum of (x) 0.50 plus (y) the yield to maturity implied by the Ask Yield(s) reported as of 10 00 a.m. (New York City time) on the second Business Day preceding the Settlement Date with respect to such Called Principal, on the display designated as Page PX1 (or such other display as may replace Page PX1) on Bloomberg Financial Markets for the most recently issued actively traded on-the-run U.S. Treasury securities Reported having a maturity equal to the Remaining Average Life of such Called Principal as of such Settlement Date. If there are no such U.S. Treasury securities Reported having a maturity equal to such Remaining Average Life, then such implied yield to maturity will be determined by (a) converting U.S. Treasury bill quotations to bond equivalent yields in accordance with accepted financial practice and (b) interpolating linearly between the Ask Yields Reported for the applicable most recently issued actively traded on-the-run U.S. Treasury securities with the maturities 
 -30- 

(1) closest to and greater than such Remaining Average Life and (2) closest to and less than such Remaining Average Life. The Reinvestment Yield shall be rounded to the number of decimal places as appears in the interest rate of the applicable bond. 
 If such yields are not Reported or the yields Reported as of such time are not ascertainable (including by way of interpolation), then Reinvestment Yield means, with respect to the Called Principal of any bond of this Supplemental Indenture, the sum of (x) 0.50 plus (y) the yield to maturity implied by the U.S. Treasury constant maturity yields reported, for the latest day for which such yields have been so reported as of the second Business Day preceding the Settlement Date with respect to such Called Principal, in Federal Reserve Statistical Release H.15 (or any comparable successor publication) for the U.S. Treasury constant maturity having a term equal to the Remaining Average Life of such Called Principal as of such Settlement Date. If there is no such U.S. Treasury constant maturity having a term equal to such Remaining Average Life, such implied yield to maturity will be determined by interpolating linearly between (1) the U.S. Treasury constant maturity so reported with the term closest to and greater than such Remaining Average Life and (2) the U.S. Treasury constant maturity so reported with the term closest to and less than such Remaining Average Life. If there is no available U.S. Treasury greater than such Remaining Average Life to be used for linear interpolation, and if there is no such U.S. Treasury constant maturity having a term equal to two years either side of such Remaining Average Life, the yield to maturity will be determined by the available U.S. Treasury whose maturity is closest to the Remaining Average Life. The selection of this closest U.S. Treasury will be confirmed by an intermediary , which will be appointed by PNC Capital Markets LLC or its successor. The intermediary will be selected from a pool of various experts and market makers in the applicable markets applicable to U.S. Treasuries. The Reinvestment Yield shall be rounded to the number of decimal places as appears in the interest rate of the applicable bond. 
 Remaining Average Life means, with respect to any Called Principal, the number of years obtained by dividing (a) such Called Principal into (b) the sum of the products obtained by multiplying (1) the principal component of each Remaining Scheduled Payment with respect to such Called Principal by (2) the number of years, computed on the basis of a 360-day year comprised of twelve 30-day months and calculated to the nearest two decimal places, that will elapse between the Settlement Date with respect to such Called Principal and the scheduled due date of such Remaining Scheduled Payment. 
 Remaining Scheduled Payments means, with respect to the Called Principal of any bond of this Supplemental Indenture, all payments of such Called Principal and interest thereon that would be due after the Settlement Date with respect to such Called Principal if no payment of such Called Principal were made prior to its scheduled due date, provided that if such Settlement Date is not a date on which interest payments are due to be made under the terms of the bond of this Supplemental Indenture, then the amount of the next succeeding scheduled interest payment will be reduced by the amount of interest accrued to such Settlement Date and required to be paid on such Settlement Date pursuant to the terms of this Supplemental Indenture. 
 -31- 

Settlement Date means, with respect to the Called Principal of any bond of this Supplemental Indenture, the date on which such Called Principal is to be redeemed. 
 Section 5. No sinking fund is to be provided for the bonds of this Supplemental Indenture. 
 Article II Miscellaneous Provisions
