 Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations We are a Colorado corporation and our subsidiaries are GRC Nevada Inc. GRCN ), Walker Lane Minerals Corp. WLMC ), County Line Holdings Inc. CLH ), County Line Minerals Corp. CLMC ), and Golden Mile Minerals Corp. GMMC ). WLMC, CLH, CLMC and GMMC are wholly-owned subsidiaries of GRCN. We are a mining company which pursues gold and silver projects that are expected to have both low operating costs and high returns on capital. We are presently focused on mineral production from our Isabella Pearl Mine in Nevada. The ore mined at Isabella Pearl is processed on site at our processing facilities and sold to a refiner as dor , which contains precious metals of gold and silver. We also continue exploration and evaluation work on our portfolio of other precious metal properties in Nevada and continue to evaluate other properties for possible acquisition. In February 2021, we began trading on the OTC Market pink sheets operated by the OTC Markets Group and subsequently up listed to the OTCQB on March 5, 2021 with a symbol change to FTCO . The following discussion summarizes our results of operations f or the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 . It also analyzes our financial condition at September 30, 2024 . This discussion should be read in conjunction with the management s discussion and analysis and the audited consolidated financial statements and footnotes for the year ended December 31, 2023 contained in our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. The discussion also presents certain financial measures that are not prepared in accordance with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles Non-GAAP but which are important to management in its evaluation of our operating results and are used by management to compare our performance with what we perceive to be peer group mining companies and are relied on as part of management s decision-making process. Management believes these measures may also be important to investors in evaluating our performance. For a detailed description of each of the non-GAAP financial measures, please see the discussion below under Non-GAAP Measures. See Forward-Looking Statements at the end of this Item 2 for important information regarding statements contained herein. Third Quarter 2024 Financial Results and Highlights 10.2 million net sales 30.3 million cash balance on September 30, 2024 4,220 gold ounces produced 41.5 million working capital at September 30, 2024 4.8 million mine gross profit 2.7 million exploration expenditures 906 total cash cost after by-product credits per gold ounce sold 990 per ounce total all-in sustaining cost 2.9 million dividends paid

 Operating Data : The following tables summarize certain information about our operations at our Isabella Pearl Mine for the periods indicated:

Differences can also arise from inventory changes incidental to shipping schedules, or variances in ore grades and recoveries which impact the amounts of metals contained in dor produced and sold. During the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, we produced 4,220 and 11,122 ounces of gold, respectively. The decreased production in 2024 is primarily due to lower leach pad recoveries due to overall lower-grade ore mined and delays in permitting our next targeted mine build at County Line. Mining and placement of ore on the heap leach pad continued to be limited to lower grade ore being mined from the Civit Cat area of the Isabella Pearl deposit and the utilization of the low-grade ore stockpile prior to receiving permit approval to mine deeper in the Pearl pit on September 18, 2024. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, we produced 12,353 and 32,293 ounces of gold, respectively. The decreased production in 2024 is primarily due to lower leach pad recoveries due to overall lower-grade ore mined and delays in permitting our next targeted mine build at County Line. Mining and placement of ore on the heap leach pad continued to be limited to lower grade ore being mined from the Civit Cat area of the Isabella Pearl deposit and the utilization of the low-grade ore stockpile prior to receiving permit approval to mine deeper in the Pearl pit on September 18, 2024.

Our average metal prices realized will therefore differ from the market average metal prices in most cases. Cash cost after by-product credit increased due mainly to lower sales volumes. Consolidated Results of Operations Three Months Ended September 30, 2024 Compared to Three Months Ended September 30, 2023 Sales, net . For the three months ended September 30, 2024, consolidated sales, net were 10.2 million as compared to 21.3 million for the same period in 2023. The decrease is attributable to lower sales volumes, partially offset by higher average sales price. Third quarter 2024 gold sales volumes decreased 62 , while the average realized price for gold increased 26 , from the same period in 2023. Lower sales volumes during the three months ended September 30, 2024 were the result of decreased production which was primarily due to lower leach pad recoveries due to overall lower-grade ore mined, and delays in permitting our next targeted mine build at County Line. Mining and placement of ore on the heap leach pad continued to be limited to lower grade ore being mined from the Civit Cat area of the Isabella Pearl deposit and the utilization of the low-grade ore stockpile prior to receiving permit approval to mine deeper in the Pearl pit on September 18, 2024. Mine gross profit. For the three months ended September 30, 2024, we recorded 4.8 million mine gross profit compared to 11.8 million mine gross profit for the same period in 2023. The decrease is primarily attributable to lower sales, as discussed above, and increased cost per ounce due to lower-grade ore mined. General and administrative . For the three months ended September 30, 2024, general and administrative expenses were 1.7 million as compared to 1.3 million in the same period in 2023. The increase is primarily attributable to an increase in stock-based compensation. Exploration expenses . For the three months ending September 30, 2024, property exploration expenses of 2.7 million as compared to 3.8 million for the same period of 2023. The decrease is primarily due to decreased exploration spending to preserve capital due to permit delays of our next targeted mine build at County Line. Exploration spending in the third quarter of 2024 primarily related to exploration, hydrogeological investigations, and permitting studies at East Camp Douglas, County Line and the Isabella Pearl trend properties.

 Other income, net . For the three months ending September 30, 2024, other income totaling 0.5 million did not materially change from 0.5 million in the same period in 2023. Mining and income tax (benefit) expense. For the three months ended September 30, 2024, mining and income tax benefit was 0.1 million as compared to mining and income tax expense of 1.4 million for the same period in 2023. The decrease is the result of our lower income before income and mining taxes. See Note 5 to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements . Net income . For the three months ended September 30, 2024, we recorded net income of 0.9 million as compared to 5.7 million in the corresponding period for 2023. The decrease is due to l ower sales volumes during the three months ended September 30, 2024 resulting from decreased production. Consolidated Results of Operations Nine months Ended September 30, 2024 Compared to Nine months Ended September 30, 2023 Sales, net . For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, consolidated sales, net were 28.0 million as compared to 62.0 million for the same period in 2023. The decrease is attributable to lower sales volumes, partially offset by higher average sales price. For the nine months ending September 30, 2024, gold sales volumes decreased 62 in 2024, while the average realized price for gold increased 18 , from the same period in 2023. Lower sales volumes during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 were the result of decreased production which was primarily due to lower leach pad recoveries due to overall lower-grade ore mined, and delays in permitting our next targeted mine build at County Line. Mining and placement of ore on the heap leach pad continued to be limited to lower grade ore being mined from the Civit Cat area of the Isabella Pearl deposit and the utilization of the low-grade ore stockpile prior to receiving permit approval to mine deeper in the Pearl pit on September 18, 2024. Mine gross profit. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we recorded 13.8 million mine gross profit compared to 35.4 million mine gross profit for the same period in 2023. The decrease is primarily attributable to lower sales, as discussed above, and increased cost per ounce due to lower-grade ore mined. General and administrative . For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, general and administrative expenses were 4.2 million compared to 3.5 million for the same period in 2023. The increase is primarily attributable to an increase in stock-based compensation. Exploration expenses . For the nine months ending September 30, 2024, property exploration expenses were 10.6 million as compared to 13.6 million for the same period of 2023. The decrease is primarily due to decreased exploration spending to preserve capital due to permit delays of our next targeted mine build at County Line. Exploration spending in 2024 primarily related to the East Camp Douglas, County Line and the Isabella Pearl trend Scarlet target properties. Other income, net . For the nine months ending September 30, 2024, other income totaled 1.7 million as compared to 1.3 million for the same period of 2023. The change is due to an increase in unrealized gains on our gold and silver bullion/rounds as a result of increasing gold and silver prices and an increase in interest income. Mining and income tax (benefit) expense. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, mining and income tax benefit was 0.1 million as compared to mining and income tax expense of 3.9 million for the same period in 2023. The decrease is the result of our lower income before income and mining taxes. See Note 5 to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements . Net income . For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we recorded a net income of 0.8 million as compared to 15.7 million in the corresponding period for 2023. The decrease is due to l ower sales volumes during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 resulting from decreased production.

 Non-GAAP Measures Throughout this report, we have provided information prepared or calculated according to U.S. GAAP and have referenced some non-GAAP performance measures which we believe will assist with understanding the performance of our business. These measures are based on precious metal gold equivalent ounces sold and include cash cost before by-product credits per ounce, total cash cost after by-product credits per ounce, and total all-in sustaining cost per ounce AISC ). Because the non-GAAP performance measures do not have any standardized meaning prescribed by U.S. GAAP, they may not be comparable to similar measures presented by other companies. Accordingly, these measures should not be considered in isolation, or as a substitute for measures of performance prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. These non-GAAP measures are not necessarily indicative of operating profit or cash flow from operations as determined under GAAP. Revenue generated from the sale of silver is considered a by-product of our gold production for the purpose of our total cash cost after by-product credits for our Isabella Pearl Mine. We periodically review our revenues to ensure that our reporting of primary products and by-products is appropriate. Because we consider silver to be a by-product of our gold production, the value of silver continues to be applied as a reduction to total cash costs in our calculation of total cash cost after by-product credits per precious metal gold equivalent ounce sold. Likewise, we believe the identification of silver as by-product credits is appropriate because of its lower individual economic value compared to gold and since gold is the primary product we produce. Total cash cost, after by-product credits, is a measure developed by the World Gold Institute to provide a uniform standard for comparison purposes. AISC is calculated based on the current guidance from the World Gold Council. Total cash cost before by-product credits includes all direct and indirect production costs related to our production of metals (including mining, crushing and conveying and other plant facility costs, royalties, and site general and administrative costs) plus treatment and refining costs. Total cash cost after by-product credits includes total cash cost before by-product credits less by-product credits, or revenues earned from silver. AISC includes total cash cost after by-product credits plus other costs related to sustaining production, including sustaining allocated general and administrative expenses and sustaining capital expenditures. We determined sustaining capital expenditures as those capital expenditures that are necessary to maintain current production and execute the current mine plan. Cash cost before by-product credits per ounce, total cash cost after by-product credits per ounce and AISC are calculated by dividing the relevant costs, as determined using the cost elements noted above, by gold ounces sold for the periods presented. Reconciliations to U.S. GAAP The following table provides a reconciliation of total cash cost after by-product credits to total mine cost of sales (a U.S. GAAP measure) as presented in the Consolidated Statements of Operations :

(3) Sustaining capital expenditures and sustaining exploration expenses divided by gold ounces sold. The following tables summarize our by-product revenue and by-product credit gold ounce sold: 

Three months ended September 30, Nine months ended September 30, 2024 2023 2024 2023 (in thousands) (in thousands) By-product credits by dollar value: Silver sales 331 581 1,277 1,308 Total sales from by-products 331 581 1,277 1,308 

Three months ended September 30, Nine months ended September 30, 2024 2023 2024 2023 By-product credits per gold pounce sold: Silver sales 79 53 104 41 Total by-product credits per gold ounce sold 79 53 104 41 Liquidity and Capital Resources As of September 30, 2024, we had a cash position of 30.3 million compared to 48.7 million at December 31, 2023. The change is primarily due to decreased cash from operations, exploration spending and dividends paid. As of September 30, 2024, we had working capital of 41.5 million compared to 67.3 million at December 31, 2023. Our working capital balance fluctuates as we use cash to fund our operations, financing and investing activities, including exploration, mine development and income taxes. With our working capital balance as of September 30, 2024, we believe that our liquidity and capital resources are adequate to fund our operations, exploration, capital, and corporate activities for the next twelve months. Net cash used in operating activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 6.4 million, compared to 22.6 million net cash provided by operating activities for nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease is 

 17 

Table of Contents 
 primarily due to lower net income and changes in inventory, depreciation and amortization, income and mining taxes payable and accounts payable. Net cash used in investing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 3.3 million compared to 6.0 million during the same period in 2023. The decrease is primarily due to less capital expenditures. Net cash used in financing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 8.6 million compared to 9.6 million for the same period in 2023. The decrease is primarily attributable to lower dividends due to the special dividend paid in May 2023. Development and Exploration Activities Isabella Pearl Mine: During the third quarter, operations continued at the Isabella Pearl IP Mine open-pit and heap leach operations. Piezometer installations were completed at the Isabella Pearl Mine to monitor groundwater levels. Mapping and sampling campaigns continued to the northwest of the Isabella Pearl Mine to further understand the gold-bearing structures that are exposed on surface, and to identify optimal areas to drill along the IP mineralized structural corridor. Analysis of final phase mining along the south rim of the pit and possible opportunities to extract the mineralized access ramp once the oxide mineralization deep is exhausted. In September 2024, we received permit approval to mine deeper in the Isabella Pearl pit. County Line property : Permitting activities continued with regulatory authorities relating to the development of the County Line mine. A piezometer installation program was planned to test the groundwater in the vicinity of the County Line and East pits; the program is scheduled to commence in the fourth quarter of 2024. This water level information will be used to plan the optimal location and depth of an additional water well once operations start. Geochemical studies of the rock units, in and around the historic pits, continued in the third quarter to determine the neutralizing potential of the units during mining. Internal geological and resource estimation modeling on the property continued during the third quarter. This information, in addition to other supportive datasets, is being used to plan another resource drill program on the property for the modified Notice of Intent NOI ). Golden Mile property: Permitting activities for development of the Golden Mile mine continued during the quarter. A land reclamation and reseeding program of disturbed U.S. Department of the Interior Bureau of Land Management BLM land on the property began in the third quarter. Once growth is established and accepted by the BLM to be reclaimed sufficiently, the BLM may release this land and allow for more drilling to be completed on the property, if required. East Camp Douglas property : Reverse circulation drilling continued in the project s northern White Rock Springs area. Sampling and mapping campaigns advanced in the project s southern Lithocap area. Cultural resource and biological surveys continued in the third quarter, as these studies are the main baseline studies required to establish the existing conditions for the pending Plan of Operations application and are the primary references to evaluate potential effects of the proposed exploration activities during analysis under the National Environmental Policy Act. Intrepid property: A NOI was submitted and approved by the BLM in the third quarter. Construction of roads into the newly approved drilling areas commenced.

Exhibit 95 
 The following disclosures are provided pursuant to the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the Act and Item 104 of Regulation S-K, which require certain disclosures by companies required to file periodic reports under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, that operate mines regulated under the Federal Mine Safety and Health Act of 1977 (the Mine Act ). The disclosures reflect our U.S. mining operations only as the requirements of the Act and Item 104 of Regulation S-K do not apply to our mines operated outside the United States. Mine Safety Information. Whenever the Federal Mine Safety and Health Administration MSHA believes a violation of the Mine Act, any health or safety standard or any regulation has occurred, it may issue a citation which describes the alleged violation and fixes a time within which the U.S. mining operator (e.g. our subsidiary, Walker Lane Minerals Corp.) must abate the alleged violation. In some situations, such as when MSHA believes that conditions pose a hazard to miners, MSHA may issue an order removing miners from the area of the mine affected by the condition until the alleged hazards are corrected. When MSHA issues a citation or order, it generally proposes a civil penalty, or fine, as a result of the alleged violation, that the operator is ordered to pay. Citations and orders can be contested and appealed, and as part of that process, are often reduced in severity and amount, and are sometimes dismissed. The number of citations, orders and proposed assessments vary depending on the size and type (underground or surface) of the mine as well as by the MSHA inspector(s) assigned. In addition to civil penalties, the Mine Act also provides for criminal penalties for an operator who willfully violates a health or safety standard or knowingly violates or fails or refuses to comply with an order issued under Section 107(a) or any final decision issued under the Act. The below table reflects citations and orders issued to us by MSHA during the three months ended September 30, 2024. The proposed assessments for the three months ended September 30, 2024 were taken from the MSHA data retrieval system as of October 24, 2024. Additional information about the Act and MSHA references used in the table follows: 
 Section 104(a) S S Citations: Citations received from MSHA under section 104(a) of the Mine Act for violations of mandatory health or safety standards that could significantly and substantially contribute to the cause and effect of a mine safety or health hazard. Section 104(b) Orders: Orders issued by MSHA under section 104(b) of the Mine Act, which represents a failure to abate a citation under section 104(a) within the period of time prescribed by MSHA. This results in an order of immediate withdrawal from the area of the mine affected by the condition until MSHA determines that the violation has been abated. Section 104(d) S S Citations and Orders: Citations and orders issued by MSHA under section 104(d) of the Mine Act for unwarrantable failure to comply with mandatory, significant and substantial health or safety standards. Section 110(b)(2) Violations: Flagrant violations issued by MSHA under section 110(b)(2) of the Mine Act. Section 107(a) Orders: Orders issued by MSHA under section 107(a) of the Mine Act for situations in which MSHA determined an imminent danger (as defined by MSHA) existed. 

Mine or Operation (1) Isabella Pearl Mine MSHA ID #2602812 Total # of Significant and Substantial Violations Under 104(a) - Total # of Orders Issued Under 104(b) - Total # of Citations and Orders Issued Under 104(d) - Total # of Flagrant Violations Under 110(b)(2) - Total # of Imminent Danger Orders Under 107(a) - Total Amount of Proposed Assessments from MSHA under the Mine Act - Total # of Mining-Related Fatalities - Received Notice of Pattern of Violations under Section 104(e) No Received Notice of Potential to have Patterns under Section 104(e) No Pending Legal Actions - Legal Actions Instituted - Legal Actions Resolved - 
 
 (1) MSHA assigns an identification number to each mine or operation and may or may not assign separate identification numbers to related facilities. The definition of mine under section 3 of the Mine Act includes the mine, as well as other items used in, or to be used in, or resulting from, the work of extracting minerals, such as land, structures, facilities, equipment, machines, tools, and minerals preparation facilities.
