 million and million, respectively. As of September 30, 2024, the related forecasted transactions extend through August 2026. 
 
 During the three and six months ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023, respectively, the Company had no cash flow hedges for which it was probable that the hedged transaction would not occur. 
 
 See Note 13 - Stockholders Equity for changes in accumulated other comprehensive loss, net of taxes, related to the Company s derivatives designated for hedge accounting. As of September 30, 2024, million of loss related to the cash flow hedge reported in accumulated other comprehensive loss is expected to be reclassified into earnings within the next 12 months. 
 
 Derivatives Not Designated for Hedge Accounting 
 
 The derivative instruments not designated as hedges for purposes of hedge accounting include certain short-term foreign currency forward contracts. Derivatives that are not designated as hedging instruments are adjusted to fair value through earnings in the financial statement line item to which the derivative relates. 
 
 Foreign currency forward contracts 
 
 The Company manages the exposure to fluctuations in foreign currencies by using primarily short-term foreign currency forward contracts to hedge certain foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities, including intercompany accounts and forecasted transactions. The net notional amounts of the foreign currency forward contracts outstanding as of September 30, 2024 and March 31, 2024 were billion and billion, respectively.

(1) Movements from exchange rates on the Company s foreign currency-denominated assets and liabilities. 
 (2) Movements from hedges used to manage the Company s foreign currency remeasurement exposure, and the associated costs of the hedging program. 
 
 Other Risks for Derivative Instruments 
 
 The Company is exposed to the risk of losses in the event of non-performance by the counterparties to its derivative contracts. The amount subject to credit risk related to derivative instruments is generally limited to the amount, if any, by which a counterparty s obligations exceed the obligations of the Company with that counterparty. To mitigate counterparty credit risk, the Company regularly reviews its credit exposure and the creditworthiness of the counterparties. With respect to its foreign currency derivatives, as of September 30, 2024, there were counterparties with concentration of credit risk, and based on gross fair value, the maximum amount of loss that the Company could incur is million. 
 
 The Company also enters into enforceable master netting arrangements with some of its counterparties. However, for financial reporting purposes, it is the Company s policy not to offset derivative assets and liabilities despite the existence of enforceable master netting arrangements. The potential effect of such netting arrangements on the Company s balance sheets is not material for the periods presented. 
 
 Non-Derivative Financial Instruments Designated for Hedge Accounting 
 
 The Company applies hedge accounting for foreign currency-denominated debt used to manage foreign currency exposures on its net investments in certain non-U.S. operations. To qualify for hedge accounting, the hedging instrument must be highly effective at reducing the risk from the exposure being hedged. 
 
 Net Investment Hedges 
 
 DXC seeks to reduce the impact of fluctuations in foreign exchange rates on its net investments in certain non-U.S. operations with foreign currency-denominated debt. For foreign currency-denominated debt designated as a hedge, the effectiveness of the hedge is assessed based on changes in spot rates. For qualifying net investment hedges, all gains or losses on the hedging instruments are included in currency translation. Gains or losses on individual net investments in non-U.S. operations are reclassified to earnings from accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) when such net investments are sold or substantially liquidated. 
 
 million and million, respectively, of foreign currency-denominated debt designated as hedges of net investments in non-U.S. subsidiaries. For the three and six months ended September 30, 2024, the pre-tax loss on foreign currency-denominated debt designated for hedge accounting recognized in other comprehensive income was million and million, respectively.

The foreign currency translation amount reflects the impact of currency movements on non-U.S. dollar-denominated goodwill balances. 
 
 Goodwill Impairment Analyses 
 
 The Company tests goodwill for impairment on an annual basis, as of the first day of the second fiscal quarter, and between annual tests if circumstances change, or if an event occurs that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount. 
 
 For the Company s annual goodwill impairment assessment as of July 1, 2024, the Company chose to perform a quantitative goodwill impairment test. This quantitative test concluded that the fair value of the Company s GBS reporting unit exceeded its carrying amount and, thereby, the goodwill balance for GBS is not impaired. 
 
 As of September 30, 2024, the Company assessed whether there were events or changes in circumstances that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of any of its reporting units below its carrying amount and require goodwill to be tested for impairment. The Company determined that there have been no such indicators and therefore, it was unnecessary to perform an interim goodwill impairment test as of September 30, 2024.

For the six months ended September 30, 2024, the primary drivers of the ETR were the global mix of income, U.S. tax on foreign income, the foreign tax credit, an increase in interest receivables due from tax authorities, and a decrease in a deferred tax asset for stock based compensation. For the three and six months ended September 30, 2023, the primary drivers of the ETR were the global mix of income, U.S. tax on foreign income, a decrease in valuation allowances on deferred tax assets, and the foreign tax credit. 
 
 The majority of our global unremitted foreign earnings have been taxed or would be exempt from U.S. tax upon repatriation. Such earnings and the majority of current foreign earnings are not indefinitely reinvested. The following earnings are considered indefinitely reinvested: approximately million that could be subject to U.S. federal tax when repatriated to the U.S. under section 1.245A-5(b) of the final Treasury regulations; and approximately million of earnings in foreign subsidiaries. A portion of these indefinitely reinvested earnings may be subject to foreign and U.S. state tax consequences when remitted. The Company will continue to evaluate its position in the future based on its future strategy and cash needs. 
 
 In connection with the merger of Computer Sciences Corporation CSC and the Enterprise Services business of Hewlett Packard Enterprise Company (the HPES Merger ), the Company entered into a tax matters agreement with Hewlett Packard Enterprise Company HPE ). HPE generally will be responsible for tax liabilities arising prior to the HPES Merger, and DXC is liable to HPE for income tax receivables it receives related to pre-HPES Merger periods. Pursuant to the tax matters agreement, the Company recorded a million tax indemnification receivable related to uncertain tax positions, a million tax indemnification receivable related to other tax payables, and a million tax indemnification payable related to other tax receivables.

 In connection with the sale of its healthcare provider software business HPS ), the Company entered into a tax matters agreement with Dedalus. Pursuant to the tax matters agreement, the Company generally will be responsible for tax liabilities arising prior to the sale of the HPS business. 
 
 The Internal Revenue Service (the IRS has examined, or is examining, the Company s federal income tax returns for fiscal 2009 through the tax year ended October 31, 2018. With respect to CSC s fiscal 2009 through 2017 federal tax returns, the Company participated in settlement negotiations with the IRS Office of Appeals. The IRS examined several issues for these tax years that resulted in various audit adjustments. The Company and the IRS Office of Appeals have settled various audit adjustments, and we disagree with the IRS disallowance of certain losses and deductions resulting from restructuring costs, foreign exchange losses, and a third-party financing transaction in previous years. As we believe we will ultimately prevail on the technical merits of the disagreed items and are challenging them in the U.S. Tax Court, these matters are not fully reserved and would result in incremental federal and state tax expense of approximately million (including estimated interest and penalties) for the unreserved portion of these items and cash tax payments of approximately million if we do not prevail. We have received notices of deficiency with respect to fiscal 2009, 2010, 2011 and 2013 and have timely filed petitions with the U.S. Tax Court. During fiscal 2024, some of these cases were dismissed, but the dismissals were procedural in nature only and do not impact the Company s potential liability for the aforementioned fiscal years. We do not expect the U.S. Tax Court matters to be resolved in the next 12 months. 
 
 During fiscal 2024, the Company determined there were inadvertent omissions on previously filed tax returns related to gain recognition agreements and certain related tax forms and disclosures. The Company notified the IRS promptly and filed for relief under Treas. Reg. Sec. 1.367(a)-8(p) to correct the issue. 
 
 The Company s fiscal years 2009, 2010, and 2013 are in the U.S. Tax Court, and consequently these years will remain open until such proceedings have concluded. The statute of limitations on assessments related to a refund claim for fiscal year 2012 is open through February 28, 2025. The Company has agreed to extend the statute of limitations for fiscal and tax return years 2014 through 2021 to December 31, 2025. The Company expects to reach resolution for fiscal and tax return years 2009 through 2011 no earlier than fiscal year 2026. The Company expects to reach resolution for fiscal and tax return years 2012 and 2013 no earlier than fiscal year 2028. The Company expects to reach resolution for fiscal and tax return years 2014 through 2021 no earlier than fiscal year 2026. 
 
 The Company may settle certain other tax examinations for different amounts than the Company has accrued as uncertain tax positions. Consequently, the Company may need to accrue and ultimately pay additional amounts or pay lower amounts than previously estimated and accrued when positions are settled in the future. The Company believes the outcomes that are reasonably possible within the next 12 months to result in a reduction in its liability for uncertain tax positions, excluding interest, penalties, and tax carryforwards, would be approximately million.

million in compensatory damages and million in punitive damages, for a total award of million. In June 2024, the Court entered a final order in the case, affirming the jury s verdict in the Company s favor and revising the monetary award to million in compensatory damages and million in punitive damages. The Court also awarded the Company million in prejudgment interest, post-judgment interest at an annual rate of , and its attorney s fees and costs, in an amount to be determined in a later order. The total award to the Company is million, plus its attorney s fees and costs. The Court also issued a permanent injunction enjoining TCS from, among other things, possessing, accessing, or using any of the Company s trade secrets that were at issue in the case, and appointing a monitor to confirm, among other things, that TCS does not do so. In August 2024, TCS filed a Notice of Appeal to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit. The Company has not recognized any portion of the award in its financial statements and will continue to monitor the progress of the case. 
 
 In addition to the matters noted above, the Company is currently subject in the normal course of business to various claims and contingencies arising from, among other things, disputes with customers, vendors, employees, contract counterparties and other parties, as well as securities matters, environmental matters, matters concerning the licensing and use of intellectual property, and inquiries and investigations by regulatory authorities and government agencies. Some of these disputes involve or may involve litigation. The financial statements reflect the treatment of claims and contingencies based on management s view of the expected outcome. DXC consults with outside legal counsel on issues related to litigation and regulatory compliance and seeks input from other experts and advisors with respect to matters in the ordinary course of business. Although the outcome of these and other matters cannot be predicted with certainty, and the impact of the final resolution of these and other matters on the Company s results of operations in a particular subsequent reporting period could be material and adverse, management does not believe based on information currently available to the Company, that the resolution of any of the matters currently pending against the Company will have a material adverse effect on the financial position of the Company or the ability of the Company to meet its financial obligations as they become due. Unless otherwise noted, the Company is unable to determine at this time a reasonable estimate of a possible loss or range of losses associated with the foregoing disclosed contingent matters.

Costs and Expenses 
 
 Our total costs and expenses are provided below: 
 
 Dollar Amount Dollar Amount Three Months Ended September 30, Change Six Months Ended September 30, Change (in millions) 2024 2023 Dollar Percent 2024 2023 Dollar Percent Costs of services 2,427 2,633 (206) (7.8) 4,953 5,352 (399) (7.5) Selling, general and administrative 353 328 25 7.6 654 655 (1) (0.2) Depreciation and amortization 329 361 (32) (8.9) 655 705 (50) (7.1) Restructuring costs 42 35 7 20.0 81 55 26 47.3 Interest expense 69 78 (9) (11.5) 141 144 (3) (2.1) Interest income (51) (53) 2 (3.8) (102) (102) Loss on disposition of businesses 2 (2) (100.0) 7 (7) (100.0) Other income, net (21) (76) 55 (72.4) (66) (140) 74 (52.9) Total Costs and Expenses 3,148 3,308 (160) (4.8) 6,316 6,676 (360) (5.4) 

Costs of Services 
 
 Costs of services, excluding depreciation and amortization and restructuring costs COS ), were 2.4 billion and 5.0 billion for the second quarter and first six months of fiscal 2025, respectively, a decrease of 206 million and 399 million, respectively, as compared to the same periods of the prior fiscal year. 
 
 The decrease in expense against both comparative periods was primarily due to a decrease in costs from lower revenue levels and a reduction in professional services and contractor-related expenses from our cost optimization efforts. 
 
 Gross margin (Revenues less COS as a percentage of revenue) was 25.1 and 23.5 for the second quarter and first six months of fiscal 2025, respectively, an increase of 1.7 and 1.3 against the comparative period. 

Selling, General and Administrative 
 
 Selling, general and administrative expense, excluding depreciation and amortization and restructuring costs SG A ), was 353 million and 654 million for the second quarter and first six months of fiscal 2025, respectively, an increase of 25 million and a decrease of 1 million, respectively, as compared to the same periods of the prior fiscal year. 
 
 The 25 million increase in expense for the second quarter of fiscal 2025 was primarily due to an increase in higher transaction, separation and integration-related TSI costs and an alignment of business development expenses from COS in support of the offering model, partially offset by a gain from a legal settlement in the second quarter of fiscal 2025 and reductions in payroll related expenses. 
 
 The 1 million decrease in expense for the first six months of fiscal 2025 was primarily due to a reduction in payroll related expenses, lower merger-related indemnification expenses, and a gain from a legal settlement in the second quarter of fiscal 2025, partially offset by higher TSI costs and an alignment of business development expenses from COS in support of the offering model. 
 
 34 

Depreciation and Amortization 
 
 Depreciation expense was 94 million and 188 million for the second quarter and first six months of fiscal 2025, respectively, a decrease of 18 million and 37 million, respectively, as compared to the same periods of the prior fiscal year. The decrease in depreciation expense against both comparative periods was primarily due to lower average net property and equipment balances. 
 
 Amortization expense was 235 million and 467 million for the second quarter and first six months of fiscal 2025, respectively, a decrease of 14 million and 13 million, respectively, as compared to the same periods of the prior fiscal year. The decrease in amortization expense against both comparative periods was primarily due to lower software amortization. 

Restructuring Costs 
 
 During fiscal 2025, management approved global cost savings initiatives designed to better align our facility and data center requirements. During the second quarter and first six months of fiscal 2025, total restructuring costs recorded, net of reversals, were 42 million and 81 million, respectively, an increase of 7 million and 26 million, respectively, as compared to the same periods of the prior fiscal year. 
 
 See Note 10 Restructuring Costs for additional information about our restructuring actions. 

Interest Expense and Interest Income 
 
 Net interest expense (interest expense less interest income) was 18 million and 39 million for the second quarter and first six months of fiscal 2025, respectively, a decrease of 7 million and 3 million, respectively, as compared to the same periods of the prior fiscal year. 
 
 The decrease in net interest expense against both comparative periods was primarily due to decreased interest expense from lower levels of asset financing and commercial paper liabilities, partially offset by lower net income from cash deposits. 

Loss on Disposition of Businesses 
 
 During the first six months of fiscal 2024, the Company sold insignificant businesses that resulted in a loss of 7 million. 

35 

Other Income, Net 
 
 Other income, net comprises non-service cost components of net periodic pension income, movement in foreign currency exchange rates on our foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities and the related economic hedges, losses (gains) on real estate and facility sales, and other miscellaneous gains and losses. The following table summarizes components of other income, net.

 Other income, net, was 21 million for the second quarter of fiscal 2025, a decrease of 55 million against the comparative period. Other income, net, was 66 million for the first six months of fiscal 2025, a decrease of 74 million against the comparative period. The change against the comparative period was primarily due to: 
 net periodic pension income increased by 4 million and 7 million primarily due to changes in expected returns on assets and other actuarial assumptions. 
 foreign currency gains for the six months ended decreased by 10 million, primarily due to movements of exchange rates on our foreign currency-denominated assets and liabilities, related hedges including forward contracts to manage our exposure to economic risk, and the cost of our hedging program. 
 net losses on real estate and facility sales increased by 27 million and 35 million; and 
 a decrease in other gains of 31 million and 36 million, primarily from the sale of a strategic investment in the second quarter of fiscal 2024. 

Taxes 
 
 Our effective tax rate ETR was 51.6 and 22.7 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, and September 30, 2023, respectively, and 56.5 and 31.6 for the six months ended September 30, 2024, and September 30, 2023, respectively. For the three months ended September 30, 2024, the primary drivers of the ETR were the global mix of income, U.S. tax on foreign income, the foreign tax credit, and an increase in interest receivables due from tax authorities. For the six months ended September 30, 2024, the primary drivers of the ETR were the global mix of income, U.S. tax on foreign income, the foreign tax credit, an increase in interest receivables due from tax authorities, and a decrease in a deferred tax asset for stock based compensation. For the three and six months ended September 30, 2023, the primary drivers of the ETR were the global mix of income, U.S. tax on foreign income, a decrease in valuation allowances on deferred tax assets, and the foreign tax credit.

Earnings Per Share 
 
 Diluted EPS for the second quarter and first six months of fiscal 2025 was 0.23 and 0.37, respectively, a decrease of 0.26 and 0.28, respectively, as compared to the same periods of the prior fiscal year. The decrease in diluted EPS against both comparative periods was primarily due to decreases in net income attributable to DXC common stockholders, partially offset by lower weighted average share counts from the Company s share repurchases. 
 
 Diluted EPS for the second quarter of fiscal 2025 includes 0.18 per share of restructuring costs, 0.07 per share of transaction, separation and integration-related costs, 0.38 per share of amortization of acquired intangible assets, (0.03) per share of merger related indemnification costs, (0.03) per share of gains on dispositions, 0.11 per share of net losses on real estate and facility sales, and 0.03 per share of tax adjustments. 
 
 Diluted EPS for the first six months of fiscal 2025 includes 0.35 per share of restructuring costs, 0.10 per share of transaction, separation and integration-related costs, 0.77 per share of amortization of acquired intangible assets, (0.03) per share of merger related indemnification costs, (0.03) per share of gains on dispositions, 0.12 per share of net losses on real estate and facility sales, and 0.03 per share of tax adjustments.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures 
 
 We present non-GAAP financial measures of performance which are derived from the statements of operations of DXC. These non-GAAP financial measures include earnings before interest and taxes EBIT ), adjusted EBIT, non-GAAP income before income taxes, non-GAAP net income, non-GAAP net income attributable to DXC common stockholders, non-GAAP EPS, organic revenue growth, constant currency revenues, and free cash flow. 
 
 We believe EBIT, adjusted EBIT, non-GAAP income before income taxes, non-GAAP net income, non-GAAP net income attributable to DXC common stockholders, and non-GAAP EPS provide investors with useful supplemental information about our operating performance after excluding certain categories of expenses as well as gains and losses on certain dispositions and certain tax adjustments. 
 
 We believe constant currency revenues provides investors with useful supplemental information about our revenues after excluding the effect of currency exchange rate fluctuations for currencies other than U.S. dollars in the periods presented. See below for a description of the methodology we use to present constant currency revenues. 
 
 One category of expenses excluded from adjusted EBIT, non-GAAP income before income tax, non-GAAP net income, non-GAAP net income attributable to DXC common stockholders, and non-GAAP EPS, incremental amortization of intangible assets acquired through business combinations, if included, may result in a significant difference in period over period amortization expense on a GAAP basis. We exclude amortization of certain acquired intangible assets as these non-cash amounts are inconsistent in amount and frequency and are significantly impacted by the timing and/or size of acquisitions. Although DXC management excludes amortization of acquired intangible assets, primarily customer-related intangible assets, from its non-GAAP expenses, we believe that it is important for investors to understand that such intangible assets were recorded as part of purchase accounting and support revenue generation. Any future transactions may result in a change to the acquired intangible asset balances and associated amortization expense. 
 
 Another category of expenses excluded from adjusted EBIT, non-GAAP income before income tax, non-GAAP net income, non-GAAP net income attributable to DXC common stockholders, and non-GAAP EPS is impairment losses, which, if included, may result in a significant difference in period-over-period expense on a GAAP basis. We exclude impairment losses as these non-cash amounts reflect generally an acceleration of what would be multiple periods of expense and are not expected to occur frequently. Further, assets such as goodwill may be significantly impacted by market conditions outside of management s control. 
 
 Selected references are made to revenue growth on an organic basis so that certain financial results can be viewed without the impact of fluctuations in foreign currency rates and without the impacts of acquisitions and divestitures, thereby providing comparisons of operating performance from period to period of the business that we have owned during both periods presented. Organic revenue growth is calculated by dividing the year-over-year change in GAAP revenues attributed to organic growth by the GAAP revenues reported in the prior comparable period. Organic revenue is calculated as constant currency revenue excluding the impact of mergers, acquisitions or similar transactions until the one-year anniversary of the transaction and excluding revenues of divestitures during the reporting period. This approach is used for all results where the functional currency is not the U.S. dollar. We believe organic revenue growth provides investors with useful supplemental information about our revenues after excluding the effect of currency exchange rate fluctuations for currencies other than U.S. dollars and the effects of acquisitions and divestitures in both periods presented. 
 
 Free cash flow represents cash flow from operations, less capital expenditures. Free cash flow is utilized by our management, investors, and analysts to evaluate cash available to pay debt, repurchase shares, and provide further investment in the business.

There are limitations to the use of the non-GAAP financial measures presented in this report. One of the limitations is that they do not reflect complete financial results. We compensate for this limitation by providing a reconciliation between our non-GAAP financial measures and the respective most directly comparable financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP. Additionally, other companies, including companies in our industry, may calculate non-GAAP financial measures differently than we do, limiting the usefulness of those measures for comparative purposes between companies. Selected references are made on a constant currency basis so that certain financial results can be viewed without the impact of fluctuations in foreign currency rates, thereby providing comparisons of operating performance from period to period. Financial results on a constant currency basis are non-GAAP measures calculated by translating current period activity into U.S. Dollars using the comparable prior period s currency conversion rates. This approach is used for all results where the functional currency is not the U.S. Dollar. Please see Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Results of Operations Revenues.

Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures 
 
 Our non-GAAP adjustments include: 
 Restructuring costs includes costs, net of reversals, related to workforce and real estate optimization and other similar charges. 
 Transaction, separation and integration-related TSI costs includes third party costs related to integration, separation, planning, financing and advisory fees and other similar charges associated with mergers, acquisitions, strategic investments, joint ventures, and dispositions and other similar transactions incurred within one year of such transactions closing, except for costs associated with related disputes, which may arise more than one year after closing. 
 Amortization of acquired intangible assets includes amortization of intangible assets acquired through business combinations. 
 Merger related indemnification in fiscal 2025, represents the Company s current net estimate to HPE for a tax related indemnification; in fiscal 2024, represents the Company s then current estimate of potential liability to HPE for a tax related indemnification. 
 Gains and losses on dispositions gains and losses related to dispositions of businesses, strategic assets and interests in less than wholly-owned entities. 
 Gains and losses on real estate and facility sales gains and losses related to dispositions of real property. (1) 
 Impairment losses non-cash charges associated with the permanent reduction in the value of the Company s assets (e.g., impairment of goodwill and other long-term assets including fixed assets and impairments to deferred tax assets for discrete changes in valuation allowances). Future discrete reversals of valuation allowances are likewise excluded. 
 Tax adjustments discrete tax adjustments to impair or recognize certain deferred tax assets, adjustments for changes in tax legislation and the impact of merger and divestitures. Income tax expense of all other (non-discrete) non-GAAP adjustments is based on the difference in the GAAP annual effective tax rate (AETR) and overall non-GAAP provision (consistent with the GAAP methodology). 
 
 (1) Starting in the fiscal quarter ended September 30, 2024, the Company s reported non-GAAP financial results reflect an adjustment for gains and losses on real estate and facilities dispositions, which the Company s current management believes are not reflective of the core operating performance of our business. For comparability purposes, historical non-GAAP financial measures set forth herein have been recast to reflect this change, which included gains on dispositions of real property of approximately 6 million during the six months ended September 30, 2023. For the fiscal years ended March 31, 2024 and March 31, 2023, the Company had gains on dispositions of real property of approximately 7 million and 21 million, respectively.

Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 
 Cash and Cash Equivalents and Cash Flows 
 
 As of September 30, 2024, our cash and cash equivalents cash were 1.2 billion, of which 0.6 billion was held outside of the U.S. As of March 31, 2024, our cash was 1.2 billion, of which 0.6 billion was held outside of the U.S. We maintain various multi-currency, multi-entity, cross-border, physical and notional cash and pool arrangements with various counterparties to manage liquidity efficiently that enable participating subsidiaries to draw on the Company s pooled resources to meet liquidity needs. 
 
 A significant portion of the cash held by our foreign subsidiaries is not expected to be impacted by U.S. federal income tax upon repatriation. However, a portion of this cash may still be subject to foreign and U.S. state income tax consequences upon future remittance. Therefore, if additional funds held outside the U.S. are needed for our operations in the U.S., we plan to repatriate these funds not designated as indefinitely reinvested. 
 
 We have 0.2 billion in cash held by foreign subsidiaries used for local operations that is subject to country-specific limitations which may restrict or result in increased costs in the repatriation of these funds. In addition, other practical considerations may limit our use of consolidated cash. This includes cash of 0.2 billion held by majority-owned consolidated subsidiaries where third-parties or public shareholders hold minority interests. 
 
 The following table summarizes our cash flow activity: 
 Six Months Ended (in millions) September 30, 2024 September 30, 2023 Change Net cash provided by (used in): Operating activities 433 375 58 Investing activities (258) (284) 26 Financing activities (189) (521) 332 Effect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents 38 (16) 54 Cash classified within current assets held for sale (3) (3) Net increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents 21 (446) 467 Cash and cash equivalents at beginning of year 1,224 1,858 Cash and cash equivalents at the end of period 1,245 1,412 
 
 Operating cash flow 
 
 Net cash provided by operating activities was 433 million and 375 million, respectively, during the first six months of fiscal 2025 and fiscal 2024, reflecting a year-over year increase of 58 million. Operating cash flow against the comparative period included: 
 
 a 149 million favorable change in working capital primarily from improvements in our cash conversion cycle; partially offset by 
 a decrease in net income, net of adjustments of 91 million. 

The following table contains certain key working capital metrics:

Investing cash flow 
 
 Net cash used in investing activities was 258 million and 284 million, respectively, during the first six months of fiscal 2025 and fiscal 2024, reflecting a year-over-year change of 26 million. The change against the comparative period was primarily due to: 
 
 a 19 million decrease in capital expenditures; 
 an increase in proceeds from sales of assets of 5 million; and 
 an increase in cash inflows from other net investing activities of 2 million. 
 
 Financing cash flow 
 
 Net cash used in financing activities was 189 million and 521 million, respectively, during the first six months of fiscal 2025 and fiscal 2024, reflecting a year-over-year change of 332 million. The change against the comparative period was primarily due to: 
 
 a 519 million decrease in cash used for share repurchase activity and related taxes paid on net share settlements; and 
 a 66 million decrease in payments on capital leases and borrowings for asset financing, as the Company continues reducing the volume of these financing arrangements; partially offset by 
 a 253 million decrease in cash inflows from commercial paper borrowings, net of repayments and other financing activities. 

Debt Financing 
 
 The following table summarizes our total debt:

 The 38 million decrease in total debt during the first six months of fiscal 2025 was primarily attributable to the decreases in finance leases and borrowings for asset financing attributable to payments exceeding additions, partially offset by an unfavorable foreign currency exchange rate of U.S. dollar against the Euro. 
 
 We were in compliance with all financial covenants associated with our borrowings as of September 30, 2024. 
 
 Our credit ratings are as follows:

Liquidity 
 
 We expect our existing cash and cash equivalents, together with cash generated from operations, will be sufficient to meet our normal operating requirements for the next 12 months. We expect to continue using cash generated by operations as a primary source of liquidity; however, should we require funds greater than that generated from our operations to fund discretionary investment activities, such as business acquisitions, we have the ability to raise capital through debt financing, including the issuance of capital market debt instruments such as commercial paper, and bonds. In addition, we currently utilize, and will further utilize accounts receivables, sales facilities, and our cross-currency cash pool for liquidity needs. However, there is no guarantee that we will be able to obtain debt financing, if required, on terms and conditions acceptable to us, if at all, in the future. 
 
 Our exposure to operational liquidity risk is primarily from long-term contracts that require significant investment of cash during the initial phases of the contracts. The recovery of these investments is over the life of the contracts and is dependent upon our performance as well as customer acceptance. 
 
 Our total liquidity of 4.4 billion as of September 30, 2024, includes 1.2 billion of cash and cash equivalents and 3.2 billion of available borrowings under our revolving credit facility. On November 1, 2024, the Company extended the term of our revolving credit facility to November 1, 2029 .

 Dividends 
 
 To maintain our financial flexibility, we continue to suspend payment of quarterly dividends for fiscal 2025.

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 
 
 In the normal course of business, we are a party to arrangements that include guarantees, the receivables securitization facility and certain other financial instruments with off-balance sheet risk, such as letters of credit and surety bonds. We also use performance letters of credit to support various risk management insurance policies. No liabilities related to these arrangements are reflected in our condensed consolidated balance sheets. There have been no material changes to our off-balance-sheet arrangements reported under Part II, Item 7 of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2024, other than as disclosed in Note 3 Receivables and Note 17 Commitments and Contingencies . 

Cash Commitments 
 
 There have been no material changes, outside the ordinary course of business, to our cash commitments since March 31, 2024. For further information see Cash Commitments in Part II, Item 7 of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2024. 
 
 For our minimum purchase cash commitments in connection with our long-term purchase agreements with certain software, hardware, telecommunication, and other service providers, see Note 17 Commitments and Contingencies. 

Critical Accounting Estimates 
 
 The preparation of consolidated financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, as well as the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. These estimates may change in the future if underlying assumptions or factors change. Accordingly, actual results could differ materially from our estimates under different assumptions, judgments or conditions. We consider the following policies to be critical because of their complexity and the high degree of judgment involved in implementing them: revenue recognition, income taxes, defined benefit plans, valuation of assets and loss accruals for litigation. We have discussed the selection of our critical accounting policies and the effect of estimates with the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors. During the three months ended September 30, 2024, there were no changes to our critical accounting policies and estimates from those described in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2024 except as mentioned in Note 1 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies. 

ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 
 
 For quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk affecting DXC, see Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk in Part II, Item 7A of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2024. Our exposure to market risk has not changed materially since March 31, 2024. 

ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 
 
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 
 Our management, under the supervision and with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, evaluated, as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act )). Based on that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of September 30, 2024. 
 
 Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 
 There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the three months ended September 30, 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS 
 
 Our operations and financial results are subject to various risks and uncertainties, which may materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations, and the actual outcome of matters as to which forward-looking statements are made in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. In such case, the trading price for DXC common stock could decline, and you could lose all or part of your investment. Past performance may not be a reliable indicator of future financial performance and historical trends should not be used to anticipate results or trends in future periods. Future performance and historical trends may be adversely affected by the aforementioned risks, and other variables and risks and uncertainties not currently known or that are currently expected to be immaterial may also materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations or the price of our common stock in the future. There have been no material changes in the three months ended September 30, 2024 to the risk factors described in Part I, Item 1A of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2024.

 Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities

 Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities 
 
 On May 18, 2023, DXC announced that its Board approved an incremental 1.0 billion share repurchase authorization. Share repurchases may be made from time to time through various means, including in open market purchases, 10b5-1 plans, privately-negotiated transactions, accelerated stock repurchases, block trades and other transactions, in compliance with Rule 10b-18 under the Exchange Act, as well as, to the extent applicable, other federal and state securities laws and other legal requirements. The timing, volume, and nature of share repurchases pursuant to the share repurchase plan are at the discretion of management and may be suspended or discontinued at any time. As of September 30, 2024, approximately 592 million worth of shares remained available for repurchase under the plans or programs. There were no share repurchases during the six months ended September 30, 2024. 
 
 On August 16, 2022, the U.S. government enacted the Inflation Reduction Act (the "IRA") into law. The IRA imposes a 1 excise tax on share repurchases completed after December 31, 2022. We reflect the excise tax within equity as part of the repurchase of the common stock. 
 
 See Note 13 - "Stockholders Equity" to the financial statements in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for more information.
