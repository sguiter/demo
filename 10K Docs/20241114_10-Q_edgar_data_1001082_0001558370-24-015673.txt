 PART I FINANCIAL INFORMATIO N DISCLOSURE REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENT S Unless otherwise required by the context, in this report, the words DISH Network, DISH, the Company, we, our and us refer to DISH Network Corporation and its subsidiaries, EchoStar refers to EchoStar Corporation, our parent company, and its subsidiaries, including us, and DISH DBS and DDBS refers to DISH DBS Corporation, our wholly-owned, indirect subsidiary and its subsidiaries. This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, including, in particular, statements about our plans, objectives and strategies, growth opportunities in our industries and businesses, our expectations regarding future results, financial condition, liquidity and capital requirements, our estimates regarding the impact of regulatory developments and legal proceedings, and other trends and projections. Forward-looking statements are not historical facts and may be identified by words such as future, anticipate, intend, plan, goal, seek, believe, estimate, expect, predict, will, would, could, can, may, and similar terms. These forward-looking statements are based on information available to us as of the date of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and represent management s current views and assumptions. Forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance, events or results and involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors, which may be beyond our control. Accordingly, actual performance, events or results could differ materially from those expressed or implied in the forward-looking statements due to a number of factors, including, but not limited to, those summarized below: SUMMARY OF RISK FACTORS Risks Relating to the DIRECTV Transaction We are subject to a number of risks while the DIRECTV Transaction is pending, which may have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Risks Related to the Integration Although we expect that the Merger will result in synergies and other benefits, those synergies and benefits may not be realized in the amounts anticipated, or may not be realized within the expected timeframe, or at all, and risks associated with the foregoing may also result from any extended delay in the Integration. Competition and Economic Risks We face intense and increasing competition from providers of video, broadband and/or wireless services. Changing consumer behavior and new technologies in our Pay-TV and/or Wireless business may reduce our subscriber activations and may cause our subscribers to purchase fewer services from us or to cancel our services altogether, resulting in less revenue to us. We face certain risks competing in the wireless services industry and operating a facilities-based wireless services business. Our pay-TV competitors may be able to leverage their relationships with programmers to reduce their programming costs and/or offer exclusive content that will place them at a competitive advantage to us. Through the MNSA and the NSA, we depend on T-Mobile and AT T to provide network services to our Wireless subscribers. Our failure to effectively manage these relationships, including without limitation, our minimum commitments, any system failure in their wireless networks, interruption in the services provided to us, and/or the termination of the MNSA or the NSA could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

Table of Contents 
 We compete with the MNOs whose networks we rely on to provide wireless services to our customers, and they may seek to limit, reduce or terminate our network access to the extent that it becomes competitively advantageous to do so. If we are unable to take advantage of technological developments on a timely basis, or at all, we may experience a decline in demand for our services or face challenges in implementing or evolving our business strategy. Operational and Service Delivery Risks Any deterioration in our operational performance, subscriber activations and churn rate and subscriber satisfaction could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. We depend on others to provide the programming that we offer to our Pay-TV subscribers and, if we fail to obtain or lose access to certain programming, our Pay-TV subscriber activations and our subscriber churn rate may be negatively impacted. We have limited satellite capacity and any failures or reduced capacity, caused by, among other things, operational and environmental risks, could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Extreme weather may result in risk of damage to our infrastructure and therefore our ability to provide services, and may lead to changes in federal, state and foreign government regulation, all of which could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. We rely on a single vendor or a limited number of vendors to provide certain key products or services to us, and the inability of these key vendors to meet our needs could have a material adverse effect on our business. We depend on independent third parties to solicit orders for our services that represent a meaningful percentage of our total gross new subscriber activations. Risks Related to our Human Capital We rely on highly skilled personnel for our business, and any inability to hire and retain key personnel or to hire qualified personnel may negatively affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Our business growth and customer retention strategies rely in part on the work of technically skilled employees. Risks Related to our Products and Technology Our business depends on certain intellectual property rights and on not infringing the intellectual property rights of others. We are, and may become, party to various lawsuits which, if adversely decided, could have a significant adverse impact on our business, particularly lawsuits regarding intellectual property. If our products contain defects, we could be subject to significant costs to correct such defects and our product and network service contracts could be delayed or cancelled, which could adversely affect our revenue. Risks Related to Cybersecurity We have experienced and may experience in the future consistent cyber-attacks and attempts to gain unauthorized access to our systems and any failure or inadequacy of our information technology infrastructure and communications systems or those of third parties that we use in our operations could disrupt or harm our business. The confidentiality, integrity, and availability of our services and products depends on the continuing operation of our information technology and other enabling systems.

Table of Contents 
 Acquisition and Capital Structure Risks We have substantial debt outstanding and may incur additional debt and covenants in our Indentures could limit our ability to undertake certain types of activities and adversely affect our liquidity. We may pursue acquisitions , dispositions, capital expenditures, the development, acquisition and launch of new satellites and other strategic initiatives to complement or expand our business , which may not be successful and we may lose a portion or all of our investment in these acquisitions and transactions. We have made substantial investments to acquire certain wireless spectrum licenses and other related assets, and may be unable to realize a return on these assets. We may need additional capital, which may not be available on favorable terms, to fund current obligations, to continue investing in our business and to finance acquisitions and other strategic transactions. Our parent, EchoStar, is controlled by one principal stockholder, who is also our Chairman. Risks Related to the Regulation of Our Business Our services depend on FCC licenses that can expire or be revoked or modified and applications for FCC licenses that may not be granted. Other factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include, but are not limited to, those discussed under the caption Risk Factors in Part II, Item 1A of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and in Part I, Item 1A of our most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K (the 10-K filed with the SEC, those discussed in Management s Narrative Analysis of Results of Operations herein and in the 10-K and those discussed in other documents we file with the SEC. All cautionary statements made or referred to herein should be read as being applicable to all forward-looking statements wherever they appear. Investors should consider the risks and uncertainties described or referred to herein and should not place undue reliance on any forward-looking statements. The forward-looking statements speak only as of the date made, and we expressly disclaim any obligation to update these forward-looking statements.

There can be no assurance that we will be able to complete all build-out requirements or profitably deploy our Wireless spectrum licenses, which may affect the carrying amount of these assets and our future financial condition or results of operations. See Note 9 for further information. Our Wireless spectrum licenses are subject to certain interim and final build-out requirements, as well as certain renewal requirements. On September 29, 2023, the FCC confirmed we have met all of our June 14, 2023 band-specific 5G deployment commitments, and of our nationwide 5G commitments. The single remaining 5G commitment, that at least of the U.S. population has access to average download speeds equal to 35 Mbps, was achieved in March 2024 using the drive test methodology previously agreed upon by us and the FCC and overseen by an independent monitor. We currently ha ve the largest commercial deployment of 5G VoNR in the world covering over million Americans and 5G broadband service covering over million Americans.

Current Marketable Investment Securities Strategic Our current strategic marketable investment securities portfolio includes and may include strategic and financial debt and/or equity investments in private and public companies that are highly speculative and have experienced and continue to experience volatility. As of September 30, 2024, this portfolio consisted of securities of a small number of issuers, and as a result the value of that portfolio depends, among other things, on the performance of those issuers. The fair value of certain of the debt and equity securities in this portfolio can be adversely impacted by, among other things, the issuers respective performance and ability to obtain any necessary additional financing on acceptable terms, or at all.

Other Investments, net We have strategic investments in certain debt and/or equity securities that are included in noncurrent Other investments, net on our Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. Our debt securities are classified as available-for-sale and are recorded at fair value. Generally, our debt investments in non-publicly traded debt instruments without a readily determinable fair value are recorded at amortized cost. Our equity investments where we have the ability to exercise significant influence over the investee are accounted for using the equity method of accounting. Certain of our equity method investments are detailed below. NagraStar L.L.C. We own a interest in NagraStar L.L.C. NagraStar ), a joint venture that is our primary provider of encryption and related security systems intended to assure that only authorized customers have access to our programming. The main technologies NagraStar provides to its customers are microchips, set-top box software, and uplink computer systems. NagraStar also provides end-to-end platform security testing services. Invidi Technologies Corporation . We own a interest in Invidi Technologies Corporation Invidi ), an entity that provides proprietary software for the addressable advertising market. Invidi contracts with multichannel video programming distributers to include its software in their respective set-top boxes and DVRs in order to deliver targeted advertisements based on a variety of demographic attributes selected by the advertisers. Invidi has also developed a cloud-based solution for internet protocol-based platforms. During the three months ended June 30, 2024, Invidi impaired the goodwill on their financial statements and our portion of this impairment resulted in a million loss in Equity in earnings (losses) of affiliates recorded in Other, net on our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income (Loss) during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. We also hold investments that are not accounted for using the equity method of accounting, which are measured at fair value. Investments in equity securities without readily determinable fair values are accounted for at cost, less impairment, and adjusted for observable price changes for identical or similar investments of the same issuer. Our ability to realize value from our strategic investments in securities that are not publicly traded depends on, among other things, the success of the issuers businesses and their ability to obtain sufficient capital, on acceptable terms or at all, and to execute their business plans. Because private markets are not as liquid as public markets, there is also increased risk that we will not be able to sell these investments, or that when we desire to sell them we will not be able to obtain fair value for them.

The convertible note hedge transactions cover, subject to anti-dilution adjustments substantially similar to those applicable to the Convertible Notes due 2026 , the number of shares of DISH Network Class A Common Stock underlying the Convertible Notes due 2026 , which initially gives us the option to purchase approximately million shares of DISH Network Class A Common Stock at a price of approximately per share, which in connection with the completion of the Merger converted into approximately million shares of EchoStar Class A Common Stock at a price of approximately per share. The total cost of the original convertible note hedge transactions was million.

 million shares of DISH Network Class A common stock at a price of approximately per share, which in connection with the completion of the Merger converted into approximately million shares of EchoStar Class A Common Stock at price ranges of approximately to per share. We received million in cash proceeds from the original sale of these warrants. In accordance with accounting guidance on hedge and warrant transactions, the net cost incurred in connection with the convertible note hedge and warrant transactions are recorded as a reduction in Additional paid-in capital within Stockholder s Equity (Deficit) on our Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets as of December 31, 2016. We will not be required to make any cash payments to each option counterparty or its affiliates upon the exercise of the options that are a part of the convertible note hedge transactions, but will be entitled to receive from them a number of shares of Class A common stock, an amount of cash or a combination thereof. This consideration is generally based on the amount by which the market price per share of Class A common stock, as measured under the terms of the convertible note hedge transactions, is greater than the strike price of the convertible note hedge transactions during the relevant valuation period under the convertible note hedge transactions. Additionally, if the market price per share of Class A common stock, as measured under the terms of the warrant transactions, exceeds the strike price of the warrants during the measurement period at the maturity of the warrants, we will owe each option counterparty a number of shares of Class A common stock in an amount based on the excess of such market price per share of Class A common stock over the strike price of the warrants. However, as specified under the terms of the warrant transactions, we may elect to settle the warrants in cash.

We currently have billion of investments related to Wireless spectrum licenses, which does not include billion of capitalized interest related to the carrying value of such licenses. See Note 1 and Note 2 for further information. We plan to commercialize our Wireless spectrum licenses through our 5G Network Deployment. We have committed to deploy our 5G Network capable of serving increasingly larger portions of the U.S. population at different deadlines. We may need to raise additional capital in the future, which may not be available on favorable terms, to fund the efforts described below, as well as, among other things, make any potential Northstar Re-Auction Payment and SNR Re-Auction Payment for the AWS-3 licenses retained by the FCC. There can be no assurance that we will be able to complete all build-out requirements or profitably deploy our Wireless spectrum licenses, which may affect the carrying amount of these assets and our future financial condition or results of operations.

 of the population in each Economic Area (which is a service area established by the FCC) with respect to these licenses shall be extended to December 14, 2026. The final deadline shall be further extended to June 14, 2028, if: by December 31, 2024, we are offering 5G broadband service to at least of the U.S. population and, as of June 14, 2025 (as defined in our September 2024 FCC extension request): (a) we have offered a low-cost 5G broadband plan and device to consumers nationwide; (b) we have deployed at least 5G sites; (c) we have upgraded our deployed 5G sites to 3GPP Release 17; and (d) we have provisioned at least of new subscribers with an EchoStar-certified 5G device on our MNO network if the subscriber is within the accelerated markets as set forth in Appendices A-F of our September 2024 FCC extension request. (13) There are a variety of build-out options and associated build-out metrics associated with these licenses. Commercialization of Our Wireless Spectrum Licenses and Related Assets. On September 29, 2023, the FCC confirmed we have met all of our June 14, 2023 band-specific 5G deployment commitments, and two of our three nationwide 5G commitments. The single remaining 5G commitment, that at least of the U.S. population has access to average download speeds equal to 35 Mbps, was achieved in March 2024 using the drive test methodology previously agreed upon by us and the FCC and overseen by an independent monitor. We currently have the largest commercial deployment of 5G VoNR in the world covering over million Americans and 5G broadband service covering over million Americans. We currently expect capital expenditures, excluding capitalized interest, for our 5G Network Deployment to be approximately billion, including amounts incurred in 2021, 2022, 2023 and the first nine months of 2024. See Note 2 for further information. In September 2024, the FCC conditionally granted our requests to extend the 5G deployment deadlines for certain of our licenses based on several commitments, described above. We may need to make significant additional investments or partner with others to, among other things, continue our 5G Network Deployment and further commercialize, build-out and integrate these licenses and related assets and any additional acquired licenses and related assets, as well as to comply with regulations applicable to such licenses. Depending on the nature and scope of such activities, any such investments or partnerships could vary significantly. In addition, as we continue our 5G Network Deployment, we have and may continue to incur significant additional expenses related to, among other things, research and development, wireless testing and ongoing upgrades to the wireless network infrastructure, software and third-party integration. As a result of these investments, among other factors, we may need to raise additional capital, which may not be available on favorable terms. We may also determine that additional wireless spectrum licenses may be required for our 5G Network Deployment and to compete effectively with other wireless service providers. AWS-3 Auction Northstar Wireless is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Northstar Spectrum, which is an entity wholly-owned by us and, prior to October 12, 2023, by us and Northstar Manager. SNR Wireless is a wholly-owned subsidiary of SNR HoldCo, which is an entity owned by us and our parent s direct wholly-owned subsidiary EchoStar SNR HoldCo L.L.C. and, prior to February 16, 2024, by us and SNR Management. See Note 2 for further information. Northstar Wireless and SNR Wireless each filed applications with the FCC to participate in Auction 97 (the AWS-3 Auction for the purpose of acquiring certain AWS-3 Licenses. Each of Northstar Wireless and SNR Wireless applied to receive bidding credits of as designated entities under applicable FCC rules.

 bidding credits (approximately billion for Northstar Wireless and billion for SNR Wireless). On November 23, 2020, the FCC released a Memorandum Opinion and Order on Remand, FCC 20-160, that found that Northstar Wireless and SNR Wireless are not eligible for bidding credits based on the FCC s determination that they remain under DISH Network s de facto control. Northstar Wireless and SNR Wireless appealed the FCC s order to the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals. On June 21, 2022, the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia issued an Opinion rejecting this challenge. On January 17, 2023, Northstar Wireless filed a petition for a writ of certiorari asking the United States Supreme Court to hear a further appeal, but that petition was denied on June 30, 2023. Letters Exchanged between Northstar Wireless and the FCC Wireless Bureau. As outlined in letters exchanged between Northstar Wireless and the Wireless Telecommunications Bureau of the FCC (the FCC Wireless Bureau ), Northstar Wireless paid the gross winning bid amounts for AWS-3 Licenses and notified the FCC that it would not be paying the gross winning bid amounts for AWS-3 Licenses. As a result of the nonpayment of those gross winning bid amounts, the FCC retained those licenses. If the winning bids from re-auction or other award of the AWS-3 licenses retained by the FCC are greater than or equal to the winning bids of Northstar Wireless, no additional amounts will be owed to the FCC by Northstar Wireless. However, if those winning bids are less than the winning bids of Northstar Wireless, then we will be responsible for the difference less any overpayment of the Northstar interim payment, detailed below, (which will be recalculated as of the winning bids from re-auction or other award) (the Northstar Re-Auction Payment ). For example, if the winning bids in a re-auction are 1, the Northstar Re-Auction Payment would be approximately billion, which is calculated as the difference between billion (the Northstar winning bid amounts) and 1 (the winning bids from re-auction) less the resulting million overpayment of the Northstar interim payment. We cannot predict with any degree of certainty the timing or outcome of any re-auction or the amount of any Northstar Re-Auction Payment. Letters Exchanged between SNR Wireless and the FCC Wireless Bureau. As outlined in letters exchanged between SNR Wireless and the FCC Wireless Bureau, SNR Wireless paid the gross winning bid amounts for AWS-3 Licenses and notified the FCC that it would not be paying the gross winning bid amounts for AWS-3 Licenses. As a result of the nonpayment of those gross winning bid amounts, the FCC retained those licenses. If the winning bids from re-auction or other award of the AWS-3 licenses retained by the FCC are greater than or equal to the winning bids of SNR Wireless, no additional amounts will be owed to the FCC by SNR Wireless. However, if those winning bids are less than the winning bids of SNR Wireless, then we and our parent, EchoStar, will be responsible for the difference less any overpayment of the SNR interim payment, detailed below, (which will be recalculated as of the winning bids from re-auction or other award) (the SNR Re-Auction Payment ). For example, if the winning bids in a re-auction are 1, the SNR Re-Auction Payment would be approximately billion, which is calculated as the difference between billion (the SNR winning bid amounts) and 1 (the winning bids from re-auction) less the resulting million overpayment of the SNR interim payment. We cannot predict with any degree of certainty the timing or outcome of any re-auction or the amount of any SNR Re-Auction Payment.

That verdict became moot on March 21, 2023, when the trial court indicated that it would grant DISH Network L.L.C. s and DISH Technologies L.L.C. s motion for judgment as a matter of law, thus effectively vacating the jury award. On June 2, 2023, the Court entered its formal order granting judgment as a matter of law. On December 12, 2023, the Court denied ClearPlay s motion to alter or amend the judgment. ClearPlay has filed a notice of appeal to the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, and briefing should be completed by November 27, 2024.

On June 21, 2023, the Court granted the motion of DISH Network L.L.C. and DISH Technologies L.L.C. to have the case transferred to the United States District Court for the District of Colorado . In May 2023, DISH Network L.L.C. and DISH Technologies L.L.C. filed petitions with the United States Patent and Trademark Office challenging the validity of all claims of the 710 patent and the 122 patent and, on December 11, 2023, the United States Patent and Trademark Office entered decisions instituting each petition. On May 9, 2024, a magistrate judge issued an order granting the defendants motion to stay the case pending the petitions before the United States Patent and Trademark Office and any related appeals. We intend to vigorously defend this case. In the event that a court ultimately determines that we infringe the asserted patents, we may be subject to substantial damages, which may include treble damages, and/or an injunction that could require us to materially modify certain features that we currently offer to consumers. We cannot predict with any degree of certainty the outcome of the suit or determine the extent of any potential liability or damages.

SafeCast Limited On June 27, 2022, SafeCast Limited filed a complaint against us in the United States District Court for the Western District of Texas. The complaint alleges that we infringe U.S. Patent No. 9,392,302, entitled System for providing improved facilities in time-shifted broadcasts (the 302 patent ). On the same day, it brought complaints in the same court asserting infringement of the same patent against AT T, Google, HBO, NBCUniversal, Paramount and Verizon.

 Segments We currently operate three primary business segments: (1) Pay-TV; (2) Retail Wireless; and (3) 5G Network Deployment. Our Pay-TV segment business strategy is to be the best provider of video services in the United States by providing products with the best technology, outstanding customer service and great value. We offer pay-TV services under the DISH brand and the SLING brand (collectively Pay-TV services). We promote our Pay-TV services by providing our subscribers with a better price-to-value relationship and experience than those available from other subscription television service providers. The DISH branded pay-TV service consists of, among other things, FCC licenses authorizing us to use direct broadcast satellite DBS and Fixed Satellite Service FSS spectrum, our owned and leased satellites, receiver systems, broadcast operations, a leased fiber optic network, in-home service and call center operations and certain other assets utilized in our operations DISH TV ). We also design, develop and distribute receiver systems and provide digital broadcast operations, including satellite uplinking/downlinking, transmission and other services to third-party pay-TV providers. The SLING branded pay-TV services consist of, among other things, multichannel, live-linear and on-demand streaming over-the-top OTT Internet-based domestic, international, Latino and Freestream video programming services SLING TV ). We market our SLING TV services to consumers who do not subscribe to traditional satellite and cable pay-TV services, as well as to current and recent traditional pay-TV subscribers who desire a lower cost alternative. We offer nationwide prepaid and postpaid retail wireless services to subscribers primarily under our Boost Mobile and Gen Mobile brands Retail Wireless services), as well as a competitive portfolio of wireless devices. We offer customers value by providing choice and flexibility in our Retail Wireless services. We offer competitive consumer plans with no annual service contracts. Our Retail Wireless business strategy is to expand our current target segments and profitably grow our subscriber base by acquiring and retaining high quality subscribers while we continue our 5G Network Deployment. We intend to acquire high quality subscribers by providing competitive offers, choice and outstanding customer service that better meet those subscribers needs and budget. We are currently operating our Retail Wireless segment primarily as a mobile virtual network operator MVNO as we continue our 5G Network Deployment and commercialize and grow customer traffic on our 5G Network, as defined below. We are transitioning our Retail Wireless segment to a mobile network operator MNO as our 5G Network has become commercially available and we grow customer traffic on our 5G Network. We are currently activating Boost Mobile subscribers with compatible devices onto our 5G Network in markets where we have reached voice over new radio VoNR . We have deployed 5G VoNR covering over 200 million Americans. Within our MVNO operations, today we depend on T-Mobile and AT T to provide us with network services under the amended Master Network Services Agreement MNSA and Network Services Agreement (the NSA ), respectively. Our 5G Network Deployment segment strategy is to commercialize our Wireless spectrum licenses through the completion of the nation s first cloud-native, Open Radio Access Network O-RAN based 5G network (our 5G Network Deployment ). We have committed to deploy a facilities-based 5G broadband network (our 5G Network capable of serving increasingly larger portions of the U.S. population at different deadlines.

 On September 29, 2023, the FCC confirmed we have met all of our June 14, 2023 band-specific 5G deployment commitments, and two of our three nationwide 5G commitments. The single remaining 5G commitment, that at least 70 of the U.S. population has access to average download speeds equal to 35 Mbps, was achieved in March 2024 using the drive test methodology previously agreed upon by us and the FCC and overseen by an independent monitor . We currently have the largest commercial deployment of 5G VoNR in the world covering over 200 million Americans and 5G broadband service covering over 250 million Americans. In September 2024, the FCC conditionally granted our requests to extend the 5G deployment deadlines for certain of our licenses based on several commitments, as detailed in Note 9 in the Notes to our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. Future Capital Requirements We expect to fund our future working capital, capital expenditures, other investments, and debt service requirements from cash generated from operations, existing cash, restricted cash, cash equivalents and marketable investment securities balances, and cash generated through raising additional capital. We may need to make significant additional investments to, among other things, continue our 5G Network Deployment and further commercialize, build-out and integrate our Wireless spectrum licenses and related assets. The amount of capital required to fund our future working capital, capital expenditure and other investment needs varies, depending on, among other things, the rate at which we complete our 5G Network Deployment, the potential purchase of additional wireless spectrum licenses and the rate at which we acquire new subscribers, and the cost of subscriber acquisition and retention. Certain of our capital expenditures for 2024 are expected to be driven by the rate of our 5G Network Deployment as well as costs associated with subscriber premises equipment. These expenditures are necessary for our 5G Network Deployment as well as to operate and maintain our DISH TV services. Consequently, we consider them to be non-discretionary. Our capital expenditures vary depending on, among other things, the number of satellites leased or under construction at any point in time and could increase materially as a result of increased competition, significant satellite failures, or economic weakness and uncertainty. Our DISH TV subscriber base has been declining and there can be no assurance that our DISH TV subscriber base will not continue to decline and that the pace of such decline will not accelerate. In the event that our DISH TV subscriber base continues to decline, it will have a material adverse long-term effect on our cash flow. We have and expect to continue to incur expenditures in 2024 related to our 5G Network Deployment, including, but not limited to, capital expenditures associated with our 5G Network Deployment and the potential purchase of additional wireless spectrum licenses. The amount of capital required will also depend on, among other things, our available liquidity, the growth of our Retail Wireless segment and the levels of investment necessary to support potential strategic initiatives that may arise from time to time. These factors, including, but not limited to, a reduction in our available future cash flows as a result of our 5G Network Deployment, may require us to raise additional capital in the future, which may not be available on favorable terms. Volatility in the financial markets has made it more difficult at times for issuers of high-yield indebtedness, such as us, to access capital markets at favorable terms. These developments may have a significant effect on our cost of financing and our liquidity position.

 Economic Environment During 2023 and the first nine months of 2024, we experienced inflationary pressures in our commodity and labor costs resulting from the macroeconomic environment in the United States, which has significantly impacted our overall operating results. Operational Liquidity We make general investments in property such as, among others, satellites, wireless devices, set-top boxes, information technology and facilities that support our Pay-TV and Retail Wireless segments. We are also making significant additional investments and may partner with others to, among other things, continue our 5G Network Deployment and further commercialize, build-out and integrate our Wireless spectrum licenses and related assets. Moreover, since we are primarily a subscriber-based company, we also make subscriber-specific investments to acquire new subscribers and retain existing subscribers. While the general investments may be deferred without impacting the business in the short-term, the subscriber-specific investments are less discretionary. Our overall objective is to generate sufficient cash flow over the life of each subscriber to provide an adequate return against the upfront investment. Once the upfront investment has been made for each subscriber, the subsequent cash flow is generally positive, but there can be no assurance that over time we will recoup or earn a return on the upfront investment. There are a number of factors that impact our future cash flow compared to the cash flow we generate at a given point in time. The first factor is our churn rate and how successful we are at retaining our current subscribers. To the extent we lose subscribers from our existing base, the positive cash flow from that base is correspondingly reduced. The second factor is how successful we are at maintaining our service margins. To the extent our Cost of services grow faster than our Service revenue, the amount of cash flow that is generated per existing subscriber is reduced. Our Pay-TV service margins have been reduced by, among other things, higher programming costs. Our Retail Wireless service margins are impacted by, among other things, our MNSA agreement with T-Mobile and our NSA agreement with AT T and the speed with which we are able to migrate Wireless subscribers onto our 5G Network. The third factor is the rate at which we acquire new subscribers. The faster we acquire new subscribers, the more our positive ongoing cash flow from existing subscribers is offset by the negative upfront cash flow associated with acquiring new subscribers. Conversely, the slower we acquire subscribers, the more our operating cash flow is enhanced in that period. Finally, our future cash flow is impacted by, among other things, the rate at which we complete our 5G Network Deployment, incur litigation expense, and any cash flow from financing activities. We anticipate operating expenditures for our 5G Network Deployment to increase for the remainder of 2024 as we continue to, among other things, deploy cell sites and communication towers to continue to commercialize our 5G Network. We expect our capital expenditures to remain consistent in the near term. However, as we prepare for our next build-out requirement deadlines, we expect our capital expenditures to increase as we approach these deadlines. As a result, our historical cash flow is not necessarily indicative of our future cash flows. As of September 30, 2024, as a result of, among other things, capital expenditures for our 5G Network Deployment, we experienced negative cash flow. We expect that this trend will continue in 2024 and in future periods. In addition, declines in our Pay-TV and Wireless subscriber base and any decrease in subscriber-related margins negatively impact our cash flow, and there can be no assurance that our subscriber declines will not continue. Availability of Credit and Effect on Liquidity The ability to raise capital has generally existed for us despite economic weakness and uncertainty. While modest fluctuations in the cost of capital will not likely impact our current operational plans, significant fluctuations could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.

 Debt Issuances and Maturity We repurchased or redeemed the principal balance of our 2 3/8 Convertible Notes due 2024 as of March 15, 2024, the instrument s maturity date. Our 5 7/8 Senior Notes due 2024 with remaining balance of approximately 1.983 billion mature on November 15, 2024. We expect to fund this obligation from our current restricted cash and cash equivalents balances on hand. Covenants and Restrictions Related to our Long-Term Debt We are subject to the covenants and restrictions set forth in the indentures related to our long-term debt. In particular, the indentures related to our outstanding senior notes issued by DISH DBS Corporation DISH DBS contain restrictive covenants that, among other things, impose limitations on the ability of DISH DBS and its restricted subsidiaries to: (i) incur additional indebtedness; (ii) enter into sale and leaseback transactions; (iii) pay dividends or make distributions on DISH DBS capital stock or repurchase DISH DBS capital stock; (iv) make certain investments; (v) create liens; (vi) enter into certain transactions with affiliates; (vii) merge or consolidate with another company; and (viii) transfer or sell assets.

Should we fail to comply with these covenants, all or a portion of the debt under the senior notes, senior secured notes and our other long-term debt could become immediately payable. The senior notes and senior secured notes also provide that the debt may be required to be prepaid if certain change-in-control events occur. In addition, the Convertible Notes provide that, if a fundamental change (as defined in the related indenture) occurs, holders may require us to repurchase for cash all or part of their Convertible Notes. As of the date of filing of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, we and DISH DBS were in compliance with the covenants and restrictions related to our respective long-term debt recorded on our Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets as of September 30, 2024 .

 DISH TV subscribers. We include customers obtained through direct sales, independent third-party retailers and other independent third-party distribution relationships in our DISH TV subscriber count. We also provide DISH TV services to hotels, motels and other commercial accounts. For certain of these commercial accounts, we divide our total revenue for these commercial accounts by 34.99, and include the resulting number, which is substantially smaller than the actual number of commercial units served, in our DISH TV subscriber count. SLING TV subscribers. We include customers obtained through direct sales and third-party marketing agreements in our SLING TV subscriber count. SLING TV subscriber additions are recorded net of disconnects. SLING TV customers receiving SLING TV Freestream service, or service for no charge, under certain new subscriber promotions, are excluded from our SLING TV subscriber count. For customers who subscribe to multiple SLING TV packages, each customer is only counted as one SLING TV subscriber. Pay-TV subscribers. Our Pay-TV subscriber count includes all DISH TV and SLING TV subscribers discussed above. For customers who subscribe to both our DISH TV services and our SLING TV services, each subscription is counted as a separate Pay-TV subscriber. Pay-TV average monthly revenue per subscriber Pay-TV ARPU ). We are not aware of any uniform standards for calculating ARPU and believe presentations of ARPU may not be calculated consistently by other companies in the same or similar businesses. We calculate Pay-TV average monthly revenue per Pay-TV subscriber, or Pay-TV ARPU, by dividing average monthly Pay-TV segment Service revenue, excluding revenue from broadband services, for the period by our average number of Pay-TV subscribers for the period. The average number of Pay-TV subscribers is calculated for the period by adding the average number of Pay-TV subscribers for each month and dividing by the number of months in the period. The average number of Pay-TV subscribers for each month is calculated by adding the beginning and ending Pay-TV subscribers for the month and dividing by two. SLING TV subscribers on average purchase lower priced programming services than DISH TV subscribers, and therefore, as SLING TV subscribers increase as a percentage of total Pay-TV subscribers, it has had a negative impact on Pay-TV ARPU. DISH TV average monthly subscriber churn rate DISH TV churn rate ). We are not aware of any uniform standards for calculating subscriber churn rate and believe presentations of subscriber churn rates may not be calculated consistently by different companies in the same or similar businesses. We calculate our DISH TV churn rate for any period by dividing the number of DISH TV subscribers who terminated service during the period by the average number of DISH TV subscribers for the same period, and further dividing by the number of months in the period. The average number of DISH TV subscribers is calculated for the period by adding the average number of DISH TV subscribers for each month and dividing by the number of months in the period. The average number of DISH TV subscribers for each month is calculated by adding the beginning and ending DISH TV subscribers for the month and dividing by two. DISH TV SAC. Subscriber acquisition cost measures are commonly used by those evaluating traditional companies in the pay-TV industry. We are not aware of any uniform standards for calculating the average subscriber acquisition costs per new DISH TV subscriber activation, or DISH TV SAC, and we believe presentations of pay-TV SAC may not be calculated consistently by different companies in the same or similar businesses. Our DISH TV SAC is calculated using all costs of acquiring DISH TV subscribers (e.g., subsidized equipment, advertising, installation, commissions and direct sales, etc.) which are included in Selling, general and administrative expenses, plus capitalized payments made under certain sales incentive programs and the value of equipment capitalized under our lease program for new DISH TV subscribe rs , divided by gross new DISH TV subscriber activations. We include all new DISH TV subscribers in our calculation, including DISH TV subscribers added with little or no subscriber acquisition costs.

 Wireless subscribers. We include prepaid and postpaid customers obtained through direct sales, independent third-party retailers and other independent third-party distribution relationships in our Wireless subscriber count. Our Wireless subscriber count includes all Government subsidized subscribers discussed below. Our gross new Wireless subscriber activations exclude all Government subsidized subscribers as we record these subscribers net of disconnects, as discussed below. Government subsidized wireless subscribers and other wireless subscribers Government subsidized subscribers ). Our Government subsidized subscribers have different subscriber economics than our core Wireless subscribers, including a significantly higher churn rate and lower subscriber acquisition costs. Therefore, our Government subsidized subscriber additions are recorded net of disconnects. Our Government subsidized subscriber count includes Wireless subscribers that participate in government subsidized programs, including the ACP program and Lifeline program, defined below, and other subscribers acquired under the Gen Mobile brand. The Affordable Connectivity Program ACP is a federal program offering broadband services and devices discounts to help low-income individuals that meet certain eligibility criteria. The ACP program funding concluded on June 1, 2024. The Lifeline Program is a federal program offering broadband services discounts to help low-income individuals that meet certain eligibility criteria. Certain states also offer a separate Lifeline program. Wireless average monthly revenue per subscriber Wireless ARPU ). We are not aware of any uniform standards for calculating ARPU and believe presentations of ARPU may not be calculated consistently by other companies in the same or similar businesses. We calculate average monthly revenue per Wireless subscriber, or Wireless ARPU, by dividing average monthly Retail Wireless segment Service revenue for the period by our average number of Wireless subscribers for the period. The average number of Wireless subscribers is calculated for the period by adding the average number of Wireless subscribers for each month and dividing by the number of months in the period. The average number of Wireless subscribers for each month is calculated by adding the beginning and ending Wireless subscribers for the month and dividing by two. Wireless average monthly subscriber churn rate Wireless churn rate ). We are not aware of any uniform standards for calculating subscriber churn rate and believe presentations of subscriber churn rates may not be calculated consistently by different companies in the same or similar businesses. We calculate our Wireless churn rate for any period by dividing the number of Wireless subscribers who terminated service during the period by the average number of Wireless subscribers for the same period, and further dividing by the number of months in the period. The average number of Wireless subscribers is calculated for the period by adding the average number of Wireless subscribers for each month and dividing by the number of months in the period. The average number of Wireless subscribers for each month is calculated by adding the beginning and ending Wireless subscribers for the month and dividing by two. Government subsidized subscriber additions are recorded net of disconnects and therefore excluded from our calculation of our Wireless churn rate.

Our consolidated operating loss totaled 130 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to operating income of 488 million during the same period in 2023. This change primarily resulted from an increase in operating loss from our 5G Network Deployment and Retail Wireless segments and a decrease in operating income from our Pay-TV segment.

 Pay-TV Segment We offer Pay-TV services under the DISH brand and the SLING brand. As of September 30, 2024, we had 8.031 million Pay-TV subscribers in the United States, including 5.888 million DISH TV subscribers and 2.143 million SLING TV subscribers. We promote our Pay-TV services by providing our subscribers with better service, technology and value than those available from other subscription television service providers. We offer a wide selection of video services under the DISH TV brand, with access to hundreds of channels depending on the level of subscription. Our standard programming packages generally include programming provided by national cable networks. We also offer programming packages that include local broadcast networks, specialty sports channels, premium movie channels and Latino and international programming. We market our SLING TV services to consumers who do not subscribe to traditional satellite and cable pay-TV services, as well as to current and recent traditional pay-TV subscribers who desire a lower cost alternative. Our SLING TV services require an Internet connection and are available on multiple streaming-capable devices including, among others, streaming media devices, TVs, tablets, computers, game consoles and phones. We offer SLING domestic, SLING International, SLING Latino and SLING Freestream video programming services. Trends in our Pay-TV Segment Competition Competition has intensified in recent years as the pay-TV industry has matured. We and our competitors increasingly must seek to attract a greater proportion of new subscribers from each other s existing subscriber bases rather than from first-time purchasers of pay-TV services. We face substantial competition from established pay-TV providers and broadband service providers and increasing competition from companies providing/facilitating the delivery of video content via the Internet to computers, televisions, and other streaming and mobile devices, including wireless service providers. In recent years, industry consolidation and convergence has created competitors with greater scale and multiple product/service offerings. These developments, among others, have contributed to intense and increasing competition, and we expect such competition to continue. We incur significant costs to retain our existing DISH TV subscribers, generally as a result of upgrading their equipment to next generation receivers, primarily including our Hopper receivers, and by providing retention credits. Our DISH TV subscriber retention costs may vary significantly from period to period. Many of our competitors have been especially aggressive by offering discounted programming and services for both new and existing subscribers, including, but not limited to, bundled offers combining broadband, video and/or wireless services and other promotional offers. Certain competitors have been able to subsidize the price of video services with the price of broadband and/or wireless services. Our Pay-TV services also face increased competition from programmers and other companies who distribute video directly to consumers over the Internet, as well as traditional satellite television providers, cable companies and large telecommunications companies that are rapidly increasing their Internet-based video offerings and direct-to-consumer exclusive and non-exclusive content. We also face competition from providers of video content, many of which are providers of programming content to us, that distribute content over the Internet including services with live-linear television programming, as well as single programmer offerings and offerings of large libraries of on-demand content, including in certain cases original content. These product offerings include, but are not limited to, Netflix, Hulu, Apple+, Prime Video, YouTube TV, Disney+, ESPN+, Paramount+, Max, STARZ, Peacock, Fubo, Philo and Tubi and certain bundles of these offerings.

 Significant changes in consumer behavior regarding the means by which consumers obtain video entertainment and information in response to digital media competition could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition or otherwise disrupt our business. In particular, consumers have shown increased interest in viewing certain video programming in any place, at any time and/or on any broadband or Internet-connected device they choose. Online content providers may cause our subscribers to disconnect our DISH TV services cord cutting ), downgrade to smaller, less expensive programming packages cord shaving or elect to purchase through these online content providers a certain portion of the services that they would have historically purchased from us. Mergers and acquisitions, joint ventures and alliances among cable television providers, telecommunications companies, programming providers and others may result in, among other things, greater scale and financial leverage and increase the availability of offerings from providers capable of bundling video, broadband and/or wireless services in competition with our services and may exacerbate the risks described under the caption Item 1A. Risk Factors of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 and elsewhere in our public filings. These transactions may affect us adversely by, among other things, making it more difficult for us to obtain access to certain programming networks on nondiscriminatory and fair terms, or at all. Our Pay-TV subscriber base has been declining due to, among other things, the factors described above. There can be no assurance that our Pay-TV subscriber base will not continue to decline and that the pace of such decline will not accelerate. As our Pay-TV subscriber base continues to decline, it could have a material adverse long-term effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flow. Programming Our ability to compete successfully will depend, among other things, on our ability to continue to obtain desirable programming and deliver it to our subscribers at competitive prices. Programming costs represent a large percentage of our Cost of services and the largest component of our total expense. We expect these costs to continue to increase due to contractual price increases and the renewal of long-term programming contracts on less favorable pricing terms and certain programming costs are rising at a much faster rate than wages or inflation. In particular, the rates we are charged for retransmitting local broadcast channels have been increasing substantially and may exceed our ability to increase our prices to our subscribers. Our ability to provide services under these agreements and negotiate acceptable terms depends on, among other things, the number of subscribers we have, our actual, perceived or anticipated financial condition and our negotiating power against each programmer, which can vary depending on the size and scale of such programmer. Going forward, our margins may face pressure if we are unable to renew our long-term programming contracts on acceptable pricing and other economic terms or if we are unable to pass these increased programming costs on to our subscribers. Increases in programming costs have caused us to increase the rates that we charge to our subscribers, which could in turn cause our existing Pay-TV subscribers to disconnect our services or cause potential new Pay-TV subscribers to choose not to subscribe to our services. Additionally, even if our subscribers do not disconnect our services, they may purchase through new and existing online content providers a certain portion of the services that they would have historically purchased from us.

 Furthermore, our net Pay-TV subscriber additions, gross new DISH TV subscriber activations, and DISH TV churn rate may be negatively impacted if we are unable to renew our long-term programming carriage contracts. In the past, our net Pay-TV subscriber additions, gross new DISH TV subscriber activations, and DISH TV churn rate have been negatively impacted as a result of programming interruptions and threatened programming interruptions in connection with the scheduled expiration of programming carriage contracts with content providers. There can be no assurance that the removal of any channels will not have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition or otherwise disrupt our business. We cannot predict with any certainty the impact to our net Pay-TV subscriber additions, gross new DISH TV subscriber activations, and DISH TV churn rate resulting from programming interruptions or threatened programming interruptions that may occur in the future. As a result, we may at tim es suffer from periods of lower net Pay-TV subscriber additions or higher net Pay-TV subscriber losses. Other Developments Adaptive Bitrate Streaming Patents T hrough our subsidiaries, we hold dozens of issued United States and foreign patents that relate to Adaptive Bitrate Streaming. On September 9, 2022, the chief administrative law judge at the United States International Trade Commission ITC issued an Initial Determination holding that the video streaming in certain Peloton, NordicTrack and Mirror exercise equipment infringes four of those patents, and recommended that the ITC prevent the importation of the infringing products. On March 8, 2023, the ITC issued its Final Determination, which affirmed the Initial Determination for three of the four patents in all material aspects, and issued the recommended exclusion and cease and desist orders, which will become effective after a Presidential review period. On February 9, 2023, we entered into a confidential license agreement covering Mirror exercise equipment that resolves our litigation involving those products. On May 1, 2023, we entered into a 75 million license agreement covering Peloton exercise equipment that resolves our litigation involving those products. During the second quarter of 2023, we recorded the 75 million license agreement in Equipment sales and other revenue on our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income (Loss). On March 6, 2024, we entered into a license agreement covering NordicTrack exercise equipment that resolves our litigation involving those products and received the initial payment.

Pay-TV Subscribers DISH TV subscribers . We lost approximately 188,000 net DISH TV subscribers during the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the loss of approximately 181,000 net DISH TV subscribers during the same period in 2023. This increase in net DISH TV subscriber losses primarily resulted from lower gross new DISH TV subscriber activations, partially offset by a lower DISH TV churn rate. 

 79 

Table of Contents Item 2. MANAGEMENT S NARRATIVE ANALYSIS OF RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Continued 
 SLING TV subscribers . We added approximately 145,000 net SLING TV subscribers during the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the addition of approximately 117,000 net SLING TV subscribers during the same period in 2023. The change in net SLING TV subscribers was primarily related to higher SLING TV subscriber activations and lower SLING TV subscriber disconnects in 2024 due to our emphasis on acquiring higher quality subscribers. We continue to experience increased competition, including competition from other subscription video on-demand and live-linear OTT service providers, many of which are providers of our content and offer football and other seasonal sports programming direct to subscribers on an a la carte basis. DISH TV subscribers, gross . During the three months ended September 30, 2024, we activated approximately 75,000 gross new DISH TV subscribers compared to approximately 142,000 gross new DISH TV subscribers during the same period in 2023, a decrease of 47.2 . This decrease in our gross new DISH TV subscriber activations was primarily related to the lack of demand, shifting consumer behavior and lower marketing expenditures, as well as increased competitive pressures, including, but not limited to, live-linear OTT service providers, aggressive short term introductory pricing and bundled offers combining broadband, video and/or wireless services and other discounted promotional offers, and direct-to-consumer offerings by certain of our programmers. Our gross new DISH TV subscriber activations continue to be negatively impacted by an emphasis on acquiring higher quality subscribers. DISH TV churn rate . Our DISH TV churn rate for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was 1.47 compared to 1.58 for the same period in 2023. Our DISH TV churn rate for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was positively impacted by our emphasis on acquiring and retaining higher quality subscribers. Our DISH TV churn rate continues to be adversely impacted by external factors, such as, among other things, cord cutting, shifting consumer behavior and increased competitive pressures, including, but not limited to, live-linear OTT service providers, aggressive marketing, bundled discount offers combining broadband, video and/or wireless services and other discounted promotional offers. Our DISH TV churn rate is also impacted by internal factors, such as, among other things, our ability to consistently provide outstanding customer service, price increases, our ability to control piracy and other forms of fraud and the level of our retention efforts. Our net Pay-TV subscriber additions, gross new DISH TV subscriber activations, and DISH TV churn rate have been negatively impacted as a result of programming interruptions and threatened programming interruptions in connection with the scheduled expiration of programming carriage contracts with content providers. We cannot predict with any certainty the impact to our net Pay-TV subscriber additions, gross new DISH TV subscriber activations, and DISH TV subscriber churn rate resulting from programming interruptions or threatened programming interruptions that may occur in the future. As a result, we may at times suffer from periods of lower net Pay-TV subscriber additions or higher net Pay-TV subscriber losses. We have not always met our own standards for performing high-quality installations, effectively resolving subscriber issues when they arise, answering subscriber calls in an acceptable timeframe, effectively communicating with our subscriber base, reducing calls driven by the complexity of our business, improving the reliability of certain systems and subscriber equipment and aligning the interests of certain independent third-party retailers and installers to provide high-quality service. Most of these factors have affected both gross new DISH TV subscriber activations as well as DISH TV subscriber churn rate. Our future gross new DISH TV subscriber activations and our DISH TV subscriber churn rate may be negatively impacted by these factors, which could in turn adversely affect our revenue.

 Service revenue. Service revenue totaled 2.602 billion for the three months ended September 30, 2024, a decrease of 175 million or 6.3 compared to the same period in 2023. The decrease in Service revenue compared to the same period in 2023 was primarily related to lower average Pay-TV subscriber base, partially offset by an increase in Pay-TV ARPU, discussed below. Pay-TV ARPU. Pay-TV ARPU was 108.88 during the three months ended September 30, 2024 versus 105.25 during the same period in 2023. The 3.63 or 3.4 increase in Pay-TV ARPU was primarily attributable to the DISH TV and SLING TV programming price increases and higher Pay-TV ad sales revenue . The DISH TV and SLING TV programming package price increases were effective in the fourth quarter of 2023. Cost of services. Cost of services totaled 1.639 billion during the three months ended September 30, 2024, a decrease of 77 million or 4.5 compared to the same period in 2023. The decrease in Cost of services was primarily attributable to a lower average Pay-TV subscriber base, partially offset by higher programming costs per subscriber. Programming costs per subscriber increased during the three months ended September 30, 2024 due to rate increases in certain of our programming contracts, including the renewal of certain contracts at higher rates, particularly for local broadcast channels. Cost of services represented 63.0 and 61.8 of Service revenue during the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. In the normal course of business, we enter into contracts to purchase programming content in which our payment obligations are generally contingent on the number of Pay-TV subscribers to whom we provide the respective content. Our Cost of services have and will continue to face further upward pressure from price increases and the renewal of long-term programming contracts on less favorable pricing terms. In addition, our programming expenses will increase to the extent we are successful in growing our Pay-TV subscriber base. Selling, general and administrative expenses. Selling, general and administrative expenses totaled 284 million during the three months ended September 30, 2024, a 102 million or 26.4 decrease compared to the same period in 2023. This change was primarily driven by a decrease in subscriber acquisition costs resulting from lower marketing expenditures and lower gross new DISH TV subscriber activations and a decrease in personnel costs. In addition, the three months ended September 30, 2023 was negatively impacted by Merger related costs. DISH TV SAC. DISH TV SAC was 985 during the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 1,065 during the same period in 2023, a decrease of 80 or 7.5 . This change was primarily attributable to a decrease in advertising costs per subscriber and a higher percentage of remanufactured receivers being activated on new subscriber accounts, partially offset by higher commission costs due to our emphasis on acquiring higher quality subscribers. During the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the amount of equipment capitalized under our lease program for new DISH TV subscribers totaled 6 million and 16 million, respectively. This decrease in capital expenditures primarily resulted from a decrease in gross new DISH TV subscriber activations and a higher percentage of remanufactured receivers being activated on new subscriber accounts. To remain competitive, we upgrade or replace subscriber equipment periodically as technology changes, and the costs associated with these upgrades may be substantial. To the extent technological changes render a portion of our existing equipment obsolete, we would be unable to redeploy all returned equipment and consequently would realize less benefit from the DISH TV SAC reduction associated with redeployment of that returned lease equipment. Our DISH TV SAC may materially increase in the future to the extent that we, among other things, transition to newer technologies, introduce more aggressive promotions, or provide greater equipment subsidies.

We lost approximately 583,000 net DISH TV subscribers during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the loss of approximately 696,000 net DISH TV subscribers during the same period in 2023. This decrease in net DISH TV subscriber losses primarily resulted from a lower DISH TV churn rate, partially offset by lower gross new DISH TV subscriber activations. SLING TV subscribers . We added approximately 88,000 net SLING TV subscribers during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the loss of approximately 214,000 net SLING TV subscribers during the same period in 2023. The change in net SLING TV subscribers was primarily related to lower SLING TV subscriber disconnects in 2024 due to our emphasis on acquiring higher quality subscribers, partially offset by lower SLING TV subscriber activations. We continue to experience increased competition, including competition from other subscription video on-demand and live-linear OTT service providers, many of which are providers of our content and offer football and other seasonal sports programming direct to subscribers on an a la carte basis.

 DISH TV subscribers, gross . During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we activated approximately 230,000 gross new DISH TV subscribers compared to approximately 375,000 gross new DISH TV subscribers during the same period in 2023, a decrease of 38.7 . This decrease in our gross new DISH TV subscriber activations was primarily related to the lack of demand, shifting consumer behavior and lower marketing expenditures, as well as increased competitive pressures, including, but not limited to, live-linear OTT service providers, aggressive short term introductory pricing and bundled offers combining broadband, video and/or wireless services and other discounted promotional offers, and direct-to-consumer offerings by certain of our programmers. Our gross new DISH TV subscriber activations continue to be negatively impacted by an emphasis on acquiring higher quality subscribers. DISH TV churn rate . Our DISH TV churn rate for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 1.46 compared to 1.69 for the same period in 2023. Our DISH TV churn rate for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was positively impacted by our emphasis on acquiring and retaining higher quality subscribers. Our DISH TV churn rate continues to be adversely impacted by external factors, such as, among other things, cord cutting, shifting consumer behavior and increased competitive pressures, including, but not limited to, live-linear OTT service providers, aggressive marketing, bundled discount offers combining broadband, video and/or wireless services and other discounted promotional offers. Our DISH TV churn rate is also impacted by internal factors, such as, among other things, our ability to consistently provide outstanding customer service, price increases, our ability to control piracy and other forms of fraud and the level of our retention efforts. In addition, our DISH TV churn rate for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 was briefly elevated due to the cyber-security incident in the first quarter of 2023. Our net Pay-TV subscriber additions, gross new DISH TV subscriber activations, and DISH TV churn rate have been negatively impacted as a result of programming interruptions and threatened programming interruptions in connection with the scheduled expiration of programming carriage contracts with content providers. We cannot predict with any certainty the impact to our net Pay-TV subscriber additions, gross new DISH TV subscriber activations, and DISH TV subscriber churn rate resulting from programming interruptions or threatened programming interruptions that may occur in the future. As a result, we may at times suffer from periods of lower net Pay-TV subscriber additions or higher net Pay-TV subscriber losses. Service revenue. Service revenue totaled 7.962 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, a decrease of 630 million or 7.3 compared to the same period in 2023. The decrease in Service revenue compared to the same period in 2023 was primarily related to lower average Pay-TV subscriber base, partially offset by an increase in Pay-TV ARPU, discussed below. Equipment sales and other revenue. Equipment sales and other revenue totaled 59 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, a decrease of 103 million compared to the same period in 2023. The decrease in Equipment sales and other revenue compared to the same period in 2023 was primarily related to a non-recurring 75 million license of our Adaptive Bitrate Streaming patents to Peloton covering certain Peloton products that resolves our litigation involving those products during the second quarter of 2023 . Pay-TV ARPU. Pay-TV ARPU was 108.21 during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 versus 103.98 during the same period in 2023. The 4.23 or 4.1 increase in Pay-TV ARPU was primarily attributable to the DISH TV and SLING TV programming price increases and higher Pay-TV ad sales revenue. The DISH TV and SLING TV programming package price increases were effective in the fourth quarter of 2023.

 Cost of services. Cost of services totaled 4.942 billion during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, a decrease of 356 million or 6.7 compared to the same period in 2023. The decrease in Cost of services was primarily attributable to a lower average Pay-TV subscriber base and lower variable and retention costs per subscriber, partially offset by higher programming costs per subscriber. Programming costs per subscriber increased during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 due to rate increases in certain of our programming contracts, including the renewal of certain contracts at higher rates, particularly for local broadcast channels. Variable and retention costs per subscriber during the nine months ended September 30, 2023 were negatively impacted by approximately 30 million in cyber-security-related expenses to remediate the incident and provide additional customer support. Cost of services represented 62.1 and 61.7 of Service revenue during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Selling, general and administrative expenses. Selling, general and administrative expenses totaled 840 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, a 269 million or 24.2 decrease compared to the same period in 2023. This change was primarily driven by a decrease in subscriber acquisition costs resulting from lower marketing expenditures and lower gross new DISH TV subscriber activations and a decrease in personnel costs. In addition, the nine months ended September 30, 2023 was negatively impacted by Merger related costs. Depreciation and amortization. Depreciation and amortization expense totaled 258 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 , a 28 million or 9.8 decrease compared to the same period in 2023. This change was primarily driven by a decrease in depreciation expense from equipment leased to new and existing DISH TV subscribers and the EchoStar XI satellite which became fully depreciated during the second quarter of 2023. DISH TV SAC. DISH TV SAC was 993 during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 1,095 during the same period in 2023, a decrease of 102 or 9.3 . This change was primarily attributable to a decrease in advertising costs per subscriber and a higher percentage of remanufactured receivers being activated on new subscriber accounts, partially offset by higher commission costs due to our emphasis on acquiring higher quality subscribers. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the amount of equipment capitalized under our lease program for new DISH TV subscribers totaled 19 million and 43 million, respectively. This decrease in capital expenditures primarily resulted from a decrease in gross new DISH TV subscriber activations and a higher percentage of remanufactured receivers being activated on new subscriber accounts.

 Retail Wireless Segment We offer nationwide prepaid and postpaid Retail Wireless services to subscribers primarily under our Boost Mobile and Gen Mobile brands, as well as a competitive portfolio of wireless devices. Prepaid wireless subscribers generally pay in advance for monthly access to wireless talk, text and data services. Postpaid wireless subscribers are qualified to pay after receiving wireless talk, text and data services, and may also qualify for certain device financing arrangements. Boost Mobile postpaid . During 2023, we launched our nationwide expansion of our Boost Mobile postpaid wireless service. At the end of the third quarter of 2023, we began offering premium wireless devices, including Apple products. We currently offer a broad range of premium wireless devices on our 5G Network. We are currently operating our Retail Wireless segment primarily as an MVNO as we continue our 5G Network Deployment and commercialize and grow customer traffic on our 5G Network. We are transitioning our Retail Wireless segment to an MNO as our 5G Network has become commercially available and we grow customer traffic on our 5G Network. We are currently activating Boost Mobile subscribers with compatible devices onto our 5G Network in markets where we have reached VoNR . We have deployed 5G VoNR covering over 200 million Americans. Within our MVNO operations, today we depend on T-Mobile and AT T to provide us with network services under the MNSA and NSA, respectively. As of September 30, 2024 we had 6.984 million Wireless subscribers. Currently, we offer Wireless subscribers competitive consumer plans with no annual service contracts and monthly service plans including high-speed data and unlimited talk and text, and device financing arrangements for certain qualified subscribers. During the second half of 2022, we began the process of migrating subscribers off the Transition Services Agreement TSA with T-Mobile, including the billing systems, and onto our own billing and operational support systems. The migration of subscribers to our new billing and operational support systems accelerated during the fourth quarter of 2022 and continued in the first and second quarters of 2023. The migration of subscribers during the first and second quarters of 2023 negatively impacted our Wireless churn rate and our results of operations. During the second quarter of 2023, we completed the migration of subscribers off the TSA with T-Mobile and onto our own billing and operational support systems. ACP Subscribers. A portion of our Wireless subscriber base and revenue is comprised of subscribers who received benefits under ACP through May 2024. Households enrolled in the ACP program continued to receive the benefit on their service through April 2024. In May 2024, households received a partial benefit and on June 1, 2024 the ACP program funding concluded and households no longer received their benefit. Although we implemented plans to retain and/or migrate these subscribers to lower priced service plans, these subscribers began deactivating in the second and third quarter of 2024. As of September 30, 2024, we had approximately 33,000 Wireless ACP subscribers, and if we are unsuccessful in retaining and/or migrating the remaining subscribers, they will deactivate in the fourth quarter of 2024. Generally, ACP subscribers have lower Wireless ARPU than other Wireless subscribers and as a result, any loss of ACP subscribers will have a nominal impact on pre-tax net income. We cannot predict with any certainty the impact of the loss of the ACP benefit to our Wireless subscriber base, net Wireless subscriber activations and results of operations.

 5G Network Deployment Segment We initially invested a total of over 30 billion in Wireless spectrum licenses, and a portion of these licenses were included in the Sale and Transfer of Assets to EchoStar. We currently have 24 billion of investments related to Wireless spectrum licenses, which does not include 7 billion of capitalized interest related to the carrying value of such licenses. See Note 1, Note 2 and Note 9 in the Notes to our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for further information. We plan to commercialize our Wireless spectrum licenses through our 5G Network Deployment. We have committed to deploy our 5G Network capable of serving increasingly larger portions of the U.S. population at different deadlines. We may need to raise additional capital in the future, which may not be available on favorable terms, to fund the efforts described below, as well as, among other things, make any potential Northstar Re-Auction Payment and SNR Re-Auction Payment for the AWS-3 licenses retained by the FCC. There can be no assurance that we will be able to complete all build-out requirements or profitably deploy our Wireless spectrum licenses, which may affect the carrying amount of these assets and our future financial condition or results of operations. See Note 9 in the Notes to our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for further information. Our Wireless spectrum licenses are subject to certain interim and final build-out requirements, as well as certain renewal requirements. On September 29, 2023, the FCC confirmed we have met all of our June 14, 2023 band-specific 5G deployment commitments, and two of our three nationwide 5G commitments. The single remaining 5G commitment, that at least 70 of the U.S. population has access to average download speeds equal to 35 Mbps, was achieved in March 2024 using the drive test methodology previously agreed upon by us and the FCC and overseen by an independent monitor. We currently have the largest commercial deployment of 5G VoNR in the world covering over 200 million Americans and 5G broadband service covering over 250 million Americans. In September 2024, the FCC conditionally granted our requests to extend the 5G deployment deadlines for certain of our licenses based on several commitments, as detailed in Note 9 in the Notes to our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. We may need to make significant additional investments or partner with others to, among other things, continue our 5G Network Deployment and further commercialize, build-out and integrate these licenses and related assets and any additional acquired licenses and related assets, as well as to comply with regulations applicable to such licenses. Depending on the nature and scope of such activities, any such investments or partnerships could vary significantly. In addition, as we continue our 5G Network Deployment, we have and may continue to incur significant additional expenses related to, among other things, research and development, wireless testing and ongoing upgrades to the wireless network infrastructure, software and third-party integration. As a result of these investments, among other factors, we may need to raise additional capital, which may not be available on favorable terms. We may also determine that additional wireless spectrum licenses may be required for our 5G Network Deployment and to compete effectively with other wireless service providers.

Interest expense, net of amounts capitalized totaled 161 million during the three months ended September 30, 2024, an increase of 150 million compared to the same period in 2023. This increase primarily resulted from the reduction of capitalized interest related to the qualifying assets being placed into service and the Sale and Transfer of Assets to EchoStar, which included the Intercompany Loan 2026 Tranche, which was previously eliminated in consolidation and held by DISH DBS, and as a result interest expense increased. During the three months ended September 30, 2024, as a result of the lower basis of our qualifying assets due to the Sale and Transfer of Assets to EchoStar and other qualifying assets, including certain bands of wireless spectrum licenses that have been placed into service with the deployment of our 5G Network, we no longer capitalize interest on those assets and as a result, capitalized interest was reduced. See Note 1, Note 2 and Note 8 in the Notes to our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for further information. Other, net. Other, net in come totaled 18 million during the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to expense of 151 million during the same period in 2023. The three months ended September 30, 2024 was positively impacted by a 21 million gain on the Liberty Puerto Rico asset sale. The three months ended September 30, 2023 was negatively impacted by a 155 million decrease in the fair value of our option to purchase certain of T-Mobile s 800 MHz spectrum licenses. See Note 4 and Note 9 in the Notes to our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for further information. Income tax (provision) benefit, net. Our income tax benefit was 48 million during the three months ended September 30, 2024, a decrease of 20 million compared to the same period in 2023. This change was primarily related to a decrease in Income (loss) before income taxes and the change in our effective tax rate. Our effective tax rate during the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was impacted by federal and state valuation allowances .

Interest income. Interest income totaled 32 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, a decrease of 59 million compared to the same period in 2023. This decrease primarily resulted from lower average cash and marketable investment securities balances and lower percentage returns earned on our cash and marketable investment securities during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. Interest expense, net of amounts capitalized. Interest expense, net of amounts capitalized totaled 496 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, an increase of 468 million compared to the same period in 2023.

During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as a result of the lower basis of our qualifying assets due to the Sale and Transfer of Assets to EchoStar and other qualifying assets, including certain bands of wireless spectrum licenses that have been placed into service with the deployment of our 5G Network, we no longer capitalize interest on those assets and as a result, capitalized interest was reduced.

Other, net income totaled 81 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to expense of 121 million during the same period in 2023 . The nine months ended September 30, 2024 was positively impacted by the 128 million gain on a sale of a financial asset to EchoSta r and a 21 million gain on the Liberty Puerto Rico asset sale, partially offset by a 70 million loss in equity in earnings from our Invidi investment, including 63 million from our portion of Invidi s goodwill impairment. The nine months ended September 30, 2023 was negatively impacted by a 192 million decrease in the fair value of our option to purchase certain of T-Mobile s 800 MHz spectrum licenses, partially offset by 73 million of early debt extinguishment gains from the repurchases of our convertible notes. See Note 1 in the Notes to our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for further information.

 Income tax (provision) benefit, net. Our income tax benefit was 81 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to a provision of 82 million during the same period in 2023 . This change was primarily related to a decrease in Income (loss) before income taxes and the change in our effective tax rate. Our effective tax rate during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was impacted by federal and state valuation allowances. Non-GAAP Performance Measures and Reconciliation It is management s intent to provide non-GAAP financial information to enhance the understanding of our GAAP financial information, and it should be considered by the reader in addition to, but not instead of, the financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP. Each non-GAAP financial measure is presented along with the corresponding GAAP measure so as not to imply that more emphasis should be placed on the non-GAAP measure. We believe that providing these non-GAAP measures in addition to the GAAP measures allows management, investors and other users of our financial information to more fully and accurately assess both consolidated and segment performance. The non-GAAP financial information presented may be determined or calculated differently by other companies and may not be directly comparable to that of other companies. Consolidated EBITDA Consolidated EBITDA is not a measure determined in accordance with GAAP and should not be considered a substitute for operating income, net income or any other measure determined in accordance with GAAP. Consolidated EBITDA is used as a measurement of operating efficiency and overall financial performance and we believe it is a helpful measure for those evaluating operating performance in relation to our competitors. Conceptually, EBITDA measures the amount of income generated each period that could be used to service debt, pay taxes and fund capital expenditures. EBITDA should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for measures of performance prepared in accordance with GAAP.

 Segment OIBDA Segment OIBDA, which is presented below, is a non-GAAP measure and does not purport to be an alternative to operating income (loss) as a measure of operating performance. We believe this measure is useful to management, investors and other users of our financial information in evaluating operating profitability of our business segments on a more variable cost basis as it excludes the depreciation and amortization expenses related primarily to capital expenditures and acquisitions for those business segments, as well as in evaluating operating performance in relation to our competitors. Segment OIBDA is calculated by adding back depreciation and amortization expense to business segments operating income (loss). See Note 10 to the Notes to our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for further information.

 Item 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURE S Conclusion regarding disclosure controls and procedures Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, we evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934) as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based upon that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of the end of the period covered by this report. Changes in internal control over financial reporting There has been no change in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934) during our most recent fiscal quarter that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. PART II OTHER INFORMATIO N Item 1. LEGAL PROCEEDING S See Note 9 Commitments and Contingencies Contingencies Litigation in the Notes to our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding certain legal proceedings in which we are involved. Item 1A. RISK FACTORS Item 1A, Risk Factors, of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 includes a detailed discussion of our risk factors. The information presented below updates, and should be read in conjunction with, the risk factors and information disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. Risks Relating to the DIRECTV Transaction Termination of the Purchase Agreement or failure to otherwise complete the DIRECTV Transaction could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Termination of the Purchase Agreement or any failure to otherwise complete the DIRECTV Transaction may result in various adverse consequences, including: our not being able to realize the anticipated benefits of the DIRECTV Transaction; our business being materially adversely impacted by the failure to pursue other beneficial opportunities due to the focus of management on the DIRECTV Transaction, without realizing any of the anticipated benefits of completing the DIRECTV Transaction; and negative reactions from the financial markets, respective customers and other stakeholders possibly related to the above. If any of the foregoing consequences were to occur as a result of termination of the Purchase Agreement, it could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

 The timing of the completion of the DIRECTV Transaction is not certain, and is subject to certain conditions, some of which we cannot control, which could result in the DIRECTV Transaction not being completed or being completed later than we expect, which could have a material adverse impact on our costs and revenues or otherwise reducing the anticipated benefits of the DIRECTV Transaction. Pursuant to the Purchase Agreement, the completion of the DIRECTV Transaction is subject to certain closing conditions, including, for example, the satisfaction of certain antitrust and other regulatory approvals and the successful exchange of DISH DBS Notes, none of which have been satisfied, and the absence of legal restraints prohibiting the completion of the DIRECTV Transaction. Governmental agencies may not approve the DIRECTV Transaction or may impose conditions to any such approval or require changes to the terms of the DIRECTV Transaction. Any such conditions or changes could have the effect of delaying completion of the DIRECTV Transaction, imposing costs on or limiting our revenues or otherwise reducing the anticipated benefits of the DIRECTV Transaction. Furthermore, under the Purchase Agreement, each party s obligation to consummate the DIRECTV Transaction is also subject to the accuracy of the representations and warranties of the other party (subject to certain qualifications and exceptions) and the performance in all material respects of the other party s covenants under the Purchase Agreement, including, with respect to us, certain covenants regarding the operation of our business prior to completion of the DIRECTV Transaction. As a result of these conditions, we cannot provide assurance that the DIRECTV Transaction will be completed on the terms or timeline currently contemplated, or at all. If such conditions are not fulfilled by the Outside Date or, if for any other reason, the DIRECTV Transaction is not completed on or prior to the Outside Date (as defined in the Purchase Agreement), the Purchase Agreement may be terminated and the DIRECTV Transaction may not be completed. There is no assurance that we will be able to obtain the required governmental and regulatory approvals to complete the DIRECTV Transaction, which, if delayed or not granted, is likely to delay or jeopardize the DIRECTV Transaction. The DIRECTV Transaction is conditioned on the expiration or termination of the applicable waiting period (or extension thereof) under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended, approval from the U.S. Federal Communications Commission FCC and possibly the consent of certain other merger control authorities and other governmental entities as set forth in the Purchase Agreement (collectively, Regulatory Approval ). These governmental and regulatory agencies have broad discretion in administering the applicable governing regulations. As a condition to their approval of the transactions contemplated by the Purchase Agreement, those agencies may impose requirements, limitations or costs or require divestitures or place restrictions on the conduct of our business. The required approvals may not be obtained or the required conditions to the DIRECTV Transaction may not be satisfied, or, even if the required approvals are obtained and the conditions to the completion of the DIRECTV Transaction are satisfied, the terms, conditions and timing of such approvals are uncertain. Any delay in completing the DIRECTV Transaction could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations. The DIRECTV Transaction is conditioned on the consummation of a pre-closing reorganization, which requires the completion of transfers of certain assets and liabilities between us and certain of our affiliates, which transfers may require consents from or approval of third parties. The Purchase Agreement is conditioned, among other things, upon the consummation of a pre-closing reorganization, which requires, among other things, that certain contracts and other assets, rights and liabilities are to be transferred between DISH DBS and certain of its affiliates in connection with the DIRECTV Transaction, as further described in the Purchase Agreement. The transfer of certain of these contracts and other assets, rights and liabilities may require consents or approvals of third parties or provide other rights to third parties. 

 101 

Table of Contents 
 Some parties may use consent requirements or other rights to terminate contracts or obtain more favorable contractual terms from us, which, for example, could take the form of price increases for services or assets that we require, forcing us and/or our affiliates to either expend additional resources in order to obtain the services or assets previously provided under the contracts or to make arrangements with new third parties. If we do not obtain required consents or approvals, the DIRECTV Transaction may not be completed, or, if completed, we may not be reflective of the currently intended DIRECTV Transaction and we may be required to seek alternative arrangements, which may not come on a timely basis or at all, or be more costly and/or of lower quality. The termination, modification, replacement or replication of these contracts or permits or the failure to timely complete the transfer or assignment of these contracts could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations and on the prospects for completion of the DIRECTV Transaction. We have and continue to incur substantial transaction-related costs in connection with the DIRECTV Transaction. If the DIRECTV Transaction does not occur, we will not benefit from these transaction related costs. We have incurred and will continue to incur a number of non-recurring costs associated with the completion of the DIRECTV Transaction and the satisfaction of the related closing conditions, which could be substantial. Nonrecurring transaction costs may include, but are not limited to, fees paid to legal, financial, consulting, investment banking and accounting advisors and costs incurred in connection with obtaining required consents or approvals from governmental authorities or contract counterparties. Such costs may be material and could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Furthermore, if the DIRECTV Transaction does not occur in a timely manner or at all, we may not be able to derive any benefit from such costs. The announcement and pendency of the DIRECTV Transaction could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations. The announcement and pendency of the DIRECTV Transaction could cause disruptions in and create uncertainty surrounding our business, including affecting our relationships with respective existing and future customers, suppliers, vendors and employees, which could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations, regardless of whether the DIRECTV Transaction is completed. In particular, we could potentially lose customers, suppliers or vendors, and new contracts with any of these third parties could be delayed, increased or decreased, and we may lose important personnel as a result of the departure of employees who decide to pursue other opportunities in light of the DIRECTV Transaction. Additionally, uncertainty about the completion and effect of the DIRECTV Transaction on our business, financial condition and results of operations may impair our ability to attract, retain and motivate personnel until the DIRECTV Transaction is completed. Employee retention may be particularly challenging during the pendency of the DIRECTV Transaction, as employees may feel uncertain about their future roles within each company after the completion of the DIRECTV Transaction. If such employees depart because of issues relating to the uncertainty relating to the DIRECTV Transaction or a desire not to continue to be employees of ours or DTV after the completion of the DIRECTV Transaction, this could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, we have expended, and continue to expend, significant management resources in an effort to complete the DIRECTV Transaction, which are being diverted from our day-to-day operations and future growth plans. In addition, the failure to complete the DIRECTV Transaction may result in negative publicity and/or a negative impression of us in the investment community and may affect our relationship with employees, customers and other partners in the business community.

 The Purchase Agreement subjects us to restrictions on our business activities prior to the completion of the DIRECTV Transaction. The Purchase Agreement subjects us and our subsidiaries, particularly DISH DBS, to restrictions on our business activities prior to the completion of the DIRECTV Transaction. The Purchase Agreement obligates us generally to, among other things, operate our Pay-TV business in the ordinary course until the completion of the DIRECTV Transaction and to use our commercially reasonable efforts to preserve a substantially intact business organizations, operations and goodwill of the business and maintain in all material respects commercial relationships. These restrictions on our business activities may adversely affect our ability to execute certain business strategies outside of the ordinary course of business, including paying dividends or making distributions, pursuing attractive business opportunities, making certain investments or acquisitions, hiring or terminating certain employees, selling, leasing, or licensing material real property, settling litigation matters, entering into certain material contracts, selling assets, engaging in capital expenditures, incurring indebtedness or making changes to its business. Such limitations could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations prior to the completion of the DIRECTV Transaction. The risks described above may be exacerbated by delays or other adverse developments with respect to the completion of the DIRECTV Transaction. For additional information, see the complete set of terms and conditions of the DIRECTV Transaction included in the Purchase Agreement. The Purchase Agreement also obligates us to, among other things, incur certain costs, make substantial investments in the Pay-TV business and take other actions, that absent the Purchase Agreement, we may or may not have taken. Absent certain exemptions in the Purchase Agreement, we are obligated to take such actions regardless if the DIRECTV Transaction is completed. These actions may be different than the historical manner in which we ran the business. As a holding company, we are dependent on the operations and funds of our subsidiaries. We are a holding company with no business operations of our own. Our only significant assets are the outstanding equity interests in our subsidiaries. As a result, we rely on cash flows from subsidiaries to meet our obligations, including to service any of our debt obligations. On September 30, 2024, we announced a sale of our Pay-TV business, from which we derive a substantial portion of our cash flow. With the sale of that business, and the interim operating covenants that restrict our access to that cash, we will be required to, among other things, sell our Pay-TV business and transfer at least 400 million of cash (subject to certain upward adjustments) to DTV upon closing of the DIRECTV Transaction and we are prevented from declaring any dividend or otherwise permitting any leakage in excess of 1.520 billion (subject to certain adjustments set forth in the Purchase Agreement, including transaction expenses and certain accrued interest adjustments and adjustments tied to certain key performance indicators) between the signing and closing of the DIRECTV Transaction. As a result, our ability to fund our Wireless business will be limited to by our cash flow from operations and ability to generate capital from our other businesses.
