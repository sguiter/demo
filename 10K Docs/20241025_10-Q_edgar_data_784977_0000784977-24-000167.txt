 square mile, State-approved service area, entirely within the State, encompasses incorporated cities. As of September 30, 2024, PGE served retail customers within a service area of 1.9 million residents. 
 
 PGE is subject to the jurisdiction of the Public Utility Commission of Oregon (OPUC) with respect to retail prices, utility services, accounting policies and practices, issuances of securities, and certain other matters. Retail prices are based on the Company s cost to serve customers, including an opportunity to earn a reasonable rate of return, as determined by the OPUC. The Company is also subject to regulation by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) in matters related to wholesale energy transactions, transmission services, reliability standards, natural gas pipelines, hydroelectric project licensing, accounting policies and practices, short-term debt issuances, and certain other matters. 
 
 Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements 
 
 , although PGE believes that the disclosures provided are adequate to make the interim information presented not misleading. 
 
 The financial information included herein as of and for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 is unaudited; however, in the opinion of management, such information reflects all adjustments necessary to fairly present the condensed consolidated financial position, condensed consolidated income and comprehensive income, and condensed consolidated cash flows of the Company for these interim periods. All such adjustments are of a normal recurring nature, unless otherwise noted. The financial information as of December 31, 2023 is derived from the Company s audited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto for the year ended December 31, 2023, included in Item 8 of PGE s Annual Report on Form 10-K, filed with the SEC on February 20, 2024, which should be read in conjunction with the interim unaudited Financial Statements. 
 
 Comprehensive Income 
 
 No material change occurred in Other comprehensive income in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023.

The remaining activity is comprised of million and million in other miscellaneous income in 2024 and 2023, respectively. 
 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, Miscellaneous income, net includes million and million in interest income from regulatory assets and million in realized and unrealized gains on the NQBP trust assets in both periods. The remaining activity is comprised of million and million in other miscellaneous income in 2024 and 2023, respectively. 
 
 Use of Estimates 
 
 The preparation of condensed consolidated financial statements in accordance with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, and disclosures of gain or loss contingencies, as of the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results experienced by the Company could differ materially from those estimates. 
 
 Certain costs are estimated for the full year and allocated to interim periods based on estimates of operating time expired, benefit received, or activity associated with the interim period; accordingly, such costs may not be reflective of amounts to be recognized for a full year. Due to seasonal fluctuations in electricity sales, as well as the price of wholesale electricity and natural gas, interim financial results do not necessarily represent those to be expected for the year. 
 
 Recent Accounting Pronouncements 
 
 In November 2023, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2023-07 Segment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures . ASU 2023-07 amends Topic 280 to improve reportable segment disclosure requirements, primarily through enhanced disclosures about significant segment expenses. For calendar year-end entities, the update will be effective for annual periods beginning on January 1, 2024, and interim periods within fiscal years beginning on January 1, 2025. Early adoption is permitted. PGE does not expect the adoption to have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements and has not early adopted the standard. 
 
 In December 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-09 Income Taxes (Topic 740): Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures . ASU 2023-09 amends Topic 740 to address requests to improve transparency about income tax information through improvements to income tax disclosures primarily related to the rate reconciliation and income taxes paid information. For calendar year-end entities, the update will be effective for annual periods beginning on January 1, 2025. Early adoption is permitted. PGE does not expect the adoption to have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements and does not plan to early adopt the standard.

Price risk management derivative activities are included within total revenues but do not represent revenues from contracts with customers as defined by GAAP. For further information, see Note 5, Risk Management. 
 
 Retail Revenues 
 
 The Company s primary revenue source is the sale of electricity to customers at regulated, tariff-based prices. Retail customers are classified as residential, commercial, or industrial. Residential customers include single-family housing, multiple-family housing (such as apartments, duplexes, and town homes), manufactured homes, and small farms. Residential demand is sensitive to the effects of weather, with demand highest during the winter heating and summer cooling seasons. Commercial customers consist of non-residential customers who accept energy deliveries at voltages equivalent to those delivered to residential customers and are also sensitive to the effects of weather, although to a lesser extent than residential customers. Commercial customers include most businesses, small industrial companies, and public street and highway lighting accounts. Industrial customers consist of non-residential customers who accept delivery at higher voltages than commercial customers. Demand from industrial customers is primarily driven by economic conditions, with weather having a less significant impact on energy use by this customer class. 
 
 In accordance with state regulations, PGE s retail customer prices are based on the Company s cost of service and determined through General Rate Case (GRC) proceedings and various tariff filings with the OPUC. Additionally, the Company offers pricing options that include a daily market price option, various time-of-use options, and several renewable energy options.

 million, including interest. PGE will reassess the earnings test, and the related impact to deferred amounts under this mechanism, based on actual return on equity for the year ending December 31, 2024. Actual results experienced by the Company could differ materially from current forecasts and estimates and could increase or decrease the final deferred balance after application of the earnings test. PGE believes the remaining amounts deferred as of September 30, 2024 are probable of recovery under the emergency deferral mechanism. The OPUC has significant discretion in making the final determination of recovery. The OPUC s conclusion of overall prudence, including application of the earnings test, could result in a portion, or all, of PGE s deferrals being disallowed for recovery. Such disallowance would be recognized as a charge to earnings. 
 
 Reliability contingency events As approved by the OPUC in PGE s 2024 GRC, the Reliability Contingency Event (RCE) mechanism allows PGE to defer and recover 80 of prudent costs for RCEs above amounts forecasted in the Company s Annual Power Cost Update Tariff, without application of an earnings test, with the remaining 20 flowing through operating expenses and subject to the existing power cost adjustment mechanism (PCAM). As of September 30, 2024, PGE s deferred balance related to RCEs was million, which includes costs from multiple qualified RCEs during the year. PGE files the results of the PCAM annually with the OPUC no later than July 1, initiating a regulatory review process that typically results in a final determination and order from the OPUC by the end of the year of filing, with any resulting refund or collection impacting customer prices effective January 1 of the following year. RCE costs incurred in 2024 will be included in the PCAM for 2024, which the Company expects to file no later than July 1, 2025. PGE believes the deferred amounts as of September 30, 2024 are probable of recovery. The OPUC has significant discretion in making the final determination of recovery. The OPUC s conclusion of overall prudence could result in a portion, or all, of PGE s deferrals being disallowed for recovery. Such disallowance would be recognized as a charge to earnings. 
 
 Wildfire Mitigation represents incremental costs and investments made by PGE related to efforts on its system to mitigate the risk of wildfire and improve resiliency to wildfire damage under Oregon Senate Bill 762, enacted in 2021. These efforts include enhanced tree and brush clearing, hardening and undergrounding equipment, and making emergency plans in close partnership with various land and emergency management agencies to further expand the use of a public safety power shutoff, when the risk warrants. In December 2023, PGE submitted its 2024 risk-based Wildfire Mitigation Plan, which was approved by the OPUC during the public meeting on July 9, 2024.

 million and 29 million, respectively. The 2024 balance is comprised of: 
 Pre-AAC Prior to establishing the collections noted below, PGE had deferred incremental costs related to wildfire mitigation and as of September 30, 2024 this balance is 10 million. On July 1, 2022, PGE filed an application for reauthorization of OPUC Docket UM 2019 to defer incremental wildfire mitigation costs that exceed the amount granted in base rates. On May 10, 2023, in Order No. 23-173, the OPUC approved an automatic adjustment clause mechanism to recover wildfire mitigation costs (capital and expense). PGE and certain parties agreed to a stipulation, which was adopted by the OPUC on October 18, 2023, that allowed PGE to begin amortizing 27 million comprised of 23 million related to the September 30, 2023 deferred operating expense balance of 31 million and 4 million for capital related revenue requirement. 
 2023 Base rates The outcome of PGE s 2022 GRC provided an annual amount of 24 million to be collected in base rates for recovery of operating expenses related to wildfire mitigation efforts beginning May 9, 2022, through December 31, 2023. As of September 30, 2024, there was 1 million in the balancing account. 
 2024 AAC Beginning January 1, 2024, and in conjunction with the Company s 2024 GRC proceeding, PGE removed the 24 million of wildfire mitigation operations and maintenance (O M) expense recovery from base rates, with the intent of recovering the current year forecasted O M expense within the automatic adjustment clause in a separate tariff. On February 16, 2024, PGE submitted an advice filing to the OPUC to update the tariff to reflect prospective wildfire mitigation costs for 2024, which included 45 million of O M expense and 4 million for the revenue requirement of capital placed in service. On July 23, 2024, the OPUC reached a decision that allowed PGE to begin collecting 24 million of O M expense and 4 million for the revenue requirement of capital placed in service. Collection will occur over a nine-month period, which began August 1, 2024. Although the approved amount of collections in 2024 is expected to be less than forecasted costs, PGE does not believe it is precluded from deferring such costs and believes they are prudently incurred and probable of recovery. Any differences between actual expense and customer collections will be recorded as regulatory assets or liabilities within the automatic adjustment clause balancing account, which will be subject to a prudence review, but will not be subject to an earnings test. As of September 30, 2024, there was 30 million deferred as a regulatory asset in the balancing account. 
 
 The OPUC has significant discretion in making the final determination of recovery. The OPUC s conclusion of overall prudence could result in a portion, or all, of PGE s deferrals being disallowed for recovery. Such disallowance would be recognized as a charge to earnings. 
 
 Clearwater RAC The RAC allows PGE to recover prudently incurred costs of renewable resources through filings made each year, outside of a GRC. Under the RAC, during 2023, the Company submitted a filing for Clearwater, which estimated the annual revenue requirement, net of net variable power costs (NVPC) benefits to be a refund to customers of approximately 30 million that would be included in customers prices June 1, 2024. Pursuant to the filing, PGE would defer the revenue requirement, net of NVPC benefits, from the in-service date of January 2024 until Clearwater was reflected in customer prices. On April 4, 2024, the OPUC rejected PGE and parties Stipulation regarding Clearwater and requested that PGE submit reply testimony responding to the arguments raised by the OPUC Staff by April 25, 2024. The OPUC issued an order on September 13, 2024 that further suspended the tariff effective date until March 1, 2025. As of September 30, 2024, the Company recorded a net million regulatory liability, which represents the deferred revenue requirement that PGE believes is probable of recovery, net of NVPC that is probable of refund to customers under the RAC. The OPUC has significant discretion on overall prudence and in making the final determination of recovery or refund. Any cost disallowance or increased refunds would be recognized as a charge to earnings.

 Credit Facilities 
 
 On September 10, 2024, PGE entered into an amendment of its existing revolving credit facility. As of September 30, 2024, PGE had a million revolving credit facility scheduled to expire in September 2029. The Company has the ability to expand the revolving credit facility to million, if needed, subject to the requirements of the agreement. Pursuant to the terms of the agreement, the revolving credit facility may be used for general corporate purposes, including as backup for commercial paper borrowings and to permit the issuance of standby letters of credit. PGE may borrow for one, three, or six months at a fixed interest rate established at the time of the borrowing, or at a variable interest rate for any period up to the then remaining term of the applicable credit facility. The revolving credit facility contains a provision that requires annual fees based on the Company s unsecured credit ratings, and contains customary covenants and default provisions, including a requirement that limits consolidated indebtedness, as defined in the agreement, to of total capitalization. As of September 30, 2024, PGE was in compliance with this covenant with a debt-to-total capital ratio and had no outstanding balance on the revolving credit facility. As a result of the policy to backup commercial paper borrowings, the aggregate unused available credit capacity under the credit facility was million. In addition, the credit facility offers the potential for adjustments to interest rate margins and fees based on PGE s achievement of certain annual sustainability-linked metrics related to its non-emitting generation capacity and the percentage of management comprised of women and employees who identify as black, indigenous, and people of color. The Company believes these potential adjustments will not have a material impact on PGE s results of operations. 
 
 The Company has a commercial paper program under which it may issue commercial paper for terms of up to 270 days. The Company has elected to limit its borrowings under the revolving credit facility in order to allow for coverage of any potential need to repay commercial paper that may be outstanding at the time. As of September 30, 2024, PGE had commercial paper outstanding. 

In addition, PGE has four letter of credit facilities that provide a total capacity of million under which the Company can request letters of credit for original terms not to exceed one year. The issuance of such letters of credit is subject to the approval of the issuing institution. Under these facilities, letters of credit for a total of million were outstanding as of September 30, 2024. Letters of credit issued are not reflected on the Company s condensed consolidated balance sheets. 
 
 Pursuant to an order issued by the FERC, the Company is authorized to issue short-term debt in an aggregate amount of up to million through February 6, 2026.

 Cash equivalents are highly liquid investments with maturities of three months or less at the date of acquisition and primarily consist of money market funds. Such funds seek to maintain a stable NAV and are comprised of short-term, government funds. Policies of such funds require that the weighted average maturity of securities holdings of such funds not exceed 90 days and provide investors with the ability to redeem shares of the funds daily at their respective NAV. Cash equivalents are classified as Level 1 in the fair value hierarchy due to the availability of quoted prices for identical assets in an active market as of the measurement date. Principal markets for money market fund prices include published exchanges such as the National Association of Securities Dealers Automated Quotations (Nasdaq) and the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE).

 The significant unobservable inputs used in the Company s fair value measurement of price risk management assets and liabilities are long-term forward prices for commodity derivatives. For certain long-term contracts, observable, liquid market transactions are not available for the duration of the delivery period. In such instances, the Company uses internally-developed long-term price curves that utilize observable data when available. When not available, regression techniques are used to estimate unobservable future prices. 
 
 The Company s Level 3 assets and liabilities from price risk management activities are sensitive to market price changes in the respective underlying commodities. The significance of the impact is dependent upon the magnitude of the price change and PGE s position as either the buyer or seller under the contract. Sensitivity of the fair value measurements to changes in the significant unobservable inputs is as follows: 
 
 Significant Unobservable Input Position Change to Input Impact on Fair Value Market price Buy Increase (decrease) Gain (loss) Market price Sell Increase (decrease) Loss (gain)

 PGE s secured and unsecured debt is currently rated at investment grade by Moody s Investors Service (Moody s) and S P Global Ratings (S P). Should Moody s or S P reduce their rating on the Company s unsecured debt to below investment grade, PGE could be subject to requests by certain wholesale counterparties to post additional performance assurance collateral, in the form of cash or letters of credit, based on total portfolio positions with each of those counterparties. Certain other counterparties would have the right to terminate their agreements with the Company. 
 
 The aggregate fair value of derivative instruments with credit-risk-related contingent features that were in a liability position as of September 30, 2024 was million, for which PGE has posted million in collateral, consisting of million of letters of credit and million of cash. If the credit-risk-related contingent features underlying these agreements were triggered at September 30, 2024, the cash requirement to either post as collateral or settle the instruments immediately would have been million. As of September 30, 2024, PGE had million cash collateral posted for derivative instruments with no credit-risk-related contingent features. Cash collateral for derivative instruments is classified as Margin deposits included in Other current assets on the Company s condensed consolidated balance sheets.

 PGE is exposed to credit risk in its commodity price risk management activities related to potential nonperformance by counterparties. Credit risk may be concentrated to the extent the Company s counterparties have similar economic, industry or other characteristics and due to direct or indirect relationships among the counterparties. PGE manages the risk of counterparty default according to its credit policies by performing financial credit reviews, setting limits and monitoring exposures, and requiring collateral (in the form of cash, letters of credit, and guarantees) when needed. The Company also uses standardized enabling agreements and, in certain cases, master netting agreements, which allow for the netting of positive and negative exposures under multiple agreements with counterparties.

EPA Investigation of Portland Harbor 
 
 An investigation by the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) of a segment of the Willamette River known as Portland Harbor that began in 1997 revealed significant contamination of river sediments. The EPA subsequently included Portland Harbor on the National Priority List pursuant to the federal Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act as a federal Superfund site. PGE has been included among more than Potentially Responsible Parties (PRPs), as it historically owned or operated property near the river. 
 
 A Portland Harbor site remedial investigation was completed pursuant to an agreement between the EPA and several PRPs known as the Lower Willamette Group (LWG), which did not include PGE. The LWG funded the remedial investigation and feasibility study and stated that it had incurred million in investigation-related costs. The Company anticipates that such costs will ultimately be allocated to PRPs as a part of the allocation process for remediation costs of the EPA s preferred remedy. 
 
 The EPA finalized a feasibility study, along with the remedial investigation, and the results provided the framework for the EPA to determine a clean-up remedy for Portland Harbor that was documented in a Record of Decision (ROD) issued in 2017. The ROD outlined the EPA s selected remediation plan for clean-up of Portland Harbor that had an undiscounted estimated total cost of billion, comprised of billion related to remediation construction costs and billion related to long-term operation and maintenance costs. Remediation construction costs were estimated to be incurred over a 13-year period, with long-term operation and maintenance costs estimated to be incurred over a 30-year period from the start of construction. Stakeholders have raised concerns that the EPA s cost estimates are understated, and PGE estimates undiscounted total remediation costs for Portland Harbor per the ROD could range from billion to billion. The EPA acknowledged the estimated costs were based on data that was outdated and that pre-remedial design sampling was necessary to gather updated baseline data to better refine the remedial design and estimated cost. 
 
 A small group of PRPs performed pre-remedial design sampling to update baseline data and submitted the data in an updated evaluation report to the EPA for review. The evaluation report concluded that the conditions of Portland Harbor have improved substantially with the passage of time. In response, the EPA indicated that while it would use the data to inform implementation of the ROD, the EPA s conclusions remained materially unchanged. With the completion of pre-remedial design sampling, Portland Harbor is now in the remedial design phase, which consists of additional technical information and data collection to be used to design the expected remedial actions. Certain PRPs, not including PGE, have entered into consent agreements to perform remedial design and the EPA has indicated it will take the initial lead to perform remedial design on the remaining areas. The Company anticipates that remedial design costs will ultimately be allocated to PRPs as a part of the allocation process for remediation

 million, excluding expenses related to contingent liabilities, are subject to an annual earnings test and would be ineligible for recovery to the extent PGE s actual regulated return on equity exceeds its return on equity as authorized by the OPUC in PGE s most recent GRC. PGE s results of operations may be impacted to the extent such expenditures are deemed imprudent by the OPUC or ineligible per the prescribed earnings test. The Company plans to seek recovery of any costs resulting from EPA s determination of liability for Portland Harbor through application of the PHERA. At this time, PGE is not collecting any Portland Harbor cost from the PHERA through customer prices.

OVERVIEW 
 
 Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (MD A) is intended to provide an understanding of the business environment, results of operations, and financial condition of PGE. MD A should be read in conjunction with the Company s condensed consolidated financial statements contained in this report, and other periodic and current reports filed with the SEC. 
 
 PGE is a vertically-integrated electric utility engaged in the generation, transmission, distribution, and retail sale of electricity. The Company participates in wholesale markets by purchasing and selling electricity, natural gas, and environmental credits in an effort to meet the needs of, and obtain reasonably-priced power for, its retail customers, manage risk, and administer its long-term wholesale contracts. In addition, PGE continues to develop products and service offerings for the benefit of retail and wholesale customers. The Company generates revenues and cash flows primarily from the sale and distribution of electricity to retail customers in its service territory in the State of Oregon (State). 
 
 Company Strategy 
 
 The Company exists to power the advancement of society. PGE energizes lives, strengthens communities, and fosters energy solutions that promote social, economic, and environmental progress. The Company is committed to being a clean energy leader and delivering steady growth and returns to shareholders. PGE is focused on working with customers, communities, policy makers, and other stakeholders to deliver affordable, safe, reliable electricity service to all, while increasing opportunities to deliver clean and renewable energy, reducing GHG emissions, and responding to evolving customer expectations. At the same time, the Company is building an increasingly smart, integrated, and interconnected grid that spans from residential customers to other utilities within the region. PGE is transforming all aspects of its business to empower its workforce to be even more results oriented to serve customers well. To create a clean energy future, PGE is focused on the following strategic imperatives: 
 Decarbonize Power Reduce GHG emissions associated with electricity served to retail customers by at least 80 by 2030 and 100 by 2040; 
 Electrify the Economy Increase beneficial electricity use to capture the benefits of new technologies while building an increasingly clean, flexible, and reliable grid; and 
 Advance Performance Improve safety, efficiency, and system and equipment reliability while maintaining affordable energy service and growing earnings per share 5 to 7 annually. 
 
 Climate Change 
 
 State-mandated GHG emissions reduction targets In 2021, the Oregon legislature passed House Bill (HB) 2021, establishing a 100 clean electricity by 2040 framework for PGE and other investor-owned utilities and electric service suppliers in the State. A number of provisions in the bill align with PGE s strategic direction and highlight Oregon s ambitious, economy-wide goals to combat climate change. The GHG emissions reduction targets applicable to these regulated entities are an 80 reduction in GHG emissions by 2030, 90 by 2035, and 100 by 
 37 

Table of Contents 

 2040 and every year thereafter. For more information regarding HB 2021 and the baseline to which the target reductions apply, see HB 2021 in the Laws and Regulations section of this Overview. 
 
 Empowering customers and communities PGE s customers have a desire for purchasing clean energy, as over 230 thousand residential and small commercial customers voluntarily participate in PGE s Green Future Program, the largest renewable power program by participation in the nation. In 2017, Oregon s most populous city, Portland, and most populous county, Multnomah, each passed resolutions to achieve 100 clean and renewable electricity by 2035 and 100 economy-wide clean and renewable energy by 2050. Other jurisdictions in PGE s service area have similar goals and continue to consider similar goals for the future. 
 
 The Company implemented a customer subscription option, the Green Future Impact Program, which is a renewable energy program that allows large business and municipality customers to have a choice in how they source their electricity. Under the Green Future Impact Program, customers can enroll in a Customer-Supplied Option (CSO) or PGE-Supplied Option (PSO). Under the CSO, participants are responsible for finding a renewable energy facility that meets established requirements and bringing those resources to PGE. Under the PSO, customers who enrolled in Phase I can receive energy from PGE-provided purchased power agreements (PPAs) for renewable resources and customers who enroll in Phase II can receive energy either from PGE-provided PPAs for renewable resources or energy from renewable resources that are PGE owned, under certain conditions. 
 
 As of September 30, 2024, the Green Future Impact Program has an approved capacity of 750 megawatts (MW) nameplate, of which 482 megawatts (MW) have been subscribed. Through this voluntary program, the Company seeks to support customers clean energy acceleration. 
 
 The Climate Pledge In 2021, PGE joined The Climate Pledge, a commitment to be net-zero annual carbon emissions by 2040, which is a decade ahead of the Paris Agreement s goal of 2050. As a signatory to The Climate Pledge, the Company agrees to: i) measure and report GHG emissions on a regular basis; ii) implement decarbonization strategies in line with the Paris Agreement through real business changes and innovations, including efficiency improvements, renewable energy, materials reductions, and other carbon emission elimination strategies; and iii) neutralize any remaining emissions with additional, quantifiable, real, permanent, and socially-beneficial offsets. 
 
 Severe weather In recent years, PGE s service territory has experienced unprecedented heat, historic ice and snowstorms, and wildfires. Beginning January 13, 2024, the Company s service territory encountered a severe winter weather event, including snow, ice, and high winds that caused catastrophic damage to physical assets and resulted in widespread customer power outages. For more information regarding the January 2024 severe winter weather event, see Declared States of Emergency within this Overview section. In August 2023 the region experienced a record-breaking heat wave with temperatures reaching all-time recorded highs for the month. This resulted in a peak load demand of 4,498 MW, exceeding the Company s previous all-time peak load demand, and surpassing the prior summer peak load by nearly 6 . The increase and severity of weather events highlights the importance of combating the effects of climate change through decarbonizing the power supply and investing in a more reliable and resilient grid. 
 
 Investing in a Clean Energy Future 
 
 Resource Planning Process PGE s resource planning process includes working with customers, stakeholders, and regulators to chart the course toward a clean, affordable, and reliable energy future. With the passage of HB 2021, PGE created a Clean Energy Plan (CEP), which articulates the Company s strategy to meet the 2030, 2035, and 2040 emission reduction targets through an equitable transition to a decarbonized grid. The CEP is based on, and was filed in connection with, the Company s 2023 Integrated Resource Plan (IRP). PGE filed its first combined IRP and CEP with the OPUC in March 2023. That filing projected PGE s resource and capacity needs over the next

 20 years and proposed an Action Plan to meet near-term needs, subject to the HB 2021 emissions reduction requirements. 
 
 PGE estimates a total resource need of approximately 3,500 to 4,500 MW of renewable energy and non-emitting capacity in order to meet the Company s 2030 emissions reduction target. Through the 2021 All-Source Request for Proposals (RFP), PGE procured 311 MW of wind resources and 475 MW of capacity, leaving a remaining need to procure approximately 2,700 to 3,700 MW. 
 
 The OPUC declined to acknowledge the CEP, directing the Company to provide additional forecast of its emission reductions based on new analysis in the combined CEP/IRP Update to be filed in the first quarter of 2025. PGE has continued to pursue its 2023 All-Source RFP while revising forecasts of emissions in the CEP. 
 
 2021 and 2023 All-Source RFPs 
 
 Pursuant to the 2021 All-Source RFP process, which sought approximately 1,000 MW of renewable resources and non-emitting dispatchable capacity, PGE entered into agreements to acquire resources as follows: 
 Clearwater Wind Development (Clearwater) PGE and NextEra Energy Resources, LLC, a subsidiary of NextEra Energy, Inc. entered into agreements to construct a 311 MW wind energy facility in Eastern Montana. PGE owns 208 MW of production capacity of the facility. Subsidiaries of NextEra Energy Resources, LLC, which operates the facility, owns the remaining 103 MW of production capacity and sells their portion of the output to PGE under a 30-year PPA. The company owned portion of the facility was placed in-service during the first quarter of 2024. As of September 30, 2024, the Company has recorded 418 million in Electric Utility Plant, net, including Allowance for funds used during construction (AFUDC). 
 Seaside Grid PGE entered into an agreement to construct a 200 MW Battery Energy Storage System (BESS) in Portland, Oregon. PGE will own the resource, with an investment of approximately 360 million, excluding AFUDC. The project has an estimated commercial operation date of June 30, 2025. As of September 30, 2024, the Company has recorded 165 million, including AFUDC, in construction work-in-progress (CWIP) for the Seaside Grid. 
 Constable BESS (formerly Evergreen) PGE entered into an agreement to construct a 75 MW BESS in Hillsboro, Oregon. PGE will own the resource, with an investment of approximately 150 million, excluding AFUDC. The project has an estimated commercial operation date of December 31, 2024. As of September 30, 2024, the Company has recorded 127 million, including AFUDC, in CWIP for the Constable BESS. 
 Sundial BESS (formerly Troutdale Grid) PGE entered into a storage capacity agreement for a 200 MW BESS in Troutdale, Oregon. NextEra Energy Resources, LLC, will own the resource and will sell the capacity to PGE under a 20-year storage capacity agreement. The project has an estimated commercial operation date of December 31, 2024. 
 
 The Clearwater agreements and all BESS agreements represent the final procurement from the 2021 All-Source RFP. Resources required to meet the remaining 2030 need are anticipated to be procured through future acquisition processes, including, but not limited to, the 2023 All-Source RFP and future RFPs. 
 
 All BESS facilities will be directly interconnected to PGE s transmission and distribution system. In the event emissions are associated with energy obtained to charge the BESS, they are accounted for when they are emitted from the generating facility. As such, BESS facilities do not add incremental emissions to the grid, and therefore, are non-emitting dispatchable capacity resources. The BESS facilities will qualify for the federal investment tax credit (ITC). The Clearwater agreements qualify for production tax credits (PTCs) and are eligible under Oregon s Renewable Portfolio Standard (RPS). The agreements will be subject to prudency review by the OPUC.

PGE filed notice with the OPUC in January 2023 that an RFP was needed to procure resources to meet forecasted capacity shortfalls and to make continued progress toward decarbonization targets under HB 2021. These actions were consistent with the 2023 IRP Action Plan. PGE filed the draft 2023 All-Source RFP with the OPUC in May 2023 and regulatory approval was granted in January 2024. The Company issued the 2023 All-Source RFP to market in February 2024, seeking bids for resources that can provide non-emitting dispatchable capacity and renewable generation. 
 
 After a robust and competitive bidding process performed in accordance with Oregon's competitive bidding rules, and with the active participation of, and oversight by, an OPUC-selected third-party independent evaluator, on September 17, 2024, PGE submitted a request for acknowledgement of the final shortlist of bidders to the OPUC. On October 7, 2024, the Company filed notification that one project on the final shortlist was no longer available. 
 
 PGE constructed the final short list to provide optionality and address the Company s future capacity need. The Company ranked the final shortlist in two groups, prioritized based on performance in the RFP price scoring evaluation, representing the optimal intersection of value to customers at the least-cost and the least-risk. These two groups together represent the final shortlist of projects recommended for regulatory acknowledgement, as follows: 
 Group A, as shown below, now consists of three bids that are top performing and PGE expects to enter commercial negotiation for all of these projects. Group A includes 375 megawatts (MW) nameplate of renewable resources and 400 MW nameplate of battery storage; and 
 Group B, as shown below, consists of five bids, all of which represent capacity options via BESS facilities. These projects are also high performing and PGE may enter commercial negotiations with some or all of these projects, allowing flexibility to address any remaining capacity need. Group B includes 885 MW nameplate of battery storage. 
 
 The proposals for renewable resources provide various combinations of solar and battery storage options that include PPAs along with Company-owned resources via Build Transfer Agreements (BTA). The proposals for non-emitting dispatchable capacity resources provide battery storage options that include PPAs along with Company-owned resources via BTAs.

RFP final shortlist projects were evaluated and selected based on conditions as of the final shortlist date and are subject to risks and uncertainties, including, but not limited to, regulatory processes, inflationary impacts, supply chain constraints, supply cost increases (including the application of trade tariffs), and legislative uncertainty. 
 
 Additional details of the 2023 RFP (OPUC Docket UM 2274) are available on the OPUC website at www.oregon.gov/puc. 
 
 Both the 2021 and 2023 RFPs are the subject of regulatory and legal challenges initiated by NewSun Energy LLC, focused on the scoring methodology of the RFPs and OPUC acknowledgement of the final shortlists. PGE has joined these proceedings as an intervenor, and the challenges are in various stages of litigation or regulatory review. PGE cannot predict the outcome of these proceedings or potential impact, if any, to either its 2021 or 2023 All-Source RFP processes. 
 
 Transmission Upgrades 
 
 In alignment with local and regional transmission plans, the 2023 IRP Action Plan, and CEP, PGE is evaluating and implementing upgrades to existing transmission resources and expansions of current transmission networks. Transmission resource actions are intended to alleviate congestion, improve regional adequacy and reliability, enable decarbonization goals, increase access to renewable generation, and address growing customer demand. 
 
 On May 28, 2024, PGE signed a non-binding memorandum of understanding in the development of the North Plains Connector, an approximately 415-mile, high-voltage direct-current (HVDC) transmission line to be constructed with endpoints near Bismarck, North Dakota and Colstrip, Montana. The parties have entered negotiations with the U.S. DOE to finalize the project objectives, terms, and conditions, including the Company s participation, which is expected to involve a 20 ownership share of the approximately 3.2 billion total investment of the project. On August 6, 2024, the project was awarded a 700 million grant from the U.S. Department of Energy s Grid Resilience and Innovation Partnerships program to further support its development and would reduce the overall total investment of the project. 
 
 The North Plains Connector would be the nation s first HVDC transmission connection among three regional U.S. electric energy markets, providing additional flexibility and the sharing of resources across multiple time zones. The transmission line would provide PGE with 600 MW of transfer capacity, access to diverse energy resources, and enhanced wholesale markets, and ease congestion on the existing western transmission system. 
 
 The U.S. DOE selected the Confederated Tribes of Warm Springs (CTWS), in partnership with PGE, for a 250 million grant to upgrade the existing 230 kV Bethel-Round Butte Transmission line to 500 kV. The project will accelerate the development of transmission capacity, enabling new carbon-free generation in Central and Eastern Oregon to reach customer demand loads in Western Oregon. The added capacity and associated upgrades will also increase resiliency of the transmission system as well as resiliency of the CTWS communities by increasing resources available to CTWS to support adaptation and response strategies. See Federal Grants in this Overview for further discussion. 
 
 Building a resilient grid To serve communities with clean energy, PGE s grid of the future will need to be smart and adaptive. Highlights of PGE s key investments and plans for building a resilient grid include: 
 Wildfire Mitigation PGE has a Wildfire Mitigation Program under which an annual Wildfire Mitigation Plan (WMP) is developed and submitted to the OPUC, as required by State law, to coordinate activities across the Company and with State-wide stakeholders. The 2024 WMP forecasts 45 million in operations and maintenance costs and an additional 43 to 49 million in capital investments in the current year to continue system hardening efforts, expand situational awareness capabilities, implement specific inspection 
 41

 and maintenance along with vegetation management, raise community and customer awareness, and take operational actions within high fire risk zones. PGE strives to improve regional safety by reducing the risk that the Company s electric utility infrastructure could cause a wildfire, while limiting the impacts of PSPS events and other mitigation activities on customers and increasing the resiliency of PGE assets to wildfire damage. In the nine months ended September 30, 2024, PGE invested 30 million in capital projects related to wildfire mitigation and resiliency and utility asset management, consistent with the 2024 WMP. 
 Virtual Power Plant (VPP) PGE s VPP is a production resource comprised of Distributed Energy Resources (DERs) and flexible loads that are managed through technology platforms to provide grid and power operations services. PGE s customer offerings related flexible load programs, rooftop solar, battery storage, and electric vehicle (EV) charging solutions support grid reliability and increase portfolio flexibility and resource diversity. These DERs and flexible loads are the foundation of PGE s VPP that will provide a growing suite of grid and system services over time. When coordinated through the Company s DER Management Systems, the various DERs and flexible loads support cost-effective decarbonization, advance customer and community energy resiliency, promote customer engagement with the energy system, and unlock additional grid services that enhance PGE s operation of a dynamic two-way system. Customer participation in the VPP helps avoid customer service interruptions and reduces exposure to scarcity pricing in energy markets. On August 14, 2023, customer actions, orchestrated through the VPP, reduced load by more than 90 MW. On July 8, 2024, increased participation reduced load by more than 100 MW. As their participation in PGE s VPP grows, customer actions provide increasing benefit and help avoid customer service interruptions and reduce exposure to scarcity pricing in energy markets. 
 Distribution System Plan (DSP) In 2021 and 2022, PGE filed its inaugural DSP in two parts, which were accepted by the OPUC in March 2022 and February 2023, respectively. While the OPUC Staff finalizes their review of potential modifications to the current DSP guidelines, PGE plans to file its next DSP in the fourth quarter of 2024. The DSP outlines distribution system assets, describes how the Company plans for new load, including distributed resources such as EVs and Solar Photovoltaic installations, and presents the vision for modernizing the grid to enable accelerated decarbonization and customer participation in meeting PGE s clean energy goals. 
 
 Electrify the economy To help Oregon reach its decarbonization goals, PGE is working to build a safe, reliable, and affordable, economy-wide, clean energy future. The Company is committed to increasing electrification of buildings and supports the accelerating pace of vehicle electrification for our customers, as well as its own vehicle fleet. 
 
 Transportation electrification (TE) is one of the most significant ways to reduce GHG emissions in Oregon. PGE is engaged with customers and communities to manage EV charging load, develop infrastructure projects aimed at improving accessibility to EV charging stations, build fleet partnerships, and offer programs to encourage customers to advance transportation electrification. 
 
 In 2021, the Oregon legislature enacted HB 2165, ensuring the OPUC has clear and broad authority to allow electric company investments in infrastructure to support TE. 
 
 In 2023, PGE s second TE plan was filed and accepted by the OPUC. This second TE plan considers current and planned activities, along with forecasted EV loads and potential system impacts. The 2023 TE plan represents a continuation of the approach and programmatic efforts found within PGE s 2019 TE plan while also outlining the Company s current strategy to integrate TE into utility business in order to plan, service, and manage EV load. 
 
 In the 2023 to 2025 period covered by the 2023 TE plan, capital expenditures are expected to be approximately 25 million. The final 2023 TE plan with its planned activities was accepted by the OPUC on October 17, 2023.

 Businesses and families continue to turn to electricity to serve their home and workplace needs. PGE continues to pursue advanced technologies to enhance the grid, pursue distributed generation and energy storage, and develop microgrids and the use of data and analytics to better predict demand and support energy-saving customer programs. 
 
 Laws and Regulations 
 
 Federal Grants In November 2021, the 1.2 trillion Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (IIJA), which includes approximately 550 billion of new federal spending, was signed into law. PGE continues to pursue multiple areas under the IIJA, and other state, federal, and private programs, for potential grant funding of projects. These projects target improvements in electrical system reliability and resiliency, wildfire situational awareness and mitigation, greater communications capabilities, advancements in customer usage analytics using artificial intelligence, renewable resources and advanced electrical grid support, hydro generation operations, hydrogen production, utility workforce development, and regional transmission capacity constraints. 
 
 As of September 30, 2024, PGE has been associated with the submission of 42 grant applications as the Prime or Sub-recipient/Supporter and has been awarded 16 grants totaling 319 million, including the following: 
 U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) Bethel-Round Butte Transmission Line Upgrade The U.S. DOE selected the Confederated Tribes of Warm Springs (CTWS), in partnership with PGE, for a 250 million grant to upgrade the existing 230 kV Bethel-Round Butte Transmission line to 500 kV. The U.S DOE, CTWS, and PGE are negotiating the final funding and scope for the line upgrade as part of a multi-year process. See Transmission Upgrades in this Overview for further discussion. 
 U.S. DOE Grid Edge Devices The U.S. DOE selected a PGE led consortium for a 50 million grant for the Grid Edge Devices project. The project will enable real-time information at each meter to improve the visibility of the electrical system to grid operators, providing detection of potential operational problems and shorten outage times, ultimately helping to anticipate and mitigate the impacts of extreme weather on grid resiliency. 
 
 PGE is in the process of assessing the impacts of these federal grants on the Company s financial position and results of operations. Although PGE continues to apply for additional grants, the Company cannot predict the ultimate timing and success of securing funding from federal programs. 
 
 Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 The Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (IRA) was signed into law in 2022 with a majority of the provisions effective for tax years beginning after December 31, 2022. 
 
 The United States Treasury and the Internal Revenue Service released extensive rules addressing credit transfer eligibility and application, including but not limited to, required registration, filing, and documentation for transferors and transferees to elect and claim a credit transfer. In December 2023, PGE received approval from the OPUC to transfer 2023 PTCs and record any difference between the full value and the discounted value in a property balancing account. Consistent with options available under the IRA, the Company transferred 2023 credits with the final transfer occurring in the first quarter of 2024. On April 16, 2024, PGE received approval from the OPUC to transfer 2024 and 2025 PTCs and record any difference between the full value and the discounted value in a property balancing account. PGE has entered into an agreement to transfer 2024 and 2025 PTCs and expects to generate and transfer approximately 58 million in PTCs in 2024. 
 
 Compared to previous resource planning processes, the Company believes the new tax incentives will provide additional investment opportunities for PGE and result in lower customer prices. Increased capital expenditures in such investment opportunities would likely result in additional financing needs through debt and equity instruments.

HB 2021 Among other things, HB 2021 requires retail electricity providers to reduce GHG emissions associated with serving Oregon retail electricity consumers 80 by 2030, 90 by 2035, and 100 by 2040, compared to baseline emissions levels, which for PGE, is calculated by using average annual emissions for the years 2010 through 2012. 
 
 HB 2021 requires utilities to develop a CEP for meeting the targets, concurrent with each IRP, that results in an affordable, reliable, and clean electric system. In reviewing a CEP, the OPUC must ensure that utilities create a plan that is in the public interest, demonstrate continual progress toward meeting the targets, and take actions as soon as practicable that facilitate rapid reduction of GHG emissions. 
 
 A law adopted in 2009 requires retail electricity providers to annually report to the Oregon Department of Environmental Quality (ODEQ) the GHG emissions associated with electricity used to serve retail customers. In the target years of 2030, 2035, and 2040, and every year thereafter in the target period, the OPUC will use the data reported to the ODEQ for that compliance year to determine whether the reduction targets are met under HB 2021. 
 
 RPS standards and related laws In 2016, Oregon Senate Bill (SB) 1547 increased the 2007 benchmarks for the percentage of electricity that must come from renewable sources by dates certain and required the elimination of coal as a fuel for generation of electricity used to serve Oregon utility customers no later than 2030. 
 
 The Company has a 20 ownership share in Colstrip Units 3 and 4 coal-fired generation plant (Colstrip) and, in response to SB 1547, has accelerated depreciation of Colstrip to December 31, 2025. In order to meet PGE s regulatory and legislative requirements, the Company continues to evaluate the possibility of exiting ownership in Colstrip. See Note 8, Contingencies, in the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 1. Financial Statements for information regarding legal proceedings related to Colstrip. 
 
 Any reduction in generation from Colstrip has the potential to provide additional capacity availability on the Colstrip transmission facilities, which stretch from eastern Montana to near the western end of that state to serve markets in the Pacific Northwest and neighboring states. PGE has an approximate 15 ownership interest in, and capacity on, the Colstrip transmission facilities. See Investing in a Clean Energy Future in this Overview for information regarding development in eastern Montana. 
 
 Other provisions of SB 1547: 
 established RPS thresholds of 27 by 2025, 35 by 2030, 45 by 2035, and 50 by 2040; 
 limited the life of renewable energy credits (RECs) generated from facilities that become operational after 2022 to five years, but continue unlimited lifespan for all existing RECs and allow for the generation of additional unlimited RECs for a period of five years for projects online before December 31, 2022; and 
 provided opportunity to pursue recovery of energy storage costs related to renewable energy in the Company s Renewable Adjustment Clause (RAC) filings. 
 PGE believes it is on track to meet the 2025 RPS threshold. 
 
 EPA Regulations for Electric Generating Facilities On April 25, 2024, the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) released final regulations pertaining to electric generation facilities. The regulations include: 
 GHG regulations for new natural gas-based turbines and existing coal-based units, pursuant to section 111 of the Clean Air Act (CAA). The rule finaliz es: i) gui delines for GHG emissions from existing fossil fuel-fired steam generating electric generating units; and ii) revisions to existing performance standards for new, reconstructed, or heavily modified fossil fuel-fired stationary combustion turbine electric generating units. 
 44 

Table of Contents 

 Supplemental Effluent Limitations Guidelines and Standards for the Steam Electric Power Generating Point Source Category (the ELG Rule), which applies to wastewater discharges from coal-based generating units and establishes pollution control requirements, building upon the 2015 and 2020 ELG Rules. The rule includes a subcategory of requirements for coal plants that will be retired or repowered by the end of 2028 and provides additional compliance pathways for coal plants that retire by the end of 2034. 
 Updated Mercury and Air Toxics Standards, pursuant to section 112 of the CAA, which sets emissions limits for filterable particulate matter for coal-based generating units. The rule reduces those limits from the standards that were originally set in 2012. 
 
 PGE continues to evaluate each of these rules to assess the impact it may have on the Company s continuing investment in Colstrip, which could be material. PGE notes that a substantial number of legal challenges have been filed regarding these rules. These challenges, if successful, could affect the applicability to PGE and Colstrip specifically. To the extent these regulations result in increased compliance costs, the Company expects to seek recovery of those costs through the ratemaking process. 
 
 In addition, the regulations included Disposal of Coal Combustion Residuals (CCR) from Electric Utilities Legacy CCR Surface Impoundments. This rule builds on 2015 regulations, which apply to active power plants that dispose of coal combustion residuals in surface impoundments or landfills, by regulating inactive surface impoundments at inactive power plants, and CCR management units at active and inactive power plants. PGE has assessed the potential impact of the CCR regulation changes and believes it will not hav e a material im pact on the Company s current Asset Retirement Obligations. 
 
 Regulatory Matters 
 
 PGE focuses on providing reliable, clean power to customers at affordable prices while providing a fair return to investors. To achieve this goal the Company must execute effectively within its regulatory framework and maintain prudent management of key financial, regulatory, and environmental matters that may affect customer prices and investor returns. The following discussion provides detail on such matters. 
 
 General Rate Case On February 29, 2024, PGE filed with the OPUC a General Rate Case (GRC) based on a 2025 test year (2025 GRC) that seeks a 225 million increase in the annual revenue requirement related primarily to recovery of costs associated with non-emitting battery projects, an increase in base business costs for upgrades to PGE's transmission and distribution system, and investments in strengthening and safeguarding the grid to meet growing customer demand and bolster reliability. PGE continues to build a stronger grid designed to withstand severe weather and allow energy to flow from more resources to improve reliability, resiliency, and capability to deliver safe, dependable, clean electricity to customers. The total increase in annual revenue requirement includes an increase of 37 million as a result of higher net variable power costs expected in 2025, reflected in the Annual Power Cost Update Tariff (AUT) also filed, separately, with the OPUC February 29, 2024 (OPUC Docket UE 436). The net variable power costs (NVPC) projection will be updated periodically during 2024. 
 
 Other key items in the 2025 GRC filing include requests for a Renewable Automatic Adjustment Clause mechanism for standalone energy storage and an investment recovery mechanism. 
 
 The proposed net increase in annual revenue requirement in the 2025 GRC was based upon a: 
 capital structure of 50 debt and 50 equity; 
 return on equity of 9.75 ; 
 cost of capital of 7.189 ; and 
 rate base of 7.5 billion.

PGE and parties continue to work through the 2025 GRC as regulatory review is expected to continue throughout 2024. The Company cannot predict the ultimate outcome of the remaining regulatory process. A final order on the 2025 GRC is targeted to be issued by the OPUC by the end of 2024, with new customer prices to take effect January 1, 2025. 
 
 The 2025 GRC filing (OPUC Docket UE 435) and the 2025 AUT filing, including copies of direct testimony and exhibits, are available on the OPUC website at www.oregon.gov/puc. 
 
 Declared states of emergency Beginning January 13, 2024, the Company s service territory encountered a severe winter weather event that included snow, ice, and high winds over several days that caused catastrophic damage to physical assets and resulted in widespread customer power outages. Along with over a dozen mutual assistance crews, PGE repaired damage and restored power to more than 500,000 customers throughout the storm and the days that followed. 
 
 As a result of the historic winter storm, Oregon s Governor declared a state of emergency on January 18, 2024, which allows PGE to seek recovery of incremental storm expenses through the previously filed emergency deferral, as the OPUC had pre-authorized for costs associated with declared states of emergency. On February 9, 2024, PGE filed a Notice of Deferral with the OPUC, under Docket UM 2190, related to the emergency restoration costs for the January storm and, as of September 30, 2024, had deferred 45 million, including interest, as a regulatory asset for the costs to repair damage to PGE s transmission and distribution systems and restore power to customers under the deferral. PGE currently forecasts its preliminary regulated return on equity for the full year 2024 will be in excess of the OPUC s authorized rate of return that is expected to be used as an earnings test for this deferral. As a result of the earnings test, the Company has decreased the deferral and taken a corresponding charge to earnings for 17 million and, as of September 30, 2024, PGE s net deferred balance related to the January 2024 storm is million, including interest. PGE will reassess the earnings test, and the related impact to deferred amounts under this mechanism, based on actual return on equity for the year ending December 31, 2024. Actual results experienced by the Company could differ materially from current forecasts and estimates and could increase or decrease the final deferred balance after application of the earnings test. PGE believes the remaining amounts deferred as of September 30, 2024 are probable of recovery under the emergency deferral mechanism. The OPUC maintains responsibility to review utility requests to amortize deferred amounts into customer prices, including a review of utility prudence in a future proceeding, among other requirements, which would include an earnings test. For further information, see January 2024 storm and damage in the Regulatory Assets and Liabilities section of Note 3, Balance Sheet Components in the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 1. Financial Statements. 
 
 On July 5, 2024, the Governor of Oregon declared a statewide emergency for a heat wave that engulfed the region. After determining costs resulting from the heat wave, the Company did not record any additional costs under the emergency deferral. 
 
 Power costs Pursuant to the AUT process, PGE annually files an estimate of power costs for the following year. As approved by the OPUC, the 2024 AUT included a final increase in power costs for 2024, and a corresponding increase in annual revenue requirement, of 216 million from 2023 levels, which were reflected in customer prices effective January 1, 2024. 
 
 Portland Harbor Environmental Remediation Account (PHERA) mechanism The EPA has listed PGE as one of over one hundred Potentially Responsible Parties (PRPs) related to the remediation of the Portland Harbor Superfund site. As of September 30, 2024, significant uncertainties still remained concerning the precise boundaries for clean-up, the assignment of responsibility for clean-up costs, the final selection of a proposed remedy by the EPA, and the method of allocation of costs amongst PRPs. It is probable that PGE will share in a portion of these 
 46 

Table of Contents 

 costs. In a Record of Decision (ROD) issued in 2017, the EPA outlined its selected remediation plan for clean-up of the Portland Harbor site, which had an estimated total cost of billion. Stakeholders have raised concerns that EPA s cost estimates are understated, and PGE estimates undiscounted total remediation costs for Portland Harbor per the ROD could range from 1.9 billion to 3.5 billion. The Company does not currently have sufficient information to reasonably estimate the amount, or range, of its potential costs for investigation or remediation of Portland Harbor. However, the Company may obtain sufficient information, prior to the final determination of allocation percentages among PRPs, to develop a reasonable estimate, or range, of its potential liability that would require recording an estimate, or low end of the range. The Company s liability related to the cost of remediating Portland Harbor could be material to PGE s financial position. The impact of such costs to the Company s results of operations is mitigated by the PHERA mechanism. As approved by the OPUC, the recovery mechanism allows the Company to defer and recover estimated liabilities and incurred legal and technical analysis expenditures related to the Portland Harbor Superfund Site through a combination of third-party proceeds, including, but not limited to, insurance recoveries, and customer prices, as necessary. The mechanism established annual prudency reviews of environmental expenditures and third-party proceeds, and annual expenditures in excess of 6 million, excluding contingent liabilities, are subject to an annual earnings test. PGE s results of operations may be impacted to the extent such expenditures were to be deemed imprudent by the OPUC or disallowed per the prescribed earnings test. For further information regarding the PHERA mechanism, see EPA Investigation of Portland Harbor in Note 8, Contingencies in the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 1. Financial Statements. 
 
 Decoupling The decoupling mechanism, previously authorized by the OPUC through 2022, was intended to provide for recovery of margin lost as a result of a reduction in electricity sales attributable to energy efficiency, customer-owned generation, and conservation efforts by residential and certain commercial customers. The mechanism provided for collection from (or refund to) customers if weather-adjusted use per customer was less (or more) than that projected in the Company s most recent GRC. 
 
 In the 2022 GRC, parties reached an agreement that eliminated PGE s decoupling mechanism such that deferrals would not occur after 2022, although amortization of then previously recorded deferrals was to continue as scheduled until collected or refunded in future customer prices. For the year ended December 31, 2022, with OPUC approval, PGE is collecting 5 million in customer prices over a one-year period that began January 1, 2024. 
 
 In the 2024 GRC filing, the Company included a concept proposal to resume decoupling, with certain modifications. PGE then made a tariff filing that proposed weather-normalized decoupling, although at a public meeting in June 2024, the OPUC permanently suspended PGE s proposed tariff, effectively denying the proposal. 
 
 Renewable recovery framework As previously authorized by the OPUC, the RAC is a primary method available to recover costs associated with renewable resources. The RAC allows PGE to recover prudently incurred costs of renewable resources through filings made each year, outside of a GRC. Under the RAC, during 2023, the Company submitted a filing for Clearwater, which went into service in January 2024. See Clearwater RAC in Note 3, Regulatory Assets and Liabilities, in the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 1. Financial Statements, for more information regarding the timing of the tariff, annual revenue requirement, and related deferral. The Company has not requested recovery of any renewable resources under the RAC during 2024. 

Operating Activities 
 
 In addition to electricity provided by PGE s own generation portfolio, to meet retail load requirements and balance energy supply with customer demand, the Company purchases and sells electricity in the wholesale market. To fuel its generation portfolio, the Company purchases natural gas in the United States and Canada and sells excess gas back into the wholesale market. PGE also performs portfolio management and wholesale market services for third parties in the region and purchases and sells environmental credits in the wholesale marketplace.

 The Company participates in the California Independent System Operator's (CAISO) western Energy Imbalance Market (EIM), which allows, among other things, more renewable energy integration into the grid by better complementing the variable output of renewable resources. PGE recently signed the implementation agreement to join the CAISO s Extended Day-Ahead Market (EDAM) to build on the success of the western EIM and help provide the Company and its customers access to more affordable, reliable and clean energy. Utilities that participate in the EDAM, expected to begin operating in 2026, will bid their anticipated energy demand and generating resources into the market a day ahead of expected usage. The EDAM will then optimize generation resources and the energy needed for all market participants, allowing them to receive the least costly and cleanest energy to meet their energy needs. The EDAM takes advantage of existing technology and systems PGE has deployed and leverages the Company s transmission system to connect regional resources across a common market, such as hydropower and wind facilities in the Pacific Northwest and solar facilities in California and the desert Southwest. 
 
 In its ongoing effort to benefit retail and wholesale customers, in 2023, PGE joined the Western Power Pool s resource adequacy program known as the Western Resource Adequacy Program (WRAP), which has announced that it is on a path to begin binding operation in 2027. The WRAP represents a regional framework to more effectively address resource adequacy, enhance reliability, integrate clean energy, and manage costs through resource diversification and capacity sharing across a wide geographic footprint and broad pool of participants across the West. 
 
 PGE generates revenues and cash flows primarily from the sale and distribution of electricity to its retail customers. The impact of seasonal weather conditions on demand for electricity can cause the Company s revenues, cash flows, and income from operations to fluctuate from period to period. Summer peak deliveries have continued to exceed those of the winter months for nearly ten years, generally resulting from growing air conditioning demand and the trend toward a warmer overall climate. In August 2023, demand reached a new all-time high, surpassing the previous mark, which was set in summer 2021. Historically, PGE had experienced its highest average megawatts (MWa) deliveries and retail energy sales during the winter heating season. Although a new record high winter peak load was set as recent as December 2022, the summer peak deliveries in each year since 2021 have exceeded that winter peak. Retail customer price changes and customer usage patterns, which can be affected by the economy, also have an effect on revenues. Wholesale power availability and price, hydro and wind generation, and fuel costs for thermal plants can also affect income from operations. PGE has taken measures to enhance the availability of supply chain-constrained items that are needed to serve new and existing customers, such as securing inventory of critical materials to improve reliability, reserving manufacturing capacity with strategic partners, and evaluating availability with established and new suppliers. The Company s materials and supplies forecasting process is designed to secure materials availability as well as mitigate cost increases through long-term agreements, supplier engagement, and expanding the supply base.

 Total retail energy deliveries for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 increased 0.3 compared with the nine months ended September 30, 2023, as the increase from industrial customers was nearly offset by decreases in residential and commercial deliveries. 
 
 Residential weather-adjusted deliveries saw average usage per customer 1.4 lower during the first nine months of 2024 compared with 2023, while the average number of residential customers was 1.6 greater. PGE has seen the number of rooftop solar installations increase in its service territory over the past few years, which continues to bear on average usage per customer. 
 
 The industrial class continues to show growth in energy deliveries, up 15.7 and 8.8 in the three months and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, compared to the same periods in 2023, reflecting strength in the high-tech manufacturing and digital services sectors.

 During the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same three months of 2023, the impact of weather on Total Retail deliveries was somewhat less than in 2023. While temperatures were above average during 2024, the number of cooling degree-days recorded were 25 above average compared to 34 above in the same period of 2023. 
 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, milder temperatures have resulted in somewhat lower Total Retail Energy deliveries when compared to the same period of 2023. Total heating degree days have been below the comparable totals for each quarter of 2024 when compared to 2023 and total cooling degree days, were also lower in the second and third quarters of 2024 than 2023. 
 
 The Company s cost-of-service opt-out program caps participation by customers in the fixed three-year and minimum five-year opt-out programs, which account for the majority of energy delivered to Direct Access customers who purchase their energy from ESSs. Had the cap limit been fully subscribed and utilized, 12 of PGE s total retail energy deliveries for the first nine months of 2024 would have been to these customers. 
 
 PGE offers service to customers under an OPUC created New Large Load Direct Access program for unplanned, large, new loads and large load growth at existing customer sites. With the adoption of the New Large Load Direct Access program, which is capped at 119 MWa, as much as 17 of the Company s energy deliveries could have been supplied by ESSs to Direct Access customers. Actual deliveries to Direct Access customers of energy supplied by ESSs represented 11 of PGE s total retail energy deliveries for the first nine months of 2024 and 2023. The OPUC, under docket UM 2024, has undertaken an investigation of long-term of Direct Access with program caps being one of the issues under consideration. 

Power Operations PGE utilizes a combination of its own generating resources and wholesale market transactions to meet the energy needs of its retail customers. The Company participates in wholesale markets by purchasing and selling electricity, natural gas, and environmental credits in an effort to meet the needs of, and obtain reasonably-priced power for, its retail customers. PGE continuously makes economic dispatch decisions based on numerous factors, such as plant availability, customer demand, river flows, wind conditions, and current wholesale prices. As a result, the amount of power generated and purchased in the wholesale market to meet the Company s retail load requirement can vary from period to period and impacts NVPC and income from operations.

 (1) Plant availability represents the percentage of the period plants were available for operations, which is impacted by planned maintenance and forced, or unplanned, outages. 
 (2) Projected levels of energy are included as part of PGE s AUT. Such projections establish the power cost component of retail prices for the following calendar year. Any shortfall is generally replaced with power from higher cost sources, while any excess generally displaces power from higher cost sources. 
 (3) Plant availability reflects Colstrip, which PGE does not operate. 
 (4) Plant availability includes Wheatridge Renewable Energy Facility and Clearwater, which PGE does not operate. 
 
 Energy received from PGE-owned and jointly-owned thermal plants during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 2023 decreased 1 . This decrease was primarily driven by economic dispatch decisions. Energy expected to be received from thermal resources is projected annually in the AUT based on forecast market prices, variable costs to run the plant, and the constraints of the plant. PGE s thermal generating plants require varying levels of annual maintenance, which is generally performed during the second quarter of the year. 
 
 Total energy received from hydroelectric generation sources, both PGE-owned generation and purchased, increased 35 during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 2023 primarily due to the addition of capacity under two purchased hydro contracts in 2024. Energy purchased from mid-Columbia and other regional hydroelectric projects increased 40 while energy generated by the Company-owned facilities increased 11 during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. Energy expected to be received from hydroelectric resources is projected annually in the AUT based on a modified hydro study, which utilizes 80 years of historical stream flow data. See Purchased power and fuel in the Results of Operations section in this Item 2, for further detail on regional hydro results. 
 
 Energy received from PGE-owned and under contract wind resources increased 45 during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 2023 primarily due to the addition of Clearwater in 2024. Energy expected to be received from wind generating resources is projected annually in the AUT based on historical generation. Wind generation forecasts are developed using a 5-year rolling average of historical wind levels or forecast studies when historical data is not available. 
 
 Under the PCAM, the Company may share with customers a portion of cost variances associated with NVPC. Customer prices can be adjusted annually to absorb a portion of the difference between the forecasted NVPC included in customer prices (baseline NVPC) and actual NVPC for the year, if such differences exceed a prescribed deadband limit, which ranges from 15 million below to 30 million above baseline NVPC. To the extent actual NVPC, subject to certain adjustments, is outside the deadband range, the PCAM provides for 90 of the excess variance to be collected from, or refunded to, customers. Pursuant to a regulated earnings test, a refund will occur only to the extent that it results in PGE s actual regulated return on equity (ROE) for the given year being no less than 1 above the Company s latest authorized ROE, while a collection will occur only to the extent that it results 
 51 

Table of Contents 

 in PGE s actual regulated ROE for that year being no greater than 1 below the Company s authorized ROE. The following is a summary of the results of the PCAM as calculated for regulatory purposes for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively: 
 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, actual NVPC was million below baseline NVPC. Based on forecast data, NVPC for the year ending December 31, 2024 is currently estimated to be below the baseline and outside the established deadband range. Pursuant to the PCAM and related earnings test, because PGE s preliminary regulatory ROE is estimated to be below 10.5 , there is no estimated refund to customers expected under the PCAM for 2024. 
 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2023, actual NVPC was 28 million above baseline NVPC. For the year ended December 31, 2023, actual NVPC was 5 million above baseline NVPC, which was within the established deadband range. Accordingly, no estimated collection from customers was recorded for 2023. 
 
 As approved by the OPUC in PGE s 2024 GRC, the Reliability Contingency Event (RCE) mechanism allows PGE to pursue recovery of 80 of costs for RCEs above amounts forecasted in the Company s AUT, with the remaining 20 flowing through operating expenses and subject to the existing PCAM. For more on the 2024 RCE, see Regulatory Assets and Liabilities in Note 3, Balance Sheet Components in the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 1. Financial Statements.

 Results of Operations 
 
 The following tables provide financial and operational information to be considered in conjunction with management s discussion and analysis of results of operations. 
 
 The results of operations are as follows for the periods presented (dollars in millions): 
 Three Months Ended September 30, Increase (Decrease) Nine Months Ended September 30, Increase (Decrease) 2024 2023 2024 2023 Total revenues 929 802 16 2,616 2,198 19 Operating expenses: Purchased power and fuel 380 386 (2) 1,060 910 16 Generation, transmission and distribution 131 85 54 337 279 21 Administrative and other 102 89 15 294 262 12 Depreciation and amortization 126 116 9 369 340 9 Taxes other than income taxes 44 41 7 132 124 6 Total operating expenses 783 717 9 2,192 1,915 14 Income from operations 146 85 72 424 283 50 Interest expense, net 53 42 26 156 127 23 Other income: Allowance for equity funds used during construction 6 5 20 17 12 42 Miscellaneous income, net 6 5 20 21 22 (5) Other income, net 12 10 20 38 34 12 Income before income tax expense 105 53 98 306 190 61 Income tax expense 11 6 83 31 30 3 Net income 94 47 100 275 160 72 Other comprehensive income (1) 1 (100) Net income and Comprehensive income 93 47 98 275 161 71 
 Includes an allowance for borrowed funds used during construction of 4 million in both the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, and 12 million and 9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. 
 
 Net income for the three months ended September 30, 2024 increased 47 million, or 100 , compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023, driven largely by an increase in Income from Operations. Retail revenues were up not only as a result of general price increases but also as a result of an increase in prices to cover anticipated higher net variable power costs, as authorized by the OPUC in the AUT. Purchased power and fuel expense, however, were comparable to the same period of 2023, as wholesale energy prices have shown a decline from the same period a year ago. While retail energy deliveries increased period over period as a result of higher demand from industrial customers, the increase in total system load was driven by a rise in wholesale energy deliveries. Generation, transmission and distribution expenses were up due to maintenance activities, vegetation management, service restoration work, and a charge to reduce the deferral for the January 2024 storm due to the application of an earnings test. Depreciation and amortization expense, driven by higher depreciable asset balances, and Interest expense, net, due to higher long-term debt balances, both increased, as anticipated, and were largely offset by increased revenues. Other income, net continues to see higher AFUDC credits in 2024.

Table of Contents 

Net income for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 increased 115 million, or 72 , compared to the same period of 2023. Retail revenues increased due to price changes to cover anticipated higher net variable power costs general cost increases, as authorized by the OPUC. Wholesale revenues have increased, driven by a 45 increase in deliveries. Generation, transmission and distribution expenses were up primarily due to vegetation management and major maintenance activities. The increase in Administrative and general expense reflects increases in various categories including compensation and benefits, customer related items, outside services, and regulatory expense. Increases in Depreciation and amortization expense, driven by higher depreciable asset balances, and Interest expense, net, due to higher long-term debt balances, were anticipated and largely offset in net income by increased revenues. Other income, net increased in 2024 primarily due to the higher AFUDC credits. 

Total revenues consist of the following for the periods presented (dollars in millions):

 Wholesale revenues result from sales of electricity and environmental credits to utilities and power marketers made in the Company s efforts to meet the needs of, and obtain reasonably priced power for, its retail customers, manage risk, and administer its long-term wholesale contracts. Such sales can vary significantly from year to year as a result of economic conditions, power and fuel prices, hydro and wind availability, and customer demand. 
 
 For the three months ended September 30, 2024, Wholesale revenues increased 19 million, or 11 , from the three months ended September 30, 2023 as higher sales volumes were partially offset by lower average sales prices. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, Wholesale revenues increased 144 million, or 45 , from the nine months ended September 30, 2023, reflecting a 45 increase in sales volumes and a 22 reduction in the average wholesale sales price due largely to milder weather and lower natural gas prices, along with a 34 million increase in sales of environmental credits. 
 
 Other operating re venues for the three months ended September 30, 2024 were up 6 million from the comparable period in 2023. In the nine months ended September 30, 2024, Other operating revenues were up 10 million compared to the same period of 2023, reflecting amortization that is offset in Retail revenues and increased transmission related revenues.

 For the three months ended September 30, 2024, the 76 million decrease related to the change in average variable power cost per MWh was driven by a 22 decrease in the average cost of purchased power and a 3 increase in the average cost for the Company s own generation, driven primarily by price risk management activity. The 81 million increase resulting from the overall mix of purchased power and generation used to meet total system load was primarily due to a 27 increase of energy obtained from purchased power and a 6 increase in the Company s own generation. 
 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the 86 million increase related to the change in average variable power cost per MWh was driven by a 5 increase in the average cost of purchased power and a 18 increase in the average cost for the Company s own generation, driven primarily by higher physical power and natural gas prices due to severe weather events in the first quarter. The 151 million increase related to total system load was comprised of an 21 increase of energy obtained from purchased power primarily due to the addition of capacity under two purchased hydro contracts in 2024, and a 6 increase in the Company s own generation primarily due to the addition of Clearwater in 2024.

 For further information regarding NVPC in relation to the PCAM, see Purchased power and fuel expense and Revenues within this Results of Operations for more details. 
 
 For the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, actual NVPC was 35 million below and 10 million above baseline NVPC, respectively. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, actual NVPC was million below and 28 million above baseline NVPC, respectively. 
 
 Based on forecast data, NVPC for the year ending December 31, 2024 is currently estimated to be below the baseline and outside the deadband. Pursuant to the PCAM and related earnings test, because PGE s preliminary regulatory ROE is estimated to be below 10.5 , there is no estimated refund to customers expected under the PCAM for 2024. 

Generation, transmission and distribution increased as follows for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same periods in 2023 (in millions):

 PGE commenced amortization of previously deferred COVID-19 related bad debt expenses on April 1, 2023. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 , the Company amortized 10 million of COVID-19 related bad debt expense that was offset in revenues. 

Depreciation and amortization expense increased 10 million and 29 million in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, compared to the same periods in 2023. The increase was primarily due to higher utility plant balances. 

Taxes other than income taxes increased 3 million and 8 million in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, compared to the same periods in 2023. The increases were driven by higher property taxes and franchise fees. 

Interest expense, net increased 11 million and 29 million, respectively, in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same periods in 2023, primarily due to higher long-term debt balances. 

Other income, net increased 2 million and 4 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, compared to the same periods in 2023. The increase was primarily driven by higher AFUDC from higher CWIP balances. 

Income tax expense increased 5 million and 1 million, in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, compared to the same periods in 2023, driven by higher pre-tax income partially offset by increased PTC benefits. 

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 
 
 There have been no material changes to the Company s critical accounting policies and estimates as previously disclosed in Item 7 of the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, filed with the SEC on February 20, 2024. 

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES 

Liquidity 
 
 PGE s access to short-term debt markets, including revolving credit from banks, helps provide necessary liquidity to support the Company s current operating activities, including the purchase of power and fuel. Long-term capital 
 59 

Table of Contents 

 requirements are driven largely by capital expenditures for distribution, transmission, and generation facilities to support both new and existing customers, repairs from major storm damage, information technology systems, and debt refinancing activities. PGE s liquidity and capital requirements can also be significantly affected by other working capital needs, including margin deposit requirements related to wholesale market activities, which can vary depending upon the Company s forward positions and the corresponding price curves. 
 
 The following summarizes PGE s cash flows for the periods presented (in millions): 
 
 Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 Cash and cash equivalents, beginning of period 5 165 Net cash provided by (used in): Operating activities 608 331 Investing activities (900) (932) Financing activities 322 483 Increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents 
 30 (118) Cash and cash equivalents, end of period 35 47 

Cash Flows from Operating Activities Cash flows from operating activities are generally determined by the amount and timing of cash received from customers and payments made to vendors, as well as the nature and amount of non-cash items, including depreciation and amortization, deferred income taxes, and pension and other postretirement benefit costs included in net income during a given period. The following items contributed to the net change in cash flows from operations for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared with the nine months ended September 30, 2023 (in millions): 
 Increase/ (Decrease) Net income 115 Accounts receivable and Unbilled revenue (87) Margin deposits activity 49 Accounts payable 248 Regulatory deferral activity (173) Depreciation and amortization 29 Deferred income taxes 
 21 Tax credit sales 
 31 Alternative revenue programs 
 33 Other miscellaneous changes 11 Net change in cash flow from operations 277 
 
 PGE estimates that non-cash charges for depreciation and amortization in 2024 will range from 475 million to 525 million. Combined with other sources, total cash expected to be provided by operations is estimated to range from 700 million to 800 million. 
 
 Cash Flows from Investing Activities Net cash used in investing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 increased 32 million when compared with the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Cash flows used 
 60 

Table of Contents 

 in investing activities consist primarily of capital expenditures related to new construction and improvements to PGE s distribution, transmission, and generation facilities, which increased 55 million. 
 
 Excluding AFUDC, the Company plans to make capital expenditures of 1.3 billion in 2024, which it expects to fund with cash to be generated from operations during 2024, as discussed above, the issuance of short- and long-term debt securities, and issuances of shares pursuant to the at-the-market offering program. For additional information, see Debt and Equity Financings in this Liquidity and Capital Resources section of Item 2. 
 
 Cash Flows from Financing Activities During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, net cash provided by financing activities was primarily the result of the funding of 450 million in First Mortgage Bonds (FMBs) and 178 million in proceeds from the issuance of common stock pursuant to the at-the-market offering program. This was partially offset by 146 million in commercial paper maturities and payment of 148 million of dividends. 

Capital Requirements 
 
 The following table presents PGE s estimated capital expenditures and contractual maturities of long-term debt for 2024 through 2028 , excluding AFUDC (in millions):

 (1) Consists primarily of upgrades to, and replacement of, generation, transmission, and distribution infrastructure, as well as new customer connections. Includes accrued capital additions, preliminary engineering, removal costs, and certain intangible working capital assets. 
 (2) Amounts are estimates as of the date of this report and may be affected by economic conditions, including but not limited to, impacts of inflation, changes to the cost of materials and labor, and financing costs. 

Debt and Equity Financings 
 
 PGE s ability to secure sufficient short- and long-term capital at a reasonable cost is determined by its financial performance and outlook, credit ratings, capital expenditure requirements, alternatives available to investors, market conditions, and other factors, such as the volatility in the capital markets in response to inflationary pressures and interest rate increases by the federal reserve. Management believes that the availability of its revolving credit facility, the expected ability to issue short- and long-term debt and equity securities, and cash expected to be generated from operations provide sufficient cash flow and liquidity to meet the Company s anticipated capital and operating requirements for the foreseeable future. 
 
 For 2024, PGE expects to fund estimated capital requirements with cash from operations, which is expected to range from 700 million to 800 million, and issuances of long-term debt securities of up to 750 million. PGE plans to fund any shortfall through the combination of issuance of common stock and the issuance of short-term debt or commercial paper, as needed. The actual timing and amount of any such issuances of debt, equity, and commercial paper will be dependent upon the timing and amount of capital expenditures and debt payments.

 Short-term Debt. Pursuant to an order issued by the FERC in January 2024, PGE has authorization to issue short-term debt up to a total of 900 million through February 6, 2026. The following table shows available liquidity as of September 30, 2024 (in millions): 
 As of September 30, 2024 Capacity Outstanding Available Revolving credit facility (1)

 (1) Scheduled to expire September 2029. 
 (2) P GE has four letter of credit facilities under which the Company can request letters of credit for an original term not to exceed one year. 
 
 On September 10, 2024, PGE entered into an amendment of its existing revolving credit facility. As of September 30, 2024 , PGE had a 750 million unsecured revolving credit facility scheduled to expire in September 2029 . The Company has the ability to expand the revolving credit facility to 850 million, if needed, subject to the requirements of the agreement. The facility allows for unlimited extension requests, provided that lenders with a pro-rata share of more than 50 of the facility approve the extension request. The revolving credit facility supplements operating cash flows and provides a primary source of liquidity. In addition, the credit facility offers the potential for adjustments to interest rate margins and fees based on PGE s achievement of certain annual sustainability-linked metrics related to its non-emitting generation capacity and the percentage of management comprised of women and employees who identify as black, indigenous, and people of color. Pursuant to the terms of the agreement, the revolving credit facility may be used as backup for commercial paper borrowings, to permit the issuance of standby letters of credit, and to provide cash for general corporate purposes. PGE may borrow for one, three, or six months at a fixed interest rate established at the time of the borrowing, or at a variable interest rate for any period up to the remaining term of the applicable credit facility. As of September 30, 2024, PGE had no outstanding balance on the revolving credit facility. 
 
 The Company has a commercial paper program under which it may issue commercial paper for terms of up to 270 days, limited to the unused amount of credit under the revolving credit facility. As of September 30, 2024, PGE had no commercial paper outstanding. The aggregate unused available credit capacity under the revolving credit facility was 750 million. The Company has elected to limit its borrowings under the revolving credit facility in order to allow coverage for the potential need to repay any commercial paper that may be outstanding at the time. 
 
 Long-term Debt. As of September 30, 2024, PGE s total long-term debt outstanding, net of 15 million of unamortized debt expense, was 4,434 million. 
 
 On February 22, 2024, PGE entered into a Bond Purchase Agreement related to the sale of 450 million in FMBs. The Bonds were issued and funded in full on February 22, 2024 and consist of: 
 a series, due in 2029, in the amount of 100 million that will bear interest from its issuance date at an annual rate of 5.15 ; 
 a series, due in 2034, in the amount of 100 million that will bear interest from its issuance date at an annual rate of 5.36 ; and 
 a series, due in 2054, in the amount of 250 million that will bear interest from its issuance date at an annual rate of 5.73 .

 Equity On April 28, 2023, PGE entered into an equity distribution agreement under which it could sell up to 300 million of its common stock through at-the-market offering programs. In 2023, pursuant to the terms of the equity distribution agreement, PGE entered into separate forward sale agreements with forward counterparties. In March 2024, the Company issued 1,714,972 shares pursuant to the agreements and received net proceeds of 78 million. In 2024, PGE entered into additional forward sale agreements with forward counterparties, exhausting the 300 million facility. In the third quarter of 2024, the Company issued 2,351,070 shares pursuant to the agreements and received net proceeds of 100 million. The Company could have physically settled the remaining amount by delivering 2,788,431 shares in exchange for cash of 118 million as of September 30, 2024. Any proceeds from the issuances of common stock will be used for general corporate purposes and investments in renewables and non-emitting dispatchable capacity. 
 
 On July 26, 2024, PGE entered into an equity distribution agreement under which it could sell up to 400 million of its common stock through at the market offering programs. As of September 30, 2024, the Company had not yet transacted under this program. Any proceeds from the issuances of common stock will be used for general corporate purposes and investments in renewables and non-emitting dispatchable capacity. 
 
 For additional information on the at-the-market offering programs, see Note 7, Shareholders Equity, in the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 1. Financial Statements. 
 
 Capital Structure. PGE s financial objectives include maintaining a common equity ratio (common equity to total consolidated capitalization, including current debt maturities and excluding lease obligations) of approximately 50 over time. Achievement of this objective helps the Company maintain investment grade credit ratings and provides access to long-term capital at favorable interest rates. The Company s common equity ratio was 45.0 and 44.6 as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 respectively. 

Credit Ratings and Debt Covenants 
 
 PGE s secured and unsecured debt is rated investment grade by Moody s Investors Service (Moody s) and S P Global Ratings (S P), with current credit ratings and outlook as follows: 
 Moody s S P Issuer credit rating A3 BBB+ Senior secured debt A1 A Commercial paper P-2 A-2 Outlook Negative Stable 
 
 In June 2024, Moody s revised the Company s outlook from Stable to Negative. These outlook changes are not expected to have a material impact on the Company s liquidity or collateral obligations. 
 
 In the event Moody s or S P reduce their credit rating on PGE s unsecured debt below investment grade, the Company could be subject to requests by certain of its wholesale, commodity, and transmission counterparties to post additional performance assurance collateral in connection with its price risk management activities. The performance assurance collateral can be in the form of cash deposits or letters of credit, depending on the terms of the underlying agreements, are based on the contract terms and commodity prices, and can vary from period to period. Cash deposits that PGE provides as collateral are classified as Margin deposits in PGE s condensed consolidated balance sheets, while any letters of credit issued are not reflected on the condensed consolidated balance sheets. 
 
 As of September 30, 2024, PGE had posted 106 million of collateral with these counterparties, consisting of 91 million in cash and 15 million in letters of credit. Based on the Company s energy portfolio, estimates of 
 63 

Table of Contents 

 energy market prices, and the level of collateral outstanding as of September 30, 2024, the amount of additional collateral that could be requested upon a single agency downgrade to below investment grade is 63 million, and decreases to 46 million by December 31, 2024 and to 15 million by December 31, 2025. The amount of additional collateral that could be requested upon a dual agency downgrade to below investment grade is 159 million and decreases to 126 million by December 31, 2024 and to 65 million by December 31, 2025. 
 
 PGE s financing arrangements do not contain ratings triggers that would result in the acceleration of required interest and principal payments in the event of a ratings downgrade. However, the cost of borrowing and issuing letters of credit under the credit facilities would increase. 
 
 The indenture securing PGE s outstanding FMBs constitutes a direct first mortgage lien on substantially all regulated utility property, other than expressly excepted property. Interest is payable semi-annually on FMBs. The issuance of FMBs requires that PGE meet earnings coverage and security provisions set forth in the Indenture of Mortgage and Deed of Trust (Indenture) securing the bonds. PGE estimates that on September 30, 2024, under the most restrictive issuance test in the Indenture, the Company could have issued up to 507 million of additional FMBs. Any issuances of FMBs would be subject to market conditions and amounts could be further limited by regulatory authorizations or by covenants and tests contained in other financing agreements. PGE also has the ability to release property from the lien of the Indenture under certain circumstances, including bond credits, deposits of cash, or certain sales, exchanges, or other dispositions of property. 
 
 PGE s revolving credit facility contains customary covenants and credit provisions, including a requirement that limits consolidated indebtedness, as defined in the credit agreements, to 65.0 of total capitalization (debt-to-total capital ratio). As of September 30, 2024, the Company s debt-to-total capital ratio, as calculated under the credit agreement, was 55.7 . 

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk. 
 
 PGE is exposed to various forms of market risk, consisting primarily of fluctuations in commodity prices, foreign currency exchange rates, and interest rates, as well as credit risk. Any variations in the Company s market risk or credit risk may affect its future financial position, results of operations, or cash flows. There have been no material changes to market risks, or credit risk, affecting the Company from those set forth in Part II, Item 7A of the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, filed with the SEC on February 20, 2024. 

Item 4. Controls and Procedures. 
 
 Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 
 PGE s management, under the supervision and with the participation of its Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, has evaluated the effectiveness of the Company s disclosure controls and procedures as required by Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(b) as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based on that evaluation, PGE s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that, as of September 30, 2024, these disclosure controls and procedures were effective. 
 
 Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting
