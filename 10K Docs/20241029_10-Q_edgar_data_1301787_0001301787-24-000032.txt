 Significant Accounting Policies 
 
 The Company has made no material changes to its significant accounting policies described in the notes to its consolidated financial statement included in its 2023 Form 10-K. The Company did not adopt any new accounting standards during the fiscal year ended December 30, 2023 or during the nine months ended September 28, 2024.

Income Tax Disclosure Improvement . On December 14, 2023, the FASB issued ASU No. 2023-09, Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures ASU 2023-09 ), which establishes new income tax disclosure requirements in addition to modifying and eliminating certain existing requirements. Under the new guidance, entities must consistently categorize and provide greater disaggregation of information in the rate reconciliation. They must also further disaggregate income taxes paid. The ASU s disclosure requirements apply to all entities subject to Accounting Standards Codification ASC No. 740, Income Taxes ASC 740 ). The overall objective of these disclosure requirements is for an entity, particularly an entity operating in multiple jurisdictions, to disclose sufficient information to enable users of financial statements to understand the nature and magnitude of factors contributing to the difference between the effective tax rate and the statutory tax rate. ASU 2023-09 will be effective for the Company for the fiscal 2025 annual reporting period. Since this new ASU addresses only disclosures, the Company does not expect the adoption of this ASU to have any material effects on its financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. The Company is currently evaluating any new disclosures that may be required upon adoption of ASU 2023-09.

 million to reflect the LCNRV for certain inventory related to its structural products. The million write-down was due to declines in wood-based commodity prices. During the third quarter of fiscal 2024, substantially all of the inventory covered by this million LCNRV write-down was sold, thereby resulting in lower Costs of products sold by that same amount in the third quarter of fiscal 2024. This adjustment increased gross margin percentage for structural products in the third quarter of fiscal 2024 by percent. 
 
 Substantially all of the amount reported in Cost of products sold on the Company s consolidated statement of operations is composed of costs incurred to purchase inventory that is subsequently resold to customers, including costs related to import duties and tariffs. Import duties and tariffs are not typically passed through to customers as separately billed charges. Certain import duties are classified by the U.S. Department of Commerce (the Commerce Department as antidumping or countervailing duties, and these duties may be subject to periodic review and adjustments by the Commerce Department through a process known as a trade remedy administrative review, which can result in both retroactive and prospective adjustments to duty rates. At the time of importation, the Company tenders antidumping duty and countervailing duty cash deposits (as use of that term has been defined by the Commerce Department) to the U.S. Customs and Border Protection U.S. Customs and accounts for duties and tariffs based on the then-current rates in effect, and records any retroactive adjustments in the period in which U.S. Customs determines final duty rates at the time entries subject to antidumping and countervailing duties liquidate (as use of that term has been defined by the Commerce Department), typically through the resolution of a trade remedy administrative review proceeding. During the three and nine months ended September 28, 2024, the Company recognized refunds of million and million, respectively, plus interest of million and million, respectively, related to retroactive adjustments associated with certain antidumping duties for imported wood moulding and millwork products. The antidumping duty cash deposits were originally paid and accounted for by the Company in prior reporting periods at the then-current rates. Impacted inventories have since been sold. These adjustment amounts are reflected in Cost of products sold and Interest expense, net, respectively, on the Company s unaudited condensed consolidated statements of operations for

 Warehouse sales are delivered from Company warehouses. Reload sales are similar to warehouse sales but are shipped from warehouses, most of which are operated by third parties, where the Company stores owned products to enhance operating efficiencies. The reload channel is employed primarily to service strategic customers that would be less economical to service from Company warehouses, and to distribute large volumes of imported products from port facilities. Direct sales are shipped from the manufacturer to the customer without the Company taking physical possession of the inventory and, as a result, typically generate lower margins than warehouse and reload distribution channels but require lower amount of committed capital and fixed costs. 
 
 Performance obligations in contracts with customers generally consist solely of delivery of goods.

 years, some of which include or more options to extend the leases for typically . The Company s leases generally provide for fixed annual rentals. Certain leases include provisions for escalating rent based on, among other things, contractually defined increases and/or changes in the Consumer Price Index CPI ). The known changes to lease payments are included in the lease liability at lease commencement. Unknown changes related to CPI are treated as variable lease payments and recognized in the period in which the obligation for those payments was incurred. In addition, a subset of vehicle lease cost is considered variable. Some leases require the Company to pay taxes, insurance, and maintenance expenses associated with the leased assets. The lease agreements do not contain any material residual value guarantees or material restrictive covenants. 
 The Company determines if an arrangement is a lease at inception and assesses lease classification as either operating or finance at lease inception or modification. Operating lease right-of use ROU assets and liabilities are presented separately on the Company s consolidated balance sheets. Finance lease ROU assets are included in property and equipment and the finance lease obligations are presented separately in the Company s consolidated balance sheets. When a lease does not provide an implicit interest rate, the Company uses its incremental borrowing rate based on the information available at the commencement date to determine the present value of future payments. The Company has also made the accounting policy election to not separate lease components from non-lease components related to the mobile fleet asset class. 
 The Company s finance lease liabilities consist of leases related to equipment and vehicles, and real estate. A majority of the Company s finance leases relate to real estate. During fiscal 2017 and fiscal 2018, the Company entered into real estate financing transactions on certain of its warehouse facilities. These transactions were completed pursuant to sale-leaseback arrangements, and upon their completion, the Company entered into long-term leases on the properties having renewal options. The Company accounted for these transactions in accordance with the ASC 840, Leases , which was the lease accounting standard in effect for the Company at the inception of these arrangements. The Company recorded these transactions as finance lease liabilities on its consolidated balance sheet. Gains on these sale-leaseback transactions were deferred and are being recognized into the Company s earnings. As of September 28, 2024 and December 30, 2023, the remaining unrecognized deferred gains related to these transactions were million and million, respectively, and these deferred gains are being recognized in earning on a straight-line basis. During the three months ended September 28, 2024 and September 30, 2023, the Company recognized million and million, respectively, of these deferred gains in each quarter. In the nine months ended September 28, 2024 and September 30, 2023, the Company recognized million and million, respectively, of these deferred gains in each period.

 Environmental Matters 
 From time to time, the Company is involved in various proceedings incidental to its business and the Company is subject to a variety of environmental and pollution control laws and regulations in all jurisdictions in which it operates. Although the ultimate outcome of these proceedings cannot be determined with certainty, based on presently available information, the Company believes that adequate liabilities have been accrued for probable losses with respect thereto and receivables recorded for expected receipts from settlements. The Company further believes that, while the ultimate outcome of these matters could be material to the Company s financial position, results of operations and cash flows in any given reporting period, they will not have a materially adverse effect on the Company s long-term financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows.

 The Company s effective income tax rates for the three and nine months ended September 28, 2024 and September 30, 2023 were impacted by the permanent addback of certain nondeductible expenses, including meals and entertainment and executive compensation, partially offset by a partial release of a valuation allowance for deferred income tax assets, the vesting of restricted stock units, and the return-to-provision adjustment associated with the most recently filed U.S. Federal income tax return. 
 
 The Company s effective income tax rates for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 were impacted by state taxes as well as the permanent addback of certain nondeductible expenses, including executive compensation, offset by a benefit from the vesting of restricted stock units. 
 
 For fiscal 2024, the Company expects its consolidated annual effective income tax rate will be approximately percent.

Third Quarter of Fiscal 2024 Compared to Third Quarter of Fiscal 2023 
 
 For the third quarter of fiscal 2024, the Company generated consolidated net sales of 747.3 million, a decrease of 62.7 million, or 7.7 percent, compared to the third quarter of fiscal 2023. The decrease in net sales in the current quarter was attributable to continuing pricing pressures in both specialty products and structural products, with commodity prices in U.S. markets for lumber and panels being down 12 percent and 19 percent, respectively, compared to the prior year period. However, pricing declines were partially offset by volume growth for both specialty and structural products. The Company s gross profit for the third quarter of fiscal 2024 decreased by 13.6 million to 125.7 million from 139.2 million in the prior year period and this decrease was attributable to both specialty and structural products. Gross margin percentage for the Company decreased from 17.2 percent to 16.8 percent in the current quarter, also attributable to both structural products and specialty products. The import-duty and LCNRV matters discussed in the sections below for specialty products and structural products contributed 5.9 million to the current quarter s gross profit. Excluding these items, gross margin percentage was 16.0 percent for the current quarter. 
 
 Net sales of specialty products, which includes products such as engineered wood, siding, millwork, outdoor living, specialty lumber and panels, and industrial products, decreased by 39.9 million, or 7.1 percent, to 519.0 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2024. This decrease in net sales was due to price deflation across all specialty product categories, partially offset by volume gains for millwork, engineered wood, and specialty lumber and panels. Specialty products gross profit decreased by 10.4 million to 100.5 million due primarily to the decrease in sales. Specialty products gross margin percentage decreased by 40 basis points to 19.4 percent compared to 19.8 percent in the third quarter of fiscal 2023 due primarily to decreases in pricing. The current period included a net benefit of 3.5 million for import duty-related items from prior periods. Excluding this benefit, specialty products gross margin percentage was 18.7 percent. The duty items were related to changes in retroactive rates for anti-dumping duties and to classification adjustments for certain goods imported by the Company. 
 
 Net sales of structural products, which includes products such as lumber, plywood, oriented strand board, rebar, and remesh, decreased by 22.8 million, or 9.1 percent, to 228.3 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2024 compared to the third quarter of 
 21 

Table of Contents 

 fiscal 2023. This decrease was primarily due to price deflation across all structural product types, partially offset by volume gains for all structural product types. Structural products gross profit decreased by 3.2 million to 25.2 million from 28.3 million in the prior year period due primarily to decreases in pricing. Structural products gross margin percentage for the third quarter of fiscal 2024 was 11.0 percent compared to 11.3 percent in the prior-year period. Gross profit and gross margin percentage for the third quarter of fiscal 2024 were positively impacted by a 2.4 million LCNRV inventory write-down for certain structural products at the end of the second quarter of fiscal 2024 that resulted in lower Costs of products sold in the third quarter of fiscal 2024 since substantially all of the inventory associated with the LCNRV write-down was sold during third quarter of fiscal 2024. This adjustment increased the current quarter s gross margin percentage for structural products by 1.0 percent. The third quarter of fiscal 2023 was negatively impacted by a 0.6 million interim period LCNRV write-down for certain inventory related to our structural products. 
 
 Our selling, general, and administrative SG A expenses increased by 0.9 million, or 0.9 percent, compared to the third quarter of fiscal 2023. In the current quarter, higher technology expenses associated with our digital transformation were partially offset by lower fleet-related logistics costs. 
 
 Depreciation and amortization expense increased 17.8 percent compared to the third quarter of fiscal 2023 due to a higher base of depreciable assets in the third quarter of fiscal 2024, resulting from our continued focus on strategic capital investment. 
 
 Interest expense, net, decreased by 17.2 percent, or 1.0 million, compared to the third quarter of fiscal 2023. The decrease was due to the generation of additional interest income from larger balances of cash and cash equivalents and from higher interest rates on those balances in the current quarter compared to the prior year period. Additionally, interest income for the third quarter of fiscal 2024 includes 0.7 million related to antidumping import duty refunds recognized in the quarter. (see Note 2, Inventories ). 
 
 Our effective income tax rates were 26.0 percent and 27.2 percent for the third quarters of fiscal 2024 and 2023, respectively. Our effective income tax rates for both periods were impacted by state taxes as well as the permanent addback of certain nondeductible expenses, including meals and entertainment and executive compensation, slightly offset by a benefit from the vesting of restricted stock units. For fiscal 2024, we expect our annual effective income tax rate will be approximately 26 percent. 
 
 Our net income for the third quarter of fiscal 2024 was 16.0 million, or 1.87 per diluted share, versus 24.4 million, or 2.71 per diluted share, in the prior-year period. Decreases in our net income and earnings per diluted share were due primarily to the factors discussed above. The 2024 period also reflects a pre-tax benefit of 2.2 million related to an adjustment of the settlement charge recorded in the fourth quarter of 2023 to settle our defined benefit pension plan. This benefit was partially offset by 1.2 million of estimated net losses related to Hurricane Helene in September 2024, which is reported within Other operating expenses, net on our unaudited condensed consolidated statements of operations. 
 
 First Nine Months of Fiscal 2024 Compared to First Nine Months of Fiscal 2023 
 
 For the first nine months of fiscal 2024, the Company generated consolidated net sales of 2.24 billion, a decrease of 182 million, or 7.5 percent, compared to the first nine months of fiscal 2023. The decrease in net sales in the current period was attributable to both specialty products and structural products and reflected continuing pricing pressures, partially offset by volume gains . The Company s gross profit for the first nine months of fiscal 2024 decreased by 32.8 million to 375.8 million from 408.6 million in the prior year period. This decline in net sales was attributable to both specialty products and structural products. The Company s gross margin percentage was 16.8 percent for the 2024 period, a decrease from the 16.9 percent for the 2023 period. Gross profit and gross margin percentage benefited in the current period by a net benefit in specialty products of 12.7 million for import duty items. The import duty items were related to changes in retroactive rates for anti-dumping duties resulting in a credit to cost of products sold of 20.7 million, partially offset by classification adjustments for certain goods imported by the Company that resulted in a net increase in Cost of products sold of 8.0 million for the current period. Not including this net benefit, the Company s gross margin percentage would have been 16.2 percent in the current period.

Net sales of specialty products, which includes products such as engineered wood, siding, millwork, outdoor living, specialty lumber and panels, and industrial products, decreased by 135.4 million, or 8 percent, to 1.56 billion in the first nine months of fiscal 2024. The decline in net sales was due to price deflation across all specialty product types, partially offset by volume gains for millwork, engineered wood, siding, and specialty lumber and panels. Specialty products gross profit decreased 17.5 million to 308.9 million due to lower net sales, while specialty products gross margin percentage decreased 60 basis points to 19.8 percent for the first nine months of fiscal 2024 compared to 19.2 percent in the first nine months of fiscal 2023. The net impact of the import duty items described above increased specialty products gross profit for the current period by 12.7 million and specialty products gross margin percentage by 0.8 percent. 
 
 Net sales of structural products, which includes products such as lumber, plywood, oriented strand board, rebar, and remesh, decreased 46.6 million to 679.6 million in the first nine months of fiscal 2024 primarily due to volume and price declines for the lumber category, partially offset by price and volume increases in the panels category. Gross profit for structural products decreased by 15.3 million to 66.9 million from 82.2 million in the prior year period due to lower sales in the current period. Structural products gross margin percentage for the first nine months of fiscal 2024 was 9.8 percent, a decline from 11.3 percent in the prior-year period due primarily to price deflation for the lumber category. Gross profit and gross margin percentage for structural products benefited in the prior year period by lower cost of products sold attributable to a 2.6 million LCNRV write-down of certain inventory at the end of fiscal 2022, partially offset by an interim 0.6 million LCNRV write-down of certain inventory during the 2023 period. During the first nine months of fiscal 2024, such interim period LCNRV inventory write-downs and reversals netted to zero. 
 
 Our SG A expenses in the first nine months of fiscal 2024 increased 1.6 million compared to the first nine months of fiscal 2023. In the current period, higher technology expenses associated with our digital transformation and legal expenses associated with duty-related matters were partially offset by lower sales-based incentive expenses and lower share-based compensation expense. 
 
 Depreciation and amortization expense increased 22.4 percent compared to the first nine months of fiscal 2023 due to a higher base of depreciable assets throughout the first nine months of fiscal 2024 when compared the prior-year period, resulting from our continued focus on strategic capital investment. 
 
 Other operating expenses, net decreased 4.0 million compared to the first nine months of fiscal 2023 primarily due to restructuring related expenses, including severance expenses, incurred in the 2023 period due to our leadership transition. 
 
 Interest expense, net, decreased by 28.3 percent, or 5.5 million, compared to the first nine months of fiscal 2023. The decrease was primarily due to the generation of higher interest income, given our year-over-year increase in cash that is generating interest at higher rates than last year. Included in interest income for the nine months ended September 28, 2024 is 2.7 million of interest income related to the antidumping import duty refunds (see Note 2, Inventories ). Interest expense, net for the nine months ended September 28, 2024 also includes 1.2 million of estimated accrued interest expense related to estimated import duties owed by the Company (see Note 9, Commitments and Contingencies ). 
 
 Our effective income tax rates were 24.9 percent and 25.9 percent for the first nine months of fiscal 2024 and 2023, respectively. Our effective income tax rate for both periods was impacted by state taxes as well as the permanent addback of certain nondeductible expenses, including meals and entertainment and executive compensation, partially offset by a benefit from the vesting of restricted stock units, and in the 2024 period, a partial release of a valuation allowance for deferred income tax assets. For fiscal 2024, we expect our annual effective income tax rate will be approximately 26 percent. 
 
 Our net income for the first nine months of fiscal 2024 was 47.8 million, or 5.53 per diluted share, versus 66.7 million, or 7.38 per diluted share, in the prior-year period. Our net income for the first nine months of fiscal 2024 decreased due primarily to the factors discussed above. The 2024 period also reflects a pre-tax benefit of 2.2 million related to an adjustment of the settlement charge recorded in the fourth quarter of 2023 to settle our defined benefit pension plan. This benefit was partially offset by 1.2 million of estimated net losses related to Hurricane Helene in September 2024, which is reported within Other operating expenses, net on our unaudited condensed consolidated statements of operations.

Excess availability, which includes availability under our Revolving Credit Facility plus cash and cash equivalents in qualified accounts, was 872.8 million as of September 28, 2024. 
 Finance Lease Obligations 
 Our finance lease obligations consist of leases for real estate, equipment, and vehicles totaling 293.8 million and 285.4 million as of September 28, 2024 and December 30, 2023, respectively. Of the 293.8 million as of September 28, 2024, 243.1 million related to real estate and 50.8 million related to equipment. Of the 285.4 million as of December 30, 2023, 243.2 million related to real estate and 42.3 million related to equipment. 
 
 Sources and Uses of Cash 
 Operating Activities 
 Net cash provided by operating activities for the first nine months of fiscal 2024 was 66.4 million compared to net cash provided of 230.7 million in the first nine months of fiscal 2023. The decrease in cash provided by operating activities during the first nine months of fiscal 2024 was primarily a result of a 18.8 million decrease in net income for the current year period and a 146.9 million net decrease in operating assets and liabilities in the current year period, primarily inventory. 
 
 Investing Activities 
 
 Net cash used in investing activities for the first nine months of fiscal 2024 was 19.0 million compared to net cash used of 18.7 million in the first nine months of fiscal 2023. In the current period, higher spending for property and equipment was

 partially offset by proceeds from sales of assets. During the first nine months of fiscal 2024, we also acquired 16.7 million of property and equipment through finance leases, compared to 11.3 million for the first nine months of fiscal 2023. 
 
 Financing Activities 
 
 Net cash used in financing activities totaled 42.9 million for the first nine months of fiscal 2024 compared to net cash used of 41.1 million for the first nine months of fiscal 2023. The change in net cash used in financing activities was primarily due to an increase in cash used for payments for finance lease liabilities, offset by a decrease in cash used to repurchase shares to satisfy employee tax withholdings for vestings of restricted stock units. During the first nine months of fiscal 2024, we repurchased 30.0 million of our common stock compared to 29.3 million during the first nine months of fiscal 2023. 
 
 Stock Repurchase Programs 
 
 During the first nine months of fiscal 2024, we repurchased 297,951 shares of our common stock under our 2023 share repurchase program at an average price of 100.63, including broker commissions but excluding federal excise tax due on the repurchases, for a total of 30.0 million. All of the share repurchase in fiscal 2024 occurred in the second and third fiscal quarters. As of September 28, 2024, there remained 61.5 million repurchase capacity under this authorization. Between September 28, 2024 and October 25, 2024, we purchased an additional 43,240 shares of our common stock for 4.6 million at an average price of 106.34 per share, including broker commissions but excluding federal excise tax due on the repurchases. 
 
 Under the 2023 share repurchase program, we may repurchase our common stock at any time or from time to time, without prior notice, subject to prevailing market conditions and other considerations. Our repurchases may be made through a variety of methods, which may include open market purchases, privately negotiated transactions, accelerated share repurchase programs, tender offers or pursuant to a trading plan that may be adopted in accordance with the Securities and Exchange Commission Rule 10b5-1. 
 
 During the first nine months of fiscal 2023, we repurchased 358,212 shares of our common stock under the former 2021/2022 share repurchase program at an average price of 83.52 per share, including broker commissions but excluding federal excise tax due on the repurchases. The 2021/2022 share repurchase program was concluded during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023. 
 
 The repurchase dollar amounts noted above are based on trade date activity, while the amounts reported on our consolidated statements of cash flows for share repurchases are based on settlement date activity. 
 
 Net Working Capital 
 
 Net working capital is an important measurement we use to determine the efficiencies of our operations and our ability to readily convert assets into cash. Net working capital is defined as the sum of accounts receivables and inventory, less accounts payable, each determined in accordance with GAAP and included in our consolidated balance sheets. This metric differs from traditional working capital in that it excludes certain current assets and current liabilities that are reported in our consolidated balance sheets. Net working capital of 432.3 million as of September 28, 2024, compared to 414.1 million as of December 30, 2023, increased on a net basis by approximately 18.2 million, as shown below:
