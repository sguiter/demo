CAUTIONARY STATEMENT REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS 
 This report contains forward-looking statements that involve substantial risks and uncertainties. These forward-looking statements are not historical facts, but rather are based on current expectations, estimates and projections about us, our current and prospective portfolio investments, our industry, our beliefs, and our assumptions. Words such as anticipates, expects, intends, plans, believes, seeks, estimates, would, should, targets, projects, and variations of these words and similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements. These statements are not guarantees of future performance and are subject to risks, uncertainties, and other factors, some of which are beyond our control and difficult to predict, that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or forecasted in the forward-looking statements. 
 In addition to factors previously identified elsewhere in the reports and other documents Sixth Street Lending Partners (the Company , we , us or our ), has filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, or SEC , the following factors, among others, could cause actual results to differ materially from forward-looking statements or historical performance: 
 an economic downturn, which could impair our portfolio companies abilities to continue to operate and could lead to the loss of some or all of our investments in those portfolio companies; 

such an economic downturn could disproportionately impact the companies in which we have invested and others that we intend to target for investment, potentially causing us to experience a decrease in investment opportunities and diminished demand for capital from these companies; 

such an economic downturn could also impact availability and pricing of our financing; 

an inability to access the capital markets could impair our ability to raise capital and our investment activities; 

inflation could negatively impact our business, including our ability to access the debt markets on favorable terms, or could negatively impact our portfolio companies; and 

the risks, uncertainties and other factors we identify in the section entitled Risk Factors in this report, in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, filed with the SEC on February 16, 2024, and elsewhere in our filings with the SEC. 

Although we believe that the assumptions on which these forward-looking statements are based are reasonable, some of those assumptions are based on the work of third parties and any of those assumptions could prove to be inaccurate; as a result, forward-looking statements based on those assumptions also could prove to be inaccurate. In light of these and other uncertainties, the inclusion of a projection or forward-looking statement in this report should not be regarded as a representation by us that our plans and objectives will be achieved. You should not place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements, which apply only as of the date of this report. We do not undertake any obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements or any other information contained herein, except as required by applicable law.

of the aggregate Commitments of the Company for organization and offering expenses in connection with the offering of Common Shares. If actual organization and offering costs incurred exceed 0.10 of the Company s total Capital Commitments, the Adviser or its affiliates will bear the excess costs. To the extent that the Company s Capital Commitments later increase, the Adviser or its affiliates may be reimbursed for past payments of excess organization and offering costs made on the Company s behalf, provided that the total organization and offering costs borne by the Company do not exceed 0.10 of total Capital Commitments and provided further that the Adviser or its affiliates may not be reimbursed for payment of excess organization and offering expenses that were incurred more than three years prior to the proposed reimbursement. As of September 30, 2024 and 2023 , there were expenses borne by the Adviser subject to future recoupment. Any sales load, platform fees, servicing fees or similar fees or expenses charged directly to an investor in an offering by a placement agent or similar party will not be considered organization or offering expenses of the Company for purposes of the Company s cap on organization and offering expenses.

of its investment company taxable income, as defined by the Code, and net tax-exempt income for that taxable year. To maintain its RIC status, the Company, among other things, has made and intends to continue to make the requisite distributions to its shareholders, which generally relieves the Company from corporate-level U.S. federal income taxes. The Company evaluates tax positions taken or expected to be taken in the course of preparing its financial statements to determine whether the tax positions are more-likely-than-not to be sustained by the applicable tax authority. Tax positions not deemed to meet the more-likely-than-not threshold are reserved and recorded as a tax benefit or expense in the current year. All penalties and interest associated with income taxes are included in income tax expense. Conclusions regarding tax positions are subject to review

U.S. federal excise tax on such taxable income, as required. To the extent that the Company determines that the estimated current year annual taxable income will be in excess of estimated current year dividend distributions from such income, the Company accrues excise tax on estimated excess taxable income. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 , the Company recorded net expense and million, respectively, for U.S. federal excise tax and other taxes. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, the Company recorded a net expense of million and million, respectively, for U.S. federal excise tax and other taxes.

million and million, respectively, for administrative services payable to the Adviser under the terms of the Administration Agreement , which is included in other general and administrative expenses in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, the Company incurred million and million, respectively, for administrative services payable to the Adviser under the terms of the Administration Agreement. Investment Advisory Agreement On June 28, 2022, the Company entered into the Investment Advisory Agreement with the Adviser. Under the terms of the Investment Advisory Agreement, the Adviser provides investment advisory services to the Company. The Adviser s services under the Investment Advisory Agreement are not exclusive, and the Adviser is free to furnish similar or other services to others so long as its services to the Company are not impaired. Under the terms of the Investment Advisory Agreement, the Company will pay the Adviser a base management fee (the Management Fee and may also pay an incentive fee (the Incentive Fee ). In November 2024, the Board renewed the Investment Advisory Agreement. Unless earlier terminated as described below, the Investment Advisory Agreement will remain in effect until November 2025, and may be extended subject to required approvals. The Investment Advisory Agreement may be terminated by either party without penalty on 60 days written notice to the other party. The Management Fee shall be calculated at an annual rate of of the Company s gross assets, payable quarterly in arrears. The Management Fee will be calculated based on the average value of the Company s gross assets at the end of the two most recently completed calendar quarters, and appropriately adjusted for any share issuances or repurchases during the current calendar quarter. Management Fees for any partial month or quarter will be appropriately prorated. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, Management Fees (gross of waivers) were million and million, respectively. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, Management Fees (gross of waivers) were million and million, respectively. Prior to any Exchange Listing that may occur, the Adviser will waive its right to receive Management Fees in excess of the sum of of the Company s average aggregate drawn capital (including capital drawn to pay Company expenses) as of the end of the two most recently completed calendar quarters, appropriately adjusted for any share issuances or repurchases during the relevant calendar quarter. The fee waiver will terminate if and when the Company consummates an Exchange Listing. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, Management Fees of million and million, respectively, have been waived. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, Management Fees of million and million, respectively, have been waived. The Incentive Fee consists of two parts, as follows: (i) The first component, payable at the end of each quarter in arrears, equals of the excess of pre-Incentive Fee net investment income in excess of a quarterly hurdle rate, until the Adviser has received subsequent to an Exchange Listing) of total net investment income for that quarter, and subsequent to an Exchange Listing) of all remaining pre-Incentive Fee net investment income for that quarter.

of cumulative realized capital gains from the inception of the Company to the end of suc h fiscal year, less the aggregate amount of any previously paid capital gain Incentive Fee for prior periods (the Capital Gains Fee ). In the determination of the second component of the Incentive Fee, any unrealized gains/(losses) specifically related to the foreign currency denominated borrowings of non-US dollar denominated investments is offset against any associated unrealized gains/(losses) related to foreign currency denominated investments. Following an Exchange Listing, the Capital Gains Fee will equal a weighted percentage of the Company s realized capital gains, if any, on a cumulative basis as between the inception of the Company to an Exchange Listing and from such Exchange Listing to the end of such fiscal year. The weighted percentage is intended to ensure that for each fiscal year following an Exchange Listing, the portion of the Company s realized capital gains that accrued prior to an Exchange Listing will be subject to an Incentive Fee rate of and the portion of the Company s realized capital gains that accrued following an Exchange Listing will be subject to an Incentive Fee rate of . 

 For purposes of determining whether pre-Incentive Fee net investment income exceeds the hurdle rate, pre-Incentive Fee net investment income is expressed as a rate of return on the average daily hurdle calculation value throughout the immediately preceding calendar quarter. Section 205(b)(3) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, as amended, or the Advisers Act, prohibits the Adviser from receiving the payment of fees on unrealized gains until those gains are realized, if ever. There can be no assurance that such unrealized gains will be realized in the future. An Exchange Listing is a quotation or listing of the Company s securities on a national securities exchange (including through an initial public offering) or a sale of all or substantially all of our assets to, or a merger or other liquidity transaction with, an entity in which the Company s shareholders receive shares of a publicly-traded company which continues to be managed by the Adviser or an affiliate thereof. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, Incentive Fees on net investment income were million and million, respectively. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 Incentive Fees on Capital Gains were million and million, respectively. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, Incentive Fees on net investment income were million and million, respectively. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, Incentive Fees on Capital Gains were million and million, respectively. As of September 30, 2024, the Capital Gains Fees accrued are not contractually payable to the Adviser. Expense Support Agreement On June 28, 2022, the Company entered into an expense support and conditional reimbursement agreement (the Expense Support Agreement with the Adviser. The Expense Support Agreement provides that, at such times as the Adviser determines, the Adviser may pay certain expenses of the Company, provided that no portion of the payment will be used to pay any interest (each an Expense Payment ). Such Expense Payment will be made in any combination of cash or other immediately available funds no later than forty-five days after a written commitment from the Adviser to pay such expense, and/or by an offset against amounts due from us to the Adviser or its affiliates. Following any calendar quarter in which Available Operating Funds (as defined in the Expense Support Agreement) exceed the cumulative distributions accrued to the Company s shareholders based on distributions declared with respect to record dates occurring in such calendar quarter (such amount referred to as the Excess Operating Funds ), the Company shall pay such Excess Operating Funds, or a portion thereof (each, a Reimbursement Payment ), to the Adviser until such time as all Expense Payments made by the Adviser to us within three years prior to the last business day of such calendar quarter have been reimbursed. The amount of the Reimbursement Payment for any calendar quarter shall equal the lesser of (i) the Excess Operating Funds in such quarter and (ii) the aggregate amount of all Expense Payments made by the Adviser to us within three years prior to the last business day of such calendar quarter that have not been previously reimbursed by us to the Adviser. The Adviser may waive its right to receive all or a portion of any Reimbursement Payment in any particular calendar quarter, so that such Reimbursement Payment may be reimbursable in a future calendar quarter. As of September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023, the Adviser had not provided any written commitments for Expense Payments. The Company has not made any Reimbursement Payments to the Adviser. The Company may or may not reimburse remaining expenses in the future.

or more of a portfolio company s outstanding voting securities as investments in affiliated companies.

The Company typically determines the fair value of its performing Level 3 debt investments utilizing a yield analysis. In a yield analysis, a price is ascribed for each investment based upon an assessment of current and expected market yields for similar investments and risk profiles. Additional consideration is given to the expected life, portfolio company performance since close, and other terms and risks associated with an investment. Among other factors, a determinant of risk is the amount of leverage used by the portfolio company relative to the total enterprise value of the company, and the rights and remedies of our investment within each portfolio company s capital structure. Significant unobservable quantitative inputs typically considered in the fair value measurement of the Company s Level 3 debt investments primarily include current market yields, including relevant market indices, but may also include quotes from brokers, dealers, and pricing services as indicated by comparable investments. If debt investments are credit impaired, an enterprise value analysis may be used to value such debt investments; however, in addition to the methods outlined above, other methods such as a liquidation or wind-down analysis may be utilized to estimate enterprise value. For the Company s Level 3 equity investments, multiples of similar companies revenues, earnings before income taxes, depreciation and amortization EBITDA or some combination thereof and comparable market transactions are typically used. Financial Instruments Not Carried at Fair Value Debt The fair value of the Company s Credit Facilities, which are categorized as Level 3 within the fair value hierarchy, as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, approximates their carrying value as the outstanding balance is callable at carrying value.

 per share par value. On June 24, 2022, our Adviser purchased thousand of Common Shares of the Company at a price of per Common Share as our initial capital. These Common Shares were issued and sold in reliance upon Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act, which provides an exemption from the registration requirements of the Securities Act. The Company has entered into subscription agreements (the Subscription Agreements with investors providing for the private placement of the Company s Common Shares. Under the terms of the Subscription Agreements, investors are required to fund drawdowns to purchase the Company s Common Shares up to the amount of their respective Capital Commitment on an as-needed basis each time the Company delivers a drawdown notice to its investors. As of September 30, 2024, the Company had received Capital Commitments totaling billion billion remaining undrawn). As of December 31, 2023 , the Company had received Capital Commitments totaling billion billion remaining undrawn). The Company has a dividend reinvestment plan, whereby the Company may issue Common Shares in order to satisfy dividend reinvestment requests. The number of Common Shares to be issued to a shareholder is determined by dividing the total dollar amount of the cash dividend or distribution payable to a shareholder by the price per share of the Company s Common Shares at the close of the payment date of a distribution. However, if the price per share on the payment date of a cash dividend or distribution exceeds the most recently computed net asset value per share, the Company will issue shares at the greater of (i) the most recently computed net asset value per share and (ii) of the current price per share (or such lesser discount to the current price per share that still exceeds the most recently computed net asset value per share).

ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 
 The information contained in this section should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto appearing elsewhere in this report. This discussion also should be read in conjunction with the Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements set forth on page 3 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. 
 Overview 
 Sixth Street Lending Partners is a Delaware statutory trust formed on April 5, 2022. The Adviser is our external manager. We have three wholly owned subsidiaries, SSLP Lending, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company, which holds a California finance lender and broker license, Sixth Street LP Holding, LLC, Sixth Street LP Holding II, LLC and Sixth Street Lending Partners Sub, LLC in which we may hold certain investments. Sixth Street LP Holding, LLC has legally dissolved as of December 31, 2023. 
 We have elected to be regulated as a BDC under the 1940 Act and have elected to be treated as a RIC under the Code. As a result, we are required to comply with various statutory and regulatory requirements, such as: 
 the requirement to invest at least 70 of our assets in qualifying assets 

source of income limitations; 

asset diversification requirements; and 

the requirement to distribute (or be treated as distributing) in each taxable year at least 90 of our investment company taxable income and tax-exempt interest for that taxable year. 

40 

Relationship with our Adviser and Sixth Street 
 Our Adviser is a Delaware limited liability company. Our Adviser acts as our investment adviser and administrator and is a registered investment adviser with the SEC under the Advisers Act. Our Adviser sources and manages our portfolio through a dedicated team of investment professionals predominately focused on direct lending, which we refer to as our Investment Team. Our Investment Team is led by our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer and our Adviser s Co-Chief Investment Officer Joshua Easterly and our Adviser s Co-Chief Investment Officer Alan Waxman, both of whom have substantial experience in credit origination, underwriting and asset management. Our investment decisions are made by our Investment Review Committee, which includes senior personnel of our Adviser and affiliates of Sixth Street Partners, LLC, or Sixth Street. 
 Sixth Street is a global investment business with over 80 billion of assets under management as of September 30, 2024. Sixth Street s direct lending platforms include Sixth Street Specialty Lending and Sixth Street Lending Partners, which are aimed at U.S. upper middle-market loan originations, Sixth Street Specialty Lending Europe, which is aimed at European middle-market loan originations. Additional Sixth Street core platforms include Sixth Street TAO, which has the flexibility to invest across all of Sixth Street s private credit market investments, Sixth Street Opportunities, which focuses on actively managed opportunistic investments across the credit cycle, Sixth Street Credit Market Strategies, which is the firm s public-side credit investment platform focused on investment opportunities in broadly syndicated leveraged loan markets, Sixth Street Growth, which provides financing solutions to growing companies, Sixth Street Fundamental Strategies, which primarily invests in secondary credit, and Sixth Street Agriculture, which invests in niche agricultural opportunities. Sixth Street has a long-term oriented, highly flexible capital base that allows it to 
 41 

invest across industries, geographies, capital structures and asset classes. Sixth Street has extensive experience with highly complex, global public and private investments executed through primary originations, secondary market purchases and restructurings, and has a team of over 650 investment and operating professionals. As of September 30, 2024, sixty-nine (69) of these personnel are dedicated to direct lending, including fifty-four (54) investment professionals. 
 Our Adviser consults with Sixth Street in connection with a substantial number of our investments. The Sixth Street platform provides us with a breadth of large and scalable investment resources. We believe we benefit from Sixth Street s market expertise, insights into industry, sector and macroeconomic trends and intensive due diligence capabilities, which help us discern market conditions that vary across industries and credit cycles, identify favorable investment opportunities and manage our portfolio of investments. Sixth Street and its affiliates will refer all middle-market loan origination activities for companies domiciled in the United States to us and conduct those activities through us. The Adviser will determine whether it would be permissible, advisable or otherwise appropriate for us to pursue a particular investment opportunity allocated to us. 
 On August 3, 2022, we, the Adviser and certain of our affiliates were granted an exemptive order from the SEC that allows us to co-invest, subject to certain conditions and to the extent the size of an investment opportunity exceeds the amount our Adviser has independently determined is appropriate to invest, with certain of our affiliates (including affiliates of Sixth Street) in middle-market loan origination activities for companies domiciled in the United States and certain follow-on investments in companies in which we have already co-invested pursuant to the order and remain invested. 
 We believe our ability to co-invest with Sixth Street affiliates is particularly useful where we identify larger capital commitments than otherwise would be appropriate for us. We expect that with the ability to co-invest with Sixth Street affiliates we will continue to be able to provide one-stop financing to a potential portfolio company in these circumstances, which may allow us to capture opportunities where we alone could not commit the full amount of required capital or would have to spend additional time to locate unaffiliated co-investors. 
 Under the terms of the Investment Advisory Agreement and Administration Agreement, the Adviser s services are not exclusive, and the Adviser is free to furnish similar or other services to others, so long as its services to us are not impaired. Under the terms of the Investment Advisory Agreement, we will pay the Adviser the base management fee, or the Management Fee, and may also pay certain incentive fees, or the Incentive Fees. 
 Under the terms of the Administration Agreement, the Adviser also provides administrative services to us. These services include providing office space, equipment and office services, maintaining financial records, preparing reports to shareholders and reports filed with the SEC, and managing the payment of expenses and the oversight of the performance of administrative and professional services rendered by others. Certain of these services are reimbursable to the Adviser under the terms of the Administration Agreement. 
 Key Components of Our Results of Operations 
 Investments 
 We focus primarily on the direct origination of loans to upper middle-market companies domiciled in the United States. 
 Our level of investment activity (both the number of investments and the size of each investment) can and does vary substantially from period to period depending on many factors, including the amount of debt and equity capital generally available to middle-market companies, the level of merger and acquisition activity for such companies, the general economic environment and the competitive environment for the types of investments we make. 
 In addition, as part of our risk strategy on investments, we may reduce certain levels of investments through partial sales or syndication to additional investors. 
 Revenues 
 We generate revenues primarily in the form of interest income from the investments we hold. In addition, we may generate income from dividends on direct equity investments, capital gains on the sale of investments and various loan origination and other fees. Our debt investments typically have a term of two to seven years, and, as of September 30, 2024, 97.5 of these investments based on fair value bore interest at a floating rate, with 100 of these subject to interest rate floors. Interest on debt investments is generally payable monthly or quarterly. Some of our investments provide for deferred interest payments or PIK interest. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, 4.9 and 4.8 of our total investment income was comprised of PIK interest. 
 42 

Changes in our net investment income are primarily driven by the spread between the payments we receive from our investments in our portfolio companies against our cost of funding and fees related to portfolio activity, rather than by changes in interest rates. Our investment portfolio primarily consists of floating rate loans, and our Credit Facilities, all bear interest at floating rates. Macro trends in base interest rates like SOFR or other reference rates may affect our net investment income over the long term. However, because we generally originate loans to a limited number of portfolio companies each quarter, and those investments also vary in size, our results in any given period, including the interest rate on investments that were sold or repaid in a period compared to the interest rate of new investments made during that period often are idiosyncratic, and reflect the characteristics of the particular portfolio companies that we invested in or exited during the period and not necessarily any trends in our business. 
 In addition to interest income, our net investment income may also be driven by prepayment and other fees, which also can vary significantly from quarter to quarter. The level of prepayment fees is generally correlated to the movement in credit spreads and risk premiums, but also will vary based on corporate events that may take place at an individual portfolio company in a given period e.g., merger and acquisition activity, initial public offerings and restructurings. As noted above, generally a small but varied number of portfolio companies may make prepayments in any quarter, meaning that changes in the amount of prepayment fees received can vary significantly between periods and can vary without regard to underlying credit trends. 
 Loan origination fees, original issue discount and market discount or premium are capitalized, and we accrete or amortize such amounts as interest income using the effective interest method for term instruments and the straight-line method for revolving or delayed draw instruments. Repayments of our debt investments can reduce interest income from period to period. We record prepayment premiums on loans as interest income when earned. We also may generate revenue in the form of commitment, amendment, structuring, syndication or due diligence fees, fees for providing managerial assistance and consulting fees. The frequency or volume of these items of revenue may fluctuate significantly. 
 Dividend income on common equity investments is recorded on the record date for private portfolio companies or on the ex-dividend date for publicly traded portfolio companies. 
 Our portfolio activity also reflects the proceeds of sales of investments. We recognize realized gains or losses on investments based on the difference between the net proceeds from the disposition and the amortized cost basis of the investment without regard to unrealized gains or losses previously recognized. We record current period changes in fair value of investments that are measured at fair value as a component of the net change in unrealized gains (losses) on investments in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. 
 Expenses 
 Our primary operating expenses include the payment of fees to our Adviser under the Investment Advisory Agreement, expenses reimbursable under the Administration Agreement and other operating costs described below. Additionally, we pay interest expense on our outstanding debt. We bear all other costs and expenses of our operations, administration and transactions, including those relating to: 
 organizational and offering expenses related to the Company s initial private offering of Common Shares (up to an aggregate of 0.10 of total capital commitments to the Company, it being understood and agreed that the Adviser shall bear all such organizational and offering expenses related to the Company s initial private offering of Common Shares in excess of such amount); 

calculating individual asset values and our net asset value (including the cost and expenses of any independent valuation firms); 

expenses, including travel expenses, incurred by the Adviser, or members of our Investment Team, or payable to third parties, in respect of due diligence on prospective portfolio companies and, if necessary, in respect of enforcing our rights with respect to investments in existing portfolio companies; 

the costs of any public offerings of our Common Shares and other securities, including registration and listing fees; 

the Management Fee and any Incentive Fee; 

certain costs and expenses relating to distributions paid on our Common Shares; 

administration fees payable under our Administration Agreement; 

costs of preparing financial statements and maintaining books and records and filing reports or other documents with the SEC (or other regulatory bodies) and other reporting and compliance costs, and the compensation of professionals responsible for the preparation of the foregoing, including the allocable portion of the compensation of our Chief Financial Officer, Chief Compliance Officer and other professionals who provide operational and administrative services to us pursuant to the Administration Agreement (based on the percentage of time those individuals devote, on an estimated basis, to our business and affairs); 

43 

debt service and other costs of borrowings or other financing arrangements; 

the Adviser s allocable share of costs incurred in providing significant managerial assistance to those portfolio companies that request it; 

amounts payable to third parties relating to, or associated with, making or holding investments; 

transfer agent and custodial fees; 

costs of hedging; 

commissions and other compensation payable to brokers or dealers; 

taxes; 

Independent Trustees fees and expenses; 

the costs of any reports, proxy statements or other notices to our shareholders (including printing and mailing costs), the costs of any shareholders meetings and the compensation of investor relations personnel responsible for the preparation of the foregoing and related matters; 

our fidelity bond; 

trustees and officers/errors and omissions liability insurance, and any other insurance premiums; 

indemnification payments; 

direct costs and expenses of administration, including audit, accounting, consulting and legal costs; and 

all other expenses reasonably incurred by us in connection with making investments and administering our business. 

We expect that during periods of asset growth, our general and administrative expenses will be relatively stable or will decline as a percentage of total assets, and will increase as a percentage of total assets during periods of asset declines. 
 Leverage 
 While as a BDC the amount of leverage that we are permitted to use is limited in significant respects, we use leverage to increase our ability to make investments. The amount of leverage we use in any period depends on a variety of factors, including cash available for investing, the cost of financing and general economic and market conditions, however, under the 1940 Act, our total borrowings are limited so that our asset coverage ratio cannot fall below 150 immediately after any borrowing, as defined in the 1940 Act. In any period, our interest expense will depend largely on the extent of our borrowing and we expect interest expense will increase as we increase leverage over time within the limits of the 1940 Act. In addition, we may dedicate assets as collateral to financing facilities from time to time. 
 Market Trends 
 We believe trends in the middle-market lending environment, including the limited availability of capital from traditional regulated financial institutions, strong demand for debt capital and specialized lending requirements, are likely to continue to create favorable opportunities for us to invest at attractive risk-adjusted rates. 
 Subsequent to the global financial crisis, the implementation of regulatory changes such as Basel III requirements, Leverage Lending Guidance, and the Volcker Rule, tightened risk appetites and reduced the capacity of traditional lenders to serve middle-market companies. We believe that these dynamics create a significant opportunity for us to directly originate investments. We also believe that the large amount of uninvested capital held by private equity firms will continue to drive deal activity, which may in turn create additional demand for debt capital. 
 This market dynamic is further exacerbated by the specialized due diligence and underwriting capabilities, as well as extensive ongoing monitoring, required for middle-market lending. We believe middle-market lending is generally more labor-intensive than lending to larger companies due to smaller investment sizes and the lack of publicly available information on these companies. As a result, the opportunities for dedicated private lenders such as us has continued to expand. 
 An imbalance between the supply of, and demand for, middle-market debt capital creates attractive pricing dynamics for investors such as BDCs. The negotiated nature of middle-market financings also generally provides for more favorable terms to the lenders, including stronger covenant and reporting packages, better call protection and lender-protective change of control provisions. We believe that BDCs have flexibility to develop loans that reflect each borrower s distinct situation, provide long-term relationships and a potential source for future capital, which renders BDCs, including us, attractive lenders.

The Adviser monitors our portfolio companies on an ongoing basis. The Adviser monitors the financial trends of each portfolio company to determine if it is meeting its business plans and to assess the appropriate course of action for each company. The Adviser has a number of methods of evaluating and monitoring the performance and fair value of our investments, which may include the following: 
 assessment of success of the portfolio company in adhering to its business plan and compliance with covenants; 

periodic and regular contact with portfolio company management and, if appropriate, the financial or strategic sponsor, to discuss financial position, requirements and accomplishments; 

comparisons to other companies in the industry; 

attendance at, and participation in, board meetings; and 

review of monthly and quarterly financial statements and financial projections for portfolio companies. 

As part of the monitoring process, the Adviser regularly assesses the risk profile of each of our investments and, on a quarterly basis, grades each investment on a risk scale of 1 to 5. Risk assessment is not standardized in our industry and our risk assessment may not be comparable to ones used by our competitors. Our assessment is based on the following categories: 
 An investment is rated 1 if, in the opinion of the Adviser, it is performing as agreed and there are no concerns about the portfolio company s performance or ability to meet covenant requirements. For these investments, the Adviser generally prepares monthly reports on investment performance and intensive quarterly asset reviews. 

An investment is rated 2 if it is performing as agreed, but, in the opinion of the Adviser, there may be concerns about the company s operating performance or trends in the industry. For these investments, in addition to monthly reports and quarterly asset reviews, the Adviser also researches any areas of concern with the objective of early intervention with the portfolio company. 

An investment will be assigned a rating of 3 if it is paying its obligations to us as agreed but a material covenant violation is expected. For these investments, in addition to monthly reports and quarterly asset reviews, the Adviser also adds the investment to its watch list and researches any areas of concern with the objective of early intervention with the portfolio company. 

46 

An investment will be assigned a rating of 4 if a material covenant has been violated, but the company is making its scheduled payments on its obligations to us. For these investments, the Adviser generally prepares a bi-monthly asset review email and generally has monthly meetings with the portfolio company s senior management. For investments where there have been material defaults, including bankruptcy filings, failures to achieve financial performance requirements or failure to maintain liquidity or loan-to-value requirements, the Adviser often will take immediate action to protect its position. These remedies may include negotiating for additional collateral, modifying investment terms or structure, or payment of amendment and waiver fees. 

A rating of 5 indicates an investment is in default on its interest and/or principal payments. For these investments, our Adviser reviews the investments on a bi-monthly basis and, where possible, pursues workouts that achieve an early resolution to avoid further deterioration of our investment. The Adviser retains legal counsel and takes actions to preserve our rights, which may include working with the portfolio company to have the default cured, to have the investment restructured or to have the investment repaid through a consensual workout. 

The following table shows the distribution of our investments on the 1 to 5 investment performance rating scale at fair value as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. Investment performance ratings are accurate only as of those dates and may change due to subsequent developments relating to a portfolio company s business or financial condition, market conditions or developments, and other factors.

Other general and administrative expenses increased from 2.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 to 4.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 
 Income Taxes, Including Excise Taxes 
 We elected to be treated as a RIC under Subchapter M of the Code, and we operate in a manner so as to continue net realized to qualify for the tax treatment applicable to RICs. To qualify as a RIC, we must, among other things, distribute to our shareholders in each taxable year generally at least 90 of our investment company taxable income, as defined by the Code, and net tax-exempt income for that taxable year. To maintain our RIC status, we, among other things, have made and intend to continue to make the requisite distributions to our shareholders, which generally relieve us from corporate-level U.S. federal income taxes. 
 Depending on the level of taxable income earned in a tax year, we can be expected to carry forward taxable income (including net capital gains, if any) in excess of current year dividend distributions from the current tax year into the next tax year and pay a nondeductible 4 U.S. federal excise tax on such taxable income, as required. To the extent that we determine that our estimated current year annual taxable income will be in excess of estimated current year dividend distributions from such income, we accrue excise tax on estimated excess taxable income. 
 For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, we recorded no net expense and 2.2 million, respectively, for U.S. federal excise tax and other taxes. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, we recorded a net expense of 0.4 million and 1.1 million, respectively, for U.S. federal excise tax and other taxes.

 For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, we had net realized gains on investments of 0.1 million and 3.7 million, respectively. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, we had no realized gains or losses on investments. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, we had net realized gains on foreign currency investments of less than 0.1 million and 0.8 million, respectively. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, we had no net realized gains or losses on foreign currency investments. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, we had net realized losses of less than 0.1 million and net realized gains of 0.2 million, respectively, on foreign currency transactions. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, we had net realized losses of 0.5 million and 0.4 million, respectively, on foreign currency transactions, primarily as a result of translating foreign currency related to our non-USD denominated investments. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, we had net realized losses of 0.1 million and net realized gains of 2.2 million, respectively, on foreign currency borrowings. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, we had no net realized gains or losses on foreign currency borrowings. 
 For the three months ended September 30, 2024, we had 62.5 million in unrealized gains on 49 portfolio company investments, which was offset by 6.4 million in unrealized losses on 12 portfolio company investments. Unrealized gains primarily resulted from tightening credit spreads and positive portfolio company specific developments. Unrealized losses primarily resulted from negative portfolio company specific developments.

Unrealized gains primarily resulted from tightening credit spreads and positive portfolio company specific developments. Unrealized losses primarily resulted from negative portfolio company specific developments. 
 For the three months ended September 30, 2023, we had 28.9 million in unrealized gains on 20 portfolio company investments, which was offset by 2.8 million in unrealized losses on 9 portfolio company investments. Unrealized gains were driven by an increase in fair value, primarily due to tightening credit spreads. For the nine months ended September 30, 2023, we had 44.2 million in unrealized gains on 25 portfolio company investments, which was offset by 3.6 million in unrealized losses on 4 portfolio company investments. Unrealized gains were driven by an increase in fair value, primarily due to tightening credit spreads. 
 For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, we had 30.0 million and 25.0 million, respectively, in unrealized losses on foreign currency borrowings, primarily as a result of fluctuations in the GBP, EUR, and SEK exchange rates. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, we had 3.9 million and 2.8 million in unrealized gains, respectively, on foreign 
 50 

currency borrowings, primarily as a result of fluctuations in EUR and GBP. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, we had less than 0.1 million in unrealized losses and no unrealized gains or losses, respectively, on foreign currency cash. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, we had no gains or losses and less than 0.1 million in unrealized losses, respectively, on foreign currency cash. 
 Realized Gross Internal Rate of Return 
 Since we began investing in 2022 through September 30, 2024, weighted by capital invested, our exited investments have generated an average realized gross internal rate of return to us of 22.9 (based on total capital invested of 61.2 million and total proceeds from these exited investments of 72.2 million). One hundred percent of these exited investments resulted in a realized gross internal rate of return to us of 10 or greater. 
 Gross IRR, with respect to an investment, is calculated based on the dates that we invested capital and dates we received distributions, regardless of when we made distributions to our shareholders. Initial investments are assumed to occur at time zero, and all cash flows are deemed to occur on the fifteenth of each month in which they occur. 
 Gross IRR reflects historical results relating to our past performance and is not necessarily indicative of our future results. In addition, gross IRR does not reflect the effect of Management Fees, expenses, Incentive Fees or taxes borne, or to be borne, by us or our shareholders, and would be lower if it did. 
 Average gross IRR is the average of the gross IRR for each of our exited investments (each calculated as described above), weighted by the total capital invested for each of those investments. 
 Average gross IRR on our exited investments reflects only invested and realized cash amounts as described above, and does not reflect any unrealized gains or losses in our portfolio. 
 Internal rate of return, or IRR, is a measure of our discounted cash flows (inflows and outflows). Specifically, IRR is the discount rate at which the net present value of all cash flows is equal to zero. That is, IRR is the discount rate at which the present value of total capital invested in each of our investments is equal to the present value of all realized returns from that investment. Our IRR calculations are unaudited. 
 Capital invested, with respect to an investment, represents the aggregate cost basis allocable to the realized or unrealized portion of the investment, net of any upfront fees paid at closing for the term loan portion of the investment. Capital invested also includes realized losses on hedging activity, with respect to an investment, which represents any inception-to-date realized losses on foreign currency forward contracts allocable to the investment, if any. 
 Realized returns, with respect to an investment, represents the total cash received with respect to each investment, including all amortization payments, interest, dividends, prepayment fees, upfront fees, administrative fees, agent fees, amendment fees, accrued interest, and other fees and proceeds. Realized returns also include realized gains on hedging activity, with respect to an investment, which represents any inception-to-date realized gains on foreign currency forward contracts allocable to the investment, if any. 
 Interest Rate and Foreign Currency Hedging 
 We use interest rate swaps to hedge our fixed rate debt and certain fixed rate investments. We have designated certain interest rate swaps to be in a hedge accounting relationship. See Note 2 for additional disclosure regarding our accounting for derivative instruments designated in a hedge accounting relationship. See Note 5 for additional disclosure regarding these derivative instruments and the interest payments paid and received. See Note 7 for additional disclosure regarding the carrying value of our debt. 
 Our current approach to hedging the foreign currency exposure in our non-U.S. dollar denominated investments is primarily to borrow the par amount in local currency under our Credit Facilities to fund these investments. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, we had 30.0 million and 25.0 million in unrealized losses, respectively, on the translation of our non-U.S. dollar denominated debt into U.S. dollars; such amounts approximate the corresponding unrealized losses on the translation of our non-U.S. dollar denominated investments into U.S. dollars for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, we had 3.9 million and 2.8 million unrealized gains, respectively, on the translation of our non-U.S. dollar denominated debt into U.S. dollars; such amounts approximate the corresponding unrealized gains on the translation of our non-U.S. dollar denominated investments into U.S. dollars for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023. In the determination of the second component of the Incentive Fee, any unrealized gains/(losses) specifically related to the foreign currency denominated borrowings of non-US dollar denominated investments is offset against any associated unrealized gains/(losses) related to foreign currency denominated investments. See our Consolidated Schedule of Investments for additional disclosure regarding the foreign currency amounts (in both par and fair value) of our non-U.S. dollar denominated investments.

Financial Condition, Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 Our liquidity and capital resources are derived primarily from proceeds from equity issuances, advances from our Credit Facilities, and cash flows from operations. The primary uses of our cash and cash equivalents are: 
 investments in portfolio companies and other investments and to comply with certain portfolio diversification requirements; 

the cost of operations (including paying our Adviser); 

debt service, repayment, and other financing costs; and 

cash dividends to the holders of our shares. 

We intend to continue to generate cash primarily from cash flows from operations, future borrowings and future offerings of securities. We may from time to time enter into additional debt facilities, increase the size of existing facilities or issue debt securities. Any such incurrence or issuance would be subject to prevailing market conditions, our liquidity requirements, contractual and regulatory restrictions and other factors. In accordance with the 1940 Act, with certain limited exceptions, we are only allowed to incur borrowings, issue debt securities or issue preferred shares if immediately after the borrowing or issuance our ratio of total assets (less total liabilities other than indebtedness) to total indebtedness plus preferred shares, is at least 150 . For more information, see Key Components of Our Results of Operations Leverage above. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, our asset coverage ratio was 187.4 and 245.6 , respectively. We carefully consider our unfunded commitments for the purpose of planning our capital resources and ongoing liquidity including our financial leverage. Further, we maintain sufficient borrowing capacity within the 150 asset coverage limitation under the 1940 Act and the asset coverage limitation under our Credit Facilities to cover any outstanding unfunded commitments we are required to fund. 
 Cash and cash equivalents as of September 30, 2024 taken together with cash available under our Credit Facilities, and cash available from undrawn Capital Commitments, is expected to be sufficient for our investing activities and to conduct our operations in the near term. As of September 30, 2024, we had approximately 548.7 million and 184.6 million of availability on our Subscription Facility and Revolving Credit Facility, respectively, subject to asset coverage limitations. 
 As of September 30, 2024, we had 514.2 million in cash and cash equivalents, including 41.9 million of restricted cash. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, cash used in operating activities was 2,686.0 million, primarily attributable to funding portfolio investments of 3,256.1 million and other net operating activities of 324.6 million which was offset by repayments and proceeds from investments of 562.4 million, an increase in net assets resulting from operations of 332.3. Cash provided by financing activities was 3,191.4 million during the period due to borrowings of 6,283.8 million and proceeds from the capital calls of 1,049.7 million, which were partially offset by paydowns on debt of 4,026.5 million and other financing activities of 115.6 million. 
 Equity 
 We have entered into subscription agreements (the Subscription Agreements with investors providing for the private placement of our Common Shares. Under the terms of the Subscription Agreements, investors are required to fund drawdowns to purchase our Common Shares up to the amount of their respective Capital Commitment on an as-needed basis each time we deliver a drawdown notice to our investors. As of September 30, 2024, we had received Capital Commitments totaling 7.4 billion 4.7 billion remaining undrawn). As of December 31, 2023, we had received Capital Commitments totaling 7.4 billion 5.7 billion remaining undrawn). 
 The following tables summarize the total Common Shares issued and proceeds received related to the Company s capital drawdowns delivered pursuant to the Subscription Agreements for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023:

2029 Notes 
 On March 4, 2024, we issued 600 million aggregate principal amount of unsecured notes that mature on March 11, 2029 (the 2029 Notes ). The principal amount of the 2029 Notes is payable at maturity. The 2029 Notes bear interest at a rate of 6.50 per year, payable semi-annually commencing on September 11, 2024, and may be redeemed in whole or in part at our option at any time at par plus a make whole premium. Total proceeds from the issuance of the 2029 Notes, net of underwriting discounts, offering costs and original issue discount, were 586.0 million. We used the net proceeds of the 2029 Notes to repay outstanding indebtedness under the Revolving Credit Facility and Subscription Facility. 
 On June 10, 2024, we issued an additional 150 million aggregate principal amount of unsecured notes that mature on March 11, 2029. The additional 2029 Notes are a further issuance of, fungible with, rank equally in right of payment with and have the same terms (other than the issue date and the public offering price) as the initial issuance of the 2029 Notes. Total proceeds from the issuance of the additional 2029 Notes, net of underwriting discounts, offering costs and original issue premium were 147.8 million. We used the net proceeds of the 2029 Notes to repay outstanding indebtedness under the Revolving Credit Facility and Subscription Facility. 
 We entered into two interest rate swaps to align the interest rates of its liabilities with our investment portfolio, which consists of predominately floating rate loans. The notional amount of the two interest rates swaps are 600.0 million and 150.0 million, respectively, each of which matures on March 11, 2029, matching the maturity date of the 2029 Notes. As a result of the swap, the Company s effective interest rate on the 2029 Notes is SOFR plus 2.45 (on a weighted average basis). The interest expense related to the 2029 Notes is offset by proceeds received from the interest rate swaps designated as a hedge. The swap adjusted interest expense is included as a component of interest expense on the Company s Consolidated Statements of Operations. As of September 30, 2024, the effective hedge interest rate swaps had a fair value of 22.5 million which is offset within interest expense by an equal, but opposite, fair value change for the hedged risk on the 2029 Notes. 
 2030 Notes 
 On September 16, 2024, we issued 600 million aggregate principal amount of unsecured notes that mature on January 15, 2030 (the 2030 Notes ).

Total proceeds from the issuance of the 2030 Notes, net of underwriting discounts, offering costs and original issue discount, were 591.7 million. We used the net proceeds of the 2030 Notes to repay outstanding indebtedness under the Revolving Credit Facility and Subscription Facility. 
 We entered into an interest rate swap to align the interest rate of its liability with the our investment portfolio, which consists of predominately floating rate loans. The notional amount of the interest rate swap is 600.0 million which matures on January 15, 2030, matching the maturity date of the 2030 Notes. As a result of the swap, our effective interest rate on the 2030 Notes is SOFR plus 2.55 . The interest expense related to the 2030 Notes is offset by proceeds received from the interest rate swaps designated as a hedge. The swap adjusted interest expense is included as a component of interest expense on the Company s Consolidated Statements of Operations. As of September 30, 2024, the effective hedge interest rate swaps had a fair value of (3.2) million which is offset within interest expense by an equal, but opposite, fair value change for the hedged risk on the 2030 Notes.

 Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 
 Portfolio Company Commitments 
 From time to time, we may enter into commitments to fund investments. We incorporate these commitments into our assessment of our liquidity position. Our senior secured revolving loan commitments are generally available on a borrower s demand and may remain outstanding until the maturity date of the applicable loan. Our senior secured delayed draw term loan commitments are generally available on a borrower s demand and, once drawn, generally have the same remaining term as the associated loan agreement. Undrawn senior secured delayed draw term loan commitments generally have a shorter availability period than the term of the associated loan agreement. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 we had the following commitments to fund investments in current portfolio companies:

57 

Other Commitments and Contingencies 
 As of September 30, 2024, we had unfunded commitments of 275.8 million to new borrowers that are not current portfolio companies. As of December 31, 2023 we did not have any unfunded commitments to fund investments to new borrowers that were not current portfolio companies as of such date. 
 From time to time, we may become a party to certain legal proceedings incidental to the normal course of our business. As of September 30, 2024, management is not aware of any material pending or threatened litigation that would require accounting recognition or financial statement disclosure. 
 We have certain contracts under which we have material future commitments. Under the Investment Advisory Agreement, our Adviser provides us with investment advisory and management services. For these services, we pay the Management Fee and the Incentive Fee. 
 Under the Administration Agreement, our Adviser furnishes us with office facilities and equipment, provides us clerical, bookkeeping and record keeping services at such facilities and provides us with other administrative services necessary to conduct our day-to-day operations. We reimburse our Adviser or its affiliates for the allocable portion (subject to the review and approval of our Board) of expenses incurred by it in performing its obligations under the Administration Agreement, and the fees and expenses associated with performing compliance functions. Such reimbursable amounts include the allocable portion of the compensation of our Chief Compliance Officer, Chief Financial Officer and other professionals who provide operational and administrative services to us pursuant to the Administration Agreement. We reimburse the Adviser (or its affiliates) for the allocable portion of the compensation paid by the Adviser (or its affiliates) to such individuals based on a percentage of time those individuals devote, on an estimated basis, to our business and affairs. We may also reimburse the Adviser or its affiliates for the allocable portion of overhead expenses (including rent, office equipment and utilities) attributable thereto. Our Adviser also offers on our behalf significant managerial assistance to those portfolio companies to which we are required to offer to provide such assistance.

Distributions 
 We have elected and qualified to be treated for U.S. federal income tax purposes as a RIC under subchapter M of the Code. To maintain RIC status, we must distribute (or be treated as distributing) in each taxable year dividends for tax purposes equal to at least 90 percent of the sum of our: 
 investment company taxable income (which is generally our ordinary income plus the excess of realized net short-term capital gains over realized net long-term capital losses), determined without regard to the deduction for dividends paid, for such taxable year; and 

net tax-exempt interest income (which is the excess of our gross tax-exempt interest income over certain disallowed deductions) for such taxable year. 

As a RIC, we (but not our shareholders) generally will not be subject to U.S. federal income tax on investment company taxable income and net capital gains that we distribute to our shareholders. 
 We intend to distribute annually all or substantially all of such income. To the extent that we retain our net capital gains or any investment company taxable income, we generally will be subject to corporate-level U.S. federal income tax. We may choose to retain our net capital gains or any investment company taxable income, and pay the U.S. federal excise tax described below. 
 58 

Amounts not distributed on a timely basis in accordance with a calendar year distribution requirement are subject to a nondeductible 4 U.S. federal excise tax payable by us. To avoid this tax, we must distribute (or be treated as distributing) during each calendar year an amount at least equal to the sum of: 
 98 of our net ordinary income excluding certain ordinary gains or losses for that calendar year; 

98.2 of our capital gain net income, adjusted for certain ordinary gains and losses, recognized for the twelve-month period ending on October 31 of that calendar year; and 

100 of any income or gains recognized, but not distributed, in preceding years. 

While we intend to distribute any income and capital gains in the manner necessary to minimize imposition of the 4 U.S. federal excise tax, sufficient amounts of our taxable income and capital gains may not be distributed to avoid entirely the imposition of this tax. In that event, we will be liable for this tax only on the amount by which we do not meet the foregoing distribution requirement. 
 We intend to pay quarterly dividends to our shareholders out of assets legally available for distribution. All dividends will be paid at the discretion of our Board and will depend on our earnings, financial condition, maintenance of RIC status, compliance with applicable BDC regulations and such other factors as our Board may deem relevant from time to time. 
 To the extent our current taxable earnings for a year fall below the total amount of our distributions for that year, a portion of those distributions may be deemed a return of capital to our shareholders for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Thus, the source of a distribution to our shareholders may be the original capital invested by the shareholder rather than our income or gains. Shareholders should read any written disclosure carefully and should not assume that the source of any distribution is our ordinary income or gains. 
 We have adopted an opt out dividend reinvestment plan for our common shareholders. As a result, if we declare a cash dividend or other distribution, each shareholder that has not opted out of our dividend reinvestment plan will have their dividends or distributions automatically reinvested in additional shares of our Common Shares rather than receiving cash dividends. Shareholders who receive distributions in the form of Common Shares will be subject to the same U.S. federal, state and local tax consequences as if they received cash distributions. 
 Related-Party Transactions 
 We have entered into a number of business relationships with affiliated or related parties, including the following: 
 the Investment Advisory Agreement; and 

the Administration Agreement 

Critical Accounting Estimates 
 Our critical accounting policies and estimates, including those relating to the valuation of our investment portfolio, are described in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023, filed with the SEC on February 16, 2024, and elsewhere in our filings with the SEC. The critical accounting policies and estimates should be read in connection with our risk factors discussed in Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023. 
 ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATI VE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 
 We are subject to financial market risks, including valuation risk, interest rate risk and currency risk. 
 Valuation Risk 
 We have invested, and plan to continue to invest, primarily in illiquid debt and equity securities of private companies. Most of our investments will not have a readily available market price, and we value these investments at fair value as determined in good faith by our Board in accordance with our valuation policy. There is no single standard for determining fair value. As a result, determining fair value requires that judgment be applied to the specific facts and circumstances of each portfolio investment while employing a consistently applied valuation process for the types of investments we make. If we were required to liquidate a portfolio investment in a forced or liquidation sale, we may realize amounts that are different from the amounts presented and such differences could be material. 
 59 

Interest Rate Risk 
 Interest rate sensitivity refers to the change in earnings that may result from changes in the level of interest rates. We also fund portions of our investments with borrowings. Our net investment income is affected by the difference between the rate at which we invest and the rate at which we borrow. Accordingly, we cannot assure you that a significant change in market interest rates will not have a material adverse effect on our net investment income. 
 We regularly measure our exposure to interest rate risk. We assess interest rate risk and manage our interest rate exposure on an ongoing basis by comparing our interest rate-sensitive assets to our interest rate-sensitive liabilities. Based on that review, we determine whether or not any hedging transactions are necessary to mitigate exposure to changes in interest rates. 
 
 As of September 30, 2024, 97.5 of our debt investments based on fair value in our portfolio bore interest at floating rates, with 100 of these subject to interest rate floors. Our credit facilities also bear interest at floating rates, and in connection with our 2029 Notes and 2030 Notes, which bear interest at fixed rates, we entered into fixed-to-floating interest rate swaps in order to align the interest rates of our liabilities with our investment portfolio. 
 Assuming that our Consolidated Balance Sheet as of September 30, 2024 were to remain constant and that we took no actions to alter our existing interest rate sensitivity, the following table shows the annualized impact of hypothetical base rate changes in interest rates (considering interest rate floors for floating rate instruments): 

in millions)

Although we believe that this analysis is indicative of our existing sensitivity to interest rate changes, it does not adjust for changes in the credit market, credit quality, the size and composition of the assets in our portfolio and other business developments that could affect our net income. Accordingly, we cannot assure you that actual results would not differ materially from the analysis above.
 
 We may in the future hedge against interest rate fluctuations by using hedging instruments such as additional interest rate swaps, futures, options and forward contracts. While hedging activities may mitigate our exposure to adverse fluctuations in interest rates, certain hedging transactions that we may enter into in the future, such as interest rate swap agreements, may also limit our ability to participate in the benefits of changes in interest rates with respect to our portfolio investments. 
 Currency Risk 
 From time to time, we may make investments that are denominated in a foreign currency. These investments are translated into U.S. dollars at each balance sheet date, exposing us to movements in foreign exchange rates. We may employ hedging techniques to minimize these risks, but we cannot assure you that such strategies will be effective or without risk to us. We may seek to utilize instruments such as, but not limited to, forward contracts to seek to hedge against fluctuations in the relative values of our portfolio positions from changes in currency exchange rates. We also have the ability to borrow in certain foreign currencies under our Credit Facilities. Instead of entering into a foreign exchange forward contract in connection with loans or other investments we have made that are denominated in a foreign currency, we may borrow in that currency to establish a natural hedge against our loan or investment. To the extent the loan or investment is based on a floating rate other than a rate under which we can borrow under our Credit Facilities, we may seek to utilize interest rate derivatives to hedge our exposure to changes in the associated rate. 
 ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures. As of the end of the period covered by this report, we carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act )). Any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives. Based on that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that our current disclosure controls and procedures are 
 60 

effective in timely alerting them to material information relating to us that is required to be disclosed by us in the reports we file or submit under the Exchange Act. 
 Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting. There have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during our most recently completed fiscal quarter that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 
 PART II OTHE R INFORMATION 
 ITEM 1. Legal Proceedings. 
 From time to time, we may be a party to certain legal proceedings in the ordinary course of business, including proceedings relating to the enforcement of our rights under loans to or other contracts with our portfolio companies. We are not currently subject to any material legal proceedings, nor, to our knowledge, is any material legal proceeding threatened against us. 

Item 2. Unregistered Sales of Equit y Securities and Use of Proceeds. 
 Refer to our Current Report on Form 8-K filed with SEC on September 27, 2024, for information about unregistered sales of our equity securities during the quarter ended September 30, 2024.
