 Held-For-Sale Classification 
 Assets classified as held-for-sale are segregated and reported in Assets held-for-sale in our Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets beginning in the period in which the assets are classified as held-for-sale. At September 30, 2024, we recorded Assets held-for-sale, primarily consisting of real estate, of million. At December 31, 2023, we recorded Assets held-for-sale and Liabilities held-for-sale, primarily consisting of AIG Life U.K. and real estate, of billion and billion, respectively. 
 Out-of-period adjustment 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company recorded an million out-of-period adjustment, which increased earnings, primarily related to the correction of net investment income for certain securities and corrections related to the calculation of certain actuarially determined balances. The Company evaluated the impact of the error and out-of-period adjustment and concluded it was not material to any previously issued interim or annual consolidated financial statements and the adjustment is not expected to be material to the year ending December 31, 2024.

reportable segments: 
 Individual Retirement consists of fixed annuities, fixed index annuities and variable annuities. 
 Group Retirement consists of recordkeeping, plan administrative and compliance services, financial planning and advisory solutions offered in-plan, along with proprietary and limited non-proprietary annuities, advisory and brokerage products offered out-of-plan. 
 Life Insurance primary products in the United States include term life and universal life insurance. The International Life business issued individual and group life insurance in the United Kingdom and distributed private medical insurance in Ireland. On October 31, 2023 Corebridge completed the sale of Laya and on April 8, 2024 completed the sale of AIG Life U.K. 
 Institutional Markets consists of stable value wrap SVW products, structured settlement and pension risk transfer PRT annuities, guaranteed investment contracts GICs and Corporate Markets products that include corporate- and bank-owned life insurance COLI-BOLI ), private placement variable universal life and private placement variable annuity products. 
 Corporate and Other consists primarily of: 
 corporate expenses not attributable to our other segments; 
 interest expense on financial debt; 
 results of our consolidated investment entities; 
 institutional asset management business, which includes managing assets for non-consolidated affiliates; and 
 results of our legacy insurance lines ceded to Fortitude Re. 
 We evaluate segment performance based on adjusted revenues and adjusted pre-tax operating income (loss) APTOI ). Adjusted revenues are derived by excluding certain items from total revenues. APTOI is derived by excluding certain items from income from operations before income tax. These items generally fall into one or more of the following broad categories: legacy matters having no relevance to our current businesses or operating performance; adjustments to enhance transparency to the underlying economics of transactions; and adjustments that we believe to be common to the industry. Legal entities are attributed to each segment based upon the predominance of activity in that legal entity. 
 APTOI excludes the impact of the following items: 
 Fortitude Re related adjustments: 
 The modified coinsurance modco reinsurance agreements with Fortitude Re transfer the economics of the invested assets supporting the reinsurance agreements to Fortitude Re. Accordingly, the net investment income on Fortitude Re funds withheld assets and the net realized gains (losses) on Fortitude Re funds withheld assets are excluded from APTOI. Similarly, changes in the Fortitude Re funds withheld embedded derivative are also excluded from APTOI. 
 The ongoing results associated with the reinsurance agreement with Fortitude Re have been excluded from APTOI as these are not indicative of our ongoing business operations.

 There were no issuances during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 for invested assets.

 Transfers of Level 3 Assets 
 During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, transfers into Level 3 assets primarily included certain investments in private placement corporate debt, commercial mortgage backed securities CMBS ), collateralized loan obligations CLO and asset-backed securities ABS ). Transfers of private placement corporate debt and certain ABS into Level 3 assets were primarily the result of limited market pricing information that required us to determine fair value for these securities based on inputs that are adjusted to better reflect our own assumptions regarding the characteristics of a specific security or associated market liquidity. The transfers of investments in CMBS, CLO and certain ABS into Level 3 assets were due to diminished market transparency and liquidity for individual security types.

 (a) Represents discount rates, estimates and assumptions that we believe would be used by market participants when valuing these assets and liabilities. 
 (b) The weighted averaging for fixed maturity securities is based on the estimated fair value of the securities. Because the valuation methodology for embedded derivatives within policyholder contract deposits and MRBs uses a range of inputs that vary at the contract level over the cash flow projection period, management believes that presenting a range, rather than weighted average, is a more meaningful representation of the unobservable inputs used in the valuation. 
 (c) Information received from third-party valuation service providers. The ranges of the unobservable inputs for constant prepayment rate, loss severity and constant default rate relate to each of the individual underlying mortgage loans that comprise the entire portfolio of securities in the RMBS and CLO securitization vehicles and not necessarily to the securitization vehicle bonds (tranches) purchased by us. The ranges of these inputs do not directly correlate to changes in the fair values of the tranches purchased by us because there are other factors relevant to the fair values of specific tranches owned by us, including, but not limited to, purchase price, position in the waterfall, senior versus subordinated position and attachment points. 
 (d) The Fortitude Re funds withheld payable has been excluded from the above table. As discussed in Note 7 , the Fortitude Re funds withheld payable is created through modco and funds withheld reinsurance arrangements where the investments supporting the reinsurance agreements are withheld by and continue to reside on Corebridge s Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. This embedded derivative is valued as a total return swap with reference to the fair value of the invested assets held by Corebridge. Accordingly, the unobservable inputs utilized in the valuation of the embedded derivative are a component of the invested assets supporting the reinsurance agreements that are held on Corebridge s Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. 
 (e) The ranges for these inputs vary due to the different GMWB product specification and policyholder characteristics across in-force policies. Policyholder characteristics that affect these ranges include age, policy duration, and gender. 
 (f) Mortality inputs are shown as multipliers of the 2012 Individual Annuity Mortality Basic table. 
 (g) The partial withdrawal utilization unobservable input range shown applies only to policies with GMWB riders. 
 (h) The NPA applied as a spread over risk-free curve for discounting. 
 (i) The fixed index annuities embedded derivative associated with index credits related to the contracts with guaranteed product features included in policyholder contract deposits was billion and billion at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. 
 The ranges of reported inputs for obligations of states, municipalities and political subdivisions, corporate debt, RMBS, CLO/ABS and CMBS valued using a discounted cash flow technique consist of one standard deviation in either direction from the value-weighted average. The preceding table does not give effect to our risk management practices that might offset risks inherent in these Level 3 assets and liabilities.

We did not recognize the unrealized losses in earnings on these fixed maturity securities at September 30, 2024 because it was determined that such losses were due to non-credit factors. Additionally, we neither intend to sell the securities nor do we believe that it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell these securities before recovery of their amortized cost basis. For fixed maturity securities with significant declines, we performed fundamental credit analyses on a security-by-security basis, which included consideration of credit enhancements, liquidity position, expected defaults, industry and sector analysis, forecasts and available market data.

 Certain of our subsidiaries are members of Federal Home Loan Banks FHLB and such membership requires the members to own stock in these FHLBs. We owned an aggregate of million and million of stock in FHLBs at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. In addition, our subsidiaries have pledged securities available-for-sale and residential loans associated with borrowings and funding agreements from FHLBs, with a fair value of billion and billion, respectively, at September 30, 2024 and billion and billion, respectively, at December 31, 2023. 
 Certain GICs recorded in policyholder contract deposits with a carrying value of million and million at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively, have provisions that require collateral to be posted or payments to be made by us upon a downgrade of our Insurer Financial Strength IFS ratings. The actual amount of collateral required to be posted to the counterparties in the event of such downgrades and the aggregate amount of payments that we could be required to make depend on market conditions, the fair value of outstanding affected transactions and other factors prevailing at and after the time of the downgrade. The fair value of securities pledged as collateral with respect to these obligations was approximately million and million at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. This collateral primarily consists of securities of the U.S. government and government-sponsored entities and generally cannot be repledged or resold by the counterparties. 
 As part of our collateralized reinsurance transactions, we pledge collateral to cedants as contractually required. The fair value of securities pledged as excess collateral with respect to these obligations was approximately million and million at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. Additionally, assets supporting these transactions are held solely for the benefit of the cedants and insulated from obligations owed to our other policyholders and general creditors.

 million and billion of residential mortgage loans and commercial mortgage loans, respectively, are in nonaccrual status. As of December 31, 2023, million and million of residential mortgage loans and commercial mortgage loans, respectively, were placed on nonaccrual status. 
 Accrued interest is presented separately and is included in Accrued investment income on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets.

As of December 31, 2023, accrued interest receivable was million and million associated with residential mortgage loans and commercial mortgage loans, respectively. 
 A significant majority of commercial mortgages in the portfolio are non-recourse loans and, accordingly, the only guarantees are for specific items that are exceptions to the non-recourse provisions. It is therefore extremely rare for us to have cause to enforce the provisions of a guarantee on a commercial real estate or mortgage loan. 
 Nonperforming loans are generally those loans where payment of contractual principal or interest is more than 90 days past due. Nonperforming loans were not significant for all periods presented.

 The loan-to-value ratio compares the current unpaid principal balance of the loan to the estimated fair value of the underlying property collateralizing the loan. Our weighted average loan-to-value ratio was at September 30, 2024 and at December 31, 2023. The loan-to-value ratios have been updated within the last three months to reflect the current carrying values of the loans. We update the valuations of collateral properties by obtaining independent appraisals, generally at least once per year.

 Does not include allowance for credit losses of million and million at September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, in relation to the off-balance-sheet commitments to fund commercial mortgage loans, which is recorded in Other liabilities in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. 
 Our expectations and models used to estimate the allowance for losses on commercial and residential mortgage loans are regularly updated to reflect the current economic environment. 
 LOAN MODIFICATIONS 
 The allowance for credit losses incorporates an estimate of lifetime expected credit losses and is recorded on each asset upon asset origination or acquisition. The starting point for the estimate of the allowance for credit losses is historical loss information, which includes losses from modifications of receivables to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty. We use a probability of default/loss given default model to determine the allowance for credit losses for our commercial and residential mortgage loans. An assessment of whether a borrower is experiencing financial difficulty is made on the date of a modification. 
 Because the effect of most modifications made to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty is already included in the allowance for credit losses utilizing the measurement methodologies used to estimate the allowance, a change to the allowance for credit losses is generally not recorded upon modification. 
 When modifications are executed, they often will be in the form of principal forgiveness, term extensions, interest rate reductions, or some combination of any of these concessions. When principal is forgiven, the amortized cost basis of the asset is written off against the allowance for credit losses. The amount of the principal forgiveness is deemed to be uncollectible; therefore, that portion of the loan is written off, resulting in a reduction of the amortized cost basis and a corresponding adjustment to the allowance for credit losses. 
 We assess whether a borrower is experiencing financial difficulty based on a variety of factors, including the borrower s current default on any of its outstanding debt, the probability of a default on any of its debt in the foreseeable future without the modification, the insufficiency of the borrower s forecasted cash flows to service any of its outstanding debt (including both principal and interest), and the borrower s inability to access alternative third party financing at an interest rate that would be reflective of current market conditions for a non-troubled debtor. 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, commercial mortgage loans with an amortized cost of million (including million supporting the funds withheld arrangements with Fortitude Re) and commercial loans, other loans and notes receivable with an amortized cost of million (none of which were supporting the funds withheld arrangements with Fortitude Re, and million of which is related to the loans previously modified in 2023) were granted term extensions and adjustment of interest rates. The modified loans represent less than and , respectively, of these portfolio segments. These modifications added less than to the weighted average life of loans in each of these two portfolio segments. 
 There were no loans that defaulted during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, that had been previously modified with borrowers experiencing financial difficulties. 
 Corebridge closely monitors the performance of the loans modified to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty to understand the effectiveness of its modification efforts. All loans with borrowers with financial difficulty that have been modified in the previous 12 months are current and performing in conjunction with its modified terms.

 COLLATERAL 
 We engage in derivative transactions that are not subject to a clearing requirement directly with related parties and unaffiliated third parties, in most cases under International Swaps and Derivatives Association, Inc. ISDA Master Agreements. Many of the ISDA Master Agreements also include Credit Support Annex provisions, which provide for collateral postings that may vary based on criteria such as ratings and threshold levels. We attempt to reduce our risk with certain counterparties by entering into agreements that enable collateral to be obtained from a counterparty on an up-front or contingent basis. We minimize the risk that counterparties might be unable to fulfill their contractual obligations by monitoring counterparty credit exposure and collateral value and generally requiring additional collateral to be posted upon the occurrence of certain events or circumstances. 
 Collateral posted by us to third parties for derivative transactions was billion and billion at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. collateral was posted by us to related parties for derivative transactions at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. In the case of collateral posted under derivative transactions that are not subject to clearing, this collateral can generally be repledged or resold by the counterparties. Collateral provided to us from third parties for derivative transactions was billion and billion at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. Collateral provided to us from related parties for derivative transactions was million and million at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. In the case of collateral provided to us under derivative transactions that are not subject to clearing, we generally can repledge or resell collateral.

million and million, respectively, and for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, million and million, respectively, have been reclassified into Interest expense. The remaining amount in AOCI, of million, will be reclassified into Interest expense over the life of the hedging relationship, which can extend up to years. We expect million to be reclassified into Interest expense over the next 12 months. There are no amounts excluded from the assessment of hedge effectiveness that are recognized in earnings. 
 For additional information related to the debt issuances, see Note 17 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in the 2023 Form 10-K. 
 We also designated certain interest rate swaps as cash flow hedges of floating-rate investment assets. Related to such swaps, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, we recognized derivative gains (losses) of million and million, respectively, in AOCI and ) million and ) million, respectively, in net investment income. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, ) million and ) million, respectively, in AOCI and ) million and ) million, respectively, in net investment income. As it relates to such hedges, we do not expect any reclassifications into net investment income over the next 12 months and there are no amounts excluded from the assessment of hedge effectiveness that are recognized in earnings. 
 We use cross-currency swaps as hedging instruments in net investment hedge relationships to mitigate the foreign exchange risk associated with our non-U.S. dollar functional currency foreign subsidiaries. For net investment hedge relationships that use derivatives as hedging instruments, we assess hedge effectiveness and measure hedge ineffectiveness using changes in forward rates. We recognized gains (losses) for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 of ) million and ) million, respectively, and for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 of million and million, respectively, included in Change in foreign currency translation adjustment in OCI related to the net investment hedge relationships. The gains (losses) recognized primarily include transactions with related parties. A qualitative methodology is utilized to assess hedge effectiveness for net investment hedges, while regression analysis is employed for all other hedges.

interest in Corebridge, resulting in tax deconsolidation of Corebridge from the AIG Consolidated Tax Group. Under the tax law, AGC and its directly owned life insurance subsidiaries (the AGC Group will not be permitted to join in the filing of a U.S. consolidated federal income tax return with our other subsidiaries (collectively, the Non-Life Group for the five-year waiting period. Instead, the AGC Group is expected to file separately as members of the AGC Group consolidated U.S. federal income tax return during the five-year waiting period. Following the five-year waiting period, the AGC Group is expected to join the U.S. consolidated federal income tax return with the Non-Life Group. 
 RECLASSIFICATION OF CERTAIN TAX EFFECTS FROM AOCI 
 We use an item-by-item approach to release the stranded or disproportionate income tax effects in AOCI related to our available-for-sale securities. Under this approach, a portion of the disproportionate tax effects is assigned to each individual security lot at the date the amount becomes lodged. When the individual securities are sold, mature or are otherwise impaired on an other-than-temporary basis, the assigned portion of the disproportionate tax effect is reclassified from AOCI to income (loss) from operations.

 . The effective tax rate on loss from operations differs from the statutory tax rate of primarily due to tax benefits associated with the release of U.S. federal and state valuation allowance, and dividends received deduction. These tax benefits were partially offset by tax charges associated with reclassifications from AOCI to income from operations related to the disposal of available-for-sale securities, state and local income taxes, and net tax adjustments related to prior year returns including interest. 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the effective tax rate on loss from operations was . The effective tax rate on loss from operations differs from the statutory tax rate of primarily due to tax benefits associated with dividends received deduction, excess tax benefits related to share based compensation payments recorded through the income statement, adjustments to deferred tax assets, renewable energy tax credits, and reclassifications from AOCI to income from operations related to the disposal of available-for-sale securities. These tax benefits were partially offset by the establishment of additional U.S. federal and foreign valuation allowance and tax charges associated with state and local income taxes. 
 For the three months ended September 30, 2023, the effective tax rate on income from operations was . The effective tax rate on income from operations differs from the statutory tax rate of primarily due to tax benefits associated with the establishment of outside basis as a result of the held-for-sale designation of Laya and AIG Life U.K., partial release of valuation allowance, dividends received deduction, tax adjustments related to prior year returns, and reclassifications from AOCI to income from operations related to the disposal of available-for-sale securities. These tax benefits were partially offset by tax charges associated with state and local income taxes. 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2023, the effective tax rate on income from operations was . The effective tax rate on income from operations differs from the statutory tax rate of primarily due to tax benefits associated with the establishment of outside basis as a result of the held-for-sale designation of Laya and AIG Life U.K., dividends received deduction, adjustments to deferred tax assets, reclassifications from AOCI to income from operations related to the disposal of available-for-sale securities, tax adjustments related to prior year returns, partial release of valuation allowance, and excess tax benefits related to share based compensation payments recorded through the income statement. These tax benefits were partially offset by tax charges associated with state and local income taxes. 
 ASSESSMENT OF DEFERRED TAX ASSET VALUATION ALLOWANCE 
 The evaluation of the recoverability of our deferred tax asset and the need for a valuation allowance requires us to weigh all positive and negative evidence to reach a conclusion that it is more likely than not that all or some portion of the deferred tax asset will not be realized. The weight given to the evidence is commensurate with the extent to which it can be objectively verified. The more negative evidence that exists, the more positive evidence is necessary and the more difficult it is to support a conclusion that a valuation allowance is not needed. 
 As discussed above, under the tax law, the AGC Group will not be permitted to join in the filing of a U.S. consolidated federal income tax return with the Non-Life Group for the five-year waiting period following the IPO. Instead, the AGC Group is expected to file separately as members of the AGC consolidated U.S. federal income tax return during this period. Following the five-year waiting period, the AGC Group is expected to join U.S. consolidated federal income tax return with the Non-Life Group. Each separate U.S. federal tax filing group or separate U.S. tax filer is required to consider this five-year waiting period when assessing realization of their respective deferred tax assets including net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. 
 Our separation from AIG resulted in an ownership change for U.S. federal income tax purposes under Section 382 of the Code. As a result of the ownership change, a limitation has been imposed upon the utilization of our U.S. net operating loss carryforwards and certain built-in losses and deductions to offset future taxable income. Our utilization is limited to approximately million per year. These limitation amounts accumulate for future use to the extent they are not utilized in a given year. 
 Recent events, changes in target interest rates by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System and significant market volatility, impacted actual and projected results of our business operations as well as our views on potential effectiveness of certain prudent and feasible tax planning strategies. In order to demonstrate the predictability and sufficiency of future taxable income necessary to support the realizability of the net operating losses and foreign tax credit carryforwards, we have considered forecasts of future income for each of our businesses, including assumptions about future macroeconomic and Corebridge-specific conditions and events, and any impact these conditions and events may have on our prudent and feasible tax planning strategies.

 ITEM 1 | Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited) | 19. Income Taxes million and million primarily attributable to current year activity. As of September 30, 2024, the balance sheet reflects a valuation allowance of million related to our tax attribute carryforwards and a portion of certain other deferred tax assets that are no longer more-likely-than-not to be realized. 
 Estimates of future taxable income, including income generated from prudent and feasible actions and tax planning strategies, impact of settlements with taxing authorities, and any changes to interpretations and assumptions related to the impact of the Inflation Reduction Act or the Tax Act, could change in the near term, perhaps materially, which may require us to consider any potential impact to our assessment of the recoverability of the deferred tax asset. Such potential impact could be material to our consolidated financial condition or results of operations for an individual reporting period. 
 For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, recent changes in market conditions, including changes in interest rates, impacted the unrealized tax capital gains and losses in the U.S. Life insurance companies available-for-sale securities portfolio, resulting in a deferred tax asset related to net unrealized tax capital losses. The deferred tax asset relates to the unrealized capital losses for which the carryforward period has not yet begun, and as such, when assessing its recoverability, we consider our ability and intent to hold the underlying securities to recovery. As of September 30, 2024, based on all available evidence, we concluded that a valuation allowance should be established on a portion of the deferred tax asset related to unrealized capital losses that are not more-likely-than-not to be realized. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, we recorded an increase/(decrease) in valuation allowance of ) million and million, respectively, associated with the unrealized tax capital losses in the U.S. Life insurance companies available-for-sale securities portfolio. As of September 30, 2024, the balance sheet reflects a valuation allowance of billion associated with the unrealized tax capital losses in the U.S. Life Insurance Companies available-for-sale securities portfolio, all of which was allocated to OCI. Additionally, as of September 30, 2024, based on all available evidence, we concluded that a valuation allowance should not be established on a portion of the deferred tax asset related to realized tax capital losses. As of September 30, 2024, we released million of valuation allowance associated with the realized tax capital losses from the insurance companies available-for-sale securities portfolio. 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we recognized a million increase in deferred tax asset valuation allowance associated with certain foreign jurisdictions.

 Executive Summary 
 
 OVERVIEW 
 We are one of the largest providers of retirement solutions and insurance products in the United States, committed to helping individuals plan, save for and achieve secure financial futures. We offer a broad set of products and services through our market leading Individual Retirement, Group Retirement, Life Insurance and Institutional Markets businesses, each of which features capabilities and industry experience we believe are difficult to replicate. These four businesses collectively seek to enhance stockholder returns while maintaining our attractive risk profile, which has historically resulted in consistent and strong cash flow generation. 
 
 REVENUES 
 Our revenues come from five principal sources: 
 Premiums are principally derived from our traditional life insurance and certain annuity products including pension risk transfer PRT transactions and structured settlements with life contingencies. Our premium income is driven by growth in new policies and contracts written and persistency of our in-force policies, both of which are influenced by a combination of factors including our efforts to attract and retain customers and market conditions that influence demand for our products; 
 Policy fees are principally derived from our individual retirement, group retirement, universal life insurance, Corporate Markets and SVW products. Our policy fees typically vary directly with the underlying account value or benefit base of our annuities. Account value and benefit base are influenced by changes in economic conditions, including changes in levels of equity prices, and changes in levels of interest rates and credit spreads, as well as net flows; 
 Net investment income from our investment portfolio varies as a result of the yield, allocation and size of our investment portfolio, which are, in turn, a function of capital market conditions and net flows into our total investments, as well as the expenses associated with managing our investment portfolio; 
 Net realized gains (losses), net include changes in the Fortitude Re funds withheld embedded derivative, risk management related derivative activities (excluding hedges of certain MRBs), changes in the fair value of embedded derivatives in certain of our insurance products and trading activity within our investment portfolio, including trading activity related to the Fortitude Re modco arrangement. Net realized gains (losses) vary due to the timing of sales of investments as well as changes in the fair value of embedded derivatives in certain of our insurance products and derivatives utilized to hedge certain embedded derivatives; and 
 Advisory fee income and other income includes fees from registered investment advisory services, 12b-1 fees (marketing and distribution fees paid by mutual funds), other asset management fee income and commission-based broker-dealer services. 
 
 BENEFITS AND EXPENSES 
 Our benefits and expenses come from six principal sources: 
 Policyholder benefits are driven primarily by customer withdrawals and surrenders from traditional products which change in response to changes in capital market conditions and changes in policy reserves, as well as life contingent benefit payments on life and annuity contracts and updates to assumptions related to future policyholder behavior, mortality and longevity; 
 Interest credited to policyholder account balances varies in relation to the amount of the underlying account value or benefit base and also includes changes in the fair value of certain embedded derivatives related to our insurance products and amortization of deferred sales inducement assets; 
 Amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs and value of business acquired for all contracts except for other investment contracts is amortized, on a constant level basis over the expected term of the related contracts, using assumptions consistent with those used in estimating the related liability for future policy benefits, or any other related balances, for those corresponding contracts, as applicable. VOBA is determined at the time of acquisition and is reported with DAC. This value is based on the present value of future pre-tax profits discounted at yields applicable at the time of purchase; 
 General operating expenses include expenses associated with conducting our business, including salaries, other employee-related compensation and other operating expenses such as professional services or travel; 
 Change in the fair value of market risk benefits, net represents the changes in fair value of MRBs contained within certain insurance contracts (excluding the impact of changes in our own credit risk), including attributed fees, along with the changes in the fair value of derivatives that economically hedge MRBs. Changes in our own credit risk are included in OCI; and

 ITEM 2 | Executive Summary 

 Interest expense represents the charges associated with our external debt obligations, including debt of consolidated investment entities. This expense varies based on the amount of debt on our balance sheet, as well as the rates of interest associated with those obligations. Interest expense related to consolidated investment entities principally relates to variable interest entities VIEs for which we are the primary beneficiary; however, creditors or beneficial interest holders of VIEs generally only have recourse to the assets and cash flows of the VIEs and do not have recourse to us except in limited circumstances when we have provided a guarantee to the VIE s interest holders. 
 
 SIGNIFICANT FACTORS IMPACTING OUR RESULTS 
 The following significant factors have impacted, and may in the future impact, our business, results of operations, financial condition and liquidity. 
 Impact of Fortitude Re 
 In 2018, AIG established Fortitude Re, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Fortitude Group Holdings, LLC Fortitude Holdings ), in a series of reinsurance transactions related to certain of AIG s legacy operations. In February 2018, AGL, VALIC and USL entered into modco agreements with Fortitude Re, a registered Class 4 and Class E reinsurer in Bermuda. Following the sale of AIG s majority ownership interest in Fortitude Holdings, AIG contributed its remaining ownership in Fortitude Re Bermuda and its one seat on its Board of Managers to us. As of September 30, 2024, our ownership interest in Fortitude Re was 2.46 . 
 In the modco arrangement, the investments supporting the reinsurance agreements, which reflect the majority of the consideration that would be paid to the reinsurer for entering into the transaction, are withheld by, and therefore continue to reside on the balance sheet of, the ceding company (i.e., AGL, VALIC and USL) thereby creating an obligation for the ceding company to pay the reinsurer (i.e., Fortitude Re) at a later date. Additionally, since we maintain ownership of these investments, we reflect our existing accounting for these assets, which consist primarily of available-for-sale securities (e.g., the changes in fair value of available-for-sale securities are recognized within OCI) on our balance sheet. We have established a funds withheld payable to Fortitude Re while simultaneously establishing a reinsurance asset representing liabilities for the insurance coverage that Fortitude Re has assumed. The funds withheld payable contains an embedded derivative and changes in fair value of this derivative are recognized in Net realized gains (losses) on Fortitude Re funds withheld embedded derivative. This embedded derivative is considered a total return swap with contractual returns that are attributable to various assets, primarily available-for-sale securities, associated with these reinsurance agreements. As the majority of the invested assets supporting the modco are fixed income securities that are available-for-sale, there is a mismatch between the accounting for the embedded derivative as its changes in fair value are recorded through net income while changes in the fair value of the fixed maturity securities available-for-sale are recorded through OCI. 
 Our net income experiences ongoing volatility as a result of the reinsurance agreements, which, as described above, give rise to a funds withheld payable that contains an embedded derivative. However, this net income volatility is almost entirely offset with a corresponding change in OCI, which reflects the fair value change from the investment portfolio supporting the funds withheld payable, which is primarily available-for-sale securities, resulting in minimal impact to our comprehensive income (loss) and equity attributable to Corebridge. The Company has also elected the fair value option on the acquisition of certain new fixed maturity securities, helping reduce the mismatch over time. 
 As of September 30, 2024, 26.3 billion of reserves had been ceded to Fortitude Re. 
 For additional information on our reinsurance agreements with Fortitude Re, see Note 7 to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. 
 
 Impact of Variable Annuity Guaranteed Benefit Riders and Hedging 
 Our Individual Retirement and Group Retirement businesses offer variable annuity products with riders that provide guaranteed benefits. The liabilities are accounted for as MRBs and measured at fair value. The fair value of the MRBs may fluctuate significantly based on market interest rates, equity prices, credit spreads, market volatility, policyholder behavior and other factors. 
 In addition to risk-mitigating features in our variable annuity product design, we have an economic hedging program designed to manage market risk from GMWBs, including exposures to changes in interest rates, equity prices, credit spreads and volatility. The hedging program includes all in-force GMWB policies and utilizes derivative instruments, including, but not limited to, equity options, futures contracts and interest rate swap and option contracts, as well as fixed maturity securities.

 Embedded Derivatives for Fixed Index Annuity and Index Universal Life Products 
 Fixed index annuity contracts contain index interest credits which are accounted for as embedded derivatives and our index universal life insurance products also contain embedded derivatives. Policyholders may elect to rebalance among the various crediting strategies within the product at specified renewal dates. At the end of each index term, we generally have the opportunity to re-price the index component by establishing different participation rates or caps on index credited rates. The index crediting feature of these products results in the recognition of an embedded derivative that is required to be bifurcated from the host contract and carried at fair value with changes in the fair value of the liabilities recorded in Net realized gains (losses). Option pricing models are used to estimate fair value, taking into account assumptions for future index growth rates, volatility of the index, future interest rates and our ability to adjust the participation rate and the cap on index credited rates in light of market conditions and policyholder behavior assumptions. 
 The following table summarizes the fair values of the embedded derivatives for fixed index annuity and index universal life products: 
 (in millions) September 30, 2024 December 31, 2023 Fixed index annuities 8,905 6,953 Index universal life 1,184 989 
 
 Our Strategic Partnership with Blackstone 
 In 2021, we entered into a strategic partnership with Blackstone pursuant to which Blackstone acquired a 9.9 position in our common stock and we entered into a long-term asset management relationship with Blackstone IM. As of September 30, 2024, Blackstone managed approximately 67.5 billion in book value of assets in our investment portfolio. 
 For additional information on our Strategic Partnership with Blackstone, see Investments below. 
 Our Investment Management Agreements with BlackRock 
 Since April 2022, we entered into investment management agreements with BlackRock and its investment advisory affiliates. As of September 30, 2024, BlackRock managed approximately 86.3 billion in book value of assets in our investment portfolio, consisting of liquid fixed income and certain private placement assets. 
 For additional information on our Investment Management Agreements with BlackRock, see Investments below. 
 
 Fair Value Option Bond Securities 
 We elect the fair value option on certain bond securities. When the fair value option is elected, the realized and unrealized gains and losses on these securities are reported in net investment income. 
 The following table shows the net investment income reported on fair value option bond securities: 
 Three Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30, (in millions) 2024 2023 2024 2023 Net investment income - excluding Fortitude Re funds withheld assets 22 7 48 25 Net investment income - Fortitude Re funds withheld assets 230 (35) 379 76 Total 252 (28) 427 101 
 Separation Costs 
 In connection with our separation from AIG, we have incurred and expect to continue to incur one-time and recurring expenses. As of September 30, 2024, we have incurred approximately 519 million of one-time expenses on a pre-tax basis. These expenses primarily relate to replicating and replacing functions, systems and infrastructure provided by AIG; rebranding; and accounting advisory, consulting and actuarial fees. In addition to these separation costs, we expect to incur costs related to the evolution of our investments organization to reflect our strategic partnerships with key external managers, our implementation of BlackRock s Aladdin investment management technology platform and our expected reduction in fees for asset management services. 
 In addition, as part of Corebridge Forward, we aimed to achieve an annual run rate expense reduction of approximately 400 million on a pre-tax basis within 24 months of the IPO. Through September 30, 2024 we have acted upon or contracted the full 400 million of exit run rate savings on a pre-tax basis. Corebridge Forward is expected to have a cumulative cost to achieve of approximately 300 million on a pre-tax basis. As of September 30, 2024, the cost to achieve has been approximately 214 million.

 ITEM 2 | Executive Summary 

 Actuarial Assumption Changes 
 Most of the fixed annuities, fixed index annuities, variable annuity products and universal life insurance products we offer maintain policyholder deposits that are reported as liabilities and classified within either separate account liabilities or policyholder contract deposits. Our products and riders also impact liabilities for future policyholder benefits and unearned revenues and assets for DAC and DSI. The valuation of these assets and liabilities (other than deposits) is based on differing accounting methods depending on the product, each of which requires numerous assumptions and considerable judgment. The accounting guidance applied in the valuation of these assets and liabilities includes, but is not limited to, the following: (i) traditional life and limited pay insurance products for which actual experience is reflected in the liability and assumptions are reviewed and updated at least annually, if necessary, with the recognition and parenthetical presentation of any resulting re-measurement gain or loss in policyholder benefits (except for discount rate changes) in the income statement; (ii) certain product guarantees for which benefit liabilities are accrued over the life of the contract in proportion to actual and future expected policy assessments; (iii) certain product guarantees reported as market risk benefits or index crediting features accounted for as embedded derivatives which are carried at fair value; and (iv) unearned revenue and assets for DAC, VOBA and DSI which are amortized on a constant level basis over the expected term of the related contracts using assumptions consistent with those used in estimating the related liability for future policy benefits, or any other related balances, for those corresponding contracts, as applicable. 
 At least annually, typically in the third quarter, we conduct a comprehensive review of the underlying assumptions within our actuarially determined assets and liabilities. These assumptions include, but are not limited to, policyholder behavior, mortality, expenses, investment returns and policy crediting rates. Changes in assumptions can result in a significant change to the carrying value of product liabilities and assets and, consequently, the impact could be material to earnings in the period of the change.

 COREBRIDGE S MACROECONOMIC, INDUSTRY AND REGULATORY TRENDS 
 Our business is affected by industry and economic factors such as changes in interest rates and credit spreads; geopolitical tensions (including the ongoing armed conflicts between Ukraine and Russia and in the Middle East ); credit and equity market conditions; currency exchange rates; regulation; tax policy; competition; and general economic, market and political conditions. We continued to operate under market conditions in 2024 and 2023 characterized by factors such as higher interest rates, inflationary pressures, an uneven global economic recovery and global trade tensions. Responses by central banks and monetary authorities with respect to inflation, growth concerns and other macroeconomic factors have also affected global exchange rates and volatility. 
 Below is a discussion of certain industry and economic factors impacting our business: 
 Demographics 
 We expect our target market of individuals planning for retirement to continue to grow with the size of the U.S. population age 65 and over that is expected to increase by approximately 30 by 2030 from just ten years earlier. In addition, we believe that reduced employer-paid retirement benefits will drive an increasing need for our individual retirement solutions. Further, consumers in the United States continue to prefer purchasing life insurance and retirement products through an agent or advisor, which positions us favorably given our broad distribution platform and in-house advisory capabilities. We continue to seek opportunities to develop new products and adapt our existing products to the growing needs of individuals to plan, save for and achieve secure financial futures. 
 Equity Markets 
 Our financial results are impacted by the performance of equity markets, which impacts the performance of our alternative investment portfolio, fee income, MRBs and embedded derivatives. For instance, in our variable annuity separate accounts, mutual fund assets and brokerage and advisory assets, we generally earn fee income based on the account value, which fluctuates with the equity markets as a significant amount of these assets are invested in equity funds. The impact of equity market returns, both increases and decreases, is reflected in our results due to the impact on the account value and the fair values of equity-exposed securities in our investment portfolio. 
 Our hedging costs could also be significantly impacted by changes in the level of equity markets as rebalancing and option costs are tied to the equity market volatility. These hedging costs are partially offset by our rider fees that are tied to the level of the volatility index VIX ). As rebalancing and option costs increase or decrease, the rider fees will increase or decrease partially offsetting the hedging costs incurred. 
 For Additional information see Risk Factors Risks Relating to Market Conditions We are exposed to risk from equity market declines or volatility in the 2023 Form 10-K.

TABLE OF CONTENTS 
 ITEM 2 | Executive Summary 

 Market and other economic factors may result in increased credit impairments, downgrades and losses across single or numerous asset classes due to lower collateral values or deteriorating cash flow and profitability by borrowers could lead to higher defaults on our investment portfolio, especially in geographic, industry or investment sectors where we have higher concentrations of exposure, such as real estate related borrowings. These factors can also cause widening of credit spreads which could reduce investment asset valuations, decrease fee income and increase statutory capital requirements, as well as reduce the availability of investments that are attractive from a risk-adjusted perspective. 
 For additional information see Risk Factors Risks Relating to Market Conditions Our business is highly dependent on economic and capital market conditions in the 2023 Form 10-K. 
 Alternative investments include private equity funds which are generally reported on a one-quarter lag. Accordingly, changes in valuations driven by equity market conditions during the third quarter of 2024 may impact the private equity investments in the alternative investments portfolio in the fourth quarter of 2024. 
 Impact of Changes in the Interest Rate Environment 
 A rising interest rate environment benefits our spread income as we reinvest cash flows from existing business at higher rates and should have a positive impact on sales of spread-based products. 
 As of September 30, 2024, new investments continue to have higher yields than the yield on maturities and redemptions that we are experiencing in our existing portfolios. We actively manage our exposure to the interest rate environment through portfolio construction and asset-liability management, including spread management strategies for our investment-oriented products and economic hedging of interest rate risk from guarantee features in our variable annuities, but we may not be able to fully mitigate our interest rate risk by matching exposure of our assets relative to our liabilities. 
 Fluctuations in interest rates may result in changes to certain statutory reserve or capital requirements that are based on formulas or models that consider interest rates or prescribed interest rates, such as cash flow testing. Rising interest rates can have a mixed impact on statutory financials due to higher surrender activity, particularly for fixed annuities, offset by potentially lower reserves for other products under various statutory reserving frameworks. 
 Annuity Sales and Surrenders 
 Rising interest rates could create the potential for increased sales but could also drive higher surrenders relative to what we have already experienced. Fixed annuities have surrender charge periods, generally in the three-to-seven-year range. Fixed index annuities have surrender charge periods, generally in the five-to-ten-year range, and within our Group Retirement segment, certain of our fixed investment options are subject to other withdrawal restrictions, which may help mitigate increased early surrenders in a rising rate environment. In addition, older contracts that have higher minimum interest rates and continue to be attractive to contract holders have driven better than expected persistency in fixed annuities, although the liabilities for such contracts have continued to decrease over time in amount and as a percentage of the total annuity portfolio. We closely monitor surrenders of fixed annuities as contracts with lower minimum interest rates come out of the surrender charge period. 
 In October 2024, we announced the launch of Corebridge MarketLock Annuity, a registered index-linked annuity RILA contract. 
 Reinvestment and Spread Management 
 We actively monitor fixed income markets, including the level of interest rates, credit spreads and the shape of the yield curve. We also frequently review our interest rate assumptions and actively manage the crediting rates used for new and in-force business. Business strategies continue to evolve and we attempt to maintain profitability of the overall business in light of the interest rate environment. A rising interest rate environment results in improved yields on new investments and improves margins for our business while also making certain products, such as fixed annuities, more attractive to potential customers. However, the rising rate environment has resulted in lower values on general and separate account assets, mutual fund assets and brokerage and advisory assets that hold investments in fixed income assets. 
 For investment-oriented products, including universal life insurance, and variable, fixed and fixed index annuities, in each of our operating and reportable segments, our spread management strategies include disciplined pricing and product design for new business, modifying or limiting the sale of products that do not achieve targeted spreads, using asset-liability management to match assets to liabilities to the extent practicable and actively managing crediting rates to help mitigate some of the pressure on investment spreads. Renewal crediting rate management is guided by specific contract provisions designed to allow crediting rates to be reset at pre-established intervals and subject to minimum crediting rate guarantees. We expect to continue to adjust crediting rates on in-force business, as appropriate, to be responsive to changing rate environments. As interest rates rise, we may need to raise crediting rates on in-force business for competitive and other reasons, potentially offsetting a portion of the additional investment income resulting from investing in a higher interest rate environment.

TABLE OF CONTENTS 
 ITEM 2 | Executive Summary 

 Of the aggregate fixed account values of our Individual Retirement and Group Retirement annuity products, 48 and 54 were crediting at the contractual minimum guaranteed interest rate at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. The percentages of fixed account values of our annuity products that are currently crediting at rates above 1 were 45 and 50 at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. In the universal life insurance products in our Life Insurance business, 59 and 59 of the account values were crediting at the contractual minimum guaranteed interest rate at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. These businesses continue to focus on pricing discipline and strategies to manage the minimum guaranteed interest crediting rates offered on new sales in the context of regulatory requirements and competitive positioning. 
 For additional information on our investment and asset-liability management strategies, see Investments below. 
 Regulatory Environment 
 The insurance and financial services industries are generally subject to close regulatory scrutiny and supervision. Our operations are subject to regulation by a number of different types of domestic and international regulatory authorities, including securities, derivatives and investment advisory regulators. Our insurance subsidiaries are subject to regulation and supervision by the states and jurisdictions in which they do business. 
 We expect that the domestic and international regulations applicable to us and our regulated entities will continue to evolve for the foreseeable future. 
 For example, on March 6, 2024, the SEC adopted final rules that require registrants, including Corebridge, to disclose certain climate-related information in registration statements and annual reports. The final rules require registrants to disclose, among other things: the impacts of material climate-related risks; the processes for identifying, assessing and managing such risks; information about the oversight of climate-related risks by the board of directors and management s role in managing material climate-related risks; and information about any climate-related targets or goals that are material to a registrant's business, results of operations, or financial condition. The final rules also require, if material, disclosure of registrants Scope 1 and/or Scope 2 greenhouse gas emissions. In addition, registrants must disclose certain information in their audited financial statements, including aggregate expenditures expensed and losses as well as capitalized costs and charges, in each case as a result of severe weather events and other natural conditions, subject to de minimis disclosure thresholds. 
 The final rules include a phased-in compliance period beginning in fiscal year 2025 for large accelerated filers such as Corebridge. Numerous legal challenges were filed after the rule s adoption, which lawsuits have been consolidated in the Eighth Circuit. On April 4, 2024, the SEC exercised its discretion to stay the final rules pending completion of judicial review in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit. Corebridge is evaluating the potential impacts of these new requirements. However, if these requirements are implemented following completion of judicial review, they may increase the complexity of Corebridge s periodic reporting as a U.S. public company and are expected to result in additional compliance and reporting costs. 
 In addition, on April 25, 2024, the Department of Labor DOL published a final rule in the Federal Register updating the definition for when a person is an investment advice fiduciary for purposes of transactions with ERISA qualified plans, related plan participants and IRAs. The DOL also published changes with respect to existing prohibited transactions exemptions PTEs relating to such advice, including PTE 84-24 and PTE 2020-02. Orders staying the rule s September 23, 2024 effective date were issued by the U.S. District Courts for the Eastern District of Texas and the Northern District of Texas on July 25, 2024 and July 26, 2024, respectively, in connection with separate lawsuits challenging the rule. On September 20, 2024, DOL filed a notice of appeal confirming its intent to appeal these two orders to the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit. We are actively monitoring the progress of the litigation while continuing to evaluate potential impact of the DOL rule to our business.

 Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures and Key Operating Metrics 
 
 NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES 
 Throughout this MD A, we present our financial condition and results of operations in the way we believe will be most meaningful and representative of our business results. Some of the measurements we use are non-GAAP financial measures under SEC rules and regulations. We believe presentation of these non-GAAP financial measures allows for a deeper understanding of the profitability drivers of our business, results of operations, financial condition and liquidity. These measures should be considered supplementary to our results of operations and financial condition that are presented in accordance with GAAP and should not be viewed as a substitute for GAAP measures. The non-GAAP financial measures we present may not be comparable to similarly named measures reported by other companies. Reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures for future periods are not provided as we do not currently have sufficient data to accurately estimate the variables and individual adjustments for such reconciliations. 
 Adjusted revenues exclude Net realized gains (losses) except for gains (losses) related to the disposition of real estate investments, income from non-operating litigation settlements (included in Other income for GAAP purposes) and changes in fair value of securities used to hedge guaranteed living benefits (included in Net investment income for GAAP purposes). 
 The following table presents a reconciliation of Total revenues to Adjusted revenues: 
 Three Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30, (in millions) 2024 2023 2024 2023 Total revenues 2,616 5,505 12,162 15,524 Fortitude Re related items: Net investment (income) on Fortitude Re funds withheld assets (515) (233) (1,172) (897) Net realized (gains) losses on Fortitude Re funds withheld assets (157) 228 100 338 Net realized (gains) losses on Fortitude Re funds withheld embedded derivatives 1,509 (1,080) 1,451 (177) Subtotal - Fortitude Re related items 837 (1,085) 379 (736) Other non-Fortitude Re reconciling items: Changes in fair value of securities used to hedge guaranteed living benefits (13) (14) (44) (41) Other (income) loss - net (6) (8) (23) (22) Net realized (gains) losses 1,099 (317) 2,088 564 Subtotal - Other non-Fortitude Re reconciling items 1,080 (339) 2,021 501 Total adjustments 1,917 (1,424) 2,400 (235) Adjusted revenues 4,533 4,081 14,562 15,289 
 Represents all Net realized gains and losses except gains (losses) related to the disposition of real estate investments and earned income (periodic settlements and changes in settlement accruals) on derivative instruments used for non-qualifying (economic) hedging or for asset replication. Earned income for non-qualifying (economic) hedging or for asset replication is reclassified from Net realized gains and losses to specific APTOI line items (e.g., net investment income and interest credited to policyholder account balances) based on the economic risk being hedged. 
 Adjusted pre-tax operating income APTOI is derived by excluding the items set forth below from income from operations before income tax. These items generally fall into one or more of the following broad categories: legacy matters having no relevance to our current businesses or operating performance; adjustments to enhance transparency to the underlying economics of transactions; and recording adjustments to APTOI that we believe to be common in our industry. We believe the adjustments to pre-tax income are useful for gaining an understanding of our overall results of operations. 
 APTOI excludes the impact of the following items: 
 FORTITUDE RE RELATED ADJUSTMENTS: 
 The modified coinsurance modco reinsurance agreements with Fortitude Re transfer the economics of the invested assets supporting the reinsurance agreements to Fortitude Re. Accordingly, the net investment income on Fortitude Re funds withheld assets and the net realized gains (losses) on Fortitude Re funds withheld assets are excluded from APTOI. Similarly, changes in the Fortitude Re funds withheld embedded derivative are also excluded from APTOI. 
 The ongoing results associated with the reinsurance agreement with Fortitude Re have been excluded from APTOI as these are not indicative of our ongoing business operations.

 ITEM 2 | Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures and Key Operating Metrics 

 INVESTMENT RELATED ADJUSTMENTS: 
 APTOI excludes Net realized gains (losses) , except for gains (losses) related to the disposition of real estate investments. Net realized gains (losses), except for gains (losses) related to the disposition of real estate investments, are excluded as the timing of sales on invested assets or changes in allowances depend largely on market credit cycles and can vary considerably across periods. In addition, changes in interest rates may create opportunistic scenarios to buy or sell invested assets. Our derivative results, including those used to economically hedge insurance liabilities, or those recognized as embedded derivatives at fair value, are also included in Net realized gains (losses) and are similarly excluded from APTOI except earned income (periodic settlements and changes in settlement accruals) on derivative instruments used for non-qualifying (economic) hedges or for asset replication. Earned income on such economic hedges is reclassified from Net realized gains and losses to specific APTOI line items based on the economic risk being hedged (e.g., Net investment income and Interest credited to policyholder account balances). 
 MARKET RISK BENEFIT ADJUSTMENTS: 
 Certain of our variable annuity, fixed annuity and fixed index annuity contracts contain GMWBs and/or GMDBs which are accounted for as MRBs. Changes in the fair value of these MRBs (excluding changes related to our own credit risk), including certain rider fees attributed to the MRBs, along with changes in the fair value of derivatives used to hedge MRBs are recorded through Change in the fair value of MRBs, net and are excluded from APTOI. 
 Changes in the fair value of securities used to economically hedge MRBs are excluded from APTOI. 
 OTHER ADJUSTMENTS: 
 Other adjustments represent all other adjustments that are excluded from APTOI and includes the net pre-tax operating income (losses) from noncontrolling interests related to consolidated investment entities. The excluded adjustments include, as applicable: 
 restructuring and other costs related to initiatives designed to reduce operating expenses, improve efficiency and simplify our organization; 
 non-recurring costs associated with the implementation of non-ordinary course legal or regulatory changes or changes to accounting principles; 
 separation costs; 
 non-operating litigation reserves and settlements; 
 loss (gain) on extinguishment of debt, if any; 
 losses from the impairment of goodwill, if any; and 
 income and loss from divested or run-off business, if any. 
 Adjusted after-tax operating income attributable to our common shareholders Adjusted After-tax Operating Income or AATOI is derived by excluding the tax effected APTOI adjustments described above, as well as the following tax items from net income attributable to us: 
 reclassifications of disproportionate tax effects from AOCI, changes in uncertain tax positions and other tax items related to legacy matters having no relevance to our current businesses or operating performance; and 
 deferred income tax valuation allowance releases and charges.

Additionally, gains (losses) related to the disposition of real estate investments are also excluded from this adjustment. 
 
 Adjusted Book Value is derived by excluding AOCI, adjusted for the cumulative unrealized gains and losses related to Fortitude Re s funds withheld assets. We believe this measure is useful to investors as it eliminates the asymmetrical impact resulting from changes in fair value of our available-for-sale securities portfolio for which there is largely no offsetting impact for certain related insurance liabilities that are not recorded at fair value with changes in fair value recorded through OCI. It also eliminates asymmetrical impacts where our own credit non-performance risk is recorded through OCI.

 Adjusted Return on Average Equity Adjusted ROAE is derived by dividing AATOI by average Adjusted Book Value and is used by management to evaluate our recurring profitability and evaluate trends in our business. We believe this measure is useful to investors as it eliminates the asymmetrical impact resulting from changes in fair value of our available-for-sale securities portfolio for which there is largely no offsetting impact for certain related insurance liabilities that are not recorded at fair value with changes in fair value recorded through OCI. It also eliminates asymmetrical impacts where our own credit non-performance risk is recorded through OCI. In addition, we adjust for the cumulative unrealized gains and losses related to Fortitude Re s funds withheld assets since these fair value movements are economically transferred to Fortitude Re.

 Premiums and deposits is a non-GAAP financial measure that includes direct and assumed premiums received and earned on traditional life insurance policies and life-contingent payout annuities, as well as deposits received on universal life insurance, investment-type annuity contracts and GICs. We believe the measure of premiums and deposits is useful in understanding customer demand for our products, evolving product trends and our sales performance period over period.

 Fee and Spread income and Underwriting Margin 
 Fee income is defined as policy fees plus advisory fees plus other fee income. For our Institutional Markets segment, its SVW products generate fee income. 
 Spread income is defined as net investment income less interest credited to policyholder account balances, exclusive of amortization of deferred sales inducement assets. Spread income is comprised of both base spread income and variable investment income. For our Institutional Markets segment, its structured settlements, PRT and GIC products generate spread income, which includes premiums, net investment income, less interest credited and policyholder benefits and excludes the annual assumption update. 
 Underwriting margin for our Life Insurance segment includes premiums, policy fees, other income, net investment income, less interest credited to policyholder account balances and policyholder benefits and excludes the annual assumption update. For our Institutional Markets segment, its Corporate Markets products generate underwriting margin, which includes premiums, net investment income, policy and advisory fee income, less interest credited and policyholder benefits and excludes the annual assumption update. 
 Base portfolio income includes interest, dividends and foreclosed real estate income, net of investment expenses and non-qualifying (economic) hedges. 
 Variable investment income includes call and tender income, commercial mortgage loan prepayments, changes in market value of investments accounted for under the fair value option, interest received on defaulted investments (other than foreclosed real estate), income from alternative investments and other miscellaneous investment income, including income of certain partnership entities that are required to be consolidated. Alternative investments include private equity funds which are generally reported on a one-quarter lag. 
 Base spread income means base portfolio income less interest credited to policyholder account balances, excluding the amortization of deferred sales inducement assets. 
 Base net investment spread means base yield less cost of funds, excluding the amortization of deferred sales inducement assets. 
 Base yield means the returns from base portfolio income including accretion and impacts from holding cash and short-term investments.

 Three Months Ended September 30, 2024 to Three Months Ended September 30, 2023 Net Income Comparison 
 Income (loss) before income tax expense (benefit) 
 We recorded a pre-tax loss of 1.6 billion in the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to pre-tax income of 2.5 billion in the three months ended September 30, 2023. The change in pre-tax income was primarily due to: 
 higher net realized losses of 3.5 billion primarily driven by higher losses on the Fortitude Re balances; 
 unfavorable change in the fair value of market risk benefits, net of 1.0 billion primarily driven by the impacts of interest rates compared to the comparable period in the prior year; and 
 higher interest credited to policyholder account balances of 224 million primarily due to higher sales activity in fixed and fixed index annuities and continued growth in our GIC business.

 ITEM 2 Consolidated Results of Operations 

 Partially offset by: 
 higher net investment income of 639 million primarily driven by higher base portfolio income, higher variable investment income and higher income related to the Fortitude Re funds withheld assets. 
 Income tax expense (benefit) 
 For the three months ended September 30, 2024, there was an income tax benefit of 407 million on loss from operations, resulting in an effective tax rate on loss from operations of 25.5 . 
 Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 to Nine Months Ended September 30, 2023 Net Income Comparison 
 We recorded a pre-tax loss of 122 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to pre-tax income of 2.7 billion in the nine months ended September 30, 2023.The change in pre-tax income was primarily due to: 
 higher net realized losses of 2.8 billion primarily driven by higher losses on the Fortitude Re balances; 
 lower premiums of 1.8 billion primarily on new pension risk transfer business; 
 unfavorable change in the fair value of market risk benefits, net of 743 million primarily driven by the impacts of lower interest rates compared to the comparable period in the prior year; and 
 higher interest credited to policyholder account balances of 593 million primarily due to higher sales activity in fixed and fixed index annuities and continued growth in our GIC business. 
 Partially offset by: 
 lower policyholder benefits of 1.5 billion primarily on new pension risk transfer business; 
 higher net investment income of 1.1 billion primarily driven by higher base portfolio income partially offset by lower variable investment income; and 
 higher net gain on divestitures of 190 million primarily from the gain on the sale of AIG Life U.K.

 Corporate and Other consists primarily of: 
 corporate expenses not attributable to our other segments; 
 interest expense on financial debt; 
 results of our consolidated investment entities; 
 institutional asset management business, which includes managing assets for non-consolidated affiliates; and

 (b) Other represents advisory fee expenses. 
 
 Financial Highlights 
 Three Months Ended September 30, 2024 to Three Months Ended September 30, 2023 APTOI Comparison 
 APTOI increased 81 million, primarily due to: 
 higher spread income of 57 million primarily driven by an increase in variable investment income of 34 million due to higher alternative income mostly due to improved private equity returns and higher yield enhancement income, and higher base spread income of 23 million due to improved base portfolio yields and growth in invested assets driven by higher general account sales; and 
 higher fee income of 32 million, primarily due to an increase in mortality and expense fees and other fee income due to higher average variable annuity separate account asset values driven by improved equity market returns.

 higher spread income of 186 million primarily driven by an increase in variable investment income of 34 million due to higher alternative income mostly due to improved private equity returns and higher yield enhancement income, higher base spread income of 152 million due to improved base portfolio yields and growth in invested assets driven by higher general account sales; and 
 higher fee income of 90 million, primarily due to an increase in mortality and expense fees and other fee income due to higher average variable annuity separate account asset values driven by improved equity market returns, and higher surrender charge fee income due to an increase in surrenders. 
 Partially offset by: 
 higher amortization of DAC and DSI of 26 million due to growth in Fixed and Fixed index annuity business; and 
 higher non-deferrable insurance commissions of 13 million mostly due to continued growth in the Fixed index annuity business.

 AUMA increased 13.6 billion driven by an increase of 11.2 billion in the general account and higher separate accounts asset values of 2.4 billion. The general account increased primarily due to positive general account net flows and lower interest rates resulting in unrealized gains from fixed maturities securities. The separate account increased primarily due to increases in the equity markets, partially offset by outflows from separate accounts.

 Individual Retirement annuities are typically subject to a three- to ten-year surrender charge period, depending on the product. For fixed annuities, the proportion of account value subject to surrender charge at September 30, 2024 increased compared to December 31, 2023 primarily due to growth in the business. For fixed index annuities, the proportion of account value subject to surrender charge at September 30, 2024 was slightly lower compared to December 31, 2023 due to the aging of the business. The increase in the proportion of account value with no surrender charge for variable annuities as of September 30, 2024 compared to December 31, 2023 was principally due to normal aging of the business.

 OVERVIEW 
 Our investment strategies are tailored to the specific business needs of each operating unit by targeting an asset allocation mix that supports estimated cash flows of our outstanding liabilities and provides diversification from asset class, sector, issuer and geographic perspectives. The primary objectives are generation of investment income, preservation of capital, liquidity management and growth of surplus. The majority of assets backing our insurance liabilities consist of fixed maturity securities, RMBS, CMBS, CLOs, other ABS and fixed maturity securities issued by government-sponsored entities and corporate entities. At September 30, 2024, for 221.1 billion of invested assets supporting our insurance operating companies, approximately 45 were in corporate debt securities. Mortgage-backed securities MBS ), ABS and CLOs represent 34 of our fixed income securities, and 99 were investment grade. At December 31, 2023, for 202.8 billion of invested assets supporting our insurance operating companies, approximately 47 were in corporate debt securities. MBS, ABS and CLOs represent 31 of our fixed income securities and 99 were investment grade. 
 See Business - Investment Management in the 2023 Form 10-K for further information, including current and future management of our investment portfolio. 
 
 Key Investment Strategies 
 Investment strategies are assessed at the segment level and involve considerations that include local and general market and economic conditions, duration and cash flow management, risk appetite and volatility constraints, rating agency and regulatory capital considerations, tax, regulatory and legal investment limitations, and, as applicable, environmental, social and governance considerations.

 ITEM 2 | Investments 

 In 2021, we entered into a long-term asset management relationship with Blackstone IM. Blackstone IM initially managed 50 billion of our existing investment portfolio, with that amount to increase to an aggregate of 92.5 billion by the third quarter of 2027. 
 The investments underlying the original 50 billion mandate with Blackstone IM began to run-off in 2022 and are being reinvested over time. As these assets run-off, we expect Blackstone to reinvest primarily in Blackstone-originated investments across a range of asset clas ses, including private and structured credit, and commercial and residential real estate securitized and whole loans. Blackstone s preferred credit and lending strategy is to seek to control all significant components of the underwriting and pricing processes with the goal of facilitating bespoke opportunities with historically strong credit protection and attractive risk-adjusted returns. Blackstone seeks to capture enhanced economics to those available in the traditional fixed income markets by going directly to the borrowers. 
 We believe that Blackstone s ability to originate attractive and privately sourced, fixed-income oriented assets, will be accretive to our businesses and provide us with an enhanced competitive advantage as we have been able to expand our investment capabilities, access new asset classes and improve our investment yields. We continue to manage asset allocation and portfolio-level risk management decisions with respect to any assets managed by Blackstone, ensuring that we maintain a consistent level of oversight across our entire investment portfolio considering our asset-liability matching needs, risk appetite and capital position. 
 As of September 30, 2024, Blackstone managed 67.5 billion in book value of assets in our investment portfolio. 
 Under the investment management agreements with BlackRock and its investment advisory affiliates, as of September 30, 2024, BlackRock managed approximately 86.3 billion in book value of assets in our investment portfolio, consisting of liquid fixed income and certain private placement assets. In addition, liquid fixed income assets associated with the Fortitude Re portfolio were separately transferred to BlackRock for management. The investment management agreements with BlackRock provide us with access to market-leading capabilities, including portfolio management, research and tactical strategies in addition to a larger pool of investment professionals. We believe BlackRock s scale and fee structure make BlackRock an excellent outsourcing partner for certain asset classes and will allow us to further optimize our investment management operating model while improving overall performance. The investment management agreements contain detailed investment guidelines and reporting requirements. 
 Some of our key investment strategies are as follows: 
 our fundamental strategy across the portfolios is to seek investments with similar characteristics to the associated insurance liabilities to the extent practicable; 
 we seek to purchase investments that offer enhanced yield through illiquidity premiums, such as private placements and commercial mortgage loans, which also add portfolio diversification. These assets typically afford credit protections through covenants, ability to customize structures that meet our insurance liability needs and deeper due diligence given information access; 
 we seek investments that provide diversification from assets available in local markets. To the extent we purchase these investments, we generally hedge any currency risk using derivatives, which could provide opportunities to earn higher risk-adjusted returns compared to investments in the functional currency; 
 we actively manage our assets and liabilities, counterparties and duration. Our liquidity sources are held primarily in the form of cash, short-term investments and publicly traded, investment grade rated fixed maturity securities that can be readily monetized through sales or repurchase agreements. Certain of our subsidiaries are members of the FHLBs in their respective districts, and we borrow from the FHLB utilizing its funding agreement program. Borrowings from FHLBs are used to supplement liquidity or for other uses deemed appropriate by management. This strategy allows us to both diversify our sources of liquidity and reduce the cost of maintaining sufficient liquidity; 
 within the United States, investments are generally split between reserve-backing and surplus portfolios: 
 insurance liabilities are backed mainly by investment grade fixed maturity securities that meet our duration, risk-return, tax liquidity, credit quality and diversification objectives. We assess asset classes based on their fundamental underlying risk factors, including credit (public and private), commercial real estate and residential real estate, regardless of whether such investments are bonds, loans or structured products; and 
 surplus investments seek to enhance portfolio returns and are generally comprised of a mix of fixed maturity investment grade and below investment grade securities and various alternative asset classes, including private equity, real estate equity and hedge funds. Over the past few years, hedge fund investments have been reduced; 
 outside of the United States, fixed maturity securities held by our insurance companies consist primarily of investment grade securities generally denominated in the currencies of the countries in which we operate; and 
 we also utilize derivatives to manage our asset and liability duration as well as currency exposures.

 ITEM 2 | Investments 

 Asset Liability Management 
 Our investment strategy is to invest in assets that generate net investment income to back policyholder benefit and deposit liabilities that result in stable distributable earnings and enhance portfolio value, subject to asset-liability management, capital, liquidity and regulatory constraints. 
 We use asset-liability management as a primary tool to monitor and manage interest rate and duration risk in our businesses. We maintain a diversified, high quality portfolio of fixed maturity securities issued by corporations, municipalities and other governmental agencies; structured securities collateralized by, among other assets, residential and commercial real estate; and commercial mortgage loans that, to the extent practicable, match the duration characteristics of the liabilities. We seek to diversify the portfolio across asset classes, sectors and issuers to mitigate idiosyncratic portfolio risks. The investment portfolio of each product line is tailored to the specific characteristics of its insurance liabilities, and as a result, duration varies between distinct portfolios. The interest rate environment has a direct impact on the asset liability management profile of the businesses, and changes in the interest rate environment may result in the need to lengthen or shorten the duration of the portfolio. In a rising rate environment, we may shorten the duration of the investment portfolio. 
 Fixed maturity securities of our domestic operations have an average duration of 6.5 years as of September 30, 2024. 
 In addition, we seek to enhance surplus portfolio returns through investments in a diversified portfolio of alternative investments. Although these alternative investments are subject to earnings fluctuations, they have historically achieved accumulative returns over time in excess of the fixed maturity portfolio returns.

 NAIC Designations of Fixed Maturity Securities 
 The Securities Valuation Office SVO of the National Association of Insurance Commissioners NAIC evaluates the investments of U.S. insurers for statutory reporting purposes and assigns fixed maturity securities to one of six categories called NAIC Designations. In general, NAIC Designations of 1, highest quality, or 2, high quality, include fixed maturity securities considered investment grade, while NAIC Designations of 3 through 6 generally include fixed maturity securities referred to as below investment grade. NAIC Designations for non-agency RMBS and CMBS are calculated using third-party modeling results provided through the NAIC. These methodologies result in an improved NAIC Designation for such securities compared to the rating typically assigned by the three major rating agencies. The following tables summarize the ratings distribution of our subsidiaries fixed maturity security portfolio by NAIC Designation, and the distribution by composite our credit rating, which is generally based on ratings of the three major rating agencies. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, 95 and 95 , respectively, of our fixed maturity security portfolio, excluding Fortitude Re funds withheld assets, were investment grade. The fixed maturity security portfolio of our insurance operating subsidiaries, excluding the Fortitude Re funds withheld assets, was 95 and 95 investment grade as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. The remaining below investment grade securities that are not included in consolidated investment entities relate to middle market and high yield bank loans securities.

 Change in Unrealized Gains and Losses on Investments 
 
 The change in net unrealized gains and losses on investments for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, was primarily attributable to a change in the fair value of fixed maturity securities. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, net unrealized gains related to fixed maturity securities were 7.0 billion and 4.7 billion, respectively, due to a decrease in interest rates. 
 The change in net unrealized gains and losses on investments for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 was primarily attributable to a change in the fair value of fixed maturity securities. For the three months ended September 30, 2023, net unrealized losses related to fixed maturity securities were 6.4 billion due to an increase in interest rates and a widening of credit spreads. For the nine months ended September 30, 2023, net unrealized losses were 4.1 billion due to increase in interest rates, partially offset by a narrowing of credit spreads.

 Higher net realized losses excluding Fortitude Re funds withheld assets in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to same periods in the prior year were due primarily to losses on sale of securities and foreign exchange transactions in the current period compared to lower losses on sale of securities and gain on foreign exchange transactions in the same period in the prior year. 
 Index-linked interest credited embedded derivatives, net of related hedges, reflected losses in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to gains and lower losses in the same period in the prior year, respectively. Fair value gains or losses in the hedging portfolio are typically not fully offset by increases or decreases in liabilities due to the non-performance or own credit risk adjustment used in the valuation of index-linked interest credited embedded derivatives, which are not hedged as part of our economic hedging program, and other risk margins used for valuation that cause the embedded derivatives to be less sensitive to changes in market rates than the hedge portfolio.

 Net realized gains (losses) on Fortitude Re funds withheld assets primarily reflect changes in the valuation of the modified coinsurance and funds withheld assets. Increases in the valuation of these assets result in losses to Corebridge as the appreciation on the assets under those reinsurance arrangements must be transferred to Fortitude Re. Decreases in valuation of the assets result in gains to Corebridge as the depreciation on the assets under those reinsurance agreements must be transferred to Fortitude Re.

 Derivatives and Hedge Accounting 
 We use derivatives and other financial instruments as part of our financial risk management programs and as part of our investment operations. Interest rate derivatives (such as interest rate swaps) are used to manage interest rate risk associated with both embedded derivatives and MRBs contained in insurance contract liabilities and fixed maturity securities as well as other interest rate sensitive assets and liabilities. Foreign exchange derivatives (principally foreign exchange forwards and swaps) are used to economically mitigate risk associated with foreign denominated investments, net capital exposures and foreign currency transactions. Equity derivatives are used to mitigate financial risk embedded in certain insurance liabilities and economically hedge certain investments. We use credit derivatives to manage our credit exposures. The derivatives are effective economic hedges of the exposures that they are meant to offset. In addition to hedging activities, we also enter into derivative instruments with respect to investment operations, which may include, among other things, credit default swaps CDS and purchases of investments with embedded derivatives, such as equity linked notes and convertible bonds. 
 We designated certain derivatives entered into with related parties as fair value hedges of available-for-sale investment securities held by our insurance subsidiaries. The fair value hedges include foreign currency forwards and cross-currency swaps designated as hedges of the change in fair value of foreign currency denominated available-for-sale securities attributable to changes in foreign exchange rates. We also designated certain interest rate swaps entered into with both third parties and related parties as fair value hedges of fixed rate GICs and commercial mortgage loans attributable to changes in benchmark interest rates. 
 Credit risk associated with derivative counterparties exists for a derivative contract when that contract has a positive fair value to us. The maximum potential exposure may increase or decrease during the life of the derivative commitments as a function of maturity and market conditions. All derivative transactions must be transacted within counterparty limits. 
 We utilize various credit enhancements, including guarantees, collateral, credit triggers and margin agreements, to reduce the credit risk related to outstanding financial derivative transactions. We require credit enhancements in connection with specific transactions based on, among other things, the creditworthiness of the counterparties and the transaction size and maturity. Furthermore, we enter into certain agreements that have the benefit of set-off and close-out netting provisions, such as ISDA Master Agreements. These provisions provide that, in the case of an early termination of a transaction, we can set off receivables from a counterparty against payables to the same counterparty arising out of all covered transactions. As a result, where a legally enforceable netting agreement exists, the fair value of the transaction with the counterparty represents the net sum of estimated fair values. 
 For additional information on embedded derivatives, see Notes 4 and 9 to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements.

 VARIABLE ANNUITY GUARANTEED BENEFITS AND HEDGING RESULTS 
 The following section provides discussion of our variable annuity guaranteed benefits and hedging results regarding our business segments. 
 
 Variable Annuity Guaranteed Benefits and Hedging Results 
 Our Individual Retirement and Group Retirement businesses offer variable annuity products with riders that provide guaranteed benefits. The liabilities are accounted for as MRBs and measured at fair value. The fair value of the MRBs may fluctuate significantly based on market interest rates, equity prices, credit spreads, market volatility, policyholder behavior and other factors. 
 In addition to risk-mitigating features in our variable annuity product design, we have an economic hedging program designed to manage market risk from GMWBs, including exposures to changes in interest rates, equity prices, credit spreads and volatility. The hedging program includes all in-force GMWB policies and utilizes derivative instruments, including but not limited to equity options, futures contracts and interest rate swap and option contracts, as well as fixed maturity securities. 
 For additional discussion of market risk management related to these product features, see Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk. 
 Differences in Valuation of MRBs and Economic Hedge Target 
 Our variable annuity hedging program utilizes an economic hedge target, which represents an estimate of the underlying economic risks in our GMWB riders. The economic hedge target differs from the GAAP valuation of the MRBs, creating volatility in our net income (loss) primarily due to the following: 
 the MRBs include both the GMWB riders and the GMDB riders while the hedge program is targeting the economic risks of just the GMWB rider; 
 the hedge program is designed to offset moves in the GMWB economic liability and therefore has a lower sensitivity to equity market changes than the MRBs; 
 the economic hedge target includes 100 of the GMWB rider fees in present value calculations; 
 the GAAP valuation reflects those fees attributed to the MRBs such that the initial value at contract issue equals zero. Since the MRB includes GMWBs and GMDBs these attributed fees are typically larger than just the GMWB rider fees; 
 the economic hedge target uses best estimate actuarial assumptions and excludes explicit risk margins used for GAAP valuation, such as margins for policyholder behavior, mortality and volatility; and 
 the economic hedge target excludes our own credit risk changes (NPAs) used in the GAAP valuation, which are recognized in OCI. The GAAP valuation has different sensitivities to movements in interest rates and other market factors, and to changes from actuarial assumption updates, than the economic hedge target. 
 For additional information on our valuation methodology for MRBs, see Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in the 2023 Form 10-K. 
 The market value of the hedge portfolio compared to the economic hedge target at any point in time may be different and is not expected to be fully offsetting. In addition to the derivatives held in conjunction with the variable annuity hedging program, we generally have cash and invested assets available to cover future claims payable under these guarantees. The primary sources of difference between the change in the fair value of the hedging portfolio and the economic hedge target include: 
 basis risk due to the variance between expected and actual fund returns, which may be either positive or negative; 
 realized volatility versus implied volatility; 
 actual versus expected changes in the hedge target driven by assumptions not subject to hedging, particularly policyholder behavior; and 
 risk exposures that we have elected not to explicitly or fully hedge.

 The following table presents a reconciliation between the fair value of the GAAP MRBs and the value of our economic hedge target:

 (793) (826) Market risk benefits liability, excluding NPA (104) 514 Adjustments for risk margins and differences in valuation 569 522 Economic hedge target liability 465 1,036 
 Impact on Pre-tax Income (Loss) 
 The impact on our pre-tax income (loss) of variable annuity guaranteed benefits and related hedging results includes changes in the fair value of MRBs and changes in the fair value of related derivative hedging instruments, and along with attributed rider fees and net of benefits associated with MRBs are together recognized in Change in the fair value of market risk benefits, net, with the exception of NPA changes, which are recognized in OCI. Changes in the fair value of market risk benefits, net are excluded from APTOI of Individual Retirement and Group Retirement. 
 The change in the fair value of the MRBs and the change in the value of the hedging portfolio are not expected to be fully offsetting, primarily due to the differences in valuation between the economic hedge target, the GAAP MRBs and the fair value of the hedging portfolio, as discussed above. When corporate credit spreads widen, the change in the NPA spread generally reduces the fair value of the MRBs liabilities, resulting in a gain in AOCI, and when corporate credit spreads tighten, the change in the NPA spread generally increases the fair value of the MRBs liabilities, resulting in a loss in AOCI. In addition to changes driven by credit market-related movements in the NPA spread, the NPA balance also reflects changes in business activity and in the net amount at risk from the underlying guaranteed living benefits. 
 Change in Economic Hedge Target 
 The decrease in the economic hedge target liability in the nine months ended September 30, 2024, was primarily driven by higher equity markets and the update of actuarial assumptions.

 ITEM 2 | Future Policy Benefits, Policyholder Contract Deposits and Market Risk Benefit 

 Three Months Ended September 30, 2024 
 Net impact on pre-tax income of 55 million was primarily driven by the update to actuarial assumptions. 
 On an economic basis, the changes in the fair value of the hedge portfolio were partially offset by the changes in the economic hedge target. In the three months ended September 30, 2024, we had a net mark-to-market gain of approximately 99 million from our hedging activities related to our economic hedge target principally driven by the update to actuarial assumptions. 
 Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 
 Net impact on pre-tax income of 262 million was primarily driven by increases in equity markets. 
 On an economic basis, the changes in the fair value of the hedge portfolio were partially offset by the changes in the economic hedge target. In the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we had a net mark-to-market gain of approximately 133 million from our hedging activities related to our economic hedge target principally driven by higher equity markets and the update to actuarial assumptions. 
 
 Three Months Ended September 30, 2023 
 Net impact on pre-tax loss of 8 million was primarily driven by decreases in equity markets. 
 On an economic basis, the changes in the fair value of the hedge portfolio were partially offset by the changes in the economic hedge target. In the three months ended September 30, 2023, we had a net mark-to-market loss of approximately 99 million from our hedging activities related to our economic hedge target primarily driven by tightening credit spreads. 
 Nine Months Ended September 30, 2023 
 Net impact on pre-tax income of 195 million was primarily driven by increases in equity markets and the impact of the London Interbank Offered Rate to Secured Overnight Financing Rate SOFR transition. 
 With the transition of risk free rates to the SOFR curve our discounting of fees has been reduced, resulting in a one time favorable impact to the MRB liability. 
 On an economic basis, the changes in the fair value of the hedge portfolio were partially offset by the changes in the economic hedge target. In the nine months ended September 30, 2023, we had a net mark-to-market loss of approximately 474 million from our hedging activities related to our economic hedge target primarily driven by tightening credit spreads and lower equity volatility. 
 
 Update of Actuarial Assumptions and Models 
 Our life insurance companies review and update actuarial assumptions at least annually, generally in the third quarter. 
 Investment-oriented products 
 We review and update assumptions used to value our universal life policies at least annually. These benefit reserves are also adjusted to reflect the changes in the fair value of available-for-sale securities with an offset to OCI. DAC and related items (which may include VOBA, DSI and unearned revenue reserves) are amortized on a constant level basis. 
 We also review assumptions related to variable annuities, fixed annuities, and fixed index annuities guaranteed benefits that are accounted for as MRBs or embedded derivatives and measured at fair value. The fair value of these MRBs or embedded derivatives is based on actuarial assumptions, including policyholder behavior, as well as capital market assumptions. 
 Traditional long-duration products 
 For traditional long-duration products discussed below, which includes whole life insurance, term life insurance, accident and health insurance, PRT, life-contingent single premium immediate annuities and structured settlements, cash flow assumptions are reviewed at least annually to determine any changes in the liability for future policy benefits. DAC and related items (which may include VOBA) are amortized on a constant level basis.

 Update of Actuarial Assumptions Impact to Consolidated pre-tax income (loss) 
 Corebridge recognized a 79 million unfavorable and 22 million favorable impact to pre-tax income, for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, attributable to the annual actuarial assumption review. For 2024, the impacts were primarily driven by updates to policyholder assumptions, including lapse and mortality updates for certain annuity products in Individual Retirement and Group Retirement and universal life products. These were partially offset by updated economic assumptions, including investment yields, and model refinements related to traditional life products and immediate annuities. For 2023, the assumption update impacts were primarily driven by updates to the portfolio yield assumption, refinements to the modeling for universal life products, and mortality assumption updates, partially offset by updated premium assumptions, and other refinements on life insurance products.

 ITEM 2 | Liquidity and Capital Resources 

Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 
 OVERVIEW 
 Liquidity is defined as cash and unencumbered assets that can be monetized in a short period of time at a reasonable cost. In addition to the on-balance-sheet liquid assets, liquidity resources include availability under committed bank credit facilities. 
 Capital refers to the long-term financial resources available to support the operation of our businesses, fund business growth, and cover financial and operational needs that arise from adverse circumstances. 
 We aim to manage our liquidity and capital resources prudently through a well-defined risk management framework that involves various target operating thresholds, as well as minimum requirements during periods of stress. 
 We believe that we have sufficient liquidity and capital resources to satisfy future requirements and meet our obligations to policyholders, customers, creditors and debt-holders, including those arising from reasonably foreseeable contingencies or events. 
 For a discussion regarding risks associated with liquidity and capital, see Risk Factors Risks Relating to Our Investment Portfolio, Liquidity, Capital and Credit in the 2023 Form 10-K. 
 
 LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES OF COREBRIDGE PARENT AND INTERMEDIATE HOLDING COMPANIES 
 As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, Corebridge Parent and its non-regulated intermediate holding companies Corebridge Hold Cos. had 4.5 billion and 4.1 billion, respectively, in liquidity sources. These liquidity sources were primarily held in the form of cash and short-term investments and included a 2.5 billion co mmitted revolving credit facility as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. Corebridge Hold Cos. primary sources of liquidity are dividends, loans and other payments from subsidiaries, sales of businesses and credit facilities. Corebridge Hold Cos. primary uses of liquidity are for debt service, capital and liability management, and operating expenses. 
 Corebridge Parent expects to maintain liquidity that is sufficient to cover one year of its expenses. We expect the Corebridge Hold Cos. may access the debt and equity markets from time to time to meet funding requirements as needed. 
 We utilize our capital resources to support our businesses, with the majority of capital held by our insurance businesses. Corebridge Hold Cos. intend to manage capital between Corebridge Hold Cos. and our insurance companies through internal, Board-approved policies as well as management standards. Nevertheless, regulatory and other legal restrictions could limit our ability to transfer capital freely, either to or from our subsidiaries. 
 As of September 30, 2024, Corebridge Parent and certain of our subsidiaries were parties to several letter of credit agreements with various financial institutions which issue letters of credit from time to time in support of our insurance companies, including a 100 million letter of credit entered into on September 30, 2024 in support of CRBG Bermuda. Letters of credit issued in support of our subsidiaries (primarily, insurance companies) totaled 226 million and 151 million at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively.

 For additional information, see Note 17 to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. 
 
 LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES OF COREBRIDGE INSURANCE SUBSIDIARIES 
 Insurance Companies 
 We believe that our insurance companies have sufficient liquidity and capital resources to satisfy reasonably foreseeable future liquidity requirements and meet their obligations, including those arising from reasonably foreseeable contingencies or events, through cash from operations and, to the extent necessary, monetization of invested assets. Our insurance companies liquidity resources are primarily held in the form of cash, short-term investments and publicly traded, investment grade-rated fixed maturity securities. 
 The liquidity of each of our material insurance companies is monitored through various internal liquidity risk measures. The primary sources of liquidity are premiums, deposits, fees, reinsurance recoverables, investment income and maturities. The primary uses of liquidity are paid losses, reinsurance payments, benefit claims, surrenders, withdrawals, interest payments, dividends, expenses, investment purchases and collateral requirements. 
 Certain of our U.S. insurance companies are members of the FHLBs in their respective districts. Our borrowings from FHLBs are non-puttable and are used to supplement liquidity or for other uses deemed appropriate by management. Our U.S. insurance companies had 5.5 billion which were due to FHLBs in their respective districts at September 30, 2024, under funding agreements which were reported in policyholder contract deposits. These investment contracts do not have mortality or morbidity risk. Proceeds from funding agreements are generally invested in investments intended to generate spread income. In addition, our U.S. insurance companies had no outstanding borrowings in the form of cash advances from FHLBs at September 30, 2024. 
 Certain of our U.S. insurance companies have securities lending programs that lend securities from their investment portfolios to supplement liquidity or for other uses deemed appropriate by management. Under these programs, these U.S. insurance companies lend securities to financial institutions and receive cash as collateral equal to 102 of the fair value of the loaned securities. Cash collateral received is kept in cash or invested in short-term investments or used for short-term liquidity purposes. 
 The aggregate amount of securities that a U.S. insurance company can lend under its program at any time is limited to 5 of its general account statutory-basis admitted assets. Our U.S. insurance companies had no securities subject to these agreements at September 30, 2024 and no liabilities to borrowers for collateral received at September 30, 2024. 
 We manage the capital of our Life Fleet Risk-Based Capital RBC ratio targeting above 400 . AGC serves as an affiliate reinsurance company. The surplus of AGC is comprised predominantly of the statutory surplus of the Life Fleet. Given that AGC has no primary operations outside of this internal reinsurance, we believe that excluding AGC from the Life Fleet RBC ratio calculation presents a more accurate view of the overall capital position of our U.S. operating entities. Our Life Fleet RBC ratio was above our minimum target Life Fleet RBC ratio of 400 as of December 31, 2023.

 Dividend Restrictions 
 Payments of dividends to Corebridge Hold Cos. by our U.S. insurance subsidiaries are subject to certain restrictions imposed by laws and regulations of their respective states of domicile. With respect to our domestic insurance subsidiaries, the payment of a dividend may require formal notice to the insurance department of the state in which the particular insurance subsidiary is domiciled, and prior approval of such insurance regulator is required when the amount of the dividend is above certain regulatory thresholds. See Business Regulation U.S. Regulation State Insurance Regulation in the 2023 Form 10-K. Bermuda law also restricts the ability of CRBG Bermuda to pay dividends. 
 To our knowledge, no Corebridge insurance company is currently on any regulatory or similar watch list with regard to solvency.

 HYBRID JUNIOR SUBORDINATED NOTES 
 On September 12, 2024, Corebridge Parent issued and sold 750 million aggregate principal amount of its 6.375 2054 Notes. Subject to certain redemption provisions and other terms of the 2054 Notes, the interest rate resets on September 15, 2034 and each five-year anniversary thereafter, at an annual rate equal to the five-year treasury rate as of the most recent reset interest determination date plus 2.646 . 
 DELAYED DRAW TERM LOAN 
 Corebridge Parent used a portion of the net proceeds of the issuance of the 2054 Notes to repay all of the 250 million aggregate principal amount outstanding under Corebridge s Three-Year DDTL Facility, dated as of February 25, 2022, among Corebridge, the lenders party thereto and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as administrative agent. The balance of the proceeds will be used for general corporate purposes. This facility was terminated on September 12, 2024 after the final loan repayment. 
 REVOLVING CREDIT AGREEMENT 
 On May 12, 2022, Corebridge Parent entered into a revolving credit agreement (the Revolving Credit Agreement ). The Revolving Credit Agreement provides for a five-year total commitment of 2.5 billion, consisting of standby letters of credit and/or revolving credit borrowings without any limits on the type of borrowings. Under circumstances described in the Revolving Credit Agreement, the aggregate commitments may be increased by up to 500 million , for a total commitment under the Revolving Credit Agreement of 3.0 billion . Loans under the Revolving Credit Agreement will mature on May 12, 2027. Under the Revolving Credit Agreement, the applicable rate, commitment fee and letter of credit fee are determined by reference to the credit ratings of Corebridge Parent s senior, unsecured, long-term indebtedness. Borrowings bear interest at a rate per annum equal to (i) in the case of U.S. dollar borrowings, Term SOFR plus an applicable credit spread adjustment plus an applicable rate or an alternative base rate plus an applicable rate; (ii) in the case of Sterling borrowings, sterling overnight index average plus an applicable credit spread adjustment plus an applicable rate; (iii) in the case of Euro borrowings, European Union interbank Offer Rate plus an applicable rate; and (iv) in the case of Japanese Yen, Tokyo Interbank Offered Rate plus an applicable rate. The alternative base rate is equal to the highest of (a) the New York Federal Reserve Bank Rate plus 0.50 , (b) the rate of interest in effect as quoted by The Wall Street Journal as the Prime Rate in the United States and (c) Term SOFR plus a credit spread adjustment of 0.100 plus an additional 1.00 .

Depending on the ratings maintained by one or more rating agencies, these triggers could result in (i) the termination or limitation of credit availability or a requirement for accelerated repayment, (ii) the termination of business contracts or (iii) a requirement to post collateral for the benefit of counterparties. 
 In the event of a downgrade of our long-term debt ratings or our insurance subsidiaries Insurer Financial Strength IFS ratings, we would be required to post additional collateral under some derivative and other transactions, or certain of the counterparties of such other of our subsidiaries would be permitted to terminate such transactions early. 
 The actual amount of collateral that we or certain of our subsidiaries would be required to post to counterparties in the event of such downgrades, or the aggregate amount of payments that we could be required to make, depends on market conditions, the fair value of outstanding affected transactions and other factors prevailing at the time of the downgrade. 
 INSURER FINANCIAL STRENGTH RATINGS 
 IFS ratings estimate an insurance company s ability to pay its obligations under an insurance policy. 
 The following table presents the ratings of our primary insurance subsidiaries as of the date of this filing: 
 A.M. Best S P Fitch Moody s American General Life Insurance Company A A+ A+ A2 The Variable Annuity Life Insurance Company A A+ A+ A2 The United States Life Insurance Company in the City of New York A A+ A+ A2

Accounting Policies and Pronouncements 
 CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES 
 The preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP requires the application of accounting policies that often involve a significant degree of judgment. On a regular basis, we review estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of financial statements. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. For a detailed discussion of our significant accounting policies and accounting pronouncements, see Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in the 2023 Form 10-K. 
 The accounting policies that we believe are most dependent on the application of estimates and assumptions, which are critical accounting estimates, are related to the determination of: 
 fair value measurements of certain financial assets and liabilities; 
 valuation of MRBs related to guaranteed benefit features of variable annuity, fixed annuity and fixed index annuity products; 
 valuation of embedded derivative liabilities for fixed index annuity and index universal life products; 
 valuation of future policy benefit liabilities and recognition of remeasurement gains and losses; 
 reinsurance assets, including the allowance for credit losses; 
 goodwill impairment; 
 allowance for credit losses primarily on loans and available-for-sale fixed maturity securities; and 
 income tax assets and liabilities, including recoverability of our net deferred tax asset and the predictability of future tax operating profitability of the character necessary to realize the net deferred tax asset. 
 These accounting estimates require the use of assumptions about matters, some of which are highly uncertain at the time of estimation. To the extent actual experience differs from the assumptions used, our business, results of operations, financial condition and liquidity could be materially affected. 
 For a complete discussion of our critical accounting estimates, see Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operation Accounting Policies and Pronouncements in the 2023 Form 10-K.

 Credit support annex a legal document generally associated with an ISDA Master Agreement that provides for collateral postings which could vary depending on ratings and threshold levels . 
 Deferred policy acquisition costs deferred costs that are incremental and directly related to the successful acquisition of new business or renewal of existing business . 
 Deferred sales inducement represents enhanced crediting rates or bonus payments to contract holders on certain annuity and investment contract products that meet the criteria to be deferred and amortized over the life of the contract.

 Guaranteed investment contract a contract whereby the issuer provides a guaranteed repayment of principal and a fixed or floating interest rate for a predetermined period of time . 
 Guaranteed minimum death benefit a benefit that guarantees the annuity beneficiary will receive a certain value upon death of the annuitant. The GMDB feature may provide a death benefit of either (a) total deposits made to the contract, less any partial withdrawals plus a minimum return (and in rare instances, no minimum return); (b) return of premium whereby the benefit is the greater of the current account value or premiums paid less any partial withdrawals; (c) rollups whereby the benefit is the greater of current account value or premiums paid (adjusted for withdrawals) accumulated at contractually specified rates up to specified ages; or (d) the highest contract value attained, typically on any anniversary date less any subsequent withdrawals following the contract anniversary. 
 Guaranteed minimum withdrawal benefit a type of living benefit that guarantees that withdrawals from the contract may be taken up to a contractually guaranteed amount, even if the account value subsequently falls to zero, provided that during each contract year total withdrawals do not exceed an annual withdrawal amount specified in the contract. Once the account value is depleted under the conditions of the GMWB, the policy continues to provide a protected income payment. 
 ISDA Master Agreement an agreement between two counterparties, which may have multiple derivative transactions with each other governed by such agreement, that generally provides for the net settlement of all or a specified group of these derivative transactions, as well as pledged collateral, through a single payment, in a single currency, in the event of a default on, or affecting any, one derivative transaction or a termination event affecting all, or a specified group of, derivative transactions. 
 Loan-to-value ratio principal amount of loan divided by appraised value of collateral securing the loan. 
 Market risk benefit is an amount that a policyholder would receive in addition to the account balance upon the occurrence of a specific event or circumstance, such as death, annuitization, or periodic withdrawal that involves protection from other-than-nominal capital market risk. 
 Master netting agreement an agreement between two counterparties who have multiple derivative contracts with each other that provides for the net settlement of all contracts covered by such agreement, as well as pledged collateral, through a single payment, in a single currency, in the event of default on or upon termination of any one such contract. 
 Non-performance Risk Adjustment adjusts the valuation of derivatives and MRBs to account for non-performance risk in the fair value measurement of all MRBs and derivative net liability positions. 
 Noncontrolling interests the portion of equity ownership in a consolidated subsidiary not attributable to the controlling parent company. 
 Policy fees an amount added to a policy premium, or deducted from a policy cash value or contract holder account, to reflect the cost of issuing a policy, establishing the required records and sending premium notices and other related expenses. 
 Reinsurance the practice whereby one insurer, the reinsurer, in consideration of a premium paid to that insurer, agrees to indemnify another insurer, the ceding company, for part or all of the liability of the ceding company under one or more policies or contracts of insurance which it has issued. 
 Risk-based capital a formula designed to measure the adequacy of an insurer s statutory surplus compared to the risks inherent in its business.

 Surrender rate represents annualized surrenders and withdrawals as a percentage of average reserves and Group Retirement mutual fund assets under administration.

 EVALUATION OF DISCLOSURE CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 
 Disclosure controls and procedures are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in reports filed or submitted under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act ), is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in SEC rules and forms and that such information is accumulated and communicated to management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures. In connection with the preparation of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, an evaluation was carried out by Corebridge management, with the participation of Corebridge s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act), as of September 30, 2024.

 For information regarding certain legal proceedings pending against us, see Note 16 to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements . 

ITEM 1A | Risk Factors 
 Failure to complete the Nippon Transaction may negatively impact our ongoing business and stock price. 
 If the Nippon Transaction is not completed on a timely basis or at all, our ongoing business may be adversely affected as a result of the time and resources committed to the proposed transaction that could have been devoted to pursuing other opportunities. In addition, the price of our common stock may decline to the extent that the current market price reflects a market assumption that the Nippon Transaction will be completed on the proposed timeline and that any anticipated benefits will be realized. 
 In addition to the other information set forth in this Quarterly Report, you should carefully consider the risk factors discussed in Risk Factors in the 2023 Form 10-K.

 On May 4, 2023, our Board of Directors authorized a 1.0 billion share repurchase program. On April 30, 2024, our Board of Directors authorized an additional 2.0 billion increase in the share repurchase amount under the share repurchase program. Under this program, Corebridge Parent may, from time to time, purchase up to 3.0 billion of Corebridge Parent common stock but is not obligated to purchase any particular number of shares. The authorization for the share repurchase program may be terminated, increased or decreased by the Board of Directors at any time. 
 Shares may be repurchased from time to time in the open market, through private purchases, through forward, derivative, accelerated repurchase or automatic repurchase transactions or otherwise. For instance, on August 7, 2024, we purchased an aggregate of approximately 200 million of shares from AIG in a privately negotiated transaction. In addition, certain of our share repurchases have been and may from time to time be effected through Exchange Act Rule 10b5-1 repurchase plans, including the share repurchase plan Corebridge Parent adopted on September 17, 2024, which, unless extended expires on November 7, 2024. The timing of any future share repurchases will depend on market conditions, our business and strategic plans, financial condition, results of operations, liquidity and other factors. 
 During the three months ended September 30, 2024, Corebridge Parent repurchased approximately 25.9 million shares of Corebridge Parent common stock, par value 0.01 per share, for an aggregate purchase price of 715 million, pursuant to the share repurchase program.
