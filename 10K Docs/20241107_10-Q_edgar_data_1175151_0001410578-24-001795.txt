As a result, the accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis, which contemplates the realization of assets and satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business.

If these milestones are not achieved, the Company will need to raise additional capital to support our ongoing operations in the future. Meanwhile the Company continues to evaluate other traditional and alternative sources of capital, including additional less or non-dilutive debt financing, royalty financing, strategic or direct investments, equity financing, and/or combinations thereof. There can be no assurance that management will be successful in these endeavors.

The majority of sales of the device are outside the United States, as CytoSorb is not yet approved for commercial sale in the United States. However, in April 2020, the Company was granted Emergency Use Authorization EUA of CytoSorb for use in critically-ill patients infected with COVID-19 with imminent or confirmed respiratory failure by the United States Food and Drug Administration (the FDA ). Direct sales outside the United States relate to sales to hospitals located in Germany, Switzerland, Austria, Belgium, Luxembourg, Poland, the Netherlands, Sweden, Denmark, Norway and the United Kingdom. Direct sales are fulfilled from the Company s warehouse facility in Berlin, Germany. There are no formal sales contracts with any direct customers relating to product price or minimum purchase requirements. However, there are agreements in place with certain direct customers that provide for either free of charge product or rebate credits based upon achieving minimum purchase levels. The Company records the value of these items earned as a reduction of revenue. These customers submit purchase orders and the order is fulfilled and shipped directly to the customer. Prices to all direct customers are based on a standard price list based on the packaged quantity (6 packs versus 12 packs). Distributor and strategic partner sales make up the remaining product sales. These distributors are located in various countries throughout the world. The Company has a formal written contract with each distributor/strategic partner. These contracts have terms ranging from - in length, with being the typical term. In addition, certain distributors are eligible for volume discount pricing if their unit sales are in excess of the base amount in the contract. Most distributor s/strategic partner s contracts have minimum annual purchase requirements in order to maintain exclusivity in their respective territories. There is no additional consideration or monetary penalty that would be required to be paid to CytoSorbents if a distributor does not meet the minimum purchase commitments included in the contract, however, at the discretion of the Company, the distributor may lose its exclusive rights in the territory if such commitments are not met. Government Grants The Company has been the recipient of various grant contracts from various agencies of the United States government, primarily the Department of Defense, to perform various research and development activities. These contracts fall into one of the following categories: 1. Fixed price the Company invoices the contract amount in equal installments over the term of the contract without regard to the timing of the costs incurred related to this contract. If billings on fixed price contracts exceed the costs incurred, revenue will be deferred to the extent of the excess billings.

Following the first year of the remaining term, the annual base rent will increase by approximately annually over the remaining term. The lease also contains of rent abatement (months 1, 2, 3, 25, 26 and 27 of the remaining lease term). In addition to the base rent, payments of operating expenses and real estate taxes will be required. These payments are to be based on actual amounts incurred during 2021 multiplied by the Company s share of the total building space ). The landlord will also provide an allowance of approximately related to certain building improvements as outlined in the lease. In April 2021, the Company provided the landlord with a letter of credit in the amount of approximately as security.

On April 1, 2021, the Company recorded a Right-of-Use asset and related lease liability of approximately million, which represents the estimated present value of the lease payments at the commencement date discounted at the Company s incremental borrowing rate of . In addition, due to the six months of rent abatement and annual base rent escalations during the remaining lease term that commenced on September 30, 2021, the Company will recognize rent expense on this lease on a straight-line basis over the remaining term of the lease for the difference between the rent expense recognized and the required payments under the lease. In September 2021, the Company extended its two operating leases for its office facility in Germany. These leases require combined base rent payments amounting to approximately per month. The initial lease term of both leases ends August 31, 2026. In addition, the Company is obligated to monthly operating expenses of approximately per month. Both leases have a five-year option to renew that would extend the lease term to August 31, 2031. There are no provisions in the leases to increase the base rent during the renewal period. There were no lease incentives and no initial direct costs were incurred related to these leases.

These forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, statements about our plans, objectives, representations and contentions and our expectations of the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic and are not historical facts and typically are identified by use of terms such as may, should, could, expect, plan, anticipate, believe, estimate, predict, potential, continue and similar words, although some forward-looking statements are expressed differently. You should be aware that the forward-looking statements included herein represent management s current judgment and expectations, but our actual results, events and performance could differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements. Factors which could cause or contribute to such differences include, but are not limited to, the risks discussed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K, as updated by any risks reported in our Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q and in the press releases and other communications to stockholders issued by us from time to time which attempt to advise interested parties of the risks and factors which may affect our business. We undertake no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events, or otherwise, other than as required under the Federal securities laws. Overview We are a leader in the treatment of life-threatening conditions in the intensive care unit and cardiac surgery through blood purification. CytoSorbents proprietary blood purification technologies are based on biocompatible, highly porous polymer beads that can actively remove toxic substances from blood and other bodily fluids by pore capture and surface adsorption. Cartridges filled with these beads can be used with standard blood pumps already in the hospital (e.g. dialysis, ECMO, heart-lung machines). CytoSorbents technologies are used in a number of broad applications. Specifically, two important applicatons are 1) the removal of blood thinners during and after cardiothoracic surgery to reduce the risk of severe bleeding and 2) the removal of inflammatory agents in common critical illnesses such as sepsis, burn injury, trauma, lung injury, liver failure, cytokine release syndrome, and pancreatitis that can lead to massive inflammation, organ failure and patient death. In these diseases, the risk of death can be extremely high, and there are few, if any, effective treatments. CytoSorbents lead product, CytoSorb , is approved in the European Union and distributed in 76 countries worldwide, with more than 250,000 devices used cumulatively to date. CytoSorb was originally launched in the European Union under CE mark as the first cytokine adsorber. Additional CE mark extensions were granted for bilirubin and myoglobin removal in clinical conditions such as liver disease and trauma, respectively, and for ticagrelor and rivaroxaban removal in cardiothoracic surgery procedures. CytoSorb has also received FDA EUA in the United States for use in adult critically ill COVID-19 patients with impending or confirmed respiratory failure, to reduce pro-inflammatory cytokine levels. CytoSorb is not yet approved in the United States. In the U.S. and Canada, CytoSorbents is developing the DrugSorb -ATR antithrombotic removal system, an investigational device based on an equivalent polymer technology to CytoSorb, to reduce the severity of perioperative bleeding in high-risk surgery due to blood thinning drugs. It has received two FDA Breakthrough Device Designations: one for the removal of ticagrelor and another for the removal of the direct oral anticoagulants (DOAC) apixaban and rivaroxaban in a cardiopulmonary bypass circuit during urgent cardiothoracic procedures. In September 2024, the Company submitted a De Novo medical device application to the FDA requesting marketing approval to reduce the severity of perioperative bleeding in CABG patients on the antithrombotic drug ticagrelor, which was accepted for substantive review in October 2024. In November 2024, the Company received its Medical Device Single Audit Program (MDSAP) certification and submitted its Medical Device License (MDL) application to Health Canada. DrugSorb-ATR is not yet granted or approved in the United States and Canada, respectively. The Company has numerous marketed products and products under development based upon this unique blood purification technology protected by many issued U.S. and international patents and registered trademarks, and multiple patent applications pending, including ECOS-300CY , CytoSorb-XL , HemoDefend-RBC , HemoDefend-BGA , VetResQ , K+ontrol , DrugSorb , ContrastSorb, and others.

 Clinical Studies Update For a complete discussion regarding our clinical study history, please refer to the section entitled Clinical Studies included in Item 1 of the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 as filed with the SEC on March 14, 2024. The following includes certain updates regarding these clinical studies subsequent to the filing of the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K. In July 2021, we received full FDA approval of an Investigational Device Exemption (IDE) application to conduct a double-blind, randomized, controlled clinical study in 120 patients entitled, S afe and T imely A ntithrombotic R emoval T icagrelor STAR-T ), in the United States to support FDA marketing approval. This was done under the previously announced FDA Breakthrough Device Designation granted for the removal of ticagrelor in a cardiopulmonary bypass circuit to reduce the likelihood of serious perioperative bleeding during urgent cardiac surgery. In October 2021, the first patient was enrolled, with the STAR-T study actively recruiting at multiple U.S. sites. In November 2022, the first milestone was completed with the first one-third of patients enrolled, triggering the first Data and Safety Monitoring Board DSMB meeting. The DSMB recommended to continue the study as planned without any modifications. In 2022, we also received FDA approval to expand the study to Canada and subsequently received Health Canada approval allowing inclusion of Canadian sites into the STAR-T trial in January 2023. In early 2023, the study exceeded 50 enrollment and reached the 2nd milestone of 67 enrollment in the spring of 2023, triggering another DSMB safety review, which found no safety concerns and recommended completion of the trial. The study completed enrollment in July of 2023 triggering the final DSMB safety review following database lock in December 2023, which also reported no safety concerns thereby meeting the primary safety endpoint of the study. Based on the initial analysis of the STAR-T data, the study did not meet the primary effectiveness endpoint in the overall patient population that underwent different types of cardiac surgeries. However, the study did demonstrate evidence that DrugSorb-ATR reduced the severity of perioperative bleeding in patients undergoing isolated coronary artery bypass graft CABG surgery who represented more than 90 of the overall study population. The topline results of the U.S. and Canadian 140-patient, pivotal STAR-T randomized controlled trial were presented at the 104th Annual Meeting of the American Association for Thoracic Surgery AATS held in Toronto, Canada on April 28, 2024. The Company submitted the DrugSorb-ATR medical device De Novo marketing application to the FDA on September 27, 2024 and announced the acceptance of the application by FDA on October 22, 2024. On November 1, 2024, the Company received its Medical Device Single Audit Program (MDSAP) certification and submitted its Medical Device License (MDL) application to Health Canada. Government Research Grants: We have historically been successful in obtaining technology development contracts from governmental agencies such as the National Institutes of Health and the U.S. Department of Defense, including the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency DARPA ), the U.S. Army, U.S. Special Operations Command USSOCOM ), the U.S. Air Force, Air Force Material Command USAF/AFMC and others. Currently, we have ongoing projects funded, in part, by the U.S. Army Medical Research Acquisition Activity USAMRAA ), National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute NHLBI ), and the USAF/AFMC. For a complete discussion of the various research grants we have obtained, please refer to the section entitled Government Research Grants included in Item 1 of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, as filed with the SEC on March 14, 2024. Research and Development Update Our research and development work levels have returned back to pre-pandemic levels. As of September 30, 2024, the revenue remaining to be earned on open grant contracts is 3.2 million. Overall, grant funded programs, HemoDefend-BGA (Universal Plasma), HemoDefend-RBC and K + ontrol , continue to progress and we have been the beneficiary of approximately 15.8 million, 4.7 million and 7.7 million in total funding, respectively, awarded to date.

 Impact of Inflation and Other Issues: The current high inflationary environment has impacted us in various ways. Due to the current competitive labor market and high inflation, our labor costs have risen significantly in order to attract and retain qualified employees throughout our organization. In addition, we have experienced raw material price increases primarily related to the oil-based chemicals used in the polymer manufacturing process as well additional requests for higher fuel surcharges from most suppliers. Rising energy costs, including electricity and fossil fuels, have also made it more expensive to support our operations, manufacturing, and commercial activities. We have also experienced increases in our transportation costs; however, we have been able to substantially mitigate these cost increases by implementing bulk shipping methods. In addition, we have been able to mitigate most supply chain issues that existed during the COVID-19 pandemic by ordering larger quantities of inventory as they were available. Inflationary pressures may continue to impact our product gross margins in the future. Results of Operations: Comparison for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023:

Changes in foreign currency impacted total revenue by 1 and 6 , for respective periods of 2024 and 2023, respectively. Revenue from product sales was approximately 8,613,000 in the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to approximately 7,754,000 in the three months ended September 30, 2023, an increase of approximately 859,000, or 11 . This increase was driven by an increase in direct sales of approximately 21 in the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to 2023. In addition, distributor sales decreased by approximately 1 during the same period. Grant income was approximately 777,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to approximately 1,057,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2023, a decrease of approximately 280,000, or 26 . This decrease was due to the completion of several grants during 2023.

 Gross Profit: For the three months ended September 30, 2024, gross profit decreased approximately 327,000 to 5,281,000 from 5,607,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. This decrease was due to a planned temporary slowdown in production to rebalance inventory levels coupled with a short-term manufacturing issue, which we believe is resolved, which resulted in a significantly lower number of CytoSorb devices produced in the quarter. As a result, product gross margins, which exclude the impact of grant income and related costs, were approximately 61 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to approximately 72 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. Research and Development Expenses: For the three months ended September 30, 2024, research and development expenses were approximately 1,851,000 as compared to research and development expenses of approximately 3,749,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2023, a decrease of approximately 1,898,000, or 51 . This decrease was driven by a decrease in our clinical trial costs due to the completion of the STAR-T clinical trial in December 2023. Clinical expenses were approximately 962,000 in the three months ended September 30, 2024 and approximately 2,837,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2023, a decrease of approximately 1,875,000, or 66 . Legal, Financial and Other Consulting Expenses: Legal, financial, and other consulting expenses were approximately 824,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to approximately 1,104,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2023, a decrease of approximately 280,000, or 25 . This decrease is related to costs associated with the write-off of certain patent applications that were incurred in 2023 that did not recur in 2024 and a decrease in regulatory consulting costs related to DrugSorb-ATR. Selling, General and Administrative Expenses: Selling, general and administrative expenses were approximately 7,003,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to approximately 8,104,000 for the three months ending September 30, 2023, a decrease of approximately 1,101,000, or 14 . This decrease was primarily due to reduction in non-cash stock compensation expense, a reduction in salaries and related expenses related to headcount reductions and a reduction in royalty expense due to the expiration of the Purolite license agreement on August 6, 2024. Interest Expense, Net: Interest expense, net, was approximately 588,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to approximately 34,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase was due to interest incurred on the Avenue Capital Group debt that was closed during the second quarter of 2024, net of interest income received of approximately 121,000 on the total balance of cash and cash equivalents. This financing increased the principal amount of our debt to 15,000,000 from 5,000,000 and the interest rate increased to 13.5 from 8 . Gain (Loss) on Foreign Currency Transactions: For the three months ended September 30, 2024, the gain on foreign currency transactions was approximately 2,650,000 as compared to a loss of approximately 1,810,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The 2024 gain was directly related to the increase in the spot exchange rate of the Euro to the U.S. dollar at September 30, 2024 as compared to June 30, 2024. The spot exchange rate of the Euro to the U.S. dollar was 1.11 per Euro at September 30, 2024, as compared to 1.07 per Euro at June 30, 2024. The 2023 loss was directly related to the decrease in the spot exchange rate of the Euro to the U.S. dollar at September 30, 2023 as compared to June 30, 2023. The spot exchange rate of the Euro to the U.S. dollar was 1.06 per Euro at September 30, 2023, as compared to 1.09 per Euro at June 30, 2023.

Changes in foreign currency impacted total revenue by 2 for each of the respective periods of 2024 and 2023, respectively. Revenue from product sales was approximately 26,444,000 in the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to approximately 23,736,000 in the nine months ended September 30, 2023, an increase of approximately 2,708,000, or 11 . Distributor sales increased by 16 and direct sales increased by 8 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Grant income was approximately 2,627,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to approximately 3,945,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, a decrease of approximately 1,318,000, or 33 . This decrease was due to the completion of several grants during 2023. Gross Profit: For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, gross profit increased approximately 1,274,000 to 18,355,000 from 17,081,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 due to increased revenue. Product gross margins were approximately 69 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to approximately 71 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. This decrease was due to a third quarter 2024 planned temporary slowdown in production to rebalance inventory levels coupled with a short-term manufacturing issue which resulted in a significantly lower number of CytoSorb devices produced.

 Research and Development Expenses: For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, research and development expenses were approximately 5,619,000, as compared to research and development expenses of approximately 11,632,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, a decrease of approximately 6,013,000, or 52 . This decrease was driven by a decrease in our clinical trial costs due to the completion of the STAR-T clinical trial in December 2023. Clinical expenses were approximately 3,525,000 in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and approximately 8,153,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, a decrease of approximately 4,628,000, or 57 . Non-grant related research and development costs decreased from approximately 3,479,000 in the nine months ended September 30, 2023 to approximately 2,094,000 in the nine months ended September 30, 2024, a decrease of approximately 1,385,000, or 40 . This reduction was a result of headcount reductions related to our cost saving initiatives. In addition, 2023 expenses included approximately 850,000 of costs incurred related to pre-production manufacturing activities required to bring the new manufacturing plant to a state of commercial readiness that did not recur in 2024. Legal, Financial and Other Consulting Expenses: Legal, financial, and other consulting expenses were approximately 2,325,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to approximately 2,958,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, a decrease of approximately 633,000, or 21 . This decrease is related to settlement costs of certain pending litigation matters in 2023 and a reduction of hiring fees in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to 2023. Selling, General and Administrative Expenses: Selling, general and administrative expenses were approximately 23,151,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to approximately 24,358,000 for the nine months ending September 30, 2023, a decrease of approximately 1,207,000, or 5 . This decrease was primarily due to a reduction in salaries and related costs due to headcount reductions and a decrease in non-cash stock compensation. These reductions were offset by a reduction in grant spending that reduced the overhead absorption benefit to selling, general and administrative expense. Interest Expense, Net: Interest expense, net, was approximately 775,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to approximately 106,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase was due to interest incurred on the Avenue Capital Group debt that was closed during the second quarter of 2024, net of interest income received of approximately 270,000 on the total balance of cash and cash equivalents. This financing increased the principal amount of our debt to 15,000,000 from 5,000,000 and the interest rate increased to 13.5 from 8 . Gain (Loss) on Foreign Currency Transactions: For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the gain on foreign currency transactions was approximately 680,000 as compared to a loss of approximately 734,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The 2024 gain was directly related to the increase in the spot exchange rate of the Euro to the U.S. dollar at September 30, 2024 as compared to December 31, 2023. The spot exchange rate of the Euro to the U.S. dollar was 1.11 per Euro at September 30, 2024, as compared to 1.10 per Euro at December 31, 2023. The 2023 loss was directly related to the decrease in the spot exchange rate of the Euro to the U.S. dollar at September 30, 2023 as compared to December 31, 2022. The spot exchange rate of the Euro to the U.S. dollar was 1.06 per Euro at September 30, 2023, as compared to 1.07 per Euro at December 31, 2022. History of Operating Losses: We have experienced substantial operating losses since inception. As of September 30, 2024, we had an accumulated deficit of approximately 295,340,000, which included losses of approximately 12,835,000 and 22,672,000 for the nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Historically, losses have resulted principally from costs incurred in the research and development of our polymer technology, clinical studies, and general and administrative expenses.

 Liquidity and Capital Resources Since inception, our operations have been primarily financed through the issuance of debt and equity securities. As of September 30, 2024, we had current assets of approximately 16,597,000 and current liabilities of approximately 8,430,000. As of September 30, 2024, 19.7 million of our total shelf amount was allocated to our ATM facility and remains available. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company sold 53,290 shares pursuant to the Sale Agreement, at an average selling price of 1.03 per share, generating net proceeds of approximately 53,200. In June of 2024, we closed on a 20 million term-loan facility with Avenue Capital Group which provided an initial tranche of 15 million at the closing of which 10 million was immediately available at closing and 5 million constitutes restricted cash subject to release to the Company prior to March 31, 2025, provided certain conditions are met. Another tranche of 5 million may be disbursed at the Company s request between July 1, 2025 and December 31, 2025, provided that the Company receives FDA marketing approval of its DrugSorb-ATR application. Concurrently with the closing of the first tranche, the Company paid off our existing debt with Bridge Bank. In March of 2024, we received approximately 880,000 in cash from the approved sale of our net operating losses and research and development credits from the State of New Jersey. We are also managing our resources proactively, continuing to invest in key areas such as our regulatory submissions of DrugSorb-ATR to U.S. FDA and Health Canada. We have also instituted and continue to maintain tight control over expenditures. As of September 30, 2024 we have approximately 12.2 million in cash, including approximately 5.7 million and 6.5 million in unrestricted and restricted cash, respectively of which the unrestricted portions not expected to fund the Company s operations beyond the next twelve months from the issuance of these consolidated financial statements. Our Avenue Capital Group debt facility provides for the release of between 3 million and 5 million of restricted cash upon the achievement of two milestones: 1) the receipt of the FDA s acceptance of our DrugSorb-ATR submission, and 2) the raise of between 3 million and 5 million of additional equity financing. Achievement of both milestones would provide an additional 6 million to 10 million of unrestricted cash. With our cost cutting efforts, we believe this is sufficient to fund the Company s operations through 2025. On October 22, 2024, the Company announced the FDA acceptance of the DrugSorb-ATR marketing submission. If these milestones are not achieved, we will need to raise additional capital to support our ongoing operations in the future. Meanwhile the Company continues to evaluate other traditional and alternative sources of capital, including additional less or non-dilutive debt financing, royalty financing, strategic or direct investments, equity financing, and/or combinations thereof. There can be no assurance that management will be successful in these endeavors. Contractual Obligations In March 2021, the Company entered into a lease agreement for a new operating facility at 305 College Road East, Princeton, New Jersey, which contains office, laboratory, manufacturing and warehouse space. The commencement date of the lease was April 1, 2021. The Initial Early Term began on the commencement date (April 1, 2021) and lasted two months. The Early Term commenced on June 1, 2021 and ended September 30, 2021. The lease also contains two five-year renewal options. Commencing on September 30, 2021, the remaining lease term will end in 15.5 years. The lease requires monthly rental payments of 25,208 for the Initial Early Term, 88,254 for the Early Term and initial monthly payments of approximately 111,171 in the first year of the remaining term. Following the first year of the remaining term, the annual base rent will increase by approximately 2.75 annually over the remaining term. The lease also contains six months of rent abatement. In addition to the base rent, payments of operating expenses and real estate taxes will be required. These payments are to be based on actual amounts incurred during 2021, multiplied by the Company s share of the total building space (92.3 ). The landlord also provided an allowance of approximately 1,455,000 related to certain building improvements as outlined in the lease. In April 2021, the Company provided the landlord with a letter of credit in the amount of approximately 1,334,000 as security. In January 2021, CytoSorbents Europe GmbH entered into a lease for 1,068 square meters of additional warehouse space. The lease commenced on April 1, 2021, requires monthly payments of base rent of 7,784 and other costs of approximately 239 and has a term of five years. The lease also has an option to extend the lease term for an additional five-year period through March 31, 2031.

 In September 2021, the Company extended its two operating leases for its office facility in Germany. These leases require combined base rent payments amounting to approximately 12,100 per month. The initial lease term of both leases ends August 31, 2026. In addition, the Company is obligated to monthly operating expenses of approximately 3,000 per month. Both leases have a five year option to renew that would extend the lease term to August 31, 2031. Off-balance Sheet Arrangements We have no off-balance sheet arrangements. Going Concern As of September 30, 2024, the Company s cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash balances were approximately 12.2 million, including approximately 5.7 million in cash and cash equivalents and approximately 6.5 million in restricted cash, of which the unrestricted portion is not expected to fund the Company s operations beyond the next twelve months from the issuance of these consolidated financial statements. This matter raises substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. As a result, the accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis, which contemplates the realization of assets and satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business. The Company continues to pursue additional milestones related to its recently announced Avenue Capital Group debt facility that would increase its unrestricted cash position by up to 10 million. If these milestones are not achieved, we will need to raise additional capital to support our ongoing operations in the future. Meanwhile the Company continues to evaluate other traditional and alternative sources of capital, including additional less or non-dilutive debt financing, royalty financing, strategic or direct investments, equity financing, and/or combinations thereof. There can be no assurance that management will be successful in these endeavors. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates A discussion of our critical accounting policies and estimates is contained in our Annual Report on Form 10-K. Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk. Not applicable. Item 4. Controls and Procedures. We maintain disclosure controls and procedures designed to ensure information required to be disclosed in our reports filed under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act ), is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures are designed to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Our management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based on that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this report are functioning effectively to provide reasonable assurance that the information required to be disclosed by us in reports filed under the Exchange Act is (i) recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms and (ii) accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding disclosures. A controls system, no matter how well designed and operated, cannot provide absolute assurance that the objectives of the controls system are met, and no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within a company have been detected. No change in our internal control over financial reporting occurred during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

 PART II. OTHER INFORMATION Item 1. Legal Proceedings. From time to time, we may become involved in litigation or other legal proceedings arising in the ordinary course of business. We are not currently a party to any litigation or legal proceedings that, in the opinion of our management, are likely to have a material adverse effect on our business. Regardless of outcome, litigation can have an adverse impact because of defense and settlement costs, diversion of management resources and other factors. On March 5, 2024, Danielle Greene, a former employee, filed a complaint against us in the Superior Court of New Jersey, Law Division, Mercer County, alleging breach of the New Jersey Conscientious Employee Protection Act CEPA ). The complaint specifically alleges that we violated the provisions of the CEPA by allegedly terminating Ms. Greene in retaliation for complaining about certain business practices. We dispute these allegations and intend to vigorously defend against them, but there can be no assurance as to the outcome of the litigation. Item 1A. Risk Factors. For a discussion of risks that affect the Company s business, please refer to Part I, Item IA, Risk Factors in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, as filed with the SEC on March 14, 2024.
