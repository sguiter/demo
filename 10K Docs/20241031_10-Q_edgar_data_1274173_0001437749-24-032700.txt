Level 1 Fair Value Measurements 
 
 Our Level 1 fair value measurements consist mostly of investments held by consolidated and unconsolidated seeded investment products and cash equivalents with quoted market prices in active markets. The fair value level of consolidated investments held by seeded investment products is determined by the underlying securities of the product. The fair value level of unconsolidated investments held in seeded investment products is determined by the net asset value, which is considered a quoted price in an active market. 
 
 Level 2 Fair Value Measurements 
 
 Our Level 2 fair value measurements consist mostly of investments held by consolidated investment products and our long-term debt. The fair value level of consolidated investments held by seeded investment products is determined by the underlying securities of the product. The fair value level of our long-term debt is determined using recent trading activity, which is considered a Level 2 input. 
 
 Level 3 Fair Value Measurements 
 
 Investments 
 
 As of September 30, 2024 , and December 31, 2023 , certain investments within consolidated VIEs were valued using significant unobservable inputs, resulting in Level 3 classification. 
 
 Deferred Bonuses 
 
 Deferred bonuses represent liabilities to employees over the vesting period that will be settled by investments in our products or cash. Upon vesting, employees receive the value of the investment product selected by the participant, adjusted for gains or losses attributable to the product. The significant unobservable inputs used to value the liabilities are investment designations and vesting periods. 
 
 Changes in Fair Value 
 
 Changes in fair value of our Level 3 assets for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 , were as follows (in millions): 

Settlement of contingent consideration 
 Fair value adjustments

 Foreign currency translation 
 Additions

Nonrecurring Fair Value Measurements 
 
 Nonrecurring Level 3 fair value measurements include goodwill and intangible assets. We measure the fair value of goodwill and intangible assets on initial recognition using discounted cash flow analysis that requires assumptions regarding projected future earnings and discount rates. Because of the significance of the unobservable inputs in the fair value measurements of these assets, such measurements are classified as Level 3.

JHG fully and unconditionally guarantees the obligations of Janus Henderson US (Holdings) Inc. in relation to the 2034 Senior Notes. 
 
 Credit Facility 
 
 On June 30, 2023, we entered into a million, unsecured, revolving credit facility Credit Facility ). The Credit Facility includes an option for us to request an increase to our borrowing capacity under the Credit Facility of up to an additional million. The Credit Facility had a maturity date of June 30, 2028, with two one -year extension options that can be exercised at the discretion of JHG with the lender s consent on the first and second anniversary of the date of the agreement. We exercised the option to extend the term of the Credit Facility on the first anniversary of the agreement. The revised maturity date of the Credit Facility is June 30, 2029. JHG and its subsidiaries may use the Credit Facility for general corporate purposes. The rate of interest for each interest period is the aggregate of the applicable margin, which is based on our long-term credit rating and the Secured Overnight Financing Rate SOFR in relation to any loan in U.S. dollars USD ), the Sterling Overnight Index Average SONIA in relation to any loan in British pounds GBP ), the Euro Interbank Offered Rate EURIBOR in relation to any loan in euros EUR or the Bank Bill Swap Rate BBSW in relation to any loan in Australian dollars AUD ). We are also required to pay a quarterly commitment fee on any unused portion of the Credit Facility, which is based on our long-term credit rating. If our credit rating falls below a certain threshold, as defined in the Credit Facility, our financing leverage ratio cannot exceed 3.00x EBITDA. At September 30, 2024 , we were in compliance with all covenants in, and there were borrowings under, the Credit Facility. 

The effective tax rate for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 , compared to the same periods in 2023, was impacted by the release of accumulated foreign currency translation reserves from liquidated JHG entities that are treated as non-deductible for tax purposes during the period. In addition, the tax rate was impacted by the disallowed noncontrolling interest expense from seeded investment products. 
 
 As of September 30, 2024 , we had million of unrecognized tax benefits held for uncertain tax positions. We estimate the existing liability for uncertain tax positions could decrease by up to million within the next 12 months without giving effect to changes in foreign currency translation. 
 
 The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development has a framework to implement a global minimum corporate tax of 15 for companies with global revenues and profits above certain thresholds (referred to as Pillar 2 ), with certain aspects of Pillar 2 effective January 1, 2024, and other aspects effective January 1, 2025. On June 20, 2023, Finance No. 2 Act 2023 was substantively enacted in the UK, introducing a global minimum effective tax rate of 15 . The legislation implements a domestic top-up tax and a multinational top-up tax, effective for accounting periods starting on or after December 31, 2023. While it is uncertain whether the U.S. will enact legislation to adopt Pillar 2, certain countries in which we operate have adopted legislation, and other countries are introducing legislation to implement Pillar 2. As of September 30, 2024 , the impact of Pillar 2 on our effective tax rate, consolidated results of operations, financial position and cash flows was not significant to the financial statements. 

Consolidated Seeded Investment Products 
 
 Noncontrolling interests in consolidated seeded investment products are classified as redeemable noncontrolling interests when there is an obligation to repurchase units at the investor s request. 
 
 Redeemable noncontrolling interests in consolidated seeded investment products may fluctuate from period to period and are impacted by changes in our relative ownership, changes in the amount of third -party investment in seeded products and volatility in the market value of the seeded products underlying securities. Third-party redemption of investments in any particular seeded product is redeemed from the respective product s net assets and cannot be redeemed from the net assets of our other seeded products or from our other net assets. 
 
 The following table presents the movement in redeemable noncontrolling interests in consolidated seeded investment products for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 (in millions):

 Business Overview 
 
 We are an independent global asset manager, specializing in active investment across all major asset classes. We actively manage a broad range of investment products for institutional and retail investors across four capabilities: Equities, Fixed Income, Multi-Asset and Alternatives. Our strategy revolves around three strategic pillars: Protect and Grow, Amplify, and Diversify, emphasizing relentless focus and disciplined execution in our core business for future success as a global active asset manager. Our strategy aims to foster sustained net new revenue and organic growth while also capitalizing on opportunistic inorganic growth opportunities to generate value for all of our stakeholders. We serve a diverse clientele worldwide, comprising intermediaries, institutional investors and self-directed clients. To cater to regional needs effectively, we maintain local presence across most markets and provide investment materials tailored to local customs, preferences and languages supported by our global distribution team. 
 
 Segment Considerations 
 
 We are a global asset manager and manage a range of investment products, operating across various product lines, distribution channels and geographic regions. However, information is reported to the chief operating decision-maker, our Chief Executive Officer CEO ), on an aggregated basis. Strategic and financial management decisions are determined centrally by our CEO and, on this basis, we operate as a single-segment investment management business. 
 
 Revenue 
 
 Revenue primarily consists of management fees and performance fees. Management fees are generally based on a percentage of the market value of our assets under management AUM and are calculated using either the daily, month-end or quarter-end average asset balance in accordance with contractual agreements. Accordingly, fluctuations in the financial markets have a direct effect on our operating results. Additionally, our AUM may outperform or underperform the financial markets and, therefore, may fluctuate in varying degrees from that of the general market. 
 
 Performance fees are specified in certain fund and client contracts, and are based on investment performance either on an absolute basis or compared to an established index over a specified period of time. These fees are often subject to a high-water mark. Performance fees are recognized at the end of the contractual period (typically monthly, quarterly or annually) if the stated performance criteria are achieved. Certain fund contracts allow for negative performance fees where there is underperformance against the relevant index.

We recognized consecutive quarters of net inflows, with third quarter 2024 net inflows of 0.4 billion. 

Third quarter 2024 diluted earnings per share was 0.17, or 0.91 on an adjusted basis. Refer to the Non-GAAP Financial Measures section below for information on adjusted non-GAAP figures. 

AUM increased to 382.3 billion, up 6 from June 30, 2024, and 24 from September 30, 2023. 

We returned 102.0 million in capital to shareholders through dividends and share buybacks during the third quarter 2024. 

On October 30, 2024, our Board of Directors declared a 0.39 per share dividend for the third quarter 2024 and approved an incremental share buyback authorization to repurchase up to an additional 50.0 million of our common stock. 

Financial Summary 
 
 Results are reported on a U.S. GAAP basis. Adjusted non-GAAP figures are presented in the Non-GAAP Financial Measures section below. 
 
 Revenue for the third quarter 2024 was 624.8 million, an increase of 103.8 million, or 20 , compared to the third quarter 2023. The key drivers of the increase were: 

An increase of 67.9 million in management fees primarily due to a market-driven increase in average AUM compared to the third quarter 2023. 

An increase of 24.4 million in performance fees primarily due to an improvement in the performance of Soci t d Investissement Capital Variable SICAVs and the U.S. mutual funds. 

Total operating expenses for the third quarter 2024 were 460.1 million, an increase of 60.8 million, or 15 , compared to the third quarter 2023. Key drivers of the increase included: 

An increase of 27.8 million in employee compensation and benefits primarily due to higher variable compensation charges as a result of an increase in operating income. 

An increase of 17.7 million in distribution expenses primarily driven by an increase in average AUM. 

Operating income for the third quarter 2024 was 164.7 million, an increase of 43.0 million, or 35 , compared to the third quarter 2023. Our operating margin was 26.4 in the third quarter 2024 compared to 23.4 in the third quarter 2023. 
 
 Net income attributable to JHG for the third quarter 2024 was 27.3 million, a decrease of 66.2 million, or 71 , compared to the third quarter 2023. In addition to the aforementioned factors affecting revenue and operating expenses, key drivers of the variance included: 

A decline of 88.2 million in other non-operating income (expense), net, primarily due to a 111.9 million release of accumulated foreign currency translation adjustments related to liquidated JHG entities. 

A 30.4 million increase in our income tax provision, primarily due to higher operating income in the third quarter 2024.

Valuation of Assets Under Management 
 
 The fair value of our AUM is based on the value of the underlying cash and investment securities of our funds, trusts and segregated mandates. A significant proportion of these securities is listed or quoted on a recognized securities exchange or market and is regularly traded thereon; these investments are valued based on unadjusted quoted market prices. However, for non-U.S. equity securities held by U.S. mutual funds, excluding ETFs, the quoted market prices may be adjusted to capture market movement between the time the local market closes and the NYSE closes. Other investments, including over-the-counter derivative contracts (which are dealt in or through a clearing firm, exchanges or financial institutions), are valued by reference to the most recent official settlement price quoted by the appointed market vendor, and in the event no price is available from this source, a broker quotation may be used. Physical property held is valued monthly by a specialist independent appraiser. 
 
 When a readily ascertainable market value does not exist for an investment, the fair value is calculated using a variety of methodologies, including the expected cash flows of its underlying net asset base, taking into account applicable discount rates and other factors; comparable securities or relevant indices; recent financing rounds; revenue multiples; or a combination thereof. Judgment is used to ascertain if a formerly active market has become inactive and to determine fair values when markets have become inactive. Our Fair Value Pricing committees are responsible for determining or approving these unquoted prices, which are reported to those charged with governance of the funds and trusts. For funds that invest in markets that are closed at their valuation point, an assessment is made daily to determine whether a fair value pricing adjustment is required to the fund s valuation. This may be due to significant market movements in other correlated open markets, scheduled market closures or unscheduled market closures as a result of natural disaster or government intervention. 
 
 Third-party administrators hold a key role in the collection and validation of prices used in the valuation of the securities. Daily price validation is completed using techniques such as day-on-day tolerance movements, invariant prices, excessive movement checks and intra-vendor tolerance checks. Our data management team performs oversight of this process and completes annual due diligence on the processes of third parties. 
 
 In other cases, we and the sub-administrators perform a number of procedures to validate the pricing received from third-party providers. For actively traded equity and fixed income securities, prices are received daily from both a primary and secondary vendor. Prices from the primary and secondary vendors are compared to identify any discrepancies. In the event of a discrepancy, a price challenge may be issued to both vendors. Securities with significant day-to-day price changes require additional research, which may include a review of all news pertaining to the issue and issuer, and any corporate actions. All fixed income prices are reviewed by our fixed income trading desk to incorporate market activity information available to our traders. In the event the traders have received price indications from market makers for a particular issue, this information is transmitted to the pricing vendors. 
 
 We leverage the expertise of our fund management teams across the business to cross-invest assets and create value for our clients. Where cross investment occurs, assets and flows are identified, and the duplication is removed.

Results of Operations 
 
 Foreign Currency Translation 
 
 Foreign currency translation impacts our results of operations. Revenue is impacted by foreign currency translation, but the impact is generally determined by the primary currency of the individual funds. Expenses are also impacted by foreign currency translation, primarily driven by the translation of GBP to USD. The GBP strengthened against the USD during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same periods in 2023. Meaningful foreign currency translation impacts to our revenue and operating expenses are discussed below.

 Management fees 
 
 Management fees increased by 67.9 million during the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023, and by 162.0 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increases in management fees were primarily due to an improvement in average AUM. 
 
 Performance fees 
 
 Performance fees are derived across a number of product ranges. U.S. mutual fund performance fees are recognized on a monthly basis, while all other performance fees are recognized on a quarterly or annual basis. The investment management fees paid by each U.S. mutual fund subject to a performance fee is the base management fee plus or minus a performance fee adjustment, as determined by the relative investment performance of the fund, over a 36-month rolling period, compared to a specified benchmark index. Performance fees by product type consisted of the following for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 (in millions):

Performance fees improved by 24.4 million during the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023, primarily due to an improvement in performance of SICAVs and the U.S. mutual funds. 
 
 Performance fees improved by 39.5 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023, primarily due to an improvement in performance of SICAVs, UK Open Ended Investment Companies UK OEICs and unit trusts, and U.S. mutual funds. These improvements were partially offset by a decline in performance of certain investment trusts. 
 
 We estimate fourth quarter 2024 aggregate performance fees to be higher than fourth quarter 2023 performance fees, primarily due to strong investment performance of a certain hedge fund and an improvement in U.S. mutual fund performance fees. However, actual results will be dependent on investment performance over the remainder of 2024. 
 
 Shareowner servicing fees 
 
 Shareowner servicing fees are primarily composed of U.S. mutual fund servicing fees, which are driven by AUM. Shareowner servicing fees increased by 6.5 million during the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023, and by 17.4 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increases in shareowner servicing fees were primarily due to an improvement in average mutual fund AUM. 
 
 Other revenue 
 
 Other revenue is primarily composed of 12b-1 distribution fees, general administration charges and other fee revenue. General administration charges include reimbursements from funds for various fees and expenses paid for by the investment manager on behalf of the funds. Other revenue increased by 5.0 million during the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023, and by 12.7 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increases in other revenue were primarily due to an improvement in average AUM.

Employee compensation and benefits 
 
 Employee compensation and benefits increased by 27.8 million during the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase was primarily driven by an increase of 22.3 million in variable compensation, mainly due to higher profitability, unfavorable foreign currency translation of 3.1 million and 2.4 million of base-pay increases. 
 
 Employee compensation and benefits increased by 71.9 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase was primarily driven by an increase of 57.1 million in variable compensation, mainly due to higher profitability, 7.2 million of base-pay increases and unfavorable foreign currency translation of 5.1 million. 
 
 For the year ended December 31, 2024, we anticipate an adjusted compensation to revenue ratio in the range of 43 to 45 . 
 
 Long-term incentive plans 
 
 Long-term incentive plan expenses increased by 7.9 million during the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023, primarily due to increases of 5.4 million driven by market appreciation of mutual fund share awards and certain long-term incentive awards, and 1.4 million for the roll-on of new awards and the acceleration of expense related to departed employees exceeding the roll-off of vested awards and the forfeiture of awards related to departed employees. 
 
 Long-term incentive plan expenses increased by 1.6 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023, primarily due to an increase of 8.1 million driven by market appreciation of mutual fund share awards and certain long-term incentive awards. This increase was partially offset by a decrease of 8.1 million for the roll-off of vested awards and the forfeiture of awards related to departed employees exceeding the roll-on of new awards and the acceleration of expense related to departed employees. 
 
 Distribution expenses 
 
 Distribution expenses are paid to financial intermediaries for the distribution and servicing of our retail investment products and are typically calculated based on the amount of the intermediary-sourced AUM. Distribution expenses increased by 17.7 million during the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023, and by 40.1 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increases in distribution expenses were primarily due to an improvement in average AUM subject to distribution expenses. 
 
 Investment administration 
 
 Investment administration expenses, which represent fund administration and fund accounting, increased by 5.3 million during the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023, and by 7.6 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increases in investment administration expenses were primarily due to contractual changes with a third-party vendor. 
 
 General, administrative and occupancy 
 
 General, administrative and occupancy expenses increased by 3.7 million during the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase was primarily due to a 5.0 million increase in consultancy fees related to certain project costs, partially offset by a 2.7 million reduction in rent-related expenses. 
 
 General, administrative and occupancy expenses increased by 5.9 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase was primarily due to a 7.7 million increase in the amortization of capitalized cloud computing costs, primarily related to the order management system transformation project that was completed in the second quarter of 2023, and a 3.7 million increase in consultancy fees related to certain project costs. These increases were partially offset by a 4.7 million insurance reimbursement related to a separately managed account trade error that occurred in 2023 and a 3.3 million reduction in rent-related expenses. 
 
 2024 non-compensation operating expenses 
 
 For the year ended December 31, 2024, we anticipate adjusted non-compensation expense growth in the higher end of mid- to high-single digits. The anticipated growth in our non-compensation expense is due to planned investments supporting our strategic initiatives including technology, marketing and advertising, anticipated inflation, amortization of certain capitalized costs and costs associated with acquisitions made in 2024. A portion of the expected fourth quarter expenses is seasonal or one-time in nature and, all else equal, an indicative quarterly run rate for non-compensation expenses will be lower going forward.

Movements in investment gains (losses), net are primarily due to the consolidation and deconsolidation of third-party ownership interests in seeded investment products and fair value adjustments in relation to our seeded investment products. In addition, a 12.5 million correction due to an error of previously recognized earnings associated with an equity method investment impacted investment gains (losses), net for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 
 Gains and losses attributable to third-party ownership interests in seeded investment products are noncontrolling interests and are not included in net income attributable to JHG. 
 
 Other non-operating income (expense), net 
 
 Other non-operating income (expense), net moved unfavorably by 88.2 million during the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023, primarily due to a 111.9 million release of accumulated foreign currency translation adjustments related to liquidated JHG entities. This decrease was partially offset by a 13.4 million provision for a credit loss and an 11.9 million contingent consideration fair value adjustment, which were both recognized during the three months ended September 30, 2023. 
 
 Other non-operating income (expense), net declined by 60.1 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023, primarily due to a 95.4 million release of accumulated foreign currency translation adjustments related to liquidated JHG entities. This decrease was partially offset by a 13.4 million provision for a credit loss and an 11.9 million contingent consideration fair value adjustment, which were both recognized during the three months ended September 30, 2023, and a 10.1 million increase in interest income driven by higher interest rates on cash balances. 
 
 In October 2024, a certain non-operating JHG entity liquidated, and we recognized an unfavorable foreign currency translation adjustment of 42.6 million in other non-operating income (expense), net on the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income. 
 
 Income tax provision 
 
 Our effective tax rates for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, were as follows:

The effective tax rate for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same periods in 2023, was impacted by the release of accumulated foreign currency translation reserves from liquidated JHG entities that are treated as non-deductible for tax purposes during the period. In addition, the tax rate was impacted by the disallowed noncontrolling interest expense from seeded investment products. 
 
 For the year ended December 31, 2024, we expect our tax rate on adjusted net income attributable to JHG to be in the range of 23 to 25 .

Non-GAAP Financial Measures 
 
 We report our financial results in accordance with GAAP. However, we evaluate our profitability and our ongoing operations using additional non-GAAP financial measures. These measures are not in accordance with, or a substitute for, GAAP, and our financial measures may be different from non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies. Management uses these performance measures to evaluate the business, and adjusted values are consistent with internal management reporting. We have provided a reconciliation below of our non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures.

 We contract with third-party intermediaries to distribute and service certain of our investment products. Fees for distribution- and servicing-related activities are either provided for separately in an investment product s prospectus or are part of the management fee. Under both arrangements, the fees are collected by us and passed through to third-party intermediaries who are responsible for performing the applicable services. The majority of distribution and servicing fees we collect are passed through to third-party intermediaries. JHG management believes that the deduction of distribution and servicing fees from revenue in the computation of adjusted revenue reflects the pass-through nature of these revenues. In certain arrangements, we perform the distribution and servicing activities and retain the applicable fee. Revenues for distribution and servicing activities performed by us are not deducted from GAAP revenue. In addition to the adjustments related to distribution and servicing activities, other revenue for the three months ended September 30, 2024, also includes an adjustment related to an employee secondment arrangement with a joint venture. The arrangement is pass-through in nature, and we believe the costs do not represent our ongoing operations. 

(2) 
 Adjustments for the three months ended September 30, 2024, include acquisition-related expenses and the acceleration of long-term incentive plan expense related to the departure of certain employees. Adjustments for the three months ended September 30, 2023, include rent expense, rent income and other rent-related adjustments associated with subleased office space, and the acceleration of long-term incentive plan expense related to the departure of certain employees. JHG management believes these costs are not representative of our ongoing operations. Additionally, within the reconciliation of operating expenses to adjusted operating expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2024, employee compensation and benefits also includes an adjustment related to an employee secondment arrangement with a joint venture. The arrangement is pass-through in nature, and we believe the costs do not represent our ongoing operations. 

(3) 
 Investment management contracts have been identified as a separately identifiable intangible asset arising on the acquisition of subsidiaries and businesses. Such contracts are recognized at the net present value of the expected future cash flows arising from the contracts at the date of acquisition. For segregated mandate contracts, the intangible asset is amortized on a straight-line basis over the expected life of the contracts. JHG management believes these non-cash and acquisition-related costs are not representative of our ongoing operations. 

(4) 
 Operating margin is operating income divided by revenue. 

(5) 
 Adjusted operating margin is adjusted operating income divided by adjusted revenue. 

(6) 
 Adjustments for the three months ended September 30, 2024, consist primarily of the release of accumulated foreign currency translation adjustments related to JHG liquidated entities. The adjustment for the three months ended September 30, 2023, includes a provision for a credit loss and contingent consideration fair value adjustment related to the 2022 sale of Intech Investment Management LLC. JHG management believes these costs are not representative of our ongoing operations. 

(7) 
 The tax impact of the adjustments is calculated based on the applicable U.S. or foreign statutory tax rate as it relates to each adjustment. Certain adjustments are either not taxable or not tax-deductible. Adjustments for the three months ended September 30, 2023, were impacted by the change to our state tax rate. As a result, the U.S. deferred tax assets and liabilities were revalued from 23.9 to 23.5 , creating a non-cash deferred tax benefit of 8.8 million. 

(8) 
 Diluted earnings per share is net income attributable to JHG common shareholders divided by weighted-average diluted common shares outstanding. 

(9) 
 Adjusted diluted earnings per share is adjusted net income attributable to JHG common shareholders divided by weighted-average diluted common shares outstanding. 

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES 
 
 Our capital structure, together with available cash balances, cash flows generated from operations, and further capital and credit market activities, if necessary, should provide us with sufficient resources to meet present and future cash needs, including operating and other obligations as they fall due and anticipated future capital requirements. 
 
 The following table summarizes key balance sheet data relating to our liquidity and capital resources as of September 30, 2024, and December 31, 2023 (in millions):

Cash and cash equivalents primarily consist of cash held at banks, on-demand deposits, investments in money market instruments, highly liquid short-term debt securities and commercial paper with a maturity date of three months or less. Cash and cash equivalents exclude cash held by consolidated VIEs and consolidated VREs, and investments exclude noncontrolling interests as these assets are not available for general corporate purposes. 
 
 Investments held by us represent seeded investment products (exclusive of noncontrolling interests), investments related to deferred compensation plans and other less significant investments classified as current assets in our Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. 
 
 We believe that existing cash and cash from operations should be sufficient to satisfy our short-term capital requirements. Expected short-term uses of cash include ordinary operating expenditures, seed capital investments, interest expense, dividend payments, income tax payments, common stock repurchases and redemption of our 2025 Senior Notes. We may also use available cash for other general corporate purposes and acquisitions.

Regulatory Capital 
 
 We are subject to regulatory oversight by the SEC, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority FINRA ), the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission CFTC ), the Financial Conduct Authority FCA and other international regulatory bodies. We strive to ensure that we are compliant with our regulatory obligations at all times. Our primary capital requirement relates to the FCA-supervised regulatory group (a sub-group of our company), comprising Janus Henderson (UK) Holdings Limited, all of its subsidiaries and Janus Henderson Investors International Limited JHIIL ). JHIIL is included as a connected undertaking to meet the requirements of the Investment Firm Prudential Regime IFPR for Markets in Financial Instruments Directive MiFID investment firms MIFIDPRU ). The combined capital requirement is 159.2 million 213.5 million), resulting in 284.3 million 381.3 million) of capital above the requirement as of September 30, 2024, based upon internal calculations and taking into account the effect of foreseeable dividends. The decrease in the surplus since June 30, 2024, is primarily due to a 19 million 24.3 million) increase in the goodwill deduction from capital relating to the Tabula acquisition and an increase in the capital requirement following the conclusions drawn from our last Internal Capital Adequacy and Risk Assessment. Capital requirements in other jurisdictions are not significant in aggregate. The FCA-supervised regulatory group is also subject to liquidity requirements and holds a sufficient surplus above these requirements.

We periodically add new investment strategies to our investment product offerings by providing the initial cash investment, or seeding, in a product. The primary purpose of seeded investment products is to generate an investment performance track record in these products and leverage that track record to attract third-party investors. We may redeem our seed capital investments for a variety of reasons, including when third-party investments in the relevant product are sufficient to sustain the investment strategy. The cash associated with seeding and redeeming seeded investment products is reflected in the above table as purchases of investments, net. 
 
 We consolidate certain seeded investment products into our group financial statements. The purchases and sales of investments within consolidated seeded investment products are disclosed separately from our capital contributions to seed a product. We also maintain an economic hedge program that uses derivative instruments to mitigate against market exposure of certain seeded investments. The cash received and paid as part of this program is reflected in the table above. 
 
 The transactions discussed above represent a majority of the activity within investing activities on our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES 
 
 We continually evaluate the accounting policies and estimates used to prepare the condensed consolidated financial statements. In general, management s estimates are based on historical experience, information from third-party professionals, as appropriate, and various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under current facts and circumstances. Actual results could differ from those estimates made by management. There were no material changes to our critical accounting estimates described in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023.

 As of September 30, 2024, our management evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act).

Disclosure controls and procedures are designed by us to ensure that we record, process, summarize and report within the time periods specified in the SEC s rule and forms the information we must disclose in reports that we file with or submit to the SEC. Ali Dibadj, our CEO, and Roger Thompson, our Chief Financial Officer, reviewed and participated in management s evaluation of the disclosure controls and procedures. Based on this evaluation, Mr. Dibadj and Mr. Thompson concluded that as of the date of their evaluation, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective. 
 
 There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) during the third quarter 2024 that materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
