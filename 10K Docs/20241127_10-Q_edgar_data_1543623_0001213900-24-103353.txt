Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial
Condition and Results of Operations 

The following Management s Discussion
and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations MD A is intended to help the reader understand US Nuclear
Corp, our operations and our present business environment. MD A is provided as a supplement to and should be read in conjunction
with our consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. The
audited financial statements for our fiscal year ended December 31, 2023, filed with the Securities Exchange Commission on Form 10-K on
May 10, 2024, should be read in conjunction with the discussion below. This discussion contains forward-looking statements that
reflect our plans, estimates and beliefs. Our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements.
 In the opinion of management, all material adjustments necessary to present fairly the results of
operations for such periods have been included in these unaudited financial statements. 

We were incorporated in Delaware on February 14,
2012, and on March 2, 2012, we filed a registration statement on Form 10 to register with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission
as a public company. We were originally organized as a vehicle to investigate and, if such investigation warrants, acquire a target
company or business seeking the perceived advantages of being a publicly held corporation. 

Since our acquisition of Overhoff Technology in
2006, we have had discussions with other companies in our industry for an acquisition. While we targeted Overhoff due to its unique position
in the tritium market, we had not commenced an acquisition since our Overhoff Technology acquisition; we believe in part the reason was
due to lack of additional capital, our status as a privately held entity at the time, and focus on developing our own products. We will
seek out companies whom our management believes will provide value to our customers and will complement our business. We will focus on
diversifying our product line into a larger range so that our customers and vendors may have a more expansive experience in type, choice,
options, price and selection. We also believe that with a more diverse product line we will become more competitive as our industry is
intensely competitive. 

Generally,
our product concentration places a heavy reliance on our Overhoff Technology division. During the nine months ending September 30, 2024,
we derived 81 of our total revenues from sales made by Overhoff to three customers. We have experienced a 21 increase in business from
our Technical Associates division compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023, which is largely due to expansion of our international
customer base. 

Our international
revenues were 32.1 of our total revenue during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. We expect this to increase over time as we continue
to field new order inquiries and engage new customers overseas. We believe that South Korea and China will likely be a larger contributor
to revenue within the next few years. While we maintain steady growth domestically, the international side of our business may be a larger
component as nuclear technology and rapid development for clean energy grows abroad. Additionally, the Company relies on continued growth
and orders from CANDU reactors (Canada Deuterium Uranium), and rapid development of the next generation of nuclear reactors called Molten
Salt Reactors, (MSR) and Liquid-Fluoride Thorium Reactors (LFTR), all of which purchase tritium detection and monitor products. There
can be no assurances as to our growth projections and our risk profile as we depend upon increased foreign customers for business. 

For the next twelve months, we anticipate we will
need approximately 5,000,000 in additional capital to fund our business plans. If we do not raise the required capital, we may not meet
our expenses and there can be no assurance that we will be able to do so and if we do, we may find the cost of such financing to be burdensome
on the Company. Additionally, we may not be able to execute on our business plans due to unforeseen market forces such as lower natural
gas prices, difficulty attracting qualified executive staff, general downturn in our sector or by competition as we operate in an
extremely competitive market for all of our product offerings. 

Robert I. Goldstein, our President, Chief Executive
Officer and Chairman of the Board of Directors also maintains a position as President of Gold Team Inc., a Delaware company that invests
in industrial real estate properties for investment purposes. He holds an 8 interest in Gold Team Inc. and spends approximately 5 hours
per week on affairs related to Gold Team Inc. The Company leases its current facilities from Gold Team Inc., which owns both the Canoga
Park, CA and Milford, Ohio properties at an expense of 9,000 and 9,000, respectively, for each facility per month. 

19 

On May 31, 2016, we entered into an Asset Purchase
Agreement with Electronic Control Concepts ECC whereby the Company purchased certain tangible and intangible assets of
ECC. ECC is a small manufacturer of test and maintenance meters for x-ray machines both medical and industrial. We acquired ECC to
give a boost to our current x-ray related product and hospital/medical product sales. 

On March 3, 2023, the Company divested itself
of its wholly owned subsidiary, Cali From Above, through a Membership Interest Purchase Agreement with the Company s President and
Chief Executive Officer, Robert Goldstein. Consideration received by the Company was 65,000,000 shares of Averox, Inc. (OTC:AVRI), resulting
in the Company owning 26 of the issued and outstanding shares of common stock of AVRI. The Company and Cali From Above also signed a
Cooperation Agreement whereby the Company holds exclusive sourcing and manufacturing rights for Cali From Above products, thus making
Cali From Above a new customer of the Company.

Sales for the three months ended September 30,
2024, were 610,864 compared to 593,502 for the same period in 2023. The increase of 17,362 or 2.9 is a result of an decrease in sales
from our Optron subsidiary of 105,875 offset by an increase in sales from our Overhoff subsidiary of 123,237. The overall increase in
sales is principally due to the mix of products and services sold during the period combined with an increase in our international customer
base at Optron. The sales breakdown for the three months ended September 30, 2024, is as follows: 

North America 77.54 

Asia (Including Japan) 16.22 

Other 6.24 

Our gross margins for the three months ended September
30, 2024, were 77.36 as compared to 78.48 for the same period in 2023. Gross margins decreased for the three months ended September
30, 2024, due to fluctuations in the cost of materials used in manufacturing our products, in addition to uncommon costs incurred during
the period ending September 30, 2023 for products not meeting specifications or standards upon completion of the manufacturing process . 

Selling, general and administrative expenses for
the three months ended September 30, 2024, were 541,731 compared to 539,337 for the same period in 2023. The increase of 2,394 or 0.4 
was principally due to increases in professional fees and payroll and employee benefits. During the three months ended September 30, 2024,
there was no stock-based compensation compared to 396,847 during the same period in 2023. Stock based compensation is issued as an incentive
to consultants to increase revenues through the acquisition of new customers. 

Other income/(expense) for the three months ended
September 30, 2024, was (41,735), compared to 686,500) for the same period in 2023. The change was primarily due to a decrease in the
amortization of debt discounts associated with convertible debentures of 658,705.

in sales from our Optron subsidiary of 57,417 and an increase in sales from our Overhoff subsidiary of 95,756. The overall increase

North America 67.86 

Asia (Including Japan) 16.72

Our gross margins for the nine months ended September
30, 2024, were 62.3 as compared to 58.94 for the same period in 2023. Gross margins increased for the nine months ended September 30,
2024, due to fluctuations in the cost of materials used in manufacturing our products, in addition to uncommon costs incurred during

amortization of debt discounts associated with convertible debentures of 1,275,316, offset
by an increase in interest expense in the current period. 

Net loss for the nine months ended September 30,
2024, was 728,320 compared to 2,296,114 for the same period in 2023. The change was principally attributed to the factors described
above. 

Liquidity and Capital Resources 

Our operations have historically been financed
by our majority shareholder and more recently from proceeds from the sale of our common stock. As funds were needed for working capital
purposes, our majority shareholder would loan us the needed funds. We anticipate funding the growth of our business through the sales
of additional shares of our common stock and loans from our majority stockholder if necessary. 

21 

At September 30, 2024, total assets increased
to 3,082,890 from 2,856,876 at December 31, 2023. The increase primarily reflects increases in accounts receivable and inventory, offset
by a decrease in cash. 

At September 30, 2024, total liabilities decreased
to 3,228,477 from 4,839,495 at December 31, 2023. The decrease is primarily the net of increases in accounts payable and customer deposits,
offset by decreases in deferred revenue, accrued expenses, notes payable, and amortization of debt discounts. Notes payable and accrued
expenses decreased 2,238,000 due to the forgiveness of 360,000 in debt and the conversion of 1,878,000 to Series A convertible preferred
stock designated by the Company in the current period. 

Net cash used in operating activities for the
nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 425,469 compared to 102,283 for the same period in 2023. The change in cash from operations
was principally due to changes in inventory, accounts receivable, and customer deposit working capital accounts. 

Net cash used in investing activities for the
nine months ended September 30, 2024, was 21,581 compared to 20,789 for the same period in 2023. The increase in cash used in investing
activities was primarily due to the decrease of a note receivable by 6,669 and cash of 2,539 surrendered in the deconsolidation of Cali
From Above during the prior period offset by an increase in employee advances of 10,000. 

Net cash provided by financing activities for
the nine months ended September 30, 2024, was 325,988 compared to 181,666 for the same period in 2023. The change in cash from financing
activities was primarily due to repayments of notes payable offset by increases in proceeds from lines of credit and shareholder loans. 

Critical Accounting Policies 

Our financial statements and related public financial
information are based on the application of accounting principles generally accepted in the United States US GAAP ). US
GAAP requires the use of estimates; assumptions, judgments and subjective interpretations of accounting principles that have an impact
on the assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses amounts reported. These estimates can also affect supplemental information contained
in our external disclosures including information regarding contingencies, risk and financial condition. We believe our use of estimates
and underlying accounting assumptions adhere to GAAP and are consistently and conservatively applied. We base our estimates on historical
experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ materially
from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. We continue to monitor significant estimates made during the preparation
of our financial statements. 

We believe
our use of estimates and underlying accounting assumptions adhere to GAAP and are consistently applied. Our significant accounting
policies are summarized in Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements. 

22 

Income Taxes 

The Company accounts for income taxes in accordance
with ASC Topic 740, Income Taxes . ASC 740 requires a company to use the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes,
whereby deferred tax assets are recognized for deductible temporary differences, and deferred tax liabilities are recognized for taxable
temporary differences. Temporary differences are the differences between the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and their tax
bases. Deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance when, in the opinion of management, it is more likely than not that some
portion, or all of, the deferred tax assets will not be realized. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are adjusted for the effects
of changes in tax laws and rates on the date of enactment. 

Under ASC 740, a tax position is recognized as
a benefit only if it is more likely than not that the tax position would be sustained in a tax examination, with a tax examination
being presumed to occur. The amount recognized is the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than 50 likely of being realized
on examination. For tax positions not meeting the more likely than not test, no tax benefit is recorded. The adoption had
no effect on the Company s consolidated financial statements. 

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 

We have not entered into any off-balance sheet
arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition,
revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources.

Item 4. Controls and Procedures. 

Evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures 

Under the supervision and with the participation
of our management, including our principal executive officer and the principal financial officer, we are responsible for conducting an
evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our internal controls and procedures, as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and
15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as of the end of the fiscal quarter covered by this report. Disclosure
controls and procedures means that the material information required to be included in our Securities and Exchange Commission SEC reports is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in SEC rules and forms relating to our company,
particularly during the period when this report was being prepared. Based on this evaluation, our principal executive officer and
principal financial officer concluded as of the evaluation date that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of September
30, 2024. 

Changes in internal controls 

Our management, with the participation of our
Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, performed an evaluation to determine whether any change in our internal controls
over financial reporting occurred during the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024. Based on that evaluation, our Chief Executive
Officer and our Chief Financial Officer concluded that no change occurred in the Company s internal controls over financial reporting
during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company s
internal controls over financial reporting.
