NOTES TO UNAUDITED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 

September 30, 2024 

Basis of Presentation 

Our financial statements are presented in conformity
with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, as reported on our fiscal years ending on December 31,
2024 and 2023. We have summarized our most significant accounting policies. 

Going concern 

The Company currently has limited operations. These
unaudited consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern, which contemplates,
among other things, the realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business. 

As reflected in the accompanying unaudited consolidated
financial statements, the Company had an accumulated deficit of at September 30, 2024, and had a net loss of and net
cash flow used in operating activities of for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively. The Company has a limited
operating history, and its continued growth is dependent upon the continuation of selling its products; hence generating revenues and
obtaining additional financing to fund future obligations and pay liabilities arising from normal business operations. These matters raise
substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. The ability of the Company to continue as a going
concern is dependent on the Company s ability to raise additional capital, implement its business plan, and generate significant
revenues. There are no assurances that the Company will be successful in its efforts to generate significant revenues, maintain sufficient
cash balance or report profitable operations or to continue as a going concern. The Company plans on raising capital through the sale
of equity or debt instruments to implement its business plan. However, there is no assurance these plans will be realized and that any
additional financings will be available to the Company on satisfactory terms and conditions, if any. 

The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated
financial statements do not include any adjustments related to the recoverability or classification of asset-carrying amounts or the amounts
and classification of liabilities that may result should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern.

Overview 

Sentient Brands is a next-level product development
and brand management company with a focus on building innovative brands in the Luxury and Premium Market space. The Company has a Direct-to
Consumer business model focusing on the integration of CBD, wellness and beauty for conscious consumers. The Company incorporates an omnichannel
approach in its marketing strategies to ensure that its products are accessible across both digital and retail channels. The Company develops
and nurtures Lifestyle Brands with carefully thought-out ingredients, packaging, fragrance and design. Sentient Brands leadership
team has extensive experience in building world-class brands such as Hugo Boss, Victoria s Secret, Versace, and Bath Body
Works. The Company is focused on two key market segments targeting: wellness and responsible luxury, which the Company believes represent
unique opportunities for its Oeuvre product line. Sentient Brands intends to leverage its in-house innovation capabilities to launch new
products that disrupt adjacent product categories. We plan to grow by leveraging our deep connections within our existing
network and attract consumers through increased brand awareness and investing in unique social media marketing. The Company s goal
is to create customer experiences that have sustainable resonance with consumers and consistently implement strategies that result in
long-term profit growth for our investors. 

Principal Products and Services 

All of our proprietary formulations contain clean,
vegan, ethically and environmentally responsible ingredients. The Company currently has one main product line, and another in development.
The Company s current active product line is Oeuvre. 

Oeuvre 

Oeuvre - A Body of Art is
a next generation CBD luxury skin care line and lifestyle brand. The foundation of our system of products is our proprietary OE Complex:
Botanicals + Gemstones + Full flower Hemp infused formulation. Each product in the Oeuvre Artistry Collection optimizes three functions:

Oeuvre Target Market 

Oeuvre is our luxury segment product line.
With Oeuvre , we are targeting a large and influential consumer class of individuals that are HENRYs 
High-Earners-Not-Rich-Yet. They have discretionary income and are highly likely to be wealthy in the future. HENRYs earn between 100,000
and 250,000 annually. They are digitally fluent, love online shopping online, and are big discretionary spenders. Therefore, ouvreskincare.com
offers inclusive, aspirationally affordable luxury products positioned for them. 

We believe the benefit of onboarding this demographic
to Oeuvre are twofold: securing valuable present customers and building relationships and business with those most likely
to be amongst the most affluent consumers in the future. By the year 2025, Millennials and Generation Z will represent more than 40 of
the overall luxury goods market, according to a 2019 report published by Boston Consulting Group. We seek to target such group for the
sale of our Oeuvre products. 

On social media, we target the following audiences
for our Oeuvre brand: 

Women aged 30+ 

Luxury Skincare Enthusiasts 

CBD Enthusiasts 

Crystal Lovers 

Wellness Audience 

Makeup Artists 

Art 

Beauty 

Influencers 

Bloggers 

Suppliers 

The Company has several third-party suppliers and
is not reliant on any particular supplier for its product offerings. Many of our products contain CBD derived from industrial hemp or
cannabis which we obtain from third parties. Hemp cultivation can be impacted by weather patterns and other natural events, but we have
not yet faced any supply issues to date with obtaining raw materials for our products. 

Distribution 

We have two primary methods through which we sell
our products: 

1. 
 Direct to Consumer online e-commerce platform 

2. 
 Wholesale partners 

Marketing Strategy 

We support our brand launches through social media
and marketing campaigns, including utilizing influencers. Marketing and public relations firms are engaged by the Company to spearhead
its launch of Oeuvre, and will likely be engaged for our future planned brand launches as well. 

Growth Strategies 

To grow our company, Sentient Brands intends to: 

Create a leading consumer packaged goods company; 

Partner with established distributers and retailers; 

Focus on operational excellence and product quality;
 and 

Establish ongoing communication with the capital markets

15 

Our mission is to create the next generation of CBD/THC
consumer brands. The Company believes it has assembled a highly accomplished team of branding and marketing professionals who have a combined
experience and track record of successfully launching and operating major brands in the consumer market space, which the Company believes
will provide it with it a competitive edge in its industry. 

M A Strategy 

During the third quarter of 2022, the Company launched
an M A strategy to identify high-margin, revenue generating businesses within above-average growth potential industry sectors as potential
acquisition targets. 

Customers 

The Company launched its Oeuvre product line
in the fourth quarter of 2021. The Company s sales channels are direct to consumer and wholesale. 

Intellectual Property 

The Company s Oeuvre brand is trademarked
in the United States, with a European trademark application pending. The Company expects to rely on trade secrets and proprietary know-how protection
for our confidential and proprietary information, however we have not yet taken security measures to protect this information. 

Competition 

We have experienced, and expect to continue to experience,
intense competition from a number of companies. 

The current market for hemp-derived CBD products is
highly competitive, consisting of publicly-trade and privately-owned companies, many of which are more adequately capitalized than the
Company. The Company s current publicly listed competitors include Charlotte s Web, CV Sciences, Elixinol, Abacus, and Green
Growth Brands, and private companies such as BeBoe, St. Jane. Mary s, Lord Jones, Bluebird Folium Biosciences, Global Cannabinoids,
and Pure Kana. In addition, public and private U.S. and Canadian companies have entered the hemp-derived CBD consumer market or have announced
plans to do so. This market is highly fragmented, and according to the Hemp Business Journal, the vast majority of industry participants
generate less than 2 million in annual revenue. We see this an opportunity to create a foothold in the CBD consumer marketplace with
the goal of building Sentient Brands as a major brand name in this space. 

Industry Overview 

The market for products based on extracts of hemp
and cannabis, is expected to grow substantially over the coming years. Arcview Market Research and BDS Analytics are forecasting the combined
market to reach nearly 45 billion within the U.S. in the year 2024. While much of this market is expected to be comprised of high potency
THC-based products that will be sold in licensed dispensaries, certain research firms are still predicting the market to grow to 5.3
billion, 12.6 billion, and 2.2 billion by 2024 in the product areas of low THC cannabinoids, THC-free Cannabinoids and pharmaceutical
cannabinoids, respectively. 

On December 20, 2018, President Donald J. Trump signed
into law the Agriculture Improvement Act of 2018, otherwise known as the Farm Bill. Prior to its passage, hemp, a member
of the cannabis family, and hemp-derived CBD were classified as a Schedule I controlled substances, and illegal under the Controlled Substances
Act CSA ). Under Section 10113 of the Farm Bill, hemp cannot contain more than 0.3 percent THC. THC refers to the chemical
compound found in cannabis that produces the psychoactive high associated with cannabis. Any cannabis plant that contains
more than 0.3 percent THC would be considered non-hemp cannabis or marijuana under federal law and thus would face no legal protection
under this new legislation and would be an illegal Schedule 1 drug under the CSA. 

With the passage of the Farm Bill, hemp cultivation
is broadly permitted. The Farm Bill explicitly allows the transfer of hemp-derived products across state lines for commercial or other
purposes. It also puts no restrictions on the sale, transport, or possession of hemp-derived products, so long as those items are produced
in a manner consistent with the law.

Recent Developments 

None 

Government Regulation 

The United States Food Drug Administration FDA is generally responsible for protecting the public health by ensuring the safety, efficacy, and security of (1) prescription and over
the counter drugs; (2) biologics including vaccines, blood and blood products, and cellular and gene therapies; (3) foodstuffs including
dietary supplements, bottled water, and baby formula; and (4) medical devices including heart pacemakers, surgical implants, prosthetics,
and dental devices. 

Regarding its regulation of drugs, the FDA process
requires a review that begins with the filing of an investigational new drug (IND) application, with follow on clinical studies and clinical
trials that the FDA uses to determine whether a drug is safe and effective, and therefore subject to approval for human use by the FDA. 

Aside from the FDA s mandate to regulate drugs,
the FDA also regulates dietary supplement products and dietary ingredients under the Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act of 1994.
This law prohibits manufacturers and distributors of dietary supplements and dietary ingredients from marketing products that are adulterated
or misbranded. This means that these firms are responsible for evaluating the safety and labeling of their products before marketing to
ensure that they meet all the requirements of the law and FDA regulations, including, but not limited to the following labeling requirements:
(1) identifying the supplement; (2) nutrition labeling; (3) ingredient labeling; (4) claims; and (5) daily use information. 

The FDA has not approved cannabis, marijuana, hemp
or derivatives as a safe and effective drug for any indication. As of the date of this filing, we have not, and do not intend to file
an Investigational New Drug Application (IND) with the FDA, concerning any of our products that contain CBD derived from industrial hemp
or cannabis. Further, our products containing CBD derived from industrial hemp are not marketed or sold using claims that their use is
safe and effective treatment for any medical condition subject to the FDA s jurisdiction. 

Government Approvals 

The Company does not currently require any government
approvals for its operations or product offerings. In August 2019, the DEA affirmed that CBD preparations at or below the 0.3 percent
delta-9 THC threshold, is not a controlled substance, and a DEA registration is not required. As a result of the 2018 Farm Bill, the FDA
has been tasked with developing CBD regulations. The FDA has not yet published regulations. 

Research and Development 

We are continuously in the process of identifying
and/or developing potential new products to offer to our customers. Our expenditures on research and development have historically been
small and immaterial compared to our other business expenditures. We are currently developing new formulations for additional product
lines. 

Employees 

We believe that our success depends upon our ability
to attract, develop and retain key personnel. We currently employ two full-time employees. The Company otherwise currently relies on the
services of independent contractors. None of our employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements, and management considers relations
with our employees to be in good standing. Although we continually seek to add additional talent to our work force, management believes
that it currently has sufficient human capital to operate its business successfully. 

17 

Our compensation programs are designed to align the
compensation of our employees with our performance and to provide the proper incentives to attract, retain and motivate employees to achieve
superior results. The structure of our compensation programs balances incentive earnings for both short-term and long-term performance. 

The primary mailing address for the Company is 590 Madison Avenue, 21 st 
Floor, New York, New York 10022. The Company s telephone number is (646) 202-2897. The Company s website is www.sentientbrands.com. 

Critical Accounting Policies
and Estimates 

Our discussion and analysis
of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in
accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements
requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related
disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. We continually evaluate our estimates, including those related to bad debts, recovery
of long-lived assets, income taxes and the valuation of equity transactions. 

We base our estimates on
historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which
form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources.
Any future changes to these estimates and assumptions could cause a material change to our reported amounts of revenues, expenses, assets
and liabilities. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. We believe the following critical
accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements. 

Recent Accounting Pronouncements 

Accounting standards that
have been issued or proposed by FASB that do not require adoption until a future date are not expected to have a material impact on our
consolidated financial statements upon adoption. We do not discuss recent pronouncements that are not anticipated to have an impact on
or are unrelated to our consolidated financial condition, results of operations, cash flows or disclosures.

Liquidity and Capital
Resources 

The consolidated financial
statements have been prepared using generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America GAAP applicable
for a going concern, which assumes that the Company will realize its assets and discharge its liabilities in the ordinary course of business. 

To the extent we are successful
in growing our business both organically and through acquisition, we continue to plan our working capital and the proceeds of any financing
to finance such acquisition costs. 

Liquidity is the ability
of a company to generate funds to support its current and future operations, satisfy its obligations and otherwise operate on an ongoing
basis. At September 30, 2024, we had a cash balance of 1,452. These funds are kept in financial institutions located in United States. 

As of September 30, 2024, we had total current assets
of 2,232, consisting of 1,452 in cash and prepaid expenses of 780. Our total current liabilities as of September 30, 2024 were 2,275,823.
We had a working capital deficit of 2,273,591 as of September 30, 2024. 

Our ability to continue as
a going concern is dependent upon our ability to carry out our business plan, achieve profitable operations, obtain additional working
capital funds from our significant shareholders, and or through debt and equity financings. However, there can be no assurance that any
additional financings will be available to us on satisfactory terms and conditions, if any. 

The accompanying consolidated
financial statements do not include any adjustments related to the recoverability or classification of asset-carrying amounts or the amounts
and classification of liabilities that may result should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern. 

Cash Flows from Operating Activities 

Operating activities used 190,347 in cash for the
nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared with cash used of 60,794 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Our negative operating
cash flow for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, was largely the result of our net loss of 933,749 offset by non cash expense
for consulting services of 340,750 and an inventory write off of 150,000. Our prepaid expenses decreased by 7,673 and our subscriptions
payable for stock purchases increased by 105,000. Our payables for the quarter increased by 110,073. Our negative operating cash flow
for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, was largely the result of our net loss of 242,631 offset by non cash depreciation of 2,909
and other noncash activity totaling 140,900. Accounts payable and accrued expenses decreased by 13,489. 

Cash Flows from Investing Activities

21 

Going Concern 

As of September 30, 2024, we have an accumulated deficit
of 4,467,129. Our ability to continue as a going concern is contingent upon the successful completion of additional financing arrangements
and our ability to achieve and maintain profitable operations. While we are expanding our best efforts to achieve the above plans, there
is no assurance that any such activity will generate funds that will be available for operations. These conditions raise substantial doubt
about our ability to continue as a going concern. These financial statements do not include any adjustments that might arise from this
uncertainty. 

Contractual Obligations and Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 

Contractual Obligations 

We presently do not have
any contractual obligations. 

Off-balance Sheet Arrangements 

We presently do not have
off-balance sheet arrangements. 

Inflation 

The effect of inflation on
our revenue and operating results was not significant. 

ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK. 

As a smaller reporting company, as defined in Rule
12b-2 of the Exchange Act, we are not required to provide the information required by this Item. 

ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

We conducted an evaluation,
with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of
our disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended,
or the Exchange Act, as of March 31, 2023, to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports filed or submitted
by us under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the Securities Exchange
Commission s rules and forms, including to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports filed or submitted
by us under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive and principal financial
officer, or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Based on that
evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that as of September 30, 2024, our disclosure controls
and procedures were not effective at the reasonable assurance level due to the material weaknesses identified and described below. 

Our principal executive officers
do not expect that our disclosure controls or internal controls will prevent all error and all fraud. Although our disclosure controls
and procedures were designed to provide reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives and our principal executive officers have determined
that our disclosure controls and procedures are effective at doing so, a control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can
provide only reasonable, not absolute assurance that the objectives of the system are met. Further, the design of a control system must
reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because
of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and
instances of fraud, if any, within the Company have been detected. These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in
decision-making can be faulty, and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake. Additionally, controls can be circumvented
if there exists in an individual a desire to do so. There can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals
under all potential future conditions.

Remediation Plan to Address
the Material Weaknesses in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 

A material weakness is a
deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility
that a material misstatement of our annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. Management
identified the following three material weaknesses that have caused management to conclude that, as of September 30, 2024, our disclosure
controls and procedures, and our internal control over financial reporting, were not effective at the reasonable assurance level: 

1. 
 We
 do not have written documentation of our internal control policies and procedures. Written documentation of key internal controls
 over financial reporting is a requirement of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act as of the period ended September 30, 2024. Management
 evaluated the impact of our failure to have written documentation of our internal controls and procedures on our assessment of our
 disclosure controls and procedures and has concluded that the control deficiency that resulted represented a material weakness. 

2. 
 We
 do not have sufficient segregation of duties within accounting functions, which is a basic internal control. Due to our size and
 nature, segregation of all conflicting duties may not always be possible and may not be economically feasible. However, to the extent
 possible, the initiation of transactions, the custody of assets and the recording of transactions should be performed by separate
 individuals. Management evaluated the impact of our failure to have segregation of duties on our assessment of our disclosure controls
 and procedures and has concluded that the control deficiency that resulted represented a material weakness. 

3. 
 Effective
 controls over the control environment were not maintained. Specifically, a formally adopted written code of business conduct and
 ethics that governs our employees, officers, and directors was not in place. Additionally, management has not developed and effectively
 communicated to employees its accounting policies and procedures. This has resulted in inconsistent practices. Further, our Board
 of Directors does not currently have any independent members and no director qualifies as an audit committee financial expert as
 defined in Item 407(d)(5)(ii) of Regulation S-K. Since these entity level programs have a pervasive effect across the organization,
 management has determined that these circumstances constitute a material weakness. 

To address these material
weaknesses, management performed additional analyses and other procedures to ensure that the financial statements included herein fairly
present, in all material respects, our financial position, results of operations and cash flows for the periods presented. Accordingly,
we believe that the financial statements included in this report fairly present, in all material respects, our financial condition, results
of operations and cash flows for the periods presented. 

To remediate the material
weakness in our documentation, evaluation and testing of internal controls we plan to engage a third-party firm to assist us in remedying
this material weakness once resources become available. 

We intend to remedy our material
weakness with regard to insufficient segregation of duties by hiring additional employees in order to segregate duties in a manner that
establishes effective internal controls once resources become available. 

Changes in Internal Controls
over Financial Reporting 

There were no changes (including
corrective actions with regard to material weakness) in our internal controls over financial reporting that occurred during the period
covered by this report that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

PART II - OTHER INFORMATION 

ITEM 1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS 

From time to time, we are subject to ordinary routine
litigation incidental to our normal business operations. We are not currently a party to any litigation the outcome of which, if determined
adversely to us, would individually or in the aggregate be reasonably expected to have a material adverse effect on our business, operating
results, cash flows or financial condition.

ITEM 5. OTHER INFORMATION 

As
previously reported, on September 3, 2024, the Company entered into a Share Exchange Agreement (the Exchange Agreement with AIG, F B, Inc., a Nevada corporation AIG ), and the owners (the AIG Shareholders of 100 of the
issued and outstanding shares of common stock of AIG (collectively, the AIG Shares ), pursuant to which, upon the Closing
(as defined below), the Company will acquire the AIG Shares from the AIG Shareholders in exchange for shares of common stock of the Company
(the Acquisition Shares ), which such Acquisition Shares will be issued by the Company to the AIG Shareholders in accordance
with an Earnout Schedule (as defined below) as set forth in the Exchange Agreement (the Share Exchange ). The closing of
the Share Exchange (the Closing was to take place on or before November 1, 2024 (the Outside Closing Date ).
 E ffective
November 1, 2024, the parties amended the Exchange Agreement to extend the Outside Closing Date to December 31, 2024 (the New Outside
Closing Date ). 

The AIG Shareholders represent
a group of international, vertically integrated food and beverage manufacturing companies AIG Group ), comprising eight
factories and 170 distributors across 22 countries, who market and sell products through various U.S. and international big-box retailers
and distributors, with several product lines holding Organic and Kosher certifications. In line with its business plan, AIG intends to
launch a global, vertically integrated food and beverage manufacturing and distribution business, based on AIG Group s proven, cash
flow-positive product lines and business models. The Company believes that, if the Share Exchange is consummated, AIG s planned
business venture would be synergistic with the Company s existing product and brand development business and anticipates meaningful
operation efficiency through the integration of the two organizations. 

Pursuant to the Exchange
Agreement, following the Closing, the Acquisition Shares will be issued by the Company to the AIG Shareholders on a quarterly basis over
the five (5) year period immediately following the Closing, in accordance with a performance-based Earnout Schedule (the Earnout
Schedule ). Pursuant to the Earnout Schedule, the Acquisition Shares will be issued to the AIG Shareholders (and/or their designees)
after achieving certain Company revenue and EBITDA growth for a period of up to five (5) years. The number of Acquisition Shares issued
to the AIG Shareholders pursuant to the Earnout Schedule will be based upon the greatest number of Acquisition Shares that would be calculated
utilizing three (3) different earnout criteria methods, as follows: 

(1) Annual Revenue
Growth Method : Acquisition Shares issued = (Company quarterly revenue growth relative to the same quarter in the previous year) /
(Company s trailing average share price over the prior quarter) where Company s trailing average share price is the average
of the closing price of the Company s share price on its principal market for the quarter. For example : If revenue grows
from 5,000,000 in quarter one 2024 to 10,000,000 in quarter one 2025 and the Company s trailing average share price is .07, then:
 5,000,000/ .07 = 71,428,571 Acquisition Shares to be issued. 

(2) EBITDA Method :
Acquisition Shares issued = (Five (5) x quarterly EBITDA growth relative to the same quarter in the previous year) / (Company s
trailing average share price over the prior quarter). For example : If EBITDA grows from 200,000 in quarter one 2024 to 500,000
in quarter one 2025 and the Company s trailing average share price is .07, then: 5 x 300,000 = 1,500,000/ .07 = 21,428,571 acquisition
shares to be issued. 

(3) Appraised
Value of Rolled-in Assets Method : Acquisition Shares issued = (appraised value of rolled-in assets relative to the same quarter in
the previous year) / (Company s trailing average share price over the prior quarter). For example : If assets in quarter one
2024 were 1,000,000 and assets in quarter one 2025 were 5,000,000 and the Company s trailing average share price is .07, then:
 4,000,000/ .07 = 57,142,857 Acquisition Shares to be issued. 

Issuances of the Acquisition
Shares to the AIG Shareholders will commence after the initial two (2) quarters of the Company s revenue are disclosed in the Company s
periodic reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission SEC on Form 10-Q and 10-K, as applicable, following
the Closing. The number of Acquisition Shares will be trued up at the end of the Company s respective fiscal year (i.e., four (4)
quarters of the Company s revenue divided by the Company s trailing average share price over the prior year). This calculation
will be made prior to the issuance of shares for the fourth quarter of a given year and the number of true up shares will be added or
deducted from the amount issued. 

25 

The number of Acquisition
Shares to be issued to the AIG Shareholders each quarter will be determined by calculating the three (3) above earnout criteria methods.
The method which yields the largest number of Acquisition Shares will be utilized for the issuance of the Acquisition Shares to the AIG
Shareholders within the applicable quarterly period. The AIG Shareholders must designate any designees or assignees prior to the end of
the quarter and must provide documentation sufficient to determine whether or not the designee s or assignee s shares are
to be aggregated with any other recipient of shares for the purpose of determining the Maximum Issuance (as defined below). 

The Acquisition Shares earnout
period will last for up to five (5) years, provided, that, in order for Acquisition Shares to be issued to the AIG Shareholders in a given
year, the Company s revenue, with a minimum of 5 EBITDA in such year, must increase over the previous year, and the number of Acquisition
Shares to be issued will be based upon such increase. At the end of each fiscal quarter of the Company, the Company will calculate the
Acquisition Shares to be issued to the AIG Shareholders using the three above earnout criteria methods. The method resulting in the largest
number of Acquisition Shares will be selected for each quarter s issuance of the Acquisition Shares to the AIG Shareholders. The
applicable number of Acquisition Shares shall be transferred to the AIG Shareholders accordingly, subject to the Maximum Issuance. 

AIG s valuation was
calculated based upon the AIG s financial projections which reflect: (i) one times (1x) quarterly revenue within the initial three
month period following the Closing, (ii) a minimum of five percent (5 EBITDA within the initial three month period following the Closing,
and (iii) annual revenues for the year ending 2025 in the aggregate amount of 45,000,000, and a minimum of five percent (5 EBITDA for
the year ending 2025. 

The number of Acquisition
Shares that may be acquired by the AIG Shareholders pursuant to the Earnout Schedule will be limited to the extent necessary to ensure
that, following such earnout, the total number of shares of common stock then beneficially owned by such AIG Shareholder and its affiliates
and any other persons whose beneficial ownership of the common stock would be aggregated with the AIG Shareholder s for purposes
of Section 13(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 1934 Act ), does not exceed 9.999 of the total number of issued
and outstanding shares of common stock (including for such purpose the shares of common stock issuable upon such earnout) (a Maximum
Issuance ). For such purposes, beneficial ownership will be determined in accordance with Section 13(d) of the 1934 Act and the
rules and regulations promulgated thereunder. In the case where the number of Acquisition Shares to be issued to an AIG Shareholder would
exceed the Maximum Issuance, then the Company will reserve that number of shares in excess of the Maximum Issuance with its Transfer Agent
(the Reserve Shares and such Reserve Shares will be issued to the AIG Shareholder at such time that the issuance would
not cause such AIG Shareholder to exceed to the 9.999 ownership limit. 

Concurrently with the Closing,
Dante Jones will resign as an executive officer and director of the Company; George Furlan will be appointed as interim chief executive
officer, president and chief financial officer of the Company, and as a non-independent director of the Company; and Eric Bruns and Dionne
Pendelton will be appointed as independent directors of the Company. The parties have agreed to indemnify each other for any losses that
may be incurred by them as a result of their breach of any of their representations, warranties and covenants contained in the Exchange
Agreement. The Exchange Agreement contains customary representations, warranties, covenants and conditions for a transaction of this type
for the benefit of the parties. Prior to the Closing, certain parties to the Share Exchange (collectively, the Lockup Parties will be subject to the terms of a lock-up leak-out agreement, which will provide the manner in which such Lockup Parties may sell, transfer
or dispose of their shares of common stock during the 12-month period following the Closing. 

The foregoing information
is a summary of each of the agreements involved in the transactions described above, is not complete, and is qualified in its entirety
by reference to the full text of those agreements, each of which is attached an exhibit to this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Readers
should review those agreements for a complete understanding of the terms and conditions associated with this transaction. 

In
the event the Closing is consummated on or before the New Outside Closing Date , the shares
of common stock to be issued as part of the Share Exchange will be issued pursuant to exemptions from registration provided by Section
4(a)(2) and/or Regulation D of the 1933 Securities Act, as amended. 

The representations, warranties
and covenants contained in the Exchange Agreement were made only for purposes of such agreement and as of specific dates, were solely
for the benefit of the parties to the Exchange Agreement, and may be subject to limitations agreed upon by the contracting parties. Accordingly,
the Exchange Agreement is incorporated herein by reference only to provide investors with information regarding the terms of the Exchange
Agreement, and not to provide investors with any other factual information regarding the Company, AIG or either of their businesses, and
should be read in conjunction with the disclosures in the Company s periodic reports and other filings with the Securities and Exchange
