 reportable segments consisting of: 1) Medicaid; 2) Medicare; 3) Marketplace; and 4) Other. Our reportable segments are consistent with how we currently manage the business and view the markets we serve. 
 As of September 30, 2024, we served approximately million members eligible for government-sponsored healthcare programs, located across states. 
 Our state Medicaid contracts typically have terms of three to , contain renewal options exercisable by the state Medicaid agency, and allow either the state or the health plan to terminate the contract with or without cause. Such contracts are subject to risk of loss in states that issue requests for proposal RFP open to competitive bidding by other health plans. If one of our health plans is not a successful responsive bidder to a state RFP, its contract may not be renewed. 
 In addition to contract renewal, our state Medicaid contracts may be periodically amended to include or exclude certain health benefits (such as pharmacy services, behavioral health services, or long-term care services); populations such as the aged, blind or disabled ABD and regions or service areas. 
 In Medicare, we enter into Medicare Advantage-Part D contracts with the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services CMS annually, and for dual-eligible programs, we enter into contracts with CMS, in partnership with each state s department of health and human services. Such contracts typically have terms of one to . 
 In Marketplace, we enter into contracts with CMS, which end on December 31 of each year, and must be renewed annually. 
 Recent Developments 
 Michigan Procurement Medicare. In October 2024, we were awarded a contract to provide benefits to the state s Highly Integrated Dual Eligible HIDE Special Needs population in service regions. This award facilitates the transition of our existing Medicaid-Medicare Plan MMP members to a HIDE product and ensures a new dual-eligibles growth opportunity by expanding our footprint from regions to , including Detroit. The new contract, which is expected to commence on January 1, 2026 in select regions, will be implemented statewide in 2027 and is expected to continue for . 
 Massachusetts Procurement Medicare. In September 2024, we were selected to proceed to contract negotiations to operate both One Care and Senior Care Options plans for 2026. This selection is expected to allow us to operate the One Care 21-64 program, and to retain our position in the Senior Care Options program. The programs provide physical, behavioral, long-term services and supports, and other community services to dual-eligibles. The new contract is expected to commence on January 1, 2026. 
 Connecticut Acquisition Marketplace and Medicare. On July 23, 2024, we announced a definitive agreement to acquire ConnectiCare Holding Company, Inc. ConnectiCare ), a wholly owned subsidiary of EmblemHealth, Inc. ConnectiCare is a leading health plan in the state of Connecticut serving members across Marketplace, Medicare, and certain commercial products. The purchase price for the transaction is approximately million, which we intend to fund with cash on hand. The transaction is subject to applicable federal and state regulatory approvals and the satisfaction of other customary closing conditions. We currently expect the transaction to close in the first quarter of 2025. 
 Florida Procurement Medicaid. In July 2024, we were notified that the Florida Agency for Healthcare Administration awarded a Medicaid managed care contract to Molina Healthcare of Florida. The contract term is expected to commence on February 1, 2025, and to run through December 31, 2030. We expect to serve approximately Medicaid beneficiaries in Miami-Dade and Monroe Counties. 
 New Mexico Procurement Medicaid. Our new contract with the New Mexico Health Care Authority commenced on July 1, 2024 and will run through December 31, 2026. The new contract added approximately members.

 , with an option for extensions. Additionally, we were re-awarded our sole contract position in the self-directed long-term services and supports personal care program. 
 Michigan Procurement Medicaid. In April 2024, we announced that the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services intends to award a Comprehensive Health Care Program contract to Molina Healthcare of Michigan. We were awarded the contract in service regions. The new Medicaid contract commenced on October 1, 2024. The new contract is expected to have a duration of , with an option for extensions. 
 Mississippi Procurement Medicaid. In the second quarter of 2024, the Mississippi Division of Medicaid extended the existing contracts for the state fiscal year that began on July 1, 2024. We now expect the new contract, which will cover both TANF ABD and CHIP, to commence on July 1, 2025. 
 Texas Procurement Medicaid. In the first quarter of 2024, we were notified of the Texas Health and Human Services Commission s intent to award us a contract for Temporary Assistance for Needy Families TANF and Children s Health Insurance Program CHIP (known in Texas as the STAR CHIP programs, and both existing contracts for Molina), expanding our footprint and expecting to grow our market share. The expected start of operations and other final contract terms are still pending. The new STAR+PLUS contract began on September 1, 2024 and grew our market share. 
 Virginia Procurement Medicaid. In the first quarter of 2024, the Virginia Department of Medical Assistance Services DMAS issued a notice of intent to award which did not include Molina Healthcare of Virginia as an awardee for its Cardinal Care Managed Care CCMC procurement. We exercised our right to protest that decision. On April 19, 2024, DMAS upheld its notice of intent to award in response to our protest. On April 26, 2024, Molina filed a legal action in Virginia Circuit Court over DMAS s decision not to award Molina a CCMC contract. In addition, DMAS separately notified us that they were exercising the contractual extension option for the period from July 1, 2024 through June 30, 2025. The noticed CCMC awards are subject to a statutory stay pending the resolution of Molina s legal action. 
 California Acquisition Medicare. Effective January 1, 2024, we closed on our acquisition of of the issued and outstanding capital stock of Brand New Day and Central Health Plan of California Bright Health Medicare ), which added approximately members. 
 California Procurement Medicaid. Our new contract with the California Department of Health Care Services commenced on January 1, 2024, which enables us to continue servicing Medi-Cal members in most of our existing counties and expand our footprint in Los Angeles County. 
 Nebraska Procurement Medicaid. Our new contract with the Nebraska Department of Health and Human Services commenced on January 1, 2024, which added approximately members.

 Minimum MLR, Medical Cost Corridors and Profit Sharing. A portion of our Medicaid premium revenue may be returned if certain minimum amounts are not spent on defined medical care costs as a percentage of premium revenue, or minimum medical loss ratio Minimum MLR ). Under certain medical cost corridor provisions, the health plans may receive additional premiums if amounts spent on medical care costs exceed a defined maximum threshold. This includes remaining risk corridors that were enacted by various states in 2020 in response to the reduced demand for medical services stemming from COVID-19. Our contracts with certain states contain profit sharing provisions under which we refund amounts to the states if our health plans generate profit above a certain specified percentage. In some cases, we are limited in the amount of administrative costs that we may deduct in calculating the refund, if any. We recorded aggregate liabilities under the terms of such contract provisions of million and million at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively, to Amounts due government agencies in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.

 for Medicare. Federal regulations define what constitutes medical costs and premium revenue. If the Minimum MLR is not met, we may be required to pay rebates to the federal government. Our dual-eligible plans may also be subject to state-specific Minimum MLRs, medical cost corridors, and profit-sharing provisions. We recognize estimated rebates as an adjustment to premium revenue in our consolidated statements of income. We recorded a liability under the terms of such contract provisions of million and million at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively, to Amounts due government agencies in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. 
 The ACA established a Minimum MLR of for the Marketplace. If the Minimum MLR is not met, we may be required to pay rebates to our Marketplace policyholders. The Marketplace risk adjustment program discussed below is taken into consideration when computing the Minimum MLR. We recognize estimated rebates under the Minimum MLR as an adjustment to premium revenue in our consolidated statements of income. The amounts were insignificant at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. 
 Risk Adjustment. Our Medicare premiums are subject to retroactive increase or decrease based on the health status of our Medicare members (as measured by member risk score). We estimate our members risk scores and the related amount of Medicare revenue that will ultimately be realized for the periods presented based on our knowledge of our members health status, risk scores and CMS practices. We also estimate amounts owed to CMS for Part D settlements. We recorded a liability under the terms of such contract provisions of million and million at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively, to Amounts due government agencies in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. 
 As of September 30, 2024, Marketplace risk adjustment payables amounted to million and related receivables amounted to million, for a net receivable of million. As of December 31, 2023, Marketplace risk adjustment payables amounted to million and related receivables amounted to million, for a net receivable of million. Marketplace risk adjustment receivables at December 31, 2023 are net of a million credit loss allowance resulting from a credit loss recognized in the third quarter of 2023 on 2022 Marketplace risk adjustment receivables due to the insolvency of an issuer in the Texas risk pool. 
 
 years, or less than years average life for structured securities. Restricted investments are invested principally in cash, cash equivalents, U.S. Treasury securities, and corporate debt securities. Concentration of credit risk with respect to accounts receivable is limited because our payors consist principally of the federal government, and governments of each state in which our health plan subsidiaries operate.

 million in cash, consistent with our strategy to grow in our existing markets. For this transaction, we applied the acquisition method of accounting, where the total purchase price was preliminarily allocated to the tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed, based on their fair values as of the acquisition date. We expect to complete the final determination of the purchase price allocation as soon as practicable, but no later than one year following the acquisition s closing date in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification ASC Topic 805, Business Combinations . Measurement period adjustments will be recorded in the period in which they are determined, as if they had been completed at the acquisition date. The pro forma effects of this acquisition for prior periods were not material to our consolidated results of operations. Acquisition costs amounted to million in the aggregate for the

 Contingent consideration Total 
 
 The contingent consideration arrangement allows the seller to earn up to million for the satisfaction of certain conditions within the stock purchase agreement by the fourth quarter of 2024. The fair value of the contingent consideration arrangement at the acquisition date was million. This fair value measurement is based on inputs not observable in the market and thus represents a Level 3 measurement. We estimated the fair value using a probability-weighted scenario approach focused on existing and expected membership. On the acquisition date, we placed the million into a third-party escrow and recorded a receivable of million in relation to the fair value measurement. As of September 30, 2024, the fair value of the contingent consideration arrangement increased to million due to the conditions being met. The net change in fair value is reported in Other operating expenses in our consolidated statements of income. 
 The valuation of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed has not yet been finalized. Further, the finalization of purchase price adjustments as provided in the stock purchase agreement is expected to occur in the fourth quarter of 2024. As a result, provisional estimates have been recorded and are subject to change, primarily for accounts that include the use of estimates, such as medical claims and benefits payable, receivables, amounts due government agencies, certain acquired intangible assets, and certain tax assets and liabilities. 
 Goodwill is calculated as the excess of the consideration transferred over the net assets recognized and represents the estimated future economic benefits arising from other assets acquired that could not be individually identified and separately recognized. Such assets include synergies we expect to achieve as a result of the transaction, such as the use of our existing infrastructure to support the added membership, and future economic benefits arising from the assembled workforce. All of the goodwill was assigned to the Medicare segment and is deductible for income tax purposes.

 million. In August 2024, we paid purchase consideration of million as a result of final purchase price adjustments as provided in the asset purchase agreement. In the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we recorded various measurement period adjustments that were insignificant. These measurement period adjustments and purchase price adjustments have been finalized as of September 30, 2024.

 Due after one year through five years Due after five years through ten years Due after ten years Total 
 In the nine months ended September 30, 2024, and 2023, maturities and redemptions of available-for-sale securities amounted to million and million, respectively, and sales amounted to million and million, respectively. Gross realized gains and losses from sales of available-for-sale securities are calculated under the specific identification method and are included in investment income. Gross realized investment gains amounted to million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and were insignificant for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Gross realized investment losses amounted to million and million in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and were reclassified into earnings from other comprehensive income on a net-of-tax basis. 
 We have determined that unrealized losses at September 30, 2024, and December 31, 2023, primarily resulted from fluctuating interest rates, rather than a deterioration of the creditworthiness of the issuers. Therefore, we determined that an allowance for credit losses was not necessary. So long as we maintain the intent and ability to hold these securities to maturity, we are unlikely to experience realized losses. In the event that we dispose of these securities before maturity, we expect that realized losses, if any, will be insignificant.

 Our estimates of medical claims and benefits payable recorded at December 31, 2023, and 2022 developed favorably by approximately million and million as of September 30, 2024, and 2023, respectively. 
 The favorable prior year development recognized in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily attributable to reserving under moderately adverse conditions, lower than expected utilization of medical services by our members and improved operating performance, mainly in the Medicaid segment. Consequently, the ultimate costs recognized in 2024, as claims payments were processed, were lower than our estimates in 2023.

 million, in the aggregate, of our common stock. Under this program, pursuant to a Rule 10b5-1 trading plan, we purchased approximately shares for million in the third quarter of 2024 (average cost of per share). We have accrued a stock repurchase excise tax of million related to the share repurchase program as of September 30, 2024 located in Accounts payable, accrued liabilities and other and Additional paid-in capital in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. 
 In October 2024, our board of directors authorized the purchase of up to billion of our common stock. This new program extends through December 31, 2025 and supersedes the stock purchase program previously approved by our board of directors in September 2023. The exact timing and amount of any repurchase is determined by management based on market conditions and share price, in addition to other factors, and repurchases generally will be made in accordance with the volume, price, and timing parameters under Rule 10b-18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. No shares have been repurchased under this program.

 reportable segments consisting of: 1) Medicaid; 2) Medicare; 3) Marketplace; and 4) Other. Our reportable segments are consistent with how we currently manage the business and view the markets we serve. 
 The Medicaid, Medicare, and Marketplace segments represent the government-funded or sponsored programs under which we offer managed healthcare services. The Other segment, which is insignificant to our consolidated results of operations, includes long-term services and supports consultative services in Wisconsin. 
 The key metrics used to assess the performance of our Medicaid, Medicare, and Marketplace segments are premium revenue, medical margin and medical care ratio MCR ). MCR represents the amount of medical care costs as a percentage of premium revenue. Therefore, the underlying medical margin, or the amount earned by the Medicaid, Medicare, and Marketplace segments after medical costs are deducted from premium revenue, represents the most important measure of earnings reviewed by management, and is used by our chief executive officer to review results, assess performance, and allocate resources. The key metric used to assess the performance of our Other segment is service margin. The service margin is equal to service revenue minus cost of service revenue. We do not report total assets by segment since this is not a metric used to assess segment performance or allocate resources.

 OVERVIEW 
 Molina Healthcare, Inc., a FORTUNE 500 company, provides managed healthcare services under the Medicaid and Medicare programs, and through the state insurance marketplaces (the Marketplace ). We served approximately 5.6 million members as of September 30, 2024, located across 21 states. 
 THIRD QUARTER 2024 HIGHLIGHTS 
 We reported net income of 326 million, or 5.65 per diluted share, for the third quarter of 2024, which reflected the following: 
 Membership of 5.6 million at September 30, 2024 increased 392,000, or 8 , compared with September 30, 2023, across all segments, primarily due to the new Medicaid contract wins, acquisitions, and growth in our current footprint, partially offset by the impact of Medicaid redeterminations; 
 Premium revenue of 9.7 billion, which increased 18 compared with the third quarter of 2023 due to the increased membership in all segments mentioned above; 
 Consolidated medical care ratio MCR of 89.2 compared with 88.7 for the third quarter of 2023, and was higher than expected as we experienced medical cost pressure in our Medicaid and Medicare segments; 
 Investment income of 118 million, which increased 5 compared with the third quarter of 2023, and continues to bolster our operating income results; 
 General and administrative expense G A ratio of 6.5 , compared with 7.1 for the third quarter of 2023, reflecting operating discipline and the continued benefit of fixed cost leverage as we grow our business; and

CONSOLIDATED RESULTS 
 NET INCOME AND OPERATING INCOME 
 Net income in the third quarter of 2024 amounted to 326 million, or 5.65 per diluted share, compared with 245 million, or 4.21 per diluted share, in the third quarter of 2023. Net income in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 amounted to 928 million, or 15.97 per diluted share, compared with 875 million, or 15.08 per diluted share, in the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in net income for both periods is driven by the impact of increased premiums and medical margin stemming from our membership growth, improved G A expense ratio, and increased investment income, partially offset by an increase in the consolidated MCR. In addition, the 
 Molina Healthcare, Inc. September 30, 2024 Form 10-Q | 25 

Table of Contents 

 three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 results reflect a 41 million credit loss on 2022 Marketplace risk adjustment receivables. 
 PREMIUM REVENUE 
 Premium revenue increased 1.5 billion, or 18 , in the third quarter of 2024, when compared with the third quarter of 2023, and increased 4.5 billion, or 19 , in the nine months ended September 30, 2024, when compared with the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The higher premium revenue reflects the impact of a balanced combination of the new Medicaid contract wins, acquisitions, and growth in our current footprint, partially offset by the impact of Medicaid redeterminations. See further discussion in Reportable Segments Segment Financial Performance, below. 
 MEDICAL CARE RATIO 
 The consolidated MCR in the third quarter of 2024 increased to 89.2 , compared with 88.7 in the third quarter of 2023, or 50 basis points, and was higher than expected as we experienced medical cost pressure in our Medicaid and Medicare segments. The consolidated MCR in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 increased to 88.8 , compared with 87.8 MCR for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, or 100 basis points, and was slightly above our long-term range. The year-over-year increase in both periods is driven mainly by our Medicaid segment, reflecting the higher than expected medical cost pressure in our legacy portfolio, and higher initial MCRs related to new contracts, expansion and the MyChoice acquisition, partially offset by minimum MLRs and medical cost corridors, continued disciplined medical cost management and year-over-year improvement in our Medicaid and Marketplace segments. See further discussion in Reportable Segments Segment Financial Performance, below. 
 The prior year reserve development in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was favorable, but its impact on earnings has been mostly absorbed by minimum MLRs and medical cost corridors. 
 PREMIUM TAX REVENUE AND EXPENSES 
 The premium tax ratio (premium tax expense as a percentage of premium revenue plus premium tax revenue) was 5.0 and 2.1 for the third quarter of 2024 and 2023, respectively, and 3.7 and 2.1 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The current year ratio increases were mainly due to the reinstatement of the California managed care organization tax by the state s Department of Health Care Services in the fourth quarter of 2023 and changes in business mix. 
 INVESTMENT INCOME 
 Investment income increased to 118 million in the third quarter of 2024, compared with 112 million in the third quarter of 2023, and increased to 341 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared with 280 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in both periods was primarily driven by higher average yields on the investment portfolio. 
 OTHER REVENUE 
 Other revenue was consistent at 20 million in the third quarter of 2024 and 2023, and totaled 63 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared with 60 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Other revenue mainly includes service revenue associated with long-term services and supports consultative services we provide in Wisconsin. 
 G A EXPENSES 
 The G A expense ratio was 6.5 in the third quarter of 2024, compared with 7.1 in the third quarter of 2023. The G A expense ratio was 6.9 in the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared with 7.3 in the nine months ended September 30, 2023. G A expenses in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 reflect operating discipline, including labor cost management, one-time credits related to certain vendor contracts, and the continued benefit of fixed cost leverage as we grow our business, partially offset by new business implementation costs associated with the Nebraska and California Medicaid contracts wins that started in January 2024 and the New Mexico Medicaid contract that started on July 1, 2024. 
 DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION 
 Depreciation and amortization was 47 million in the third quarter of 2024, compared with 42 million in the third quarter of 2023, and was 138 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared with 128 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in both periods is due to the closing of the My Choice Wisconsin and Bright Health Medicare acquisitions. 
 Molina Healthcare, Inc. September 30, 2024 Form 10-Q | 26 

Table of Contents 

 OTHER OPERATING EXPENSES 
 Other operating expenses decreased by 58 million in the third quarter of 2024, compared with the third quarter of 2023, and decreased by 10 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared with the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease in both periods is primarily due to the 41 million credit loss on 2022 Marketplace risk adjustment receivables recorded in the third quarter of 2023. This was partially offset by increases in non-recurring costs associated with acquisitions, and costs for litigation dating back to 2013. Other operating expenses also include service costs associated with long-term services and supports consultative services we provide in Wisconsin, as noted above. 
 INTEREST EXPENSE 
 Interest expense was 29 million and 27 million in the third quarter of 2024 and 2023, respectively, and 84 million and 82 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The increase is due to borrowings under the Credit Facility occurring in the third quarter of 2024. 
 INCOME TAXES 
 Income tax expense amounted to 112 million in the third quarter of 2024, or 25.7 of pretax income, compared with income tax expense of 87 million, or 26.3 of pretax income, in the third quarter of 2023. Income tax expense amounted to 315 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2024, or 25.3 of pretax income, compared with income tax expense of 300 million, or 25.5 of pretax income, in the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The difference in the effective tax rate is due to a decrease in nondeductible expenses, net of an increase in state income taxes, and differences in discrete tax benefits recognized in the respective periods. 

TRENDS AND UNCERTAINTIES 
 REGULATORY DEVELOPMENTS AND RELATED TRENDS 
 Federal Economic Stabilization and Other Programs 
 The Public Health Emergency PHE officially ended on May 11, 2023. There are several healthcare programs tied to the PHE which are impacted by this change in policy. These include coverage of COVID-19 testing and vaccines, changes to the Medicare fee schedule for COVID-related treatments, and free coverage of at-home COVID-19 diagnostic tests. Per federal statutory and regulatory requirements, some of these programs concluded with the end of the PHE, while some will continue through 2024, and some will remain in place permanently. 
 Operations 
 Enrollment and Premium Revenue 
 Excluding acquisitions and our exit from Puerto Rico, we estimate we added approximately one million new Medicaid members since March 31, 2020, when we first began to report on the impacts of the pandemic. We believe this membership increase was mainly due to the suspension of redeterminations for Medicaid eligibility. The Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2023 authorized states to resume redeterminations and terminate coverage for ineligible enrollees starting on April 1, 2023, irrespective of the status of the PHE. Consequently, during the third quarter of 2023, all states in which we operate had begun disenrolling members. In the third quarter of 2024, we estimate we lost approximately 50,000 members due to the net effect of redeterminations. This was on track with our expectations and brings the total count of members lost through redeterminations to 700,000, and we expect reconnects will continue, resulting in net membership additions of 50,000 in the fourth quarter of 2024. Although the medical cost profile of members who have been disenrolled is more favorable than the Medicaid segment average, when combined with the beneficial impact of corridor offsets and rates in several states, our Medicaid MCR for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was in line with our expectations. Based on the experience to date, we expect that we will ultimately retain approximately 35 of the membership gained since March 31, 2020. 
 OTHER RECENT DEVELOPMENTS 
 RFPs and Acquisitions 
 Michigan Procurement Medicare. In October 2024, we were awarded a contract to provide benefits to the state s Highly Integrated Dual Eligible HIDE Special Needs population in six service regions.

Table of Contents 

 which is expected to commence on January 1, 2026 in select regions, will be implemented statewide in 2027 and is expected to continue for seven years. 
 Massachusetts Procurement Medicare. In September 2024, we were selected to proceed to contract negotiations to operate both One Care and Senior Care Options plans for 2026. This selection is expected to allow us to operate the One Care 21-64 program, and to retain our position in the Senior Care Options program. The programs provide physical, behavioral, long-term services and supports, and other community services to dual-eligibles. The new contract is expected to commence on January 1, 2026. 
 Connecticut Acquisition Marketplace and Medicare. On July 23, 2024, we announced a definitive agreement to acquire ConnectiCare Holding Company, Inc. ConnectiCare ), a wholly owned subsidiary of EmblemHealth, Inc. ConnectiCare is a leading health plan in the state of Connecticut serving members across Marketplace, Medicare, and certain commercial products. The purchase price for the transaction is approximately 350 million, which we intend to fund with cash on hand. The transaction is subject to applicable federal and state regulatory approvals and the satisfaction of other customary closing conditions. We currently expect the transaction to close in the first quarter of 2025. 
 Florida Procurement Medicaid. In July 2024, we were notified that the Florida Agency for Healthcare Administration awarded a Medicaid managed care contract to Molina Healthcare of Florida. The contract term is expected to commence on February 1, 2025, and to run through December 31, 2030. We expect to serve approximately 90,000 Medicaid beneficiaries in Miami-Dade and Monroe Counties. 
 New Mexico Procurement Medicaid. Our new contract with the New Mexico Health Care Authority commenced on July 1, 2024 and will run through December 31, 2026. The new contract added approximately 33,000 members.

In May 2024, we were notified that the Wisconsin Department of Health Services intends to make an award for the purchase of services under the Family Care and Family Care Partnership program in its Geographic Service Region 5 to Molina Healthcare of Wisconsin. The go-live date is expected to be January 1, 2025, and the contract is expected to have a duration of two years, with an option for three two-year extensions. Additionally, we were re-awarded our sole contract position in the self-directed long-term services and supports personal care program. 
 Michigan Procurement Medicaid. In April 2024, we announced that the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services intends to award a Comprehensive Health Care Program contract to Molina Healthcare of Michigan. We were awarded the contract in six service regions. The new Medicaid contract commenced on October 1, 2024. The new contract is expected to have a duration of five years, with an option for three one-year extensions. 
 Mississippi Procurement Medicaid. In the second quarter of 2024, the Mississippi Division of Medicaid extended the existing contracts for the state fiscal year that began on July 1, 2024. We now expect the new four-year contract, which will cover both TANF ABD and CHIP, to commence on July 1, 2025. 
 Texas Procurement Medicaid. In the first quarter of 2024, we were notified of the Texas Health and Human Services Commission s intent to award us a contract for Temporary Assistance for Needy Families TANF and Children s Health Insurance Program CHIP (known in Texas as the STAR CHIP programs, and both existing contracts for Molina), expanding our footprint and expecting to grow our market share. The expected start of operations and other final contract terms are still pending. The new STAR+PLUS contract began on September 1, 2024 and grew our market share. 
 Virginia Procurement Medicaid. In the first quarter of 2024, the Virginia Department of Medical Assistance Services DMAS issued a notice of intent to award which did not include Molina Healthcare of Virginia as an awardee for its Cardinal Care Managed Care CCMC procurement. We exercised our right to protest that decision. On April 19, 2024, DMAS upheld its notice of intent to award in response to our protest. On April 26, 2024, Molina filed a legal action in Virginia Circuit Court over DMAS s decision not to award Molina a CCMC contract. In addition, DMAS separately notified us that they were exercising the contractual extension option for the period from July 1, 2024 through June 30, 2025. The noticed CCMC awards are subject to a statutory stay pending the resolution of Molina s legal action. 
 California Acquisition Medicare. Effective January 1, 2024, we closed on our acquisition of 100 of the issued and outstanding capital stock of Brand New Day and Central Health Plan of California Bright Health Medicare ), which added approximately 109,000 members.

 Nebraska Procurement Medicaid. Our new contract with the Nebraska Department of Health and Human Services commenced on January 1, 2024, which added approximately 114,000 members. 
 Change Healthcare Cybersecurity Incident 
 On February 21, 2024, Change Healthcare CHC ), a major claims processing vendor to Molina, experienced a significant cybersecurity incident. Immediately upon becoming aware of the incident, Molina disconnected and isolated its systems from CHC, and confirmed that no Molina owned or operated systems were compromised by any pre-incident interaction or connectivity with CHC. As a result of the disconnection of our systems from CHC, Molina s ability to receive claims submissions and process remits and payments to providers was partially and temporarily impaired. We promptly enacted our incident response and business continuity plans, which included the implementation of alternative, work-around solutions in order to resume electronic claims intake and payment to providers, and, as a result, we experienced minimal impact to our claims payment operations. To date the event has not had a material impact on the Company s financial condition or results of operations. We have implemented enhanced vendor-related security protocols to mitigate potential risks to providers and members related to this incident. 
 UnitedHealth Group Incorporated, the parent company to CHC, has indicated a substantial portion of U.S. residents may have had their PHI/PII affected by the incident. CHC has notified Molina that certain members data has been breached. CHC is in the process of notifying the individuals impacted by this data breach.

REPORTABLE SEGMENTS 
 As of September 30, 2024, we served approximately 5.6 million members eligible for Medicaid, Medicare, and other government-sponsored healthcare programs for low-income families and individuals, including Marketplace members, most of whom receive government premium subsidies. 
 We currently have four reportable segments consisting of: 1) Medicaid; 2) Medicare; 3) Marketplace; and 4) Other. 
 The Medicaid, Medicare, and Marketplace segments represent the government-funded or sponsored programs under which we offer managed healthcare services. The Other segment, which is insignificant to our consolidated results of operations, includes long-term services and supports consultative services in Wisconsin. 
 HOW WE ASSESS PERFORMANCE 
 We derive our revenues primarily from health insurance premiums. Our primary customers are state Medicaid agencies and the federal government. 
 The key metrics used to assess the performance of our Medicaid, Medicare, and Marketplace segments are premium revenue, medical margin and medical care ratio MCR ). MCR represents the amount of medical care costs as a percentage of premium revenue. Therefore, the underlying medical margin, or the amount earned by the Medicaid, Medicare, and Marketplace segments after medical costs are deducted from premium revenue, represents the most important measure of earnings reviewed by management, and is used by our chief executive officer to review results, assess performance, and allocate resources. The key metric used to assess the performance of our Other segment is service margin. The service margin is equal to service revenue minus cost of service revenue. 
 Management s discussion and analysis of the change in medical margin is discussed below under Segment Financial Performance. For more information, see Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, Note 10, Segments.

 Medicaid 
 Medicaid premium revenue increased 957 million, or 14 , in the third quarter of 2024, when compared with the third quarter of 2023. Medicaid premium revenue increased 3.0 billion, or 15 , in the nine months ended September 30, 2024, when compared with the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The higher premium revenue reflects new contract wins in Iowa (commenced in July 2023), Nebraska (commenced in January 2024), and New Mexico (commenced in July 2024), expansions in California and Texas that commenced in January 2024, and September 2024, respectively, and the My Choice acquisition that closed in September 2023. These increases were partially offset by the impact of Medicaid redeterminations. 
 The medical margin in our Medicaid program decreased 22 million, or 3 , in the third quarter of 2024 when compared with the third quarter of 2023, and decreased 54 million, or 2 , in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 when compared with the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease in both periods was driven by an increase in the MCR, as discussed below, partially offset by the impact of increased premium revenues and margin associated with the membership growth discussed above. 
 The Medicaid MCR increased 170 basis points to 90.5 in the third quarter of 2024, from 88.8 in the third quarter of 2023, and increased 180 basis points to 90.3 in the nine months ended September 30, 2024, from 88.5 in the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase for both periods was mainly attributable to higher than expected medical costs in our legacy portfolio from the continued impact of redetermination-related acuity shifts and higher utilization among our continuing population, particularly for LTSS, pharmacy, and behavioral health services. The increase is also driven by the higher initial MCR associated with the start of new contracts, the My Choice acquisition, and a short-term disparity in timing between premium rates and medical trend. Additionally, the MCR in the third quarter included a 50 basis point impact from a premium rate reduction retroactive to January 1, 2024 in our California business. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the MCR was impacted by 40 basis points 
 Molina Healthcare, Inc. September 30, 2024 Form 10-Q | 30 

Table of Contents 

 from retroactive premium rate reductions in our California business, including the intra-year adjustment mentioned above and the prior year adjustment recognized in the second quarter of 2024. The increases in both periods were partially offset by minimum MLR and medical cost corridors, on-cycle and off-cycle rate adjustments that went into effect in several states during the quarter, and medical cost management. Excluding new contracts and the recent acquisition, our legacy Medicaid MCR in 2024 is above our long-term target range. 
 Medicare 
 Medicare premium revenue increased 335 million, or 32 , in the third quarter of 2024 compared to the third quarter of 2023, and increased 1,128 million, or 36 , in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increases were primarily due to the Bright Health Medicare acquisition that closed on January 1, 2024, the impact of MAPD and D-SNP membership expansion and organic membership growth in existing states, and increased premiums that are more commensurate with the acuity of our population. 
 The medical margin for Medicare increased 64 million in the third quarter of 2024, and increased 205 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2024, when compared to the same periods in 2023. The increase in both periods was mainly due to the year-over-year growth in membership and premium revenues combined with the decrease in MCR discussed below. 
 The Medicare MCR decreased to 89.6 in the third quarter of 2024, or 280 basis points, compared to the third quarter of 2023, and decreased to 87.7 in the nine months ended September 30, 2024, or 210 basis points, compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decreases in each period were primarily driven by higher risk adjustment premiums that are more commensurate with the acuity of our membership, pricing and benefit design changes implemented in 2024 and operational improvements, partially offset by elevated LTSS and pharmacy costs and higher outpatient utilization. The Medicare MCR for the third quarter of 2024 is slightly above our long-term target range due to elevated LTSS and pharmacy costs and higher outpatient utilization. 
 Marketplace 
 Marketplace premium revenue increased 162 million in the third quarter of 2024 compared to the third quarter of 2023, and increased 356 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023, mainly driven by an increase in membership. Our Marketplace membership as of September 30, 2024, amounted to 410,000 members, representing an increase of 134,000 members compared to September 30, 2023, which is in line with our product and pricing strategy to achieve growth, while maintaining target margins in this segment, and membership gained from redeterminations this year. 
 The Marketplace medical margin increased 75 million in the third quarter of 2024 when compared with the third quarter of 2023, and increased 116 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 when compared with the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in each period is primarily due to the growth in premiums and margin associated with the higher membership and the impact of MCR changes discussed below. 
 The Marketplace MCR decreased to 73.0 in the third quarter of 2024, or 590 basis points, compared to 78.9 in the third quarter of 2023, and decreased to 72.6 in the nine months ended September 30, 2024, or 120 basis points, compared to 73.8 in the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The changes in both periods reflect our product and pricing strategy to achieve growth, changes in membership mix, risk adjustment premiums that are more commensurate with the acuity of our membership, and continued operational improvements. Silver metal tier products incur less MCR seasonality than bronze metal tier products due to lower deductibles. The Marketplace MCR for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 is performing better than our expectations. 
 Other 
 The Other segment includes service revenues and costs associated with long-term services and supports consultative services we provide in Wisconsin, and also includes certain corporate amounts not allocated to the Medicaid, Medicare, or Marketplace segments. Such amounts were immaterial to our consolidated results of operations for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. 

LIQUIDITY, FINANCIAL CONDITION AND CAPITAL RESOURCES 
 LIQUIDITY 
 We manage our cash, investments, and capital structure to meet the short- and long-term obligations of our business while maintaining liquidity and financial flexibility. We forecast, analyze, and monitor our cash flows to enable prudent investment management and financing within the confines of our financial strategy. 
 Molina Healthcare, Inc. September 30, 2024 Form 10-Q | 31 

Table of Contents 

 We maintain liquidity at two levels: 1) the regulated health plan subsidiaries; and 2) the parent company. 
 Our regulated health plan subsidiaries primary liquidity requirements include payment of medical claims and other health care services; payment of certain settlements with our state and federal customers, such as minimum medical loss ratio and risk corridors and Marketplace risk transfers on behalf of CMS; general and administrative costs directly incurred or paid through an administrative services agreement to the parent company; and federal tax payments to the parent company under an intercompany tax sharing agreement. Our regulated health plan subsidiaries meet their liquidity needs by generating cash flows from operating activities, primarily from premium revenue; cash flows from investing activities, including investment income and sales of investments; and capital contributions received from our parent company. 
 Our regulated health plan subsidiaries are each subject to applicable state regulations that, among other things, require the maintenance of minimum levels of capital and surplus. We continue to maintain levels of aggregate excess statutory capital and surplus in our regulated health plan subsidiaries that we believe are appropriate. See further discussion under Regulatory Capital and Dividend Restrictions below. When available and as permitted by applicable regulations, cash in excess of the capital needs of our regulated health plan subsidiaries is generally paid in the form of dividends to our parent company to be used for general corporate purposes. In the third quarter and the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the parent company received 385 million and 670 million, respectively, in dividends and return of capital from the regulated health plan subsidiaries. See further discussion of dividends below in Future Sources and Uses of Liquidity Future Sources. 
 Parent company liquidity requirements generally consist of payment of administrative costs not directly incurred by our regulated operations, including, but not limited to, staffing costs, lease payments, branding and certain information technology services; capital contributions paid to our regulated health plan subsidiaries, including funding for newer health plans; capital expenditures; debt service; funding for common stock purchases, acquisitions and other growth-related activities; and federal tax payments. In the third quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2024, the parent company contributed capital in the aggregate amount of 70 million and 345 million, respectively, to our regulated health plan subsidiaries to satisfy statutory capital and surplus requirements and to fund growth in California health plans acquired in the Bright Health Medicare acquisition and our Iowa and Nebraska health plans. Our parent company normally meets its liquidity requirements from administrative services fees earned under administrative services agreements; dividends received from our regulated subsidiaries; federal tax payments collected from the regulated subsidiaries; proceeds received from the issuance of debt and equity securities; and cash flows from investing activities, including investment income and sales of investments. 
 Cash, cash equivalents and investments at the parent company amounted to 195 million and 742 million as of September 30, 2024, and December 31, 2023, respectively. The decrease as of September 30, 2024, was primarily due to funding our Bright Health Medicare acquisition for 441 million, the purchase of approximately 1.5 million shares of our stock for 500 million in the third quarter of 2024 and capital contributions to regulated health plan subsidiaries, partially offset by the timing of corporate payments, and dividends received from regulated health plan subsidiaries and net proceeds of 150 million from borrowings under the Credit Facility. 
 Investments 
 After considering expected cash flows from operating activities, we generally invest cash of regulated subsidiaries that exceeds our expected short-term obligations in longer term, investment-grade, and marketable debt securities to improve our overall investment return. These investments are made pursuant to board-approved investment policies which conform to applicable state laws and regulations. 
 Our investment policies are designed to provide liquidity, preserve capital, and maximize total return on invested assets, all in a manner consistent with state requirements that prescribe the types of instruments in which our subsidiaries may invest. These investment policies require that our investments have final maturities of less than 15 years, or less than 15 years average life for structured securities. Professional portfolio managers operating under documented guidelines manage our investments and a portion of our cash equivalents. Our portfolio managers must obtain our prior approval before selling investments where the loss position of those investments exceeds certain levels. 
 The overall rating of our portfolio is AA-. Our investment policy has directives in conjunction with state guidelines to minimize risks and exposures in volatile markets. Additionally, our portfolio managers assist us in navigating the current volatility in the capital markets.

 Our restricted investments are invested principally in cash, cash equivalents, U.S. Treasury securities, and corporate debt securities; we have the ability to hold such restricted investments until maturity. All of our unrestricted investments are classified as current assets. 
 
 Cash Flow Activities 
 Our cash flows are summarized as follows: 
 Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 Change (In millions) Net cash provided by operating activities 868 2,352 (1,484) Net cash used in investing activities (483) (719) 236 Net cash used in financing activities (414) (61) (353) Net (decrease) increase in cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash and cash equivalents (29) 1,572 (1,601) 
 Operating Activities 
 We typically receive capitation payments monthly, in advance of payments for medical claims; however, government payors may adjust their payment schedules, positively or negatively impacting our reported cash flows from operating activities in any given period. For example, government payors may delay our premium payments, or they may prepay the following month s premium payment. 
 Net cash provided by operations for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 868 million, compared with 2,352 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The lower cash flow in 2024 mainly results from timing differences in government receivables and payables, including Medicare and Medicaid premium prepayments benefiting the 2023 period and increased risk corridor settlement activity in 2024, and the timing benefit of income tax payments in 2023. 
 Investing Activities 
 Net cash used in investing activities was 483 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared with 719 million used in the nine months ended September 30, 2023, an increase in cash flow of 236 million. This change in cash flow was primarily due to a 295 million net cash outflow related to the Bright Health Medicare acquisition in January 2024, and 49 million for final purchase consideration for My Choice Wisconsin, offset by the net activity of proceeds and purchases of investments, which were net purchases of 118 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and net purchases of 625 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 Financing Activities 
 Net cash used in financing activities was 414 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared with 61 million used in the nine months ended September 30, 2023, a decrease in cash flow of 353 million. In the nine months ended September 30, 2024, financing activity included common stock purchases of 500 million and 150 million in net borrowings under the Credit Facility. In addition, in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, financing cash outflows included 57 million and 60 million, respectively, for common stock withheld to settle employee tax obligations. 
 
 FINANCIAL CONDITION 
 We believe that our cash resources, borrowing capacity available under our Amended Credit Agreement as discussed further below in Future Sources and Uses of Liquidity Future Sources, and internally generated funds will be sufficient to support our operations, regulatory requirements, debt repayment obligations and capital expenditures for at least the next 12 months. 
 On a consolidated basis, at September 30, 2024, our working capital was 4.5 billion, compared with 4.4 billion at December 31, 2023. At September 30, 2024, our cash and investments amounted to 9.5 billion, compared with 9.4 billion at December 31, 2023. A significant portion of our portfolio is held in cash and cash equivalents and we do not anticipate the fluctuations in the aggregate fair value of our financial assets to have a material impact on our liquidity or capital position since we intend to hold our securities to maturity. Net unrealized losses on our investments classified as current and available for sale decreased to 12 million at September 30, 2024 compared to 108 million at December 31, 2023. We have determined that the unrealized losses primarily resulted from fluctuating interest rates, rather than a deterioration of the creditworthiness of the issuers.

 Because of the statutory restrictions that inhibit the ability of our health plan subsidiaries to transfer net assets to us, the amount of retained earnings readily available to pay dividends to our stockholders is generally limited to cash, cash equivalents and investments held by our unregulated parent. For more information, see the Liquidity discussion presented above. 
 Regulatory Capital and Dividend Restrictions 
 Each of our regulated, wholly owned subsidiaries must maintain a minimum amount of statutory capital determined by statute or regulations. Such statutes, regulations and capital requirements also restrict the timing, payment and amount of dividends and other distributions, loans or advances that may be paid to us as the sole stockholder. To the extent our subsidiaries must comply with these regulations, they may not have the financial flexibility to transfer funds to us. Based upon current statutes and regulations, the minimum capital and surplus requirement for these subsidiaries was estimated to be approximately 2.5 billion at September 30, 2024 and 2.3 billion at December 31, 2023. The aggregate capital and surplus of our wholly owned subsidiaries was in excess of these minimum capital requirements as of both dates. 
 Under applicable regulatory requirements, the amount of dividends that may be paid by our wholly owned subsidiaries without prior approval by regulatory authorities as of September 30, 2024, was approximately 260 million in the aggregate. The subsidiaries may pay dividends over this amount, but only after approval is granted by the regulatory authorities. 
 Based on our cash and investments balances as of September 30, 2024, management believes that our regulated, wholly owned subsidiaries remain well capitalized and exceed their regulatory minimum requirements. We have the ability, and have committed to provide, additional capital to each of our health plans as necessary to ensure compliance with minimum statutory capital requirements. 
 Debt Ratings 
 Each of our senior notes is rated BB by Standard Poor s, and Ba2 by Moody s Investor Service, Inc. A downgrade in our ratings could adversely affect our borrowing capacity and increase our borrowing costs. 
 Financial Covenants 
 Our Amended Credit Agreement contains customary non-financial and financial covenants, including a net leverage ratio and an interest coverage ratio. Such ratios are computed as defined by the terms of the Amended Credit Agreement. 
 In addition, the indentures governing each of our outstanding senior notes contain cross-default provisions that are triggered upon default by us or any of our subsidiaries on any indebtedness in excess of the amount specified in the applicable indenture. As of September 30, 2024, we were in compliance with all financial and non-financial covenants under the Amended Credit Agreement and other long-term debt. 
 
 FUTURE SOURCES AND USES OF LIQUIDITY 
 Future Sources 
 Our regulated subsidiaries generate significant cash flows from premium revenue, which is generally received a short time before related healthcare services are paid. Premium revenue is our primary source of liquidity. Thus, any decline in the receipt of premium revenue, and our profitability, could have a negative impact on our liquidity. 
 Regulatory Developments . Excluding acquisitions and our exit from Puerto Rico, we estimate we added approximately one million new Medicaid members since March 31, 2020, when we first began to report on the impacts of the pandemic. We believe this membership increase was mainly due to the suspension of redeterminations for Medicaid eligibility. The Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2023 authorized states to resume redeterminations and terminate coverage for ineligible enrollees starting on April 1, 2023, irrespective of the status of the PHE. Consequently, during the third quarter of 2023, all states in which we operate had begun disenrolling members. In the third quarter of 2024, we estimate we lost approximately 50,000 members due to the net effect of redeterminations. This was on track with our expectations and brings the total count of members lost through redeterminations to 700,000, and we expect reconnects will continue, resulting in net membership additions of 50,000 in the fourth quarter of 2024. Although the medical cost profile of members who have been disenrolled is more favorable than the Medicaid segment average, when combined with the beneficial impact of corridor offsets and rates in several states, our Medicaid MCR for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was in line with our expectations. Based on the experience to date, we expect that we will ultimately retain approximately 35 of the membership gained since March 31, 2020.

 Dividends from Subsidiaries. When available and as permitted by applicable regulations, cash in excess of the capital needs of our regulated health plans is generally paid in the form of dividends to our unregulated parent company to be used for general corporate purposes. 
 Credit Agreement Borrowing Capacity. On September 20, 2024, we entered into a Second Amendment to our credit agreement (the Amended Credit Agreement ), which, among other things, increased available commitments under our revolving credit facility Credit Facility to 1.25 billion, and extended the termination date of lending commitments to September 20, 2029. The Amended Credit Agreement also provides for a 15 million swingline sub-facility and a 100 million letter of credit sub-facility, as well as incremental term loans available to finance certain acquisitions up to 800 million, plus an unlimited amount of such term loans as long as we maintain a minimum consolidated net leverage ratio. As of September 30, 2024, we had available borrowing capacity of 1.1 billion under the Amended Credit Agreement. See further discussion in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, Note 8, Debt. 
 Future Uses 
 Common Stock Purchases. In October 2024, our board of directors authorized the purchase of up to 1 billion of our common stock. This new program extends through December 31, 2025 and supersedes the stock purchase program previously approved by our board of directors in September 2023. The exact timing and amount of any repurchase is determined by management based on market conditions and share price, in addition to other factors, and repurchases generally will be made in accordance with the volume, price, and timing parameters under Rule 10b-18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. No shares have been repurchased under this program. 
 Acquisitions. Connecticut Acquisition Marketplace and Medicare. On July 23, 2024, we announced a definitive agreement to acquire ConnectiCare Holding Company, Inc. ConnectiCare ), a wholly owned subsidiary of EmblemHealth, Inc. ConnectiCare is a leading health plan in the state of Connecticut serving members across Marketplace, Medicare, and certain commercial products. The purchase price for the transaction is approximately 350 million, which we intend to fund with cash on hand. The transaction is subject to applicable federal and state regulatory approvals and the satisfaction of other customary closing conditions. We currently expect the transaction to close in the first quarter of 2025. 
 Regulatory Capital Requirements and Dividend Restrictions. We have the ability, and have committed to provide, additional capital to each of our health plans as necessary to ensure compliance with minimum statutory capital requirements. 

CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS 
 A summary of future obligations under our various contractual obligations and commitments as of December 31, 2023 was disclosed in our 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K. 
 There were no significant changes to our contractual obligations and commitments outside the ordinary course of business during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES 
 When we prepare our consolidated financial statements, we use estimates based on assumptions that may affect reported amounts and disclosures; actual results could differ from these estimates. Our critical accounting estimates relate to: 
 Medical costs, claims and benefits payable . Refer to Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, Note 7, Medical Claims and Benefits Payable, for a table that presents the components of the change in medical claims and benefits payable, and for additional information regarding the factors used to determine our changes in estimates for all periods presented in the accompanying consolidated financial statements.

For a discussion of this topic, including amounts recorded in our consolidated financial statements, refer to Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, Note 4, Business Combinations. Other than the discussion as noted above, in the nine months ended September 30, 2024, there were no significant changes to our disclosure reported in Critical Accounting Estimates in our 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K. 

QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 
 Our earnings and financial position are exposed to financial market risk relating to changes in interest rates, and the resulting impact on investment income and interest expense. 
 Substantially all of our investments and restricted investments are subject to interest rate risk and will decrease in value if market interest rates increase. Assuming a hypothetical and immediate 1 increase in market interest rates at September 30, 2024, the fair value of our fixed income investments would decrease by approximately 117 million. Declines in interest rates over time will reduce our investment income. 
 For further information on fair value measurements and our investment portfolio, please refer to Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, Note 5, Fair Value Measurements, and Note 6, Investments. 
 Borrowings under the Amended Credit Agreement bear interest based, at our election, on a base rate or other defined rate, plus in each case, the applicable margin. For further information, see Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, Note 8, Debt. 

CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures. Our management, with the participation of our chief executive officer and our chief financial officer, evaluated, as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act). Based on that evaluation, our chief executive officer and chief financial officer concluded that, as of September 30, 2024, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective at the reasonable assurance level. 
 Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended September 30, 2024, that materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal controls over financial reporting. 

LEGAL PROCEEDINGS
