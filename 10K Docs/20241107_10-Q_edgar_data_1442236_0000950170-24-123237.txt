Three and Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024, compared to Three and Nine Months Ended September 30, 2023 
 Global Economic Trends 
 There has been heightened uncertainty in the macroeconomic environment, and concerns that the U.S. economy may fall into a recession since the Federal Reserve began aggressively raising interest rates in March 2022 to address persistently high inflation. There are also significant geopolitical concerns, including the current conflict between Ukraine and Russia and the Israel-Hamas war, which have created extreme volatility in the global capital markets and are expected to have further global economic consequences, including disruptions of the global supply chain and energy markets. Any such volatility and disruptions may have adverse consequences on us or the third parties on whom we rely. If the equity and credit markets continue to deteriorate, including as a result of political unrest or war, it may make any necessary debt or equity financing more difficult to obtain in a timely manner or on favorable terms, more costly or more dilutive. Inflation can adversely affect us by increasing our costs, including salary costs. Any significant increases in inflation and related increases in interest rates could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. 
 Revenue 
 For the quarter ended September 30, 2024, revenue was 72.8 million, an increase of 2.4 million, or 3.3 , compared to 70.4 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2023. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, revenue was 218.6 million, a decrease of 0.4 million, or 0.2 , compared to 219.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 The increase in revenue for the quarter ended September 30, 2024 was attributable to newly added customers in the quarter ended September 30, 2024 and strong overall demand in existing customer base which, in total, contributed approximately 16 million in additional revenue, an increase of 32 from the same period in 2023. This was partially offset by lower volumes due to lost customers and to soft conditions in certain customer end markets, resulting in a decrease of revenues of approximately 13 million. 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the decrease in revenue was attributable to lower volumes from lost customers, whose margins were lower overall than the rest of the business, resulting in a decrease of revenues of approximately 33 million, which includes lower than expected production volumes at one of our largest customers due to soft conditions in their end market. This was mostly offset by both newly added customers in the current quarter and strong overall demand for the remaining business which, in total, contributed approximately 33 million in additional revenue, an increase of 22 from the same period in 2023. 
 Cost of Revenue/Gross Profit 
 Cost of revenue increased 3.1 million to 61.1 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2024 from 58.0 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2023. We experienced higher cost of revenue as a percentage of revenue in the quarter ended September 30, 2024 due to onboarding and ramping up of new customers. Cost of revenue decreased 1.2 million to 179.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 180.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The changes were primarily due to the same reasons impacting the decrease in revenue. 
 Gross profit for the quarter ended September 30, 2024 was 11.7 million, compared to 12.4 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2023. The gross profit margin was 16.1 for the quarter ended September 30, 2024, compared to 17.7 for the same quarter of 2023. Gross profit margin was negatively impacted in the quarter ended September 30, 2024 by approximately 2 due to a combination of temporarily lower revenues and higher cost of revenue for an isolated group of customers in a specific end market. Additionally, margins were impacted in the quarter by approximately 1 as new customers typically come on board at lower margins and can take multiple quarters to ramp. Gross profit for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 39.3 million, compared to 38.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The gross profit margin was 18.0 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 17.6 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The changes in gross profit and gross profit margin percentage for the quarter and year to date periods were primarily due to the net impacts of the changes in both revenue and cost of revenue combined with broad margin gains across most of our business. 
 Revenue, gross profit, and gross profit margins are affected period to period by the volumes of waste and recyclable materials generated by our customers, the frequency and type of services provided, the price and mix of the services provided, price changes for recyclable materials, the cost and mix of subcontracted services provided in any one reporting period, and the timing of acquisitions and integration. Volumes of waste and recyclable materials generated by our customers is impacted period to period based on several factors including their production or sales levels, demand of their product or services in the market, supply chain reliability, and labor force stability, among other business factors. 
 Operating Expenses 
 Operating expenses were 12.6 million and 12.0 million for the quarters ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Operating expenses were 36.6 million and 35.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. 
 Selling, general, and administrative expenses were 10.3 million and 9.6 million for the quarters ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The increase primarily relates to increases in labor related expenses. Selling, general, and administrative expenses 
 17 

were 29.5 million and 28.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The increase primarily relates to increases in labor related expenses and certain professional fees. 
 Operating expenses for the quarters ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 included depreciation and amortization of 2.4 million and 2.3 million, respectively. Operating expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 included depreciation and amortization of 7.1 million and 7.2 million, respectively. 
 Interest Expense 
 Interest expense was 2.7 million and 2.4 million for the quarters ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Interest expense was 7.8 million and 7.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The increase is primarily due to increased borrowings under our revolving credit facility and our equipment term loan, partially offset by reduced borrowings from voluntary paydowns on the term loan in 2023. We are amortizing debt issuance costs of 3.8 million and OID of 1.8 million to interest expense over the life of the related debt arrangements as discussed in Note 7 to our condensed consolidated financial statements. 
 Income Taxes 
 We recorded an income tax benefit of (0.3) million and a provision for income taxes of 0.1 million for the quarters ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. We recorded a provision for income tax of 0.5 million and 0.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The provision/(benefit) for income tax is primarily attributable to state tax obligations based on current estimated state tax apportionments for states with no net operating loss carryforwards, federal income tax after anticipated utilization of all federal net operating loss carryforwards by year end, and other timing differences. 
 We recorded a full valuation allowance against all our deferred tax assets DTAs as of both September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. We intend on maintaining a full valuation allowance on our DTAs until there is sufficient evidence to support the reversal of all or some portion of these allowances. However, given our current earnings and anticipated future earnings, we believe that there is a reasonable possibility that within the next 12 to 24 months, sufficient positive evidence may become available to allow us to reach a conclusion that a significant portion of the valuation allowance will no longer be needed. Release of the valuation allowance would result in the recognition of certain DTAs and a decrease to income tax expense for the period the release is recorded. However, the exact timing and amount of the valuation allowance release are subject to change based on the level of profitability that we are able to actually achieve. 
 Net Loss 
 Net loss for the quarter ended September 30, 2024 was (3.4) million, compared to net loss of (2.1) million for the quarter ended September 30, 2023. Net loss for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was (5.6) million, compared to net loss of (5.0) million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The explanations above detail the majority of the changes related to the change in net results. 
 Our operating results, including revenue, operating expenses, and operating margins, will vary from period to period depending on commodity prices of recyclable materials, the volumes and mix of services provided, as well as customer mix during the reporting period, and the timing of acquisitions and integration. 
 Loss per Share 
 Net loss per basic and diluted share attributable to common stockholders was (0.16) and (0.10) for the quarters ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Net loss per basic and diluted share attributable to common stockholders was (0.27) and (0.25) for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. 
 The basic and diluted weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding were approximately 20.7 million and 20.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The basic and diluted weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding were approximately 20.5 million and 20.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. 
 Adjusted EBITDA 
 For the three months ended September 30, 2024, Adjusted EBITDA (as defined below), a non-GAAP financial measure, decreased 31.7 to 2.5 million from 3.7 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, Adjusted EBITDA increased 0.5 to 12.8 million from 12.7 million for the same period in 2023. 
 We use the non-GAAP measurement of earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization, stock-related compensation charges, and other adjustments, or Adjusted EBITDA, to evaluate our performance. Adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP measure that is also frequently used by analysts, investors and other interested parties to evaluate the market value of companies considered to be in similar businesses. We suggest that Adjusted EBITDA be viewed in conjunction with our reported financial results or other financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP.

For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 , other adjustments included severance and project costs, as well as certain administrative costs related to borrowings. 
 Adjusted Net Income (Loss) and Adjusted Net Income (Loss) per Diluted Share 
 Adjusted net income (loss), a non-GAAP financial measure, was (1.1) million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared with 0.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. Adjusted net income was 1.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared with 2.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. We present adjusted net income (loss) and adjusted net income (loss) per diluted share, both non-GAAP financial measures, supplementally because they are widely used by investors as a valuation measure in the solid waste industry. Management uses adjusted net income (loss) and adjusted net income (loss) per diluted share as two of the principal measures to evaluate and monitor the ongoing financial performance of our operations. We provide adjusted net income (loss) to exclude the effects of items management believes impact the comparability of operating results between periods. Adjusted net income (loss) has limitations due to the fact that it excludes items that have an impact on our financial condition and results of operations. Adjusted net income (loss) and adjusted net income (loss) per diluted share are not a substitute for, and should be used in conjunction with, GAAP financial measures. Other companies may calculate these non-GAAP financial measures differently. Our adjusted net income (loss) and adjusted net income (loss) per diluted share for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 are calculated as follows:

Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we had 1.1 million and 0.3 million in cash and cash equivalents, respectively. Working capital was 22.0 million and 15.7 million as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. 
 We derive our primary sources of funds for conducting our business activities from operating revenues; borrowings under our credit facilities; and the placement of our equity securities to investors. We require working capital primarily to carry accounts receivable, service debt, purchase capital assets, fund operating expenses, address unanticipated competitive threats or technical problems, withstand adverse economic conditions, fund potential acquisition transactions, and pursue goals and strategies. 
 We believe our existing cash and cash equivalents of 1.1 million, our borrowing availability under our 35.0 million ABL Facility (as defined and discussed in Note 7 to our condensed consolidated financial statements), and cash expected to be generated from operations will be sufficient to fund our operations for the next 12 months and thereafter for the foreseeable future. Our known current- and long-term uses of cash include, among other possible demands, capital expenditures, lease payments and repayments to service debt and other long-term obligations. We have no agreements, commitments, or understandings with respect to any such placements of our securities and any such placements could be dilutive to our stockholders. 
 Cash Flows 
 The following discussion relates to the major components of our cash flows for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. 
 Cash Flows from Operating Activities 
 Net cash used in operating activities was (1.3) million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared with net cash provided by operating activities of 6.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 Net cash used in operating activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 related primarily to the net effect of the following: 
 net loss of (5.6) million; 

non-cash items of 10.8 million, which primarily related to depreciation, amortization of intangible assets and debt issuance costs, provision for doubtful accounts, and stock-based compensation; and 

net cash used in the net change in operating assets and liabilities of (6.5) million, primarily associated with relative changes in accounts receivable, accounts payable, and accrued liabilities, including an earn-out payment of (1.0) million. 

Net cash provided by operating activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 related primarily to the net effect of the following: 
 20 

net loss of (5.0) million; 

non-cash items of 10.5 million, which primarily related to depreciation, amortization of intangible assets and debt issuance costs, provision for doubtful accounts, and stock-based compensation; and 

net cash provided by the net change in operating assets and liabilities of 1.1 million, primarily associated with relative changes in accounts receivable, accounts payable, and accrued liabilities. 

Our business, including revenue, operating expenses, and operating margins, may vary depending on the blend of services we provide to our customers, the terms of customer contracts, recyclable materials contracts, and our business volume levels. Fluctuations in net accounts receivable are generally attributable to a variety of factors including, but not limited to, the timing of cash receipts from customers, and the inception, increase, modification, or termination of customer relationships. Our operating activities may require additional cash in the future from our debt facilities and/or equity financings depending on the level of our operations. 
 Cash Flows from Investing Activities 
 Cash used in investing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was (5.2) million and primarily related to the purchase of compactors and related equipment. Cash used in investing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 was (1.3) million. Other investing activities are primarily from purchases of intangible assets such as software development costs and other property and equipment. 
 Cash Flows from Financing Activities 
 Net cash provided by financing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 7.3 million, primarily from net borrowings of 5.3 million on our ABL Facility and 2.5 million borrowings from our PNC equipment term loan. Net cash used in financing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 was (14.1) million, primarily from net repayments of (6.8) million on our ABL Facility and (7.8) million repayment of long-term debt. See Note 7 to our condensed consolidated financial statements for a discussion of the ABL Facility and other notes payable. 
 Inflation 
 Although the overall economy has experienced some inflationary pressures, we do not believe that inflation had a material impact on us during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. We believe that current inflationary increases in costs, such as fuel, labor, and certain capital items, can be addressed by our flexible pricing structures and cost recovery fees allowing us to recover certain of the cost of inflation from our customer base. Consistent with industry practice, many of our contracts allow us to pass through certain costs to our customers or adjust pricing. Although we believe that we should be able to offset many cost increases that result from inflation in the ordinary course of business, we may be required to absorb at least part of these costs increases due to competitive pressures or delays in timing of rate increases. Although we have not been materially affected by inflation in the past, we can provide no assurance that we will not be affected in the future by higher rates of inflation and increases in interest rates. 
 Critical Accounting Estimates and Policies 
 Our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our condensed consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of our condensed consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates, including those related to areas that require a significant level of judgment or are otherwise subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty. These areas include carrying amounts of accounts receivable, goodwill and other intangible assets, stock-based compensation expense, deferred taxes and the fair value of assets and liabilities acquired in business acquisitions. We base our estimates on historical experience, our observance of trends in particular areas, and information or valuations and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances and which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that may not be readily apparent from other sources. Actual amounts could differ significantly from amounts previously estimated. For a discussion of our critical accounting policies, refer to Part II, Item 7 Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in our 2023 Annual Report. There have been no significant changes in our critical accounting policies during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 
 Recent Accounting Pronouncements 
 See Note 2 to our condensed consolidated financial statements. 
 Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 
 We have no off-balance sheet debt or similar obligations. We have no transactions or obligations with related parties that are not disclosed, consolidated into, or reflected in our reported results of operations or financial position. We do not guarantee any third-party debt.

I tem 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 
 Not applicable. 
 I tem 4. Controls and Procedures 
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 Our management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, has evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act, as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Based on such evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective at a reasonable assurance level as of September 30, 2024. 
 Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
 There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting identified in management s evaluation pursuant to Rules 13a-15(d) or 15d-15(d) of the Exchange Act during the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q that materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 
 Limitations on Effectiveness of Controls and Procedures 
 Our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, does not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures or our internal control over financial reporting will prevent all error and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues, misstatements, errors, and instances of fraud, if any, within our company have been or will be prevented or detected. These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision making can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake. Controls also can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people, or by management override of the controls. We base the design of any system of controls in part on certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions. Projections of any evaluation of controls effectiveness to future periods are subject to risks. Over time, internal controls may become inadequate as a result of changes in conditions, or through the deterioration of the degree of compliance with policies or procedures.

 (i) on the date fixed pursuant to Section 6.4 of these Bylaws as the record date for the determination of stockholders entitled to notice of and to vote at such meeting; or

Persons holding stock of the Corporation in a fiduciary capacity shall be entitled to vote such stock. Persons whose stock is pledged shall be entitled to vote, unless in the transfer by the pledgor on the books of the Corporation the pledgor shall have expressly empowered the pledgee to vote thereon, in which case only the pledgee, or the pledgee s proxy, may represent such stock and vote thereon. Stock having voting power standing of record in the names of two or more persons, whether fiduciaries, members of a partnership, joint tenants, tenants in common, tenants by the entirety or otherwise, or with respect to which two or more persons have the same fiduciary relationship, shall be voted in accordance with the provisions of the Nevada Revised Statutes, as the same exists or may hereafter be amended (the NRS ). 

(C) At any meeting of stockholders at which a quorum is present, all matters, except as otherwise provided in the Articles of Incorporation, in these Bylaws, or by law, shall be decided by the vote of a majority in voting interest of the stockholders present in person or by proxy and entitled to vote thereat and thereon.

The vote at any meeting of stockholders on any question need not be by ballot, unless so directed by the chairman of the meeting. On a vote by ballot, each ballot shall be signed by the stockholder voting, or by such stockholder s proxy, if there be such proxy, and it shall state the number of shares voted. 
 
 SECTION 2.9 Proxies . 
 
 	Every person entitled to vote for directors or on any other matter shall have the right to do so either in person or by one or more agents authorized by a written proxy signed by the person and filed with the Secretary of the Corporation. A proxy shall be deemed signed if the stockholder s name is placed on the proxy (whether by manual signature, typewriting, or otherwise) by the stockholder or the stockholder s attorney in fact. A validly executed proxy which does not state that it is irrevocable shall continue in full force and effect unless revoked by the person executing it, prior to the vote pursuant thereto, by a writing delivered to the Corporation stating that the proxy is revoked or by a subsequent proxy executed by, or attendance at the meeting and voting in person by the person executing the proxy; provided, however, that no such proxy shall be valid after the expiration of six (6) months from the date of such proxy, unless, and only as long as, it is coupled with an interest, or unless the person executing it specifies therein the length of time for which it is to continue in force, which in no case shall exceed seven (7) years from the date of its execution. Subject to the above and the provisions of Section 78.355 of the General Corporation Law of the state of Nevada, any proxy duly executed is not revoked and continues in full force and effect until an instrument revoking it or a duly executed proxy bearing a later date is filed with the Secretary of the Corporation. 
 
 SECTION 2.10 Inspectors of Election . 
 
 	Prior to each meeting of stockholders, the Chairman of such meeting shall appoint an inspector(s) of election to act with respect to any vote. Each inspector of election so appointed shall first subscribe an oath faithfully to execute the duties of an inspector of election at such meeting with strict impartiality and according to the best of such inspector of election s ability. Such inspector(s) of election shall decide upon the qualification of the voters and shall certify and report the number of shares represented at the meeting and entitled to vote on any question, determine the number of votes entitled to be cast by each share, shall conduct the vote and, when the voting is completed, accept the votes and ascertain and report the number of shares voted respectively for and against each question, and determine, and retain for a reasonable period a record of the disposition of, any challenge made to any determination made by such inspector(s) of election. Reports of inspector(s) of election shall be in writing and subscribed and delivered by them to the Secretary of the Corporation. The inspector(s) of election need not be stockholders of the Corporation, and any officer of the Corporation may be an inspector(s) of election on any question other than a vote for or against a proposal in which such officer shall have a material interest. The inspector(s) of election may appoint or retain other persons or entities to assist the inspector(s) of election in the performance of the duties of the inspector(s) of election. 
 
 SECTION 2.11 Advance Notice of Stockholder Proposals and Stockholder Nominations . 
 
 	 Nominations of persons for election to the Board and the proposal of other business to be considered by the stockholders may be made at any meeting of stockholders only (a) pursuant to the Corporation s notice of meeting (or any supplement thereto); (b) by or at the direction of the Board; or (c) by any stockholder of the 

Corporation who was a stockholder of record at the time of giving of the notice provided for in these Bylaws, who is entitled to vote at the meeting and who complies with the notice procedures set forth in this Section 2.11.

m. a representation and undertaking as to whether such stockholder, such beneficial owner or their respective affiliates or others acting in concert with them intends, or is part of a group that intends, to (x) deliver a proxy statement or form of proxy to holders of at least the percentage of the voting power of the Corporation s then-outstanding stock required to approve or adopt the proposal or to elect each such nominee (which representation and undertaking must include a statement as to whether such stockholder, such beneficial owner or their respective affiliates or others acting in concert with them intends to solicit the requisite percentage of the voting

n. a representation that the stockholder giving the notice and the beneficial owners, if any, has or have compiled with all applicable federal, state and other legal requirements in connection with such stockholders and/or each such beneficial owners acquisition of shares of capital stock or other securities of the Corporation and/or such stockholder s and/or each such beneficial owner s acts or omission as a stockholder of the Corporation, including, without limitation, in connection with such nomination or proposal. 

o. any other information relating to such stockholder, such beneficial owner or their respective affiliates or others acting in concert with them, or director nominee or proposed business, that, in each case, would be required to be disclosed in a proxy statement or other filing required to be made in connection with the solicitation of proxies in support of such nominee (in a contested election of directors) or proposal pursuant to Section 14 of the 1934 Act; and 

p. such other information relating to any proposed item of business as the Corporation may reasonably require to determine whether such proposed item of business is a proper matter for stockholder action. 

In addition to the requirements of this Section 2.11, to be timely, a stockholder s notice (and any additional information submitted to the Corporation in connection therewith) must further be updated and supplemented (1) if necessary, so that the information provided or required to be provided in such notice is true and correct as of the record date for determining the stockholders entitled to notice of, and to vote at, the annual meeting and as of the date that is 10 business days prior to the annual meeting or any adjournment, rescheduling, postponement or other delay thereof; and (2) to provide any additional information that the Corporation may reasonably request. Any such update and supplement or additional information must be received by the Secretary at the principal executive offices of the Corporation (A) in the case of a request for additional information, promptly following a request therefor, which response must be received by the Secretary not later than such reasonable time as is specified in any such request from the Corporation; or (B) in the case of any other update or supplement of any information, not later than five (5) business days after the record date for the annual meeting (in the case of any update and supplement required to be made as of the record date), and not later than eight (8) business days prior to the date for the annual meeting or any adjournment, rescheduling, postponement or other delay thereof (in the case of any update or supplement required to be made as of ten (10) business days prior to the annual meeting or any adjournment, rescheduling, postponement or other delay thereof). 
 	 No later than five (5) business days prior to the annual meeting or any adjournment, rescheduling, postponement or other delay thereof, a stockholder nominating individuals for election as a director will provide the Corporation with reasonable evidence that such stockholder has met the requirements of Rule 14a-19. The failure to timely provide such update, supplement, evidence or additional information shall result in the nomination or proposal no longer being eligible for consideration at the annual meeting. If the stockholder fails to comply with the requirements of Rule 14a-19 (including because the stockholder fails to provide the Corporation with all information or notices required by Rule 14a-19), then the director nominees proposed by such stockholder shall be ineligible for election at the annual meeting and any votes or proxies in respect of such nomination shall be disregarded, notwithstanding that such proxies may have been received by the Corporation and counted for the purposes of determining quorum. For the avoidance of doubt, the obligation to update and supplement, or provide additional information or evidence, as set forth in these Bylaws shall not limit the Corporation s rights with respect to any deficiencies in any notice provided by a stockholder, extend any 

applicable deadlines pursuant to these bylaws or enable or be deemed to permit a stockholder who has previously submitted notice pursuant to these bylaws to amend or update any nomination or to submit any new nomination. No disclosure pursuant to these Bylaws will be required with respect to the ordinary course business activities of any broker, dealer, commercial bank, trust company or other nominee who is the stockholder submitting a notice pursuant to this Section 2.11 solely because such broker, dealer, commercial bank, trust company or other nominee has been directed to prepare and submit the notice required by these Bylaws on behalf of a beneficial owner. 
 	(D) Other Requirements and Procedures. 
 
 	1. To be eligible to be a nominee of any stockholder for election as a director of the Corporation, the proposed nominee must provide to the Secretary, in accordance with the applicable time periods prescribed for delivery of notice under this Section: 
 
 a. a signed and completed written questionnaire (in the form provided by the Secretary at the written request of the nominating stockholder, which form will be provided by the Secretary within ten (10) days of receiving such request) containing information regarding such nominee s background and qualifications and such other information as may reasonably be required by the Corporation to determine the eligibility of such nominee to serve as a director of the Corporation or to serve as an independent director of the Corporation; 

b. a written representation and undertaking that, unless previously disclosed to the Corporation, such nominee is not, and will not become, a party to any voting agreement, arrangement, commitment, assurance or understanding with any person or entity as to how such nominee, if elected as a director, will vote on any issue; 

c. a written representation and undertaking that, unless previously disclosed to the Corporation, such nominee is not, and will not become, a party to any Third-Party Arrangement; 

d. a written representation and undertaking that, if elected as a director, such nominee would be in compliance, and will continue to comply, with the Corporation s corporate governance, conflict of interest, confidentiality, stock ownership and trading guidelines, and other policies and guidelines applicable to directors and in effect during such person s term in office as a director (and, if requested by any candidate for nomination, the Secretary will provide to such proposed nominee all such policies and guidelines then in effect); and 

e. a written representation and undertaking that such nominee, if elected, intends to serve a full term on the Board of Directors.

 	3. No person will be eligible to be nominated by a stockholder for election as a director of the Corporation, or to be seated as a director of the Corporation, unless nominated and elected in accordance with the procedures set forth in this Section 2.11. No business proposed by a stockholder will be conducted at any meeting of the stockholders except in accordance with the procedures set forth in this Section 2.11.

The termination of any action, suit, or proceeding by judgment, order, settlement, conviction, or upon a plea of nolo contendere or its equivalent, does not, of itself, create a presumption that the person did not act in good faith and in a manner which he reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the Corporation, and that, with respect to any criminal action or proceeding, he had reasonable cause to believe that his conduct was unlawful. 
 
 SECTION 7.2 Actions by the Corporation .

Indemnification may not be made for any claim, issue, or matter as to which such a person has been adjudged by a court of competent jurisdiction, after exhaustion of all appeals therefrom, to be liable to the Corporation or for amounts paid in settlement to the Corporation, unless and only to the extent that the court in which the action or suit was brought or other court of competent jurisdiction determines upon application that in view of all the circumstances of the case, the person is fairly and reasonably entitled to indemnity for such expenses as the court deems proper. 
 SECTION 7.3 Successful Defense . 
 
 	To the extent that a director, officer, employee, or agent of the Corporation has been successful on the merits or otherwise in defense of any action, suit, or proceeding referred to in Sections 7.1 and 7.2, or in defense of any claim, issue, or matter therein, he must be indemnified by the Corporation against expenses, including attorneys fees, actually and reasonably incurred by him in connection with the defense.

The determination must be made: 
 (a) By the stockholders; 

(b) By the Board majority vote of a quorum consisting of directors who were not parties to the act, suit, or proceeding; 

(c) If a majority vote of a quorum consisting of directors who were not parties to the act, suit, or proceeding so orders, by independent legal counsel in a written opinion; or

The provisions of this section do not affect any rights to advancement of expenses to which corporate personnel other than directors or officers may be entitled under any contract or otherwise by law. 
 
 SECTION 7.6 Other Rights . 
 
 	The indemnification and advancement of expenses authorized in or ordered by a court pursuant to this Article VII:

 	If a claim for indemnification (following the final disposition of the relevant proceeding) or payment of expenses under this Article VII is not paid in full within thirty (30) days after a written claim therefor by the indemnitee has been received by the Corporation, the indemnitee may file suit to recover the unpaid amount of such claim and, if successful in whole or in part, shall be entitled to be paid the expenses of prosecuting such claim. In any such action, the Corporation shall have the burden of proving that the indemnitee was not entitled to the requested indemnification or payment of expenses under applicable law.

 	The Corporation s obligation, if any, to indemnify or advance expenses to any person who was or is serving at its request as a director, officer, employee, or agent of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust, enterprise, or nonprofit entity shall be reduced by any amount such person may collect as indemnification or advancement of expenses from such other corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust, enterprise, or nonprofit enterprise.
