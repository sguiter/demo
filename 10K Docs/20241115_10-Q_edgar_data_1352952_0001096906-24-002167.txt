 The CFN Business generates revenue through sponsored content, including articles, press releases, videos, podcasts, advertisements and other media, email advertisements and other marketing campaigns run on behalf of public and private companies in the cannabis industry, helping them reach accredited, retail and institutional investors. Most revenue is generated through contracts involving a monthly cash payment. 
 
 Ranco performs services including white label manufacturing and co-packing for customers. Customers will drop off their product and the Company will perform the services via their employees and contractors.

 Liquidity, Capital Resources and Going Concern 
 As of September 30, 2024, we had 263,702 in unrestricted cash and 7,632,488 in notes payable. 
 
 The Company had a working capital deficit of 14,862,760 and an accumulated deficit of 75,528,870 as of September 30, 2024. The Company also had a net loss of 926,009 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 
 
 Management s plan to continue as a going concern includes raising capital in the form of debt or equity, growing its existing business acquired under the Ranco Agreement, managing and reducing operating and overhead costs and continuing to pursue strategic transactions and opportunities including launching an e-commerce network focused on the sale of general wellness CBD, products. 
 
 These matters, among others, raise substantial doubt about the ability of the Company to continue as a going concern. These financial statements do not include any adjustments to the amounts and classification of assets and liabilities that may be necessary should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern. 
 
 Management continues to explore raising additional capital through a combination of debt financing, other non-dilutive financing and/or equity financing to supplement the Company s capitalization and liquidity. If we raise additional funds by issuing debt securities or preferred stock, or by incurring loans, these forms of financing would have rights, preferences, and privileges senior to those of holders of our Common Stock. The availability and the terms under which we may be able to raise additional capital could be disadvantageous, and the terms of debt financing or other non-dilutive financing may involve restrictive covenants and dilutive financing instruments, which could place significant restrictions on our operations. If we raise capital through the issuance of additional equity, such sales and issuance would dilute the ownership interests of the existing holders of Common Stock. There can be no assurances that any additional debt, other non-dilutive and/or equity financing would be available to us on favorable terms or at all. We expect to continue to incur net losses, comprehensive losses, and negative cash flows from operating activities as we continue to expand our operations to meet anticipated demand.

 Item 4. Controls and Procedures 
 
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 
 Our management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer, who is our principal executive officer and our principal financial officer, has evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. Based upon that evaluation, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer concluded that as of September 30, 2024, our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective. 
 
 Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
 
 During the quarter ended September 30, 2024, in order to remediate the segregation of duties and other deficiencies initially created by the departure of our accounting department in June 2019, we hired accounting consultants to perform our account reconciliations and other day-to-day accounting requirements. The internal control structure was also documented and assessed in the areas of financial reporting and disclosure controls as it relates to our continuing operations. In addition, we revised and improved the use of our systems for getting appropriate approvals for purchases and other activities that require authorization. However, our ability to file timely reports is heavily dependent on having the necessary financial resources to pay consultants and other outside service providers involved with performing key elements of our disclosure and financial reporting controls. Our current financial condition, has temporarily hindered our ability to file timely reports for this reason. As a result, we have assessed our disclosure controls and controls over financial reporting as not effective.
