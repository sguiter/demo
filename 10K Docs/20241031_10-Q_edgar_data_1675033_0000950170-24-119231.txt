Item 1. Financi al Statements. 
 The financial statements listed in the index to consolidated financial statements immediately following the signature page to this report are incorporated herein by reference. 
 Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. 
 Overview 

On September 1, 2023, we contributed investments in certain of our operating company subsidiaries and other specialty finance assets to our formerly wholly owned subsidiary, Great Elm Specialty Finance, LLC GESF in exchange for equity and subordinated indebtedness in GESF. In connection with this contribution, a strategic investor purchased approximately 12.5 of the equity interests and subordinated indebtedness in GESF. Through its subsidiaries, GESF provides a variety of financing options along a continuum of lending to middle-market borrowers, including receivables factoring, asset-based and asset-backed lending, lender finance, and equipment financing. GESF expects to generate both revenue and cost synergies across its specialty finance company subsidiaries. We currently own approximately 87.5 of GESF. 
 On September 27, 2016, we and Great Elm Capital Management, LLC GECM ), our external investment manager, entered into an investment management agreement (the Investment Management Agreement and an administration agreement (the Administration Agreement ), and we began to accrue obligations to our external investment manager under those agreements. On August 1, 2022, upon receiving our stockholders approval, we and GECM entered into an amendment to the Investment Management Agreement to reset the capital gains incentive fee to begin on April 1, 2022, which eliminated 163.2 million of realized and unrealized losses incurred prior to April 1, 2022 in calculating future incentive fees. In addition, the incentive fee based on income was amended to reset the mandatory deferral commencement date used in calculating deferred incentive fees to April 1, 2022. The Investment Management Agreement renews for successive annual periods, subject to requisite approvals from our board of directors (our Board and/or stockholders. 
 We have elected to be treated as a RIC for U.S. federal income tax purposes. As a RIC, we will not be taxed on our income to the extent that we distribute such income each year and satisfy other applicable income tax requirements. To qualify as a RIC, we must, among other things, meet source-of-income and asset diversification requirements and annually distribute to our stockholders generally at least 90 of our investment company taxable income on a timely basis. If we qualify as a RIC, we generally will not have to pay corporate level taxes on any income that we distribute to our stockholders. 
 Investments 
 Our level of investment activity can and does vary substantially from period to period depending on many factors, including, among others, the amount of debt and equity capital available from other sources to middle-market companies, the level of merger and acquisition activity, pricing in the high yield and leveraged loan credit markets, our expectations of future investment opportunities, the general economic environment as well as the competitive environment for the types of investments we make. 
 As a BDC, our investments and the composition of our portfolio are required to comply with regulatory requirements. 
 Revenues 
 We generate revenue primarily from interest on the debt investments that we hold. We may also generate revenue from dividends on the equity investments that we hold, capital gains on the disposition of investments, and lease, fee, and other income. Our investments in fixed income instruments generally have an expected maturity of three to five years, although we have no lower or upper constraint on maturity. Our debt investments generally pay interest quarterly or semi-annually. Payments of principal of our debt investments may be amortized over the stated term of the investment, deferred for several years or due entirely at maturity. In some cases, our debt investments and preferred stock investments may defer payments of cash interest or dividends or payment-in-kind PIK ). In addition, we may generate revenue in the form of prepayment fees, commitment, origination, due diligence fees, end-of-term or exit fees, fees for providing significant managerial assistance, consulting fees and other investment-related income. 
 3 

Expenses 
 Our primary operating expenses include the payment of a base management fee, administration fees (including the allocable portion of overhead under the Administration Agreement), and, depending on our operating results, an incentive fee. The base management fee and incentive fee remunerates GECM for work in identifying, evaluating, negotiating, closing and monitoring our investments. The Administration Agreement provides for reimbursement of costs and expenses incurred for office space rental, office equipment and utilities allocable to us under the Administration Agreement, as well as certain costs and expenses incurred relating to non-investment advisory, administrative or operating services provided by GECM or its affiliates to us. We also bear all other costs and expenses of our operations and transactions. In addition, our expenses include interest on our outstanding indebtedness. 
 Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 
 Valuation of Portfolio Investments 
 We value our portfolio investments at fair value based upon the principles and methods of valuation set forth in policies adopted by our Board. Fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. Market participants are buyers and sellers in the principal (or most advantageous) market for the asset that (1) are independent of us; (2) are knowledgeable, having a reasonable understanding about the asset based on all available information (including information that might be obtained through due diligence efforts that are usual and customary); (3) are able to transact for the asset; and (4) are willing to transact for the asset (that is, they are motivated but not forced or otherwise compelled to do so). 
 Investments for which market quotations are readily available are valued at such market quotations unless the quotations are deemed not to represent fair value. Debt and equity securities for which market quotations are not readily available or for which market quotations are deemed not to represent fair value, are valued at fair value using a valuation process consistent with our Board-approved policy. 
 Our Board approves in good faith the valuation of our portfolio as of the end of each quarter. Due to the inherent uncertainty and subjectivity of determining the fair value of investments that do not have a readily available market value, the fair value of our investments may differ significantly from the values that would have been used had a readily available market value existed for such investments and may differ materially from the values that we may ultimately realize. In addition, changes in the market environment and other events may impact the market quotations used to value some of our investments. 
 Those investments for which market quotations are not readily available or for which market quotations are deemed not to represent fair value are valued utilizing a market approach, an income approach, or both approaches, as appropriate. The market approach uses prices and other relevant information generated by market transactions involving identical or comparable assets or liabilities (including a business). The income approach uses valuation techniques to convert future amounts (for example, cash flows or earnings) to a single present amount (discounted). The measurement is based on the value indicated by current market expectations about those future amounts. In following these approaches, the types of factors that we may take into account in determining the fair value of our investments include, as relevant and among other factors: available current market data, including relevant and applicable market trading and transaction comparables; applicable market yields and multiples, security covenants, call protection provisions, information rights and the nature and realizable value of any collateral, the portfolio company s ability to make payments, its earnings and discounted cash flows, the markets in which the portfolio company does business, comparisons of financial ratios of peer companies that are public, and merger and acquisition comparables; and enterprise values. 
 We prefer the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs in our valuation process. Inputs refer broadly to the assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an asset. Observable inputs are inputs that reflect the assumptions market participants would use in pricing an asset developed based on market data obtained from sources independent of us. Unobservable inputs are inputs that reflect our assumptions about the assumptions market participants would use in pricing an asset developed based on the best information available in the circumstances. 
 Both observable and unobservable inputs are subject to some level of uncertainty and assumptions used bear the risk of change in the future. We utilize the best information available to us, including the factors listed above, in preparing the fair valuations. In determining the fair value of any individual investment, we may use multiple inputs or utilize more than one approach to calculate the fair value to assess the sensitivity to change and determine a reasonable range of fair value. In addition, our valuation procedures include an assessment of the current valuation as compared to the previous valuation for each investment and where differences are material understanding the primary drivers of those changes, incorporating updates to our current valuation inputs and approaches as appropriate.

Revenue Recognition 
 Interest and dividend income, including PIK income, is recorded on an accrual basis. Origination, structuring, closing, commitment and other upfront fees, including original issue discounts OID ), earned with respect to capital commitments are generally amortized or accreted into interest income over the life of the respective debt investment, as are end-of-term or exit fees receivable upon repayment of a debt investment if such fees are fixed in nature. Other fees, including certain amendment fees, prepayment fees and commitment fees on broken deals, and end-of-term or exit fees that have a contingency feature or are variable in nature are recognized as earned. Prepayment fees and similar income due upon the early repayment of a loan or debt security are recognized when earned and are included in interest income. 
 We may purchase debt investments at a discount to their face value. Discounts on the acquisition of corporate debt instruments are generally amortized using the effective-interest or constant-yield method unless there are material questions as to collectability. 
 We assess the outstanding accrued income receivables for collectability at least quarterly, or more frequently if there is an event that indicates the underlying portfolio company may not be able to make the expected payments. If it is determined that amounts are not likely to be paid we may establish a reserve against or reverse the income and put the investment on non-accrual status. 
 Net Realized Gains (Losses) and Net Change in Unrealized Appreciation (Depreciation) 
 We measure realized gains or losses by the difference between the net proceeds from the repayment or sale of an investment and the amortized cost basis of the investment, without regard to unrealized appreciation or depreciation previously recognized. Realized gains and losses are computed using the specific identification method. 
 Net change in unrealized appreciation or depreciation reflects the net change in portfolio investment fair values and portfolio investment cost bases during the reporting period, including the reversal of previously recorded unrealized appreciation or depreciation when gains or losses are realized.

(1) The per share amounts are based on a weighted average of 10,449,888 and 9,556,695 outstanding common shares for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively. 

(2) The per share amounts are based on a weighted average of 7,601,958 outstanding common shares for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023. 

Investment income consists of interest income, including net amortization of premium and accretion of discount on loans and debt securities, dividend income and other income, which primarily consists of amendment fees, commitment fees and funding fees on loans. 
 Interest income increased for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the corresponding period in the prior year primarily due to an increased debt investment portfolio size. As of September 30, 2024, the debt investment portfolio had an average coupon rate of 12.3 on approximately 241.2 million of principal as compared to 12.5 on approximately 217.8 million of principal as of September 30, 2023, excluding positions on non-accrual in each period. 
 The increase in dividend income for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 is primarily due to the investment in CLO Formation JV, LLC which was formed in the current year and pays periodic dividends to its equityholders. 
 Other commitment fees decreased for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 attributable to exits from positions with revolver commitments.

(1) The per share amounts are based on a weighted average of 10,449,888 and 9,556,695 outstanding common shares for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively. 

(2) The per share amounts are based on a weighted average of 7,601,958 outstanding common shares for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023. 

Expenses are largely comprised of advisory fees and administration fees paid to GECM and interest expense on our outstanding notes payable. See Liquidity and Capital Resources. Advisory fees include management fees and incentive fees calculated in accordance with the Investment Management Agreement, and administration fees include direct costs reimbursable to GECM under the Administration Agreement and fees paid for sub-administration services. 
 Management fees increased for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 due to increases in the underlying management fee assets which primarily consists of the fair value of the portfolio of investments. 
 Incentive fees increased for the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023 due to higher pre-incentive net investment income over the same period. Incentive fees increased for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023 due to increased pre-incentive net investment income over the same period. 
 Professional services costs decreased for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the corresponding periods in the prior year, primarily due to decreased legal expenses associated with specific transaction matters which have been partially offset by general rate increases for professional services including valuation and accounting costs. 
 Interest expense increased for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the corresponding periods in the prior year primarily due to the issuance of 56.5 million in aggregate principal amount of the 8.50 Notes due 2029 (the GECCI Notes in April and July 2024, and the issuance of 36.0 million in aggregate principal amount of the 8.125 Notes due 2029 (the GECCH Notes in September 2024.

For the three months ended September 30, 2024, unrealized appreciation was primarily driven by an increase in fair value of our investment in CW Opportunity 2 LP of approximately 1.1 million and in our investment in Nice-Pak Products, Inc. warrants of approximately 0.5 million. Unrealized depreciation for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily driven by a decrease in fair value of our investment in GESF common stock of approximately 1.1 million and in our investment in Blue Ribbon, LLC term loan of approximately 0.4 million.

For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, unrealized appreciation was primarily driven by an increase in fair value of our investment in Nice-Pak Products warrants of approximately 2.2 million and in our investment in Maverick Gaming, LLC term loan of approximately 1.5 million. Unrealized depreciation for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily driven by a decrease in fair value of our investment in GESF common stock of approximately 3.6 million and in our investment in New Wilkie Energy term loan of approximately 2.2 million. 
 For the three months ended September 30, 2023, unrealized appreciation was primarily driven by reversal of approximately 7.0 million in previously recognized unrealized depreciation on our investment in Lenders Funding common equity which was reclassified to realized loss upon the sale of our position and 2.0 million in the reversal of previously recognized unrealized depreciation on our investment in Sterling equity which was reclassified to realized loss upon the in-kind contribution to GESF. Unrealized depreciation for the three months ended September 30, 2023 was primarily driven by the reversal of approximately 3.9 million in previously recognized unrealized appreciation on our investment in Prestige common equity which was reclassified to realized gain upon the in-kind contribution to GESF. 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2023, unrealized appreciation was primarily driven by an increase in the fair value of our investment in American Coastal Insurance Corp. (formerly, United Insurance Holding Corp.) unsecured bonds of approximately 5.0 million. Unrealized appreciation also includes approximately 5.0 million and 1.6 million in the reversal of previously recognized unrealized depreciation on our investments in Lenders Funding equity and Sterling equity, respectively.

 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 We generate liquidity through our operations with cash received from investment income and sales and paydowns on investments. Such proceeds are generally reinvested in new investment opportunities, distributed to shareholders in the form of dividends, or used to pay operating expenses. We also receive proceeds from our issuances of notes payable and our revolving credit facility and from time to time may raise additional equity capital. See Revolver and Notes Payable below for more information regarding our outstanding credit facility and notes. 
 As of September 30, 2024, we had approximately 0.3 million of cash and cash equivalents and approximately 25.7 million of money market fund investments at fair value. As of September 30, 2024, we had investments in 54 debt instruments across 45 companies, totaling approximately 234.5 million at fair value and 20 equity investments in 18 companies, with an aggregate fair value of approximately 98.8 million. 
 In the normal course of business, we may enter into investment agreements under which we commit to make an investment in a portfolio company at some future date or over a specified period of time. As of September 30, 2024, we had approximately 11.1 million in unfunded commitments to provide financing to certain of our portfolio companies. We had sufficient availability on our Revolver as well as cash and other liquid assets on our September 30, 2024 balance sheet to satisfy the unfunded commitments. 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, net cash used for operating activities was approximately 114.1 million, reflecting the purchases and repayments of investments offset by net investment income, including non-cash income related to accretion of discount and PIK income and proceeds from sales of investments and principal payments received. Net cash provided by purchases and proceeds from sales of investments was approximately 47.0 million, reflecting payments for additional investments of 219.2 million, offset by proceeds from principal repayments and sales of 172.2 million. 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, net cash provided by financing activities was 113.5 million, consisting of 35.7 million in proceeds from our issuance of shares of our common stock, net of related expenses, 88.8 million in net proceeds from the issuance of the GECCI Notes and GECCH Notes, less 11.0 million in distributions to stockholders. 
 We believe we have sufficient liquidity available to meet our short-term and long-term obligations for at least the next 12 months and for the foreseeable future thereafter.

 We have certain contracts under which we have material future commitments. Under the Investment Management Agreement, GECM provides investment advisory services to us. For providing these services, we pay GECM a fee, consisting of two components: (1) a base management fee based on the average value of our total assets and (2) an incentive fee based on our performance. On August 1, 2022, our stockholders approved an amendment to the Investment Management Agreement to eliminate 163.2 million of realized and unrealized losses incurred prior to April 1, 2022 from the calculation of future capital gains incentive fees and reset the capital gain incentive fee and mandatory deferral periods in Sections 4.4 and 4.5, respectively, of the Investment Management Agreement to begin on April 1, 2022. 
 We are also party to the Administration Agreement with GECM. Under the Administration Agreement, GECM furnishes us with, or otherwise arranges for the provision of, office facilities, equipment, clerical, bookkeeping, finance, accounting, compliance and record keeping services at such office facilities and other such services as our administrator. 
 If any of the contractual obligations discussed above are terminated, our costs under any new agreements that we enter into may increase. In addition, we would likely incur significant time and expense in locating alternative parties to provide the services we expect to receive under our Investment Management Agreement and our Administration Agreement. Any new investment management agreement would also be subject to approval by our stockholders. 
 Both the Investment Management Agreement and the Administration Agreement may be terminated by either party without penalty upon no fewer than 60 days written notice to the other. 
 Revolver 
 On May 5, 2021, we entered into a Loan, Guarantee and Security Agreement (the Loan Agreement with City National Bank CNB ). The Loan Agreement provides for a senior secured revolving line of credit (the Revolver of up to 25 million (subject to a borrowing base as defined in the Loan Agreement). We may request to increase the revolving line in an aggregate amount not to exceed 25 million, which increase is subject to the sole discretion of CNB. In November 2023, the Company entered into an amendment to the Loan Agreement extending the maturity date of the revolving line to May 5, 2027. Borrowings under the revolving line bear interest at a rate equal to (i) the Secured Overnight Financing Rate SOFR plus 3.00 (reduced from SOFR plus 3.50 prior to the November 2023 amendment), (ii) a base rate plus 2.00 or (iii) a combination thereof, as determined by us. Additionally, we are required to pay a commitment fee of 0.50 per annum on any unused portion of the revolving line of credit. As of September 30, 2024, there were no borrowings outstanding under the revolving line. 
 Borrowings under the revolving line are secured by a first priority security interest in substantially all of our assets, subject to certain specified exceptions. We have made customary representations and warranties and are required to comply with various affirmative and negative covenants, reporting requirements and other customary requirements for similar loan agreements. In addition, the Loan Agreement contains financial covenants requiring (i) net assets of not less than 65 million, (ii) asset coverage equal to or greater than 150 and (iii) bank asset coverage equal to or greater than 300 , in each case tested as of the last day of each fiscal quarter of the Company. Borrowings are also subject to the leverage restrictions contained in the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the Investment Company Act ).

On September 12, 2024, we caused redemption notices to be issued to the holders of the GECCM Notes regarding the Company's exercise of its option to redeem, in whole, the issued and outstanding GECCM Notes. We redeemed all of the issued and outstanding GECCM Notes on October 12, 2024 at 100 of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest thereon from September 30, 2024 through, but excluding, the redemption date, October 12, 2024.

 (2) Calculated as of the respective high or low closing sales price divided by the quarter-end NAV. 

 (3) We have adopted a dividend reinvestment plan that provides for reinvestment of our dividends and other distributions on behalf of our stockholders, unless a stockholder elects to receive cash. As a result, if our Board authorizes, and we declare, a cash distribution, our stockholders who have not opted out of our dividend reinvestment plan will have their cash distributions (net of any applicable withholding tax) automatically reinvested in additional shares of our common stock, rather than receiving the cash distributions. 

 For all periods presented in the table above, there was no return of capital included in any distribution. The last reported closing price for our common stock on October 24, 2024 was per share. As of October 24, 2024, we had 9 record holders of our common stock.

Recent Developments 
 Distribution 
 Our board set the distribution for the quarter ending December 31, 2024 at a rate of 0.35 per share. The full amount of each distribution will be from distributable earnings. The schedule of distribution payments will be established by GECC pursuant to authority granted by our Board. The distribution will be paid in cash. 
 Redemption of GECCM Notes 
 On October 12, 2024, we redeemed all of the issued and outstanding GECCM Notes at 100 of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest thereon from September 30, 2024 through, but excluding, the redemption date, October 12, 2024. 
 Issuance of Additional GECCH Notes 
 On October 3, 2024, the Company issued an additional 5.4 million of the GECCH Notes upon full exercise of the underwriters' over-allotment option. 
 Interest Rate Risk 
 We are also subject to financial risks, including changes in market interest rates. As of September 30, 2024, approximately 174.6 million in principal amount of our debt investments bore interest at variable rates, which are generally based on SOFR or US prime rate, and many of which are subject to certain floors. Although interest rates began to decline during the quarter, in recent years interest rates have risen and remain elevated. A prolonged increase in interest rates will increase our gross investment income and could result in an increase in our net investment income if such increases in interest rates are not offset by a corresponding decrease in the spread over variable rates that we earn on any portfolio investments or an increase in our operating expenses. See Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk for an analysis of the impact of hypothetical base rate changes in interest rates. 
 14 

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitati ve Disclosures About Market Risk. 
 We are subject to financial market risks, including changes in interest rates. As of September 30, 2024, 11 debt investments in our portfolio bore interest at a fixed rate, and the remaining 42 debt investments were at variable rates, representing approximately 66.6 million and 174.6 million in principal debt, respectively. As of December 31, 2023, 8 debt investments in our portfolio bore interest at a fixed rate, and the remaining 29 debt investments were at variable rates, representing approximately 68.2 million and 148.9 million in principal debt, respectively. The variable rates are generally based upon the SOFR or US prime rate. 
 To illustrate the potential impact of a change in the underlying interest rate on our net investment income, we have assumed a 1 , 2 , and 3 increase and 1 , 2 , and 3 decrease in the underlying reference rate, and no other change in our portfolio as of September 30, 2024. We have also assumed there are no outstanding floating rate borrowings by the Company. See the following table for the effect the rate changes would have on net investment income.

(5,183) 

(1) Several of our debt investments with variable rates contain a reference rate floor. The actual increase (decrease) of net investment income reflected in the table above takes into account such floors to the extent applicable. 

Although we believe that this analysis is indicative of our existing interest rate sensitivity as of September 30, 2024, it does not adjust for changes in the credit quality, size and composition of our portfolio, and other business developments, including borrowing under a credit facility, that could affect the net increase (decrease) in net assets resulting from operations. Accordingly, no assurances can be given that actual results would not differ materially from the results under this hypothetical analysis. 
 We may in the future hedge against interest rate fluctuations by using standard hedging instruments such as futures, options and forward contracts. While hedging activities may insulate us against adverse changes in interest rates, they may also limit our ability to participate in the benefits of lower interest rates with respect to the investments in our portfolio with fixed interest rates. 
 Item 4. Controls and Procedures. 
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 As of September 30, 2024, we, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act )). Based on that evaluation, our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective and provided reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed in our periodic filings with the SEC is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. However, in evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, management recognized that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives, and management necessarily was required to apply its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures.

GREAT ELM CAPITAL CORP. 
 NOTES TO THE UNAUDITED CONSOLI DATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
 Dollar amounts in thousands, except share and per share amounts 
 as a Maryland corporation. The Company is structured as an externally managed, non-diversified closed-end management investment company. The Company elected to be regulated as a business development company (a BDC under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the Investment Company Act ). The Company is managed by Great Elm Capital Management, LLC, a Delaware corporation GECM ), a subsidiary of Great Elm Group, Inc., a Delaware corporation GEG ). The Company seeks to generate current income and capital appreciation through debt and income generating equity investments, including investments in specialty finance businesses. 

F- 38 

F- 39 

of the Company s total capitalization and individually less than of the Company s total capitalization may be determined by GECM in good faith in accordance with the Company s valuation policy without the employment of an independent valuation firm; and 

 The Company s audit committee recommends, and the Board approves, the fair value of the investments in the Company s portfolio in good faith based on the input of GECM, the independent valuation firms (to the extent applicable) and the business judgment of the audit committee and the Board, respectively. 

 Those investments for which market quotations are not readily available or for which market quotations are deemed not to represent fair value are valued utilizing a market approach, an income approach, or both approaches, as appropriate. The market approach uses prices and other relevant information generated by market transactions involving identical or comparable assets or liabilities (including a business). The income approach uses valuation techniques to convert future amounts (for example, cash flows or earnings) to a single present amount (discounted). The measurement is based on the value indicated by current market expectations about those future amounts. In following these approaches, the types of factors that the Company may take into account in determining the fair value of its investments include, as relevant and among other factors: available current market data, including relevant and applicable market trading and transaction comparables, applicable market yields and multiples, security covenants, call protection provisions, information rights, the nature and realizable value of any collateral, the portfolio company s ability to make payments, its earnings and discounted cash flows, the markets in which the portfolio company does business, comparisons of financial ratios of peer companies that are public, merger and acquisition comparables, and enterprise values. Investments in revolvers or delayed draw loans may include unfunded commitments for which the Company s acquisition cost will be offset by compensation received on the portion of the commitment that is unfunded. As a result, the purchases of a commitment that is not fully funded may result in a negative cost basis for the funded commitment. The fair value of the unfunded commitment is adjusted for price appreciation or depreciation and may result in a negative fair value for the unfunded commitment. 

F- 40 

of investment company taxable income ICTI including PIK interest, as defined by the Code, for each taxable year in order to be eligible for tax treatment under subchapter M of the Code. Depending on the level of ICTI earned in a tax year, the Company may choose to carry forward ICTI in excess of current year dividend distributions into the next tax year. Any such carryover ICTI must be distributed prior to the 15th day of the ninth month after the tax year-end. So long as the Company maintains its status as a RIC, it generally will not be subject to corporate-level U.S. federal income taxes on any ordinary income or capital gains that it distributes at least annually to its stockholders as distributions. Rather, any tax liability related to income earned by the Company represents obligations of the Company s stockholders and will not be reflected in the consolidated financial statements of the Company. If the Company does not distribute (or is not deemed to have distributed) each calendar year the sum of (1) of its net ordinary income for each calendar year, (2) of its capital gain net income for the one-year period ending October 31 in that calendar year and (3) any income recognized, but not distributed, in preceding years (the Minimum Distribution Amount ), the Company will generally be required to pay an excise tax equal to of the amount by the which Minimum Distribution Amount exceeds the distributions for the year. To the extent that the Company determines that its estimated current year annual taxable income will be in excess of estimated current year dividend distributions from such taxable income, the Company accrues excise taxes, if any, on estimated excess taxable income as taxable income is earned using an annual effective excise tax rate. The annual effective excise tax rate is determined by dividing the estimated annual excise tax by the estimated annual taxable income. The Company has accrued of excise tax expense during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 . The Company accrued of excise tax expense during the year ended December 31, 2023. At December 31, 2023, the Company, for federal income tax purposes, had capital loss carryforwards of which will reduce its taxable income arising from future net realized gains on investment transactions, if any, to the extent permitted by the Internal Revenue Code, and thus will reduce the amount of distributions to stockholders, which would otherwise be necessary to relieve the Company of any liability for federal income tax. On December 22, 2010, the Regulated Investment Company Modernization Act of 2010 (the Modernization Act was signed into law. The Modernization Act changed the capital loss carryforward rules as they relate to regulated investment companies. Capital losses generated in tax years beginning after the date of enactment may now be carried forward indefinitely, and retain the character of the original loss. Of the capital loss carryforwards at December 31, 2023, are limited losses and available for use subject to annual limitation under Section 382. Of the capital losses at December 31, 2023, are short-term and are long term. ASC 740, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes ASC 740 provides guidance on the accounting for and disclosure of uncertainty in tax position. ASC 740 requires the evaluation of tax positions taken or expected to be taken in the course of preparing the Company s tax returns to determine whether the tax positions are more-likely-than-not of being sustained by the applicable tax authority. Tax positions deemed to meet the more-likely-than-not threshold are recorded as a tax benefit or expense in the current year. Based on its analysis of its tax position for all open tax years (the current and prior years, as applicable), the Company has concluded that it does not have any uncertain tax positions that met the recognition or measurement criteria of ASC 740. Such open tax years remain subject to examination and adjustment by tax authorities.

million of historical realized and unrealized losses incurred prior to April 1, 2022 in calculating future incentive fees. In addition, the Income Incentive Fee was amended to reset the mandatory deferral commencement date used in calculating deferred incentive fees to April 1, 2022. The Company s Chief Executive Officer and President is also a portfolio manager for GECM, as well as a Managing Director of Imperial Capital Asset Management, LLC. The Company s Chief Compliance Officer is also the chief compliance officer and general counsel of GECM, and the president of GEG. The Company s Chief Financial Officer is also the chief financial officer of GEG. Management Fee The base management fee is calculated at an annual rate of of the Company s average adjusted gross assets, including assets purchased with borrowed funds. The base management fee is payable quarterly in arrears. The base management fee is calculated based on the average value of the Company s gross assets, excluding cash and cash equivalents, at the end of the two most recently completed calendar quarters, and appropriately adjusted for any share issuances or repurchases during the then current calendar quarter. Base management fees for any partial quarter are prorated. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 management fees amounted to and , respectively. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 management fees amounted to and , respectively. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, and , respectively, remained payable. Incentive Fee The incentive fee consists of two components that are independent of each other with the result that one component may be payable even if the other is not. One component of the incentive fee is based on income (the Income Incentive Fee and the other component is based on capital gains (the Capital Gains Incentive Fee ). The Income Incentive Fee is calculated on a quarterly basis as of the amount by which the Company s pre-incentive fee net investment income (the Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income for the quarter exceeds a hurdle rate of annualized) of the Company s net assets at the end of the immediately preceding calendar quarter, subject to a catch-up provision pursuant to which GECM receives all of such income in excess of the level but less than annualized) and subject to a total return requirement (described below). The effect of the catch-up provision is that, subject to the total return provision, if pre-incentive fee net investment income exceeds of the Company s net assets at the end of the immediately preceding calendar quarter, in any calendar quarter, GECM will receive of the Company s pre-incentive fee net investment income as if the hurdle rate did not apply. These calculations will be appropriately prorated for any period of less than three months and adjusted for any share issuances or repurchases during the then current quarter. Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income includes any accretion of original issue discount, market discount, PIK interest, PIK dividends or other types of deferred or accrued income, including in connection with zero coupon securities, that the Company and its consolidated subsidiaries have recognized in accordance with GAAP, but have not yet received in cash (collectively, Accrued Unpaid Income ).
