SPECIAL NOTE REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS 
 This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws. All statements other than statements of historical fact contained in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, including statements regarding our future results of operations and financial position, business strategy and plans and objectives of management for future operations, are forward-looking statements. These statements involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other important factors that may cause our actual results, performance or achievements to be materially different from any future results, performance or achievements expressed or implied by the forward-looking statements. 
 In some cases, you can identify forward-looking statements by terms such as may, should, would, expects, plans, anticipates, could, intends, target, projects, contemplates, believes, estimates, predicts, potential or continue or the negative of these terms or other similar expressions. The forward-looking statements in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q are only predictions. We have based these forward-looking statements largely on our current expectations and projections about future events and financial trends that we believe may affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. These forward-looking statements speak only as of the date of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and are subject to a number of risks, uncertainties and assumptions described in the section titled Risk Factors and elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Because forward-looking statements are inherently subject to risks and uncertainties, some of which cannot be predicted or quantified, you should not rely on these forward-looking statements as predictions of future events. The events and circumstances reflected in our forward-looking statements may not be achieved or occur and actual results could differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements. Some of the key factors that could cause actual results to differ from our expectations include: 
 our ability to achieve or sustain positive cash flows from operations or profitability; 

our ability to complete the construction of, commission and successfully operate isotope enrichment plants in a cost-effective manner; 

our ability to meet, and to continue to meet, applicable regulatory requirements for the use of the isotopes we may produce using the ASP technology or the Quantum Enrichment process; 

our ability to obtain regulatory approvals for the production and distribution of isotopes; 

our ability to comply on an ongoing basis with the numerous regulatory requirements applicable to the ASP technology, the Quantum Enrichment process and our enrichment facilities in South Africa; 

the introduction, market acceptance and success of Mo-100 that we may produce using ASP technology as an alternative and potentially more convenient production route for Tc-99m; 

the success or profitability of our future offtake arrangements with respect to various isotopes that we may produce using ASP technology or the Quantum Enrichment process; 

a failure of demand for various isotopes that we may produce using ASP technology or the Quantum Enrichment process; 

our future capital requirements and sources and uses of cash; 

our ability to obtain funding for our operations and future growth; 

the extensive costs, time and uncertainty associated with new technology development; 

our ability to implement and maintain effective internal controls; 

developments and projections relating to our competitors and industry; 

the ability to recognize the anticipated benefits of acquisitions, including our acquisition of assets of Molybdos (Pty) Limited in the business rescue auction, the assets and intellectual property we acquired from Klydon Proprietary Ltd, and our investment in PET Labs Pharmaceuticals; 

problems with the performance of the ASP technology or the Quantum Enrichment process in the enrichment of isotopes; 

our dependence on a limited number of third-party suppliers for certain components; 

our inability to adapt to changing technology and diagnostic landscape, such as the emergence of new diagnostic scanners or tracers; 

our expected dependence on a limited number of key customers for isotopes that we may produce using ASP technology or the Quantum Enrichment process; 

our inability to protect our intellectual property and the risk of claims that we have infringed on the intellectual property of others; 

our inability to compete effectively;

our credit counterparty risks; 

geopolitical risk and changes in applicable laws or regulations; 

our inability to adequately protect our technology infrastructure; 

our inability to hire or retain skilled employees and the loss of any of our key personnel; 

operational risk; 

costs and other risks associated with becoming a reporting company and becoming subject to the Sarbanes-Oxley Act; and 

other factors that are described in Risk Factors, on page 38 .

These statements relate to future events or to our future financial performance and involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties, and other factors that may cause our actual results, performance, or achievements to be materially different from any future results, performance, or achievements expressed or implied by these forward-looking statements. Factors that may cause actual results to differ materially from current expectations include, among other things, those set forth in Part I, Item 1A - Risk Factors below and for the reasons described elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Any forward-looking statement in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q reflects our current view with respect to future events and is subject to these and other risks, uncertainties, and assumptions relating to our operations, results of operations, industry, and future growth. Given these uncertainties, you should not place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements. Except as required by law, we assume no obligation to update or revise these forward-looking statements for any reason, even if new information becomes available in the future. 
 This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q also contains estimates, projections, and other information concerning our industry, our business, and the potential markets for certain isotopes, including data regarding the estimated size of those markets, their projected growth rates, and the incidence of certain medical conditions. Information that is based on estimates, forecasts, projections, or similar methodologies is inherently subject to uncertainties, and actual events or circumstances may differ materially from events and circumstances reflected in this information. Unless otherwise expressly stated, we obtained these industry, business, market, and other data from reports, research surveys, studies, and similar data prepared by third parties, industry, medical and general publications, government data, and similar sources.

ASP Isotopes Inc. 
 Notes to Unaudited Conden sed Consolidated Financial Statements 
 owned subsidiary of ASP South Africa, was formed in March 2023 and began operations in January 2024. ASP Isotopes UK Ltd ASP UK ), a subsidiary of ASP Guernsey, was incorporated in July 2022. ASPI South Africa Asset Finance Proprietary Limited ("ASP SA Asset Finance ), a subsidiary of ASP South Africa, was incorporated in July 2024. PET Labs Global Nuclear Medicine SEZC PET Labs Global ), a subsidiary of ASP Guernsey, was incorporated in June 2024 in the Cayman Islands. PET Labs Pharmaceuticals Proprietary Limited PET Labs ), a owned subsidiary of ASP Isotopes Inc. operates in South Africa. ASP Isotopes Inc. s subsidiary, Quantum Leap Energy LLC, was formed in the state of Delaware in September 2023 and began operations in February 2024. Quantum Leap Energy LLC s subsidiary Quantum Leap Energy Proprietary Limited Quantum Leap Energy South Africa ), has its operations in South Africa. ASP Isotopes Inc., its subsidiaries and ASP Rentals are collectively referred to as the Company throughout these consolidated statements. The Company is a development stage advanced materials company dedicated to the development of technology and processes that, if successful, will allow for the enrichment of natural isotopes into higher concentration products, which could be used in several industries. The Company s proprietary technology, the Aerodynamic Separation Process ASP technology ), originally developed by Klydon Proprietary Ltd Klydon ), is designed to enable the production of isotopes used in several industries. The Company s initial focus is on the production and commercialization of enriched Carbon-14 C-14 ), Molybdenum-100 Mo-100 and Silicon-28 Si-28 ). The Company has completed an isotope enrichment plant for the enrichment of C-14 located in Pretoria, South Africa and we expect to start commercial supply of C-14 in the first quarter of 2025, assuming timely delivery of the feedstock from the Company's customer. The Company anticipates completion and commissioning of a multi-isotope enrichment plant in Pretoria, South Africa in the fourth quarter 2024, and the Company expects to start initial commercial supply of Si-28 in early 2025. In addition, the Company has started planning additional isotope enrichment plants. The Company believes the C-14 it may develop using the ASP technology may be used in the development of new pharmaceuticals and agrochemicals. The Company believes that the Mo-100 it may develop using the ASP technology has significant potential advantages for use in the preparation of nuclear imaging agents by radiopharmacies and others in the medical industry. The Company believes the Si-28 it may develop using the ASP technology may be used to develop advanced semiconductors and in quantum computing. In addition, the Company is considering the future development of the ASP technology for the separation of Zinc-68, Xenon-129/136 for potential use in the healthcare end market, Germanium 70/72/74 for possible use in the semiconductor end market, and Chlorine-37 for potential use in the nuclear energy end market. The Company is also developing quantum enrichment technology to produce enriched Ytterbium-176 Yb-176 ), Nickel-64, Lithium6, Lithium-7 and Uranium-235 U-235 ). Quantum enrichment is an advanced isotope enrichment technique that is currently in development that uses lasers. The Company believes the U-235 that it may develop using quantum enrichment technology may be commercialized as a nuclear fuel component for use in the new generation of high-assay low-enriched uranium (HALEU)-fueled small modular reactors that are now under development for commercial and government uses. The construction of the Company's first quantum enrichment facility was completed in August 2024, and the Company produced the first semi-finished material of enriched Yb-176 during the commissioning phase of the plant in October 2024. The Company expects to be able to achieve a enrichment for Yb-176 and offer highly enriched Yb-176 for commercial sale during 2025. The Company also expects to proceed with the plans to construct Nickel-64 and Lithium- 6/7 quantum enrichment plants with targeted production during 2025. Liquidity The Company has experienced net losses and negative cash flows from operating activities since its inception. The Company incurred net losses of and for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The Company currently expects that its cash and cash equivalents of as of September 30, 2024 will be sufficient to fund its operating expenses and capital requirements for more than 12 months from the date the financial statements are issued. In November 2024, the Company issued an additional shares of common stock in a public offering at a public offering price of per share for net proceeds of approximately . The Company anticipates it will need to continue to raise capital through additional equity and/or debt financings and/or collaborative development agreements to fund its operations. There can be no assurance that the Company will achieve or sustain positive cash flows from operations or profitability. The Company is in the process of seeking additional debt and equity financing. However, such funding may not be available on a timely basis on terms acceptable to the Company, or at all. If the Company is unable to raise additional capital when required or on acceptable terms, the Company may be required to scale back or discontinue the advancement of product candidates, reduce headcount, reorganize, merge with another entity, or cease operations.

Principles of consolidation owned Enlightened Isotopes, the owned PET Labs and the owned VIE ASP Rentals. All intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. Currency and currency translation owned Enlighted Isotopes, the owned PET Labs and the owned VIE ASP Rentals is the South African Rand. Adjustments that arise from exchange rate changes on transactions of each group entity denominated in a currency other than the functional currency are included in other income and expense in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss. Assets and liabilities of the entities with functional currency of South African Rand are recorded in South African Rand and translated into the U.S. dollar reporting currency of the Company at the exchange rate on the balance sheet date. Revenue and expenses of the entities with functional currency of South African Rand are recorded in South African Rand and translated into the U.S. dollar reporting currency of the Company at the average exchange rate prevailing during the reporting period. Resulting translation adjustments are recorded separately in stockholders equity as a component of accumulated other comprehensive (loss) income. Concentration of Credit Risk and other Risks per depositor, per insured bank for each account ownership category. Although the Company currently believes that the financial institutions with whom it does business, will be able to fulfill their commitments to the Company, there is no assurance that those institutions will be able to continue to do so. The Company has not experienced any credit losses associated with its balances in such accounts for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. The Company's foreign subsidiaries held cash of approximately and as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 , respectively, which is included in cash on the consolidated balance sheets. The Company's strategic plan does not require the repatriation of foreign cash in order to fund its operations in the U.S., and it is the Company's current intention to indefinitely reinvest its foreign cash outside of the U.S. If the Company were to repatriate foreign cash to the U.S., the Company would be required to accrue and pay U.S. taxes in accordance with applicable U.S. tax rules and regulations as a result of the repatriation. 
 Cash and Cash Equivalents in the form of money market funds as of September 30, 2024 . The Company had cash equivalents as of December 31, 2023 . 
 Segment Information operating segments: (i) nuclear fuels, and (ii) specialist isotopes and related services. The nuclear fuels segment is focused on research and development of technologies and methods used to produce high-assay low-enriched uranium (HALEU) and Lithium-6 for the advanced nuclear fuels target end market. The specialist isotopes and related services segment is focused on research and development of technologies and methods used to separate high-value, low-volume isotopes (such as C-14, Mo-100 and Si-28) for highly specialized target end markets other than advanced nuclear fuels, including pharmaceuticals and agrochemicals, nuclear medical imaging and semiconductors, as well as services related to these isotopes, and this segment includes PET Labs.

To determine the appropriate amount of revenue to be recognized for arrangements determined to be within the scope of ASC 606, the Company performs the following five steps: (i) identification of the promised goods or services in the contract; (ii) determination of whether the promised goods or services are performance obligations including whether they are distinct in the context of the contract; (iii) measurement of the transaction price, including the constraint on variable consideration; (iv) allocation of the transaction price to the performance obligations; and (v) recognition of revenue when (or as) the Company satisfies each performance obligation. The Company only applies the five-step model to contracts when it is probable that the entity will collect consideration it is entitled to in exchange for the goods or services it transfers to the customer. The Company evaluates a transaction s performance obligations to determine if promised goods or services in a contract to transfer a distinct good or service to the customer and are considered distinct when (i) the customer can benefit from the good or service on its own or together with other readily available resources and (ii) the promised good or service is separately identifiable from other promises in the contract. In assessing whether promised goods or services are distinct, the Company considers whether the goods or services are integral or dependent to other goods or services in the contract. The Company determines the transaction price based on the agreed government rates for the promised goods in the contract.

. The Company had no income tax expense due to operating losses incurred for the three months ended September 30, 2023, as the Company had a full valuation allowance on the net deferred tax asset. The effective tax rate for the three month period ended September 30, 2024 varied from the federal statutory rate primarily due to losses in jurisdictions for which a valuation allowance is recorded. The Company s effective tax rate for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was . The Company had no income tax expense due to operating losses incurred for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, as the Company had a full valuation allowance on the net deferred tax asset. The effective tax rate for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 varied from the federal statutory rate primarily due to losses in jurisdictions for which a valuation allowance is recorded. The Company recognizes a tax benefit from an uncertain tax position when it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination, including resolutions of any related appeals or litigation processes, based on the technical merits. Income tax positions must meet a more likely than not recognition threshold to be recognized. The Company s practice is to recognize interest and/or penalties related to income tax matters in income tax expense. The Company had no accrual for interest and penalties on the Company s balance sheets and has not recognized interest and/or penalties in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024. Uncertain tax positions are evaluated based upon the facts and circumstances that exist at each reporting period. Subsequent changes in judgment based upon new information may lead to changes in recognition, derecognition, and measurement. Adjustments may result, for example, upon resolution of an issue with the taxing authorities or expiration of a statute of limitations barring an assessment for an issue. As of September 30, 2024, there were no uncertain tax positions. As of September 30, 2024, the Company did not recognize any interest and penalties associated with unrecognized tax benefits. Due to net operating losses incurred, tax years from inception remain open to examination by the Federal and State taxing jurisdictions to which the Company is subject. The Company is not currently under Internal Revenue Services (IRS), state or local tax examination. Ownership changes, as defined in the IRC, may limit the amount of net operating loss carryforwards that can be utilized annually to offset future taxable income pursuant to IRC Section 382 or similar provisions. Subsequent ownership changes could further affect the limitation in future years. The Company has not completed a study to assess whether a change of control has occurred or whether there have been multiple changes of control since the Company s formation due to the significant complexity and cost associated with such study and because there could be additional changes in control in the future. As a result, the Company is not able to estimate the effect of the change in control, if any, on the Company s ability to utilize net operating loss and research and development credit carryforwards in the future.

As a result of many factors, including those factors set forth in the section entitled Risk Factors, our actual results could differ materially from the results described in or implied by the forward-looking statements contained in the following discussion and analysis. You should carefully read the section entitled Risk Factors to gain an understanding of the important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from our forward- looking statements. Please also see the section entitled Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements. 
 Overview 
 We are a development stage advanced materials company dedicated to the development of technology and processes that, if successful, will allow for the enrichment of natural isotopes into higher concentration products, which could be used in several industries. Our proprietary technology, the Aerodynamic Separation Process ASP technology ), originally developed by Klydon Proprietary Ltd Klydon ), is designed to enable the production of isotopes used in several industries. Our initial focus is on the production and commercialization of enriched Carbon-14 C-14 ), Molybdenum-100 Mo-100 and Silicon-28 Si-28 ). We have completed an isotope enrichment plant for the enrichment of C-14 located in Pretoria, South Africa and we expect to start commercial supply of C-14 in the first quarter of 2025 assuming timely delivery of the feedstock from the Company s customer. We anticipate completion and commissioning of a multi-isotope enrichment plant in Pretoria, South Africa in the fourth quarter of 2024, and we expect to start initial commercial supply of Si-28 in early 2025. In addition, we have started planning additional isotope enrichment plants. We believe the C-14 we may produce using the ASP technology could be used in the development of new pharmaceuticals and agrochemicals. We believe the Mo-100 we may produce using the ASP technology could have significant potential advantages for use in the preparation of nuclear imaging agents by radiopharmacies and others in the medical industry. We believe the Si-28 we may produce using the ASP technology may be used to create advanced semiconductors and in quantum computing. In addition, we are considering the future development of the ASP technology for the separation of Zinc-68, Xenon-129/136 for potential use in the healthcare end market, Germanium 70/72/74 for possible use in the semiconductor end market, and Chlorine -37 for potential use in the nuclear energy end market. 
 We are also developing Quantum Enrichment technology to produce enriched Ytterbium-176 Yb-176 ), Nickel-64, Lithium 6, Lithium7 and Uranium-235 U-235 ). Quantum enrichment is an advanced isotope enrichment technique that is currently in development that uses lasers. We believe that the U-235 we may produce using quantum enrichment technology may be commercialized as a nuclear fuel component for use in the new generation of HALEU- fueled small modular reactors that are now under development for commercial and government uses. The construction of our first quantum enrichment facility was completed in August 2024, and we produced the first semi-finished material of enriched Yb-176 during the commissioning phase of the plant in October 2024. We expect to be able to achieve a 99.75 enrichment for Yb-176 and offer highly enriched Yb-176 for commercial sale during 2025. We also expect to proceed with the plans to construct Nickel-64 and Lithium- 6/7 quantum enrichment plants with targeted production during 2025. 
 Our Subsidiaries 
 We operate principally through our subsidiaries. ASP Isotopes Guernsey Limited (the holding company for subsidiaries in the Cayman Islands, South Africa, Iceland and the United Kingdom) is focused on the development and commercialization of high-value, low-volume isotopes for highly specialized end markets (such as C-14, Mo-100, and Si-28). ASP Isotopes UK Ltd is the owner of our technology. 
 In September 2023, we formed Quantum Leap Energy LLC, or QLE, which also has subsidiaries in the United Kingdom (Quantum Leap Energy Limited) and South Africa (Quantum Leap Energy (Pty) Limited), to focus on the development and commercialization of advanced nuclear fuels such as HALEU and Lithium-6. 
 In addition, in the fourth quarter of 2023, we entered into a strategic relationship with Pet Labs Pharmaceuticals (Pty) Limited (PET Labs) by acquiring a 51 ownership stake in PET Labs. We anticipate this transaction will allow us to enter the downstream medical isotope production and distribution market. Beginning in 2024, primarily as a result of the increased business activities of QLE, we have two operating segments: (i) nuclear fuels, and (ii) specialist isotopes and related services. 
 Although no assurance can be given, we plan to spin-out QLE as a separate public company and list the shares of QLE on a U.S. national exchange and distribute a portion of QLE s common equity to ASPI s stockholders as of a to-be-determined future record date, in each case subject to obtaining applicable approvals and consents and complying with applicable rules and regulations and public market trading and listing requirements. The regulatory landscape and supply chain for nuclear fuel production differs significantly from that of medical isotopes, hence we and QLE have different business models and we believe that both companies would benefit if QLE is independently managed and financed. 
 In connection with the anticipated spin-out, in February 2024, we entered into a number of agreements with QLE, including a License Agreement, pursuant to which QLE has licensed from us the rights to technologies and methods used to separate Uranium 235 and Lithium 6 (including but not limited to the quantum enrichment and ASP technologies) in exchange for a perpetual royalty in the amount of 10 of all future QLE revenues, and an EPC Services Framework Agreement, pursuant to which we will provide services for the engineering, procurement and construction of one or more turnkey Uranium-235 and Lithium-6 enrichment facilities in locations to be identified by QLE and owned or leased by QLE, and commissioning, start-up and test services for each such facility, subject to the receipt of all applicable regulatory approvals, permits, licenses, authorizations, registrations, certificates, consents, orders, variances and similar rights. In addition, in February 2024, we assigned to QLE certain existing memoranda of understanding with U.S.-based small modular reactor companies for the use of Quantum Enrichment for the production of High-Assay Low Enriched Uranium (HALEU). The MOUs provide for substantial financial support for the development of HALEU production facilities that should be capable of supplying metric ton quantities of HALEU by 2027. 
 27 

High-Assay Low-Enriched Uranium (HALEU) Production 
 In October 2024, we entered into a term sheet with TerraPower, LLC related to the construction of a uranium enrichment facility capable of producing HALEU and the future supply of HALEU to TerraPower. The term sheet contemplates the parties entering into a definitive agreement, pursuant to which TerraPower would provide funding for the construction of a HALEU production facility. In addition, the parties anticipate entering into a long-term supply agreement for HALEU expected to be produced at this facility, pursuant to which the customer would purchase all HALEU produced at the facility over a 10-year period after the expected completion of the facility in 2027. It is anticipated that the definitive agreements will be assigned to QLE. Except for binding periods of exclusivity, during which we will not negotiate with third parties for the supply of HALEU or work on another ASP technology-based uranium enrichment facility, the term sheet is non-binding and there is no assurance that the parties will enter into definitive agreements. 
 In November 2024, we entered into a memorandum of understanding MOU with The South African Nuclear Energy Corporation (Necsa) to collaborate on the research, development and ultimately the commercial production of advanced nuclear fuels. Necsa is a state-owned company established by the Republic of South Africa Nuclear Energy Act in 1999 with a mandate to undertake and promote research and development in the field of nuclear energy and radiation sciences. Necsa is also responsible for processing source material, and co-operating with other institutions on nuclear and related matters. The proposed structure under discussion for the delivery of the objectives of the MOU contemplates the formation of a new entity in South Africa with a board of directors consisting of at least two representatives from the Company and Necsa. Discussions between the parties during the last three years have focused on advancing new nuclear fuel to cater especially for small modular reactors as a start and eventually the construction of a nuclear fuel facility for the production of HALEU. It is anticipated that the research, development and ultimate construction of a HALEU production facility will take place at Pelindaba in Pretoria, South Africa. Pelindaba is South Africa s main nuclear research center and is the home of the 20MW research nuclear reactor, SAFARI-1, which over the last several years has become one of the world s largest suppliers of Molybdenum-99 and other radioisotopes.

Klydon had the right to terminate the exclusivity of the Mo-100 license in the event that the licensee ceased carrying on activities of Mo-100 enrichment for a period longer than 24 consecutive months. Klydon had no other rights to terminate the Mo-100 license. Effective July 26, 2022, the parties agreed to terminate the Mo-100 license, which was superseded and replaced by a new license agreement (described under the heading Omnibus Klydon License below). 
 Exclusive U-235 License (superseded and replaced by new license (see Omnibus Klydon License below)). On January 25, 2022, ASP South Africa, as licensee, entered into a license with Klydon, as licensor, pursuant to which ASP South Africa acquired from Klydon an exclusive license to use, subcontract and sublicense certain intellectual property rights relating to the ASP technology for the development and/or otherwise disposing of the ASP technology and production, distribution, marketing and or sale of U-235 produced using the ASP (as so amended, the U-235 license ). The intellectual property rights granted to us through the U-235 license included all existing and/or future proprietary rights of Klydon relating to the ASP technology, whether or not such rights have been registered, including the copyright, designs, know-how, patents and trademarks (although Klydon currently has no such patents, patent applications or copyrights). The exclusive U-235 license had a term of 999 years and was for the global development of the ASP technology and production of U-235 and global for the distribution, marketing and sale of U-235. In connection with the U-235 license we made an upfront payment of 100,000 and agreed to pay certain royalties (the greater of 50 per k.g. of U-235 and 10 of profits) and a 33 sublicensing revenue share of any cash consideration we may receive for any sublicenses we may grant. Klydon had the right to terminate the exclusivity of the U-235 license in the event that the licensee ceased carrying on activities of U-235 enrichment for a period longer than 24 consecutive months. Klydon had no other rights to terminate the U-235 license. Effective July 26, 2022, the parties agreed to terminate the U-235 license, which was superseded and replaced by a new license agreement (described under the heading Omnibus Klydon License below). 
 Omnibus Klydon License. On July 26, 2022, ASP Isotopes UK Ltd ("ASP UK"), as licensee, entered into a license agreement with Klydon, as licensor, pursuant to which ASP UK acquired from Klydon an exclusive license to use, develop, modify, improve, subcontract and sublicense certain intellectual property rights relating to the ASP technology for the production, distribution, marketing and sale of all isotopes produced using the ASP technology (the Klydon license agreement ). The intellectual property rights granted to us through the Klydon license agreement included all existing and/or future proprietary rights of Klydon relating to the ASP technology, whether or not such rights have been registered, including the copyright, designs, know-how, patents and trademarks (although Klydon currently has no such patents, patent applications or copyrights). The Klydon license agreement was royalty-free, had a term of 999 years and was worldwide for the development of the ASP technology and the distribution, marketing and sale of isotopes. Future production of isotopes is limited to member countries of the Nuclear Suppliers Group. In connection with the Klydon license agreement, we agreed to make an upfront payment of 100,000 (to be included within the payments we made under the Turnkey Contract (described below) and deferred payments of 300,000 over 24 months. Effective April 4, 2023, pursuant to the Acknowledgement of Debt Agreement described below, we acquired the ASP technology, among other things, from Klydon, and the Klydon license agreement is no longer in effect. 
 Turnkey Contract. On November 1, 2021, ASP South Africa and Klydon, as the contractor, entered into a contract under which Klydon has been appointed to supply to ASP South Africa a complete turnkey isotope enrichment plant (the Turnkey Contract ). The activities to be undertaken or performed by Klydon include: taking control of the assets acquired in the Molybdos Business Rescue Auction; the design of an isotope enrichment facility; the supply of components, equipment and labor required for the construction; the installation, testing and commissioning of the isotope enrichment plant; securing all required approvals, regulatory authorizations and other required consents for the operation of the plant; providing training to local ASP Isotopes South Africa (Proprietary) Limited personnel to enable them to operate the plant going forward; and providing warranties in relation to the performance targets of the plant which are required to be met. Klydon was responsible for liaising with the relevant South African authorities, including the South African Non Proliferation Council, the Nuclear Suppliers Group and International Atomic Energy Agency to ensure that the Turnkey Contract and the isotope enrichment plant are compliant with international laws and guidelines. 
 Acknowledgement of Debt Agreement. Klydon performed a portion of the services required under the Turnkey Contract described above; however, services were incomplete and many of the services were not completed within the time frame required. As a result, Klydon and ASP South Africa entered into an Acknowledgement of Debt Agreement dated November 30, 2022, whereby Klydon (i) agreed to pledge its assets (the Pledged Assets to ASP South Africa to secure its performance of the Turnkey Contract by December 31, 2022, and (ii) acknowledged that ASP South Africa would suffer damages in the amount of 6,050,000 Damage Amount should it fail to perform. Under the Acknowledgement of Debt Agreement, the Pledged Assets would serve as collateral for Klydon s obligation to pay the Damage Amount should Klydon fail to perform. In connection therewith, also on November 30, 2022, ASP South Africa and Klydon entered into a Deed of Security Agreement whereby, if Klydon failed to complete its obligations under the Turnkey Contract by December 31, 2022, all of Klydon s rights of any nature to and interests of any nature in the Pledged Assets would be transferred to ASP South Africa. Klydon failed to complete its obligations under the Turnkey Contract by December 31, 2022. 
 29 

On April 4, 2023, we perfected our interests in the assets under the Acknowledgement of Debt Agreement, pursuant to which we acquired the Pledged Assets, including certain intellectual property, from Klydon and settled all amounts due to Klydon, including the ZAR 6,000,000 for the acquisition of the Silicon-28 plant assets. 
 Other Commercial Agreements 
 Below is a summary of the key terms of our other commercial agreements. 
 Lease for Molybdenum Processing Plant. On October 12, 2021, ASP South Africa entered into an agreement of lease with the landlord of the facility located at 33 Eland Street, Koedoespoort Industrial, Pretoria where we operate our Molybdenum processing plant where gaseous Molybdenum compound will be treated (which process comprises several stages of compression and expansion during which the product is purified). The term of the lease ends on December 31, 2030. 
 Lease for additional production space . On April 1, 2023, ASP South Africa entered into an agreement of lease with the landlord of facility located in Pretoria where we plan to perform production activities. The initial term of the lease was set to end on March 31, 2024. We entered into a new agreement of lease with the landlord. The terms of the new lease ends on February 28, 2026. 
 Lease for additional laboratory space. On November 1, 2023, ASP South Africa entered into an agreement of lease with the landlord of the facility located in Pretoria where we perform research and development activities. The term of the lease ends on October 30, 2026. 
 Lease for PET Labs operations . Commencing with our acquisition of PET Labs in October 2023, this facility has an initial term set to expire in March 2026 with automatic monthly extensions thereafter. This space is used for office and production activities. 
 Lease for additional PET Labs operations . Commencing with our acquisition of PET Labs in October 2023, this facility had an initial term which expired in December 2023 and is currently under automatic monthly extensions. This space is used for production activities. 
 Political Risk Insurance Policy with Optio Group. On October 25, 2021, ASP Guernsey entered into a contract of insurance to cover against political risk and expropriation, to off-set the risk of events detrimental to the company occurring in the Republic of South Africa for a period of three years. The insurer is Optio Group Limited which is 100 underwritten by one or more syndicates at Lloyd s of London. The specific risks covered in the policy are: (i) permanent and total abandonment of operations, (ii) deprivation of assets or shareholding, (iii) physical damage due to political violence, (iv) non-transfer or inconvertibility, (v) business interruption, (vi) non-honouring of arbitration award, and (vii) crisis management support. The limit of cover is equal to or in excess of the projected amount of investment required to complete the initial stage of the first planned Molybdenum enrichment plant. The limit of cover is capable of being increased and extended by mutual agreement with the insurer. 
 Components of Results of Operations 
 Revenue 
 Effective with the acquisition of 51 of PET Labs, the Company recognizes revenue from the sale of nuclear medical doses for PET scanning. 
 Cost of Goods Sold 
 Cost of goods sold associated with the sale of nuclear medical doses for PET scanning consist of labor, delivery and materials. 
 Operating Expenses 
 Our operating expenses consist of (i) research and development expenses and (ii) selling, general and administrative expenses. 
 Research and Development 
 Our research and development expenses consist primarily of direct and indirect costs incurred in connection with the development activities for our future isotopes. 
 Direct costs include: 
 external research and development expenses; and 

costs related to designing the development processes of isotope production. 

Indirect costs include: 
 personnel-related costs, which include salaries, payroll taxes, employee benefits, and other employee-related costs, including stock-based compensation expense, for personnel engaged in research and development functions; and 

facilities and other various expenses. 

Research and development expenses are recognized as incurred and payments made prior to the receipt of goods or services to be used in research and development are capitalized until the goods or services are received. 
 As described above, Klydon charged us for expenses associated with these research and development functions under the Turnkey Contract. We expect that our research and development expenses will increase substantially for the foreseeable future as we continue the development of our future isotopes. We cannot determine with certainty the timing of initiation, the duration or the completion costs of development activities. Actual development timelines, the probability of success and development costs can differ materially from expectations. 
 30 

We may need to raise substantial additional capital in the future. In addition, we cannot forecast which future isotopes may be subject to future collaborations, when such arrangements will be secured, if at all, and to what degree such arrangements would affect our development plans and capital requirements. 
 Our research and development expenses may vary significantly based on a variety of factors, such as: 
 the scope, rate of progress, expense and results of our development activities; 

the phase of development of our future isotopes; 

the timing, receipt, and terms of any approvals from applicable regulatory authorities including the FDA and foreign regulatory authorities; 

significant and changing government regulation and regulatory guidance; 

the cost and timing of designing the development processes of isotope production; 

the extent to which we establish additional strategic collaborations or other arrangements; and 

the impact of any business interruptions to our operations or to those of the third parties with whom we work. 

A change in the outcome of any of these variables with respect to the development of any of our future isotopes could significantly change the costs and timing associated with the development of that future isotope. 
 Selling, General and Administrative 
 Selling, general and administrative expenses consist primarily of personnel-related costs, which include salaries, payroll taxes, employee benefits, and other employee-related costs, including stock-based compensation expense, for personnel in executive, sales, finance and other administrative functions. Other significant costs include legal fees relating to corporate matters, professional fees for accounting and consulting services and facility-related costs. 
 We expect that our ongoing selling, general and administrative expenses will increase substantially for the foreseeable future to support our increased research and development activities and increased costs of operating as a public company and in building our internal resources. These increased costs will include increased expenses related to audit, legal, regulatory and tax-related services associated with maintaining compliance with exchange listing and SEC requirements, director and officer insurance premiums and investor and public relations costs associated with operating as a public company. 
 Segment Information 
 As of December 31, 2023, we managed our operations as a single segment, specialist isotopes and related services. Beginning in 2024, primarily as a result of the increased business activities of our subsidiary, Quantum Leap Energy LLC, we have two operating segments: (i) nuclear fuels, and (ii) specialist isotopes and related services. 
 The nuclear fuels segment is focused on research and development of technologies and methods used to produce high-assay low-enriched uranium (HALEU) and Lithium-6 for the advanced nuclear fuels target end market. 
 The specialist isotopes and related services segment is focused on research and development of technologies and methods used to separate high-value, low-volume isotopes (such as C-14, Mo-100 and Si-28) for highly specialized target end markets other than advanced nuclear fuels, including pharmaceuticals and agrochemicals, nuclear medical imaging and semiconductors, as well as services related to these isotopes, and this segment includes PET Labs. 
 The financial information is regularly reviewed by the chief operating decision maker CODM in deciding how to allocate resources. Our CODM is our chief executive officer. 
 We manage assets on a total company basis, not by operating segment, as the assets are shared or commingled. Therefore, the chief operating decision maker does not regularly review any asset information by operating segment and, accordingly, asset information is not reported on a segment basis.

Other expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 was 105,029, which includes a 109,040 change in the fair value of the share liability related to the shares issuable to a placement agent and other consultants. 
 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 Sources of Liquidity 
 We have incurred net losses and negative cash flows from operations since our inception, and we expect to continue to incur significant and increasing net losses for the foreseeable future. We have principally financed our operations to date through the issuance of our common stock, including our IPO, subsequent common stock offerings and the issuance of convertible notes payable. In July 2024, we issued 13,800,000 in a public offering at a public offering price of 2.50 per share resulting in net proceeds of approximately 32.3 million after deducting underwriting discounts, commissions and offering expenses. In November 2024, we issued an additional 2,754,250 shares of common stock in a public offering at a public offering price of 6.75 per share resulting in net proceeds of approximately 17.1 million after deducting underwriting discounts, commissions and offering expenses. 
 As of September 30, 2024, we had cash and cash equivalents of 51,571,540. We have not generated any revenue from the sale of our enriched isotopes, and our ability to generate product revenue from the sale of enriched isotopes sufficient to achieve profitability will depend on the successful development and eventual commercialization of one or more of our current or future enriched isotopes. 
 Effective with the acquisition of 51 of PET Labs Pharmaceuticals on October 31, 2023, we have begun to recognize revenue from the sale of nuclear medical doses for PET scanning in South Africa. Our ability to generate product revenue from the sale of nuclear medical doses for PET scanning sufficient to achieve profitability will depend on the successful expansion of production capabilities and commercialization of the results of that expansion. 
 Future Funding Requirements 
 Based on our current operating plan, we estimate that our existing cash and cash equivalents will be sufficient to fund our operating expenses and capital expenditure requirements through at least the next 12 months from the date the financial statements are issued. However, our forecast of the period of time through which our financial resources will be adequate to support our operations is a forward-looking statement that involves risks and uncertainties, and actual results could vary materially. We have based this estimate on assumptions that may prove to be wrong, and we could deplete our capital resources sooner than we expect. Additionally, the process of developing isotopes is costly, and the timing of progress and expenses in these development activities is uncertain. 
 Our future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including: 
 the type, number, scope, progress, expansions, results, costs and timing of, our development activities for our future isotopes; 

the outcome, timing and costs of regulatory review of our future isotopes; 

the costs and timing of manufacturing for our future isotopes; 

our efforts to enhance operational systems and hire additional personnel to satisfy our obligations as a public company, including enhanced internal controls over financial reporting; 

the costs associated with hiring additional personnel and consultants as our preclinical and clinical activities increase; 

the costs and timing of establishing or securing sales and marketing and distribution capabilities, whether alone or with third parties, to commercialize future isotopes for which we may obtain regulatory approval, if any; 

our ability to achieve sufficient market acceptance, coverage and adequate reimbursement from third-party payors and adequate market share and revenue for any approved products; 

the terms and timing of establishing and maintaining collaborations, licenses and other similar arrangements; 

the costs of obtaining, expanding, maintaining and enforcing our patent and other intellectual property rights; and 

costs associated with any products or technologies that we may in-license or acquire. 

Developing isotopes is a time-consuming, expensive and uncertain process that takes years to complete, and we may never achieve the necessary results required or obtain applicable regulatory approval for any isotopes or generate revenue from the sale of any future isotopes (assuming applicable regulatory approval is received). In addition, our future isotopes (assuming applicable regulatory approval is received) may not achieve commercial success. Our commercial revenues, if any, will be derived from sales of isotopes that we expect to be commercially available in substantial quantities in the last quarter of 2024. If we receive permits and licenses to enrich U-235 (which in itself is highly uncertain), we do not expect U-235 to be commercially available for at least several years, if ever. As a result, we may need substantial additional financing to support our continuing operations and further the development of and commercialization of our future isotopes. 
 Expansion of the production and distribution of nuclear medical doses for PET scanning is a time-consuming, expensive and uncertain process that may take years to complete. As a result, we may need substantial additional financing to support our continuing operations and further the development of and commercialization of future nuclear medical doses for PET scanning. 
 Until such time as we can generate significant revenue from sales of our future isotopes or nuclear medical doses for PET scanning, if ever, we expect to finance our cash needs through public or private equity or debt financings or other capital sources, including potential collaborations, licenses and other similar arrangements. However, we may be unable to raise additional funds or enter into such other arrangements when needed on favorable terms or at all. Our ability to raise additional funds may be adversely impacted by potential worsening global economic conditions and the recent disruptions to, and volatility in, the credit and financial markets in the United States and worldwide resulting severely diminished liquidity and credit availability, increased interest rates, inflationary pressures, declines in consumer confidence, declines in economic growth, increases in unemployment rates and uncertainty about economic stability. The financial markets and the global economy may also be adversely affected by the current or anticipated impact of military conflict. To the extent that we raise additional capital through the sale of equity or convertible debt securities, the ownership interest of our stockholders will be or could be diluted, and the terms of these securities may include liquidation or other preferences 
 34 

that adversely affect the rights of our common stockholders. Debt financing and equity financing, if available, may involve agreements that include covenants limiting or restricting our ability to take specific actions, such as incurring additional debt, making capital expenditures or declaring dividends. If we raise funds through collaborations, or other similar arrangements with third parties, we may have to relinquish valuable rights to our future isotopes, future revenue streams or research programs or may have to grant licenses on terms that may not be favorable to us and/or may reduce the value of our common stock. If we are unable to raise additional funds through equity or debt financings when needed, we may be required to delay, limit, reduce or terminate our product development or future commercialization efforts or grant rights to develop and market our future isotopes even if we would otherwise prefer to develop and market such isotopes ourselves.

Item 3. Q uantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk. 
 We are a smaller reporting company as defined by Item 10 of Regulation S-K and are not required to provide the information otherwise required under this item. 
 Item 4. Contr ols and Procedures. 
 Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 Our management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of March 31, 2024. The term disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act, mean controls and other procedures of a company that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms. Disclosure controls include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company on the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to management, including our principal executive and principal financial officers, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 
 Management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives, and management necessarily applies its judgement in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures. Based on the evaluation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of September 30, 2024, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that, as a result of a material weakness identified in our internal control over financial reporting, as previously disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K (as amended) for the year ended December 31, 2023, our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of September 30, 2024. In order to remediate the material weakness, management expects to hire additional accounting and finance resources or consultants with public company experience. 
 Changes in Internal Control 
 There has been no change in our internal control over financial reporting as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act during our most recently completed fiscal quarter that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. Effective July 1, 2024, we hired a new Chief Financial Officer in order to address the internal control environment.

PART II-O THER INFORMATION 
 Item 1. Le gal Proceedings. 
 From time to time, we may be a party to litigation or subject to claims incident to the ordinary course of business. Although the results of litigation and claims cannot be predicted with certainty, we currently believe that the final outcome of these ordinary course matters will not have a material adverse effect on our business. Regardless of the outcome, litigation can have an adverse impact on us because of defense and settlement costs, diversion of management resources and other factors. We are not currently a party to any material legal proceedings. 
 Item 1A. Risk Factors. 
 In addition to the other information set forth in this Form 10-Q, including under the heading Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements, the risks and uncertainties which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and future growth prospects that we believe are most important for you to consider are discussed in Part II, Item 1A Risk Factors of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, filed with the SEC on April 10, 2024 and as amended by Forms 10-K/A filed with the SEC on April 29, 2024 and July 1, 2024. The risks described in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 (as amended) are not the only risks we face. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we presently deem less significant may also impair our business operations. There are no material changes to the Risk Factors described in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 (as amended).
