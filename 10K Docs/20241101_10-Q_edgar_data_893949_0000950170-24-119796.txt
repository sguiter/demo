Allowance for contractual adjustments and uncollectibles 

() 

() 

Patient service revenue is recognized at the time services are provided by the Company s affiliated physicians. The Company s performance obligations related to the delivery of services to patients are satisfied at the time of service. Accordingly, there are no performance obligations that are unsatisfied or partially unsatisfied at the end of the reporting period with respect to patient service revenue. Almost all of the Company s patient service revenue is reimbursed by government-sponsored healthcare programs GHC Programs and third-party insurance payors. Payments for services rendered to the Company s patients are generally less than billed charges. The Company monitors its revenue and receivables from these sources and records an estimated contractual allowance to properly account for the anticipated differences between billed and reimbursed amounts. Accordingly, patient service revenue is presented net of an estimated provision for contractual adjustments and uncollectibles. The Company estimates allowances for contractual adjustments and uncollectibles on accounts receivable based upon historical experience and other factors, including days sales outstanding DSO for accounts receivable, evaluation of expected adjustments and delinquency rates, past adjustments and collection experience in relation to amounts billed, an aging of accounts receivable, current contract and reimbursement terms, changes in payor mix and other relevant information. Contractual adjustments result from the difference between the physician rates for services performed and the reimbursements by GHC Programs and third-party insurance payors for such services. Collection of patient service revenue the Company expects to receive is normally a function of providing complete and correct billing information to the GHC Programs and third-party insurance payors within the various filing deadlines and typically occurs within 30 to 60 days of billing. Some of the Company s hospital agreements require hospitals to pay the Company administrative fees. Some agreements provide for fees if the hospital does not generate sufficient patient volume in order to guarantee that the Company receives a specified minimum revenue level. The Company also receives fees from hospitals for administrative services performed by its affiliated physicians providing medical director or other services at the hospital.

maternal-fetal medicine practice for total consideration of million, of which million was paid in cash at closing and million was recorded as a contingent consideration liability. The acquisition expanded the Company s national network of physician practices across women s and children s services. In connection with this acquisition, the Company recorded tax deductible goodwill of million, fixed assets of million and other intangible assets consisting primarily of physician and hospital agreements of million. 

million, intangible asset impairments of million and operating lease right-of-use asset impairments of million. The operating lease right-of-use impairments are recorded within the transformational and restructuring related expenses line item. During the second quarter of 2024, the Company made the decision to exit its primary and urgent care service line based on a review of the cost and time that would be required to build the platform to scale. The Company divested one of its two previously acquired primary and urgent care practices during the second quarter and divested the second practice during the third quarter. The total loss on disposal of these two businesses was million. During the second quarter of 2024, the Company experienced a triggering event, due to a sustained decline in its stock price and a market capitalization below the Company's book equity value. As the Company consists of only one reporting unit, and is publicly traded, management estimates the fair value of its reporting unit utilizing the Company s market capitalization, multiplying the number of actual shares of common stock outstanding on June 30, 2024 by its stock price on June 30, 2024 and applying an additional premium to give effect to the Company s best estimate of a control premium. With respect to the estimated control premium used in its analysis, the Company believes that it is reasonable to expect that a market participant would pay a premium to obtain a controlling interest in the Company. The Company considered information from the public markets for premiums on acquisitions in its industry and also considered other factors, such as the value that may arise from the ability to take advantage of synergies and other benefits that flow from control over another entity. This assessment resulted in a non-cash impairment charge of million, representing the amount by which the Company's book value exceeded its implied fair value, based on its market capitalization plus an estimated control premium. Consideration was first given to other individual and group long-lived assets, and no impairment was considered necessary on such assets. Recognition of this non-cash charge against goodwill resulted in a tax benefit which generated an additional deferred tax asset of million that increased the Company's book value. An incremental non-cash charge was required to reduce the Company's book value to its previously determined fair value. Accordingly, the Company recorded the incremental non-cash charge of million for a total non-cash charge of million. A change in the control premium used would have impacted the non-cash impairment charge by approximately million.

The net decrease in accrued salaries and incentive compensation of million, from December 31, 2023 to September 30, 2024, is primarily due to the payment of performance-based incentive compensation, principally to the Company s affiliated physicians, partially offset by performance-based incentive compensation accrued during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 . A majority of the Company s payments for performance-based incentive compensation is paid annually during the first quarter. 

million of unsecured senior notes due 2030 (the 2030 Notes ). The Company used the net proceeds from the issuance of the Notes, together with million drawn under the Revolving Credit Line (as defined below), million of Term A Loan (as defined below) and approximately million of cash on hand, to redeem (the Redemption the senior unsecured notes due 2027 (the "2027 Notes"), which had an outstanding principal balance of billion, and to pay costs, fees and expenses associated with the Redemption and the Credit Agreement Amendment (as defined below). Interest on the 2030 Notes accrues at the rate of per annum, or million, and is . The Company's obligations under the 2030 . Although the Company is not required to make mandatory redemption or sinking fund payments with respect to the 2030 Notes, upon the occurrence of a change in control, the Company may be required to repurchase the 2030 Notes at a purchase price equal to of the aggregate principal amount of the 2030 Notes repurchased plus accrued and unpaid interest. Also in connection with the Redemption, the Company amended its credit agreement (the Credit Agreement , and such amendment, the "Credit Agreement Amendment"), concurrently with the issuance of the 2030 Notes. The Credit Agreement Amendment, among other things, (i) refinanced the prior unsecured revolving credit facility with a million unsecured revolving credit facility, including a million sub-facility for the issuance of letters of credit (the Revolving Credit Line ), and a million term A loan facility Term A Loan and (ii) removed JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as the administrative agent under the Credit Agreement and appointed Bank of America, N.A. as the administrative agent for the lenders. The Credit Agreement, as amended by the Credit Agreement Amendment (the Amended Credit Agreement matures on February 11, 2027 and is guaranteed on an unsecured basis by substantially all of the Company's subsidiaries and affiliated professional contractors. At the Company's option, borrowings under the Amended Credit Agreement bear interest at , based on the Company's consolidated net leverage ratio. The Amended Credit Agreement contains customary covenants and restrictions, including covenants that require the Company to maintain a minimum interest coverage ratio, a maximum consolidated net leverage ratio and to comply with laws, and restrictions on the ability to pay dividends, incur indebtedness or liens and make certain other distributions subject to baskets and exceptions, in each case, as specified therein. Failure to comply with these covenants would constitute an event of default under the Amended Credit Agreement, notwithstanding the ability of the Company to meet its debt service obligations. The Amended Credit Agreement includes various customary remedies for the lenders following an event of default, including the acceleration of repayment of outstanding amounts under the Amended Credit Agreement. In addition, the Company may increase the principal amount of the Revolving Credit Line or incur additional term loans under the Amended Credit Agreement in an aggregate principal amount such that on a pro forma basis after

The Company recognizes compensation expense related to its restricted stock and deferred stock awards ratably over the corresponding vesting periods. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024 , the Company granted million shares of restricted stock to its employees and non-employee directors under the Amended and Restated 2008 Incentive Plan.

Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 
 
 The following discussion highlights the principal factors that have affected our financial condition and results of operations, as well as our liquidity and capital resources, for the periods described. This discussion should be read in conjunction with the unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements and the notes thereto included in this Quarterly Report. In addition, reference is made to our audited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto and related Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023, filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on February 20, 2024 (the 2023 Form 10-K ). As used in this Quarterly Report, the terms Pediatrix , the Company , we , us and our refer to the parent company, Pediatrix Medical Group, Inc., a Florida corporation, and the consolidated subsidiaries through which its businesses are actually conducted (collectively, PMG ), together with PMG s affiliated business corporations or professional associations, professional corporations, limited liability companies and partnerships affiliated professional contractors ). Certain subsidiaries of PMG have contracts with our affiliated professional contractors, which are separate legal entities that provide physician services in certain states. The following discussion contains forward-looking statements. Please see the Company s 2023 Form 10-K, including Item 1A, Risk Factors, for a discussion of the uncertainties, risks and assumptions associated with these forward-looking statements. In addition, please see Caution Concerning Forward-Looking Statements below. 
 
 Overview 
 
 Pediatrix is a leading provider of physician services including newborn, maternal-fetal, and other pediatric subspecialty care. Our national network is comprised of affiliated physicians who provide clinical care in 37 states. Our affiliated physicians provide neonatal clinical care, primarily within hospital-based neonatal intensive care units NICUs ), to babies born prematurely or with medical complications; and maternal-fetal and obstetrical medical care to expectant mothers experiencing complicated pregnancies, primarily in areas where our affiliated neonatal physicians practice. We also provide services across multiple other pediatric subspecialties. 
 
 General Economic Conditions and Other Factors 
 
 Our operations and performance depend significantly on economic conditions. During the three months ended September 30, 2024, the percentage of our patient service revenue being reimbursed under government-sponsored healthcare programs GHC Programs decreased as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. However, we could experience shifts toward GHC Programs if changes occur in economic behaviors or population demographics within geographic locations in which we provide services, including an increase in unemployment and underemployment as well as losses of commercial health insurance. Payments received from GHC Programs are substantially less for equivalent services than payments received from commercial insurance payors. In addition, costs of managed care premiums and patient responsibility amounts continue to rise, and accordingly, we may experience lower net revenue resulting from increased bad debt due to patients inability to pay for certain services. 
 
 Practice Portfolio Management Plan and Impairment of Long-Lived Assets 
 
 During the second quarter of 2024, we formalized our physician practice optimization plans, resulting in a decision to exit almost all of our affiliated office-based practices, other than maternal-fetal medicine. Over the course of many years, we expanded our pediatric service lines and footprint to provide specialized care to more patients, including through our office-based portfolio of practices. This added complexity to our operations over time and, accordingly, increased costs that resulted in operating challenges primarily for our office-based portfolio of practices. Recognizing this and our need to adapt to the current healthcare climate, during the second quarter, we made the decision to return to a hospital-based and maternal-fetal medicine-focused organization. The exits of our pediatric office-based practices are expected to be completed by December 31, 2024. Accordingly, a recoverability assessment for each impacted individual physician practice was performed, and the estimated future cash flows related to the physician practices did not support the carrying value of the specifically identified individual long-lived assets. As a result, during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we recorded fixed asset impairments of 20.1 million, intangible asset impairments of 7.7 million and operating lease right-of-use asset impairments of 10.6 million. The operating lease right-of-use impairments are recorded within the transformational and restructuring related expenses line item.

 During the second quarter of 2024, we made the decision to exit our primary and urgent care service line based on a review of the cost and time that would be required to build the platform to scale. We divested one of our two previously acquired primary and urgent care practices during the second quarter and divested the second practice in the third quarter. The total loss on disposal of these two businesses was 10.6 million. 
 
 Goodwill Impairment 
 
 Goodwill is tested for impairment on at least an annual basis, in accordance with the subsequent measurement provisions of the accounting guidance for goodwill. During the second quarter of 2024, we experienced a triggering event resulting from a sustained decline in our stock price that resulted in our market capitalization being lower than the book value of our equity. This impairment assessment resulted in a non-cash impairment charge of 130.0 million. Recognition of this non-cash charge against goodwill resulted in a tax benefit which generated an additional deferred tax asset of 24.2 million that increased the book value of our equity. An incremental non-cash charge was required to reduce the book value of our equity to our previously determined fair value. Accordingly, we recorded the incremental non-cash charge of 24.2 million for a total non-cash charge of 154.2 million. 
 Surprise Billing Legislation 	 
 13 

In late 2020, Congress enacted the No Surprises Act NSA legislation intended to protect patients from surprise medical bills when certain services are furnished by providers who are not in-network with the patient s insurer. Effective January 1, 2022, if the patient s insurance plan or coverage is subject to the NSA, providers are not permitted to send patients an unexpected or surprise medical bill that arises from out-of-network emergency care provided at certain out-of-network facilities or at certain in-network facilities by out-of-network emergency providers, as well as nonemergency care provided at certain in-network facilities by out-of-network providers without the patient s informed consent (as defined by the NSA). Many states have legislation on this topic and will continue to modify and review their laws pertaining to surprise billing. 
 
 For claims subject to the NSA, insurers are required to calculate the patient s total cost-sharing amount pursuant to rules set forth in the NSA and its implementing regulations which, in some cases, can be calculated by reference to the applicable qualifying payment amount for the items or services received. The patient s cost-sharing amount for out-of-network services covered by the NSA must be no more than the patient s in-network cost-sharing amounts. Patient cost-sharing amounts for items and services subject to the NSA count toward the patient s health plan deductible and out-of-pocket cost-sharing limits. For claims subject to the NSA, providers are generally not permitted to balance bill patients beyond this cost-sharing amount. An out-of-network provider is only permitted to bill a patient more than the cost-sharing amount allowed under the NSA for certain types of services if the provider satisfies all aspects of an informed consent process set forth in the NSA s implementing regulations. Providers that violate these surprise billing prohibitions may be subject to state enforcement action or federal civil monetary penalties. 
 
 For claims subject to the NSA, including many emergency care services, out-of-network providers will be paid an amount determined by the patient s insurer; if a provider is not satisfied with the initial amount paid for the services, the provider can pursue recourse through an independent dispute resolution process. The outcome of each IDR dispute is generally binding on both the provider and payor with respect to the particular claims at issue in that dispute but may not affect an insurer s future offers of payment. Accordingly, we cannot predict how these IDR results will compare to the rates that our affiliated physicians customarily receive for their services. These measures could limit the amount we can charge and recover for services we furnish where we have not contracted with the patient s insurer, and therefore could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and the trading price of our securities. 
 
 Healthcare Reform 
 
 The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act (collectively the ACA has altered how health care is delivered and reimbursed in the U.S. and contain various provisions, including the establishment of health insurance exchanges to facilitate the purchase of qualified health plans, expanded Medicaid eligibility, subsidized insurance premiums and additional requirements and incentives for businesses to provide healthcare benefits. Other provisions have expanded the scope and reach of the FCA and other healthcare fraud and abuse laws. The status of the ACA may be subject to change as a result of political, legislative, regulatory, and administrative developments, as well as judicial proceedings. As a result, we could be affected by potential changes to various aspects of the ACA, including changes to subsidies, healthcare insurance marketplaces and Medicaid expansion. We cannot say for certain whether there will be additional future challenges to the ACA or what impact, if any, such challenges may have on our business. Changes resulting from various legal proceedings, and any legislative or administrative change to the current healthcare financing system, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and the trading price of our securities. 
 
 In addition to the ACA, there could be changes to other GHC Programs, such as a change to the Medicaid program design or Medicaid coverage and reimbursement rates set forth under federal or state law. These changes, if implemented, could eliminate the guarantee that everyone who is eligible and applies for Medicaid benefits would receive them and could potentially give states new authority to restrict eligibility, cut benefits and/or make it more difficult for people to enroll. Moreover, the expiration of the COVID-19 national emergency and public health emergency declarations in May 2023 may impact the coverage for and access to certain services for Medicaid patients. Expiration of the national emergency and public health emergency declarations will also end waivers for the provision of certain services, and returning our services to a pre-pandemic regulatory state similarly may increase our exposure to legal, regulatory, compliance and clinical risks. 
 
 Medicaid Expansion 
 
 The ACA also allows states to expand their Medicaid programs through federal payments that fund most of the cost of increasing the Medicaid eligibility income limit from a state s historic eligibility levels to 133 of the federal poverty level. All of the states in which we operate, however, already cover children in the first year of life and pregnant women if their household income is at or below 133 of the federal poverty level. Recently, Democrats in Congress have sought to expand Medicaid or Medicaid-like coverage in states that have not yet expanded Medicaid. They also have sought to reduce payments to certain hospitals in some of these states. Should any of these changes take effect, we cannot predict with any assurance the ultimate effect on reimbursements for our services. 
 
 Non-GAAP Measures 
 
 In our analysis of our results of operations, we use various GAAP and certain non-GAAP financial measures. We have incurred certain expenses that we do not consider representative of our underlying operations, including transformational and restructuring related expenses. Accordingly, we report adjusted earnings before interest, taxes and depreciation and amortization Adjusted EBITDA ), defined as net income (loss) before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, and transformational and restructuring related expenses. Earnings per share has also been adjusted Adjusted EPS and consists of diluted net income (loss) per common and common equivalent share adjusted for amortization expense, stock-based compensation expense, transformational and restructuring related expenses and impacts from discrete tax events. For the three months ended September 30, 2024, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EPS are being further adjusted to exclude loss 
 14 

on disposal of businesses and tax effects of goodwill impairment. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, both Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EPS are being further adjusted to exclude loss on disposal of businesses and impairment losses. 
 
 We believe these measures, in addition to income from operations, net income and diluted net income per common and common equivalent share, provide investors with useful supplemental information to compare and understand our underlying business trends and performance across reporting periods on a consistent basis. These measures should be considered a supplement to, and not a substitute for, financial performance measures determined in accordance with GAAP. In addition, since these non-GAAP measures are not determined in accordance with GAAP, they are susceptible to varying calculations and may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies. We encourage investors to review our financial statements and publicly-filed reports in their entirety and not to rely on any single financial measure. 
 
 For a reconciliation of each of Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EPS to the most directly comparable GAAP measures for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, refer to the tables below (in thousands, except per share data).

Results of Operations 
 
 Three Months Ended September 30, 2024 as Compared to Three Months Ended September 30, 2023 
 
 Our net revenue was 511.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to 506.6 million for the same period in 2023. The increase in net revenue of 4.6 million, or 0.9 , was primarily attributable to an increase in same-unit revenue, partially offset by a decrease in revenue from non-same unit activity, primarily resulting from practice dispositions. Same units are those units at which we provided services for the entire current period and the entire comparable period. Same-unit net revenue increased by 24.6 million, or 5.2 . The increase in same-unit revenue was comprised of an increase of 15.9 million, or 3.4 , from net reimbursement-related factors and 8.7 million, or 1.8 , related to patient service volumes. The net increase in revenue related to net reimbursement-related factors was primarily due to an increase in revenue resulting from a favorable shift in payor mix and an increase in administrative fees from our hospital partners. The increase in revenue from patient service volumes was related to increases across all of our service lines. 
 
 Practice salaries and benefits decreased 3.5 million, or 1.0 , to 364.9 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to 368.4 million for the same period in 2023. The 3.5 million decrease was primarily attributable to non-same unit activity, primarily resulting from practice dispositions, partially offset by an increase in clinical compensation expense, including benefits and incentive compensation, all at our existing units. 
 
 Practice supplies and other operating expenses decreased 1.9 million, or 6.0 , to 29.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to 31.3 million for the same period in 2023. The decrease was primarily attributable to non-same unit activity, primarily resulting from practice dispositions, partially offset by a net increase in practice supply and other costs related to our existing units, with increases in professional services, travel and medical supply costs partially offset by a decrease in insurance expense. 
 
 General and administrative expenses primarily include all billing and collection functions and all other salaries, benefits, supplies and operating expenses not specifically related to the day-to-day operations of our affiliated physician practices and services. General and administrative expenses were 58.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to 57.4 million for the same period in 2023. The net increase of 0.7 million was primarily related to increases in incentive compensation based on financial results and salary expense for enhancement of revenue cycle management staffing, partially offset by decreases in overall staffing levels. General and administrative expenses as a percentage of net revenue was 11.4 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to 11.3 for the same period in 2023. 
 
 Depreciation and amortization expense was 6.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to 9.2 million for the same period in 2023. The decrease of 2.9 million was primarily related to a decrease in depreciation expense related to non-same unit activity, primarily practice dispositions. 
 
 Transformational and restructuring related expenses were 18.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and primarily related to revenue cycle management transition activities, position eliminations across various shared services and operations departments and impairment of various right-of-use lease assets resulting from practice dispositions. 
 
 Loss on disposal of businesses was 0.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024. 
 
 Income from operations was 33.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to 40.3 million for the same period in 2023. Our operating margin was 6.6 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to 7.9 for the same period in 2023. The decrease in our operating margin was primarily due to transformational and restructuring related activity, partially offset by net favorable impacts from our same-unit results driven by higher revenue and from non-same unit activity due to practice dispositions. Excluding transformational and restructuring related expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2024, our income from operations was 52.4 million and our operating margin was 10.3 for such period. We believe excluding the impacts from transformational and restructuring related activity provides a more comparable view of our operating income and operating margin. 
 
 Total non-operating expenses were 8.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to 9.4 million for the same period in 2023. The net decrease in non-operating expenses was primarily related to an increase in investment income on higher cash balances. 
 
 Our effective income tax rate tax rate was 23.0 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to 30.6 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The tax rates for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 include net discrete tax expense of 6.5 million and 1.1 million, respectively. Net discrete tax expense for the three months ended September 30, 2024 primarily relates to a reduction in the carrying value of deferred tax assets due to practice portfolio management activities. After excluding discrete tax impacts, during the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, our tax rate was (2.6) and 27.0 , respectively. We believe excluding discrete tax impacts provides a more comparable view of our tax rate. The decrease in our tax rate from 27.0 to (2.6) for the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the prior year period primarily relates to the tax effects of the non-cash goodwill impairment charge. 
 
 Net income was 19.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to 21.4 million for the same period in 2023. Adjusted EBITDA was 60.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to 50.4 million for the same period in 2023. The increase in our Adjusted EBITDA was primarily due to net favorable impacts from our same-unit results and practice disposition activity. 
 
 16 

Diluted net income per common and common equivalent share was 0.23 on weighted average shares outstanding of 84.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to 0.26 on weighted average shares outstanding of 83.0 million for the same period in 2023. Adjusted EPS was 0.44 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to 0.32 for the same period in 2023. 
 
 Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 as Compared to Nine Months Ended September 30, 2023 
 
 Our net revenue was 1.51 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to 1.50 billion for the same period in 2023. The increase in revenue of 12.4 million, or 0.8 , was primarily attributable to increases in same-unit revenue, partially offset by a decrease in revenue from non-same unit activity, primarily resulting from practice dispositions. Same units are those units at which we provided services for the entire current period and the entire comparable period. Same-unit net revenue increased by 51.5 million, or 3.7 . The increase in same-unit net revenue was comprised of an increase of 29.1 million, or 2.1 , from net reimbursement-related factors and an increase of 22.4 million, or 1.6 , related to patient service volumes. The net increase in revenue related to net reimbursement-related factors was primarily due to an increase in revenue resulting from a favorable shift in payor mix and an increase in administrative fees from our hospital partners. The increase in revenue from patient service volumes was related to increases across all of our service lines. 
 
 Practice salaries and benefits increased 7.2 million, or 0.7 , to 1.09 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to 1.08 billion for the same period in 2023. The 7.2 million increase was primarily attributable to an increase in clinical compensation expense and benefits at our existing units, partially offset by decreases in non-same unit activity, primarily practice dispositions. 
 
 Practice supplies and other operating expenses decreased 0.2 million, or 0.2 , to 92.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to 93.1 million for the same period in 2023. The decrease was primarily attributable to non-same unit activity, primarily practice dispositions, partially offset by a net increase in practice supply and other expenses. The net increase at our existing units was driven by increases in professional services, rent and travel expenses, partially offset by a decrease in insurance expense. 
 
 General and administrative expenses primarily include all billing and collection functions and all other salaries, benefits, supplies and operating expenses not specifically identifiable to the day-to-day operations of our physician practices and services. General and administrative expenses were 174.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to 174.5 million for the same period in 2023. The net increase of 0.4 million is primarily related to increases in salary expense for enhancement of revenue cycle management staffing and incentive compensation based on financial results, partially offset by lower expenses from net staffing reductions, professional services fees, travel expenses, and information technology expenses. General and administrative expenses as a percentage of net revenue were 11.6 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. 
 
 Depreciation and amortization expense was 25.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to 27.1 million for the same period in 2023. The decrease of 1.7 million was primarily related to lower depreciation resulting from fixed asset impairments recognized in the second quarter of 2024. 
 
 Transformational and restructuring related expenses were 40.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and primarily related to the impairment of various right-of-use lease assets resulting from our practice portfolio management activities, position eliminations across various shared services and operations departments and revenue cycle management transition activities. 
 
 Goodwill impairment was 154.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, resulting from the triggering event during the second quarter based on a sustained stock price decline. 
 
 Fixed assets impairments were 20.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, resulting from the practice portfolio management activities. 
 
 Intangible assets impairments were 7.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, resulting from the practice portfolio management activities. 
 
 Loss on disposal of businesses was 10.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, resulting from the disposals of the primary and urgent care practices. 
 
 Loss from operations was 108.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to income from operations of 118.8 million for the same period in 2023. Our operating margin was (7.1) for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to 7.9 for the same period in 2023. The decrease in our operating margin was primarily due to the impairment activity recorded during the second quarter and transformational and restructuring related activity, partially offset by net favorable impacts from non-same unit activity. Excluding impairment activity and transformational and restructuring related expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, our income from operations was 125.5 million and our operating margin was 8.3 for such period. We believe excluding the impacts from the impairment and transformational and restructuring related activity provides a more comparable view of our operating income and operating margin. 
 
 Total non-operating expenses were 26.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to 28.3 million for the same period in 2023. The net decrease in non-operating expenses was primarily related to an increase in investment income and lower interest expense due to lower debt balances. 
 
 Our tax rate was 3.8 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 29.4 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The tax rates for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 include net discrete tax expense of 8.5 million and 2.0 million, 
 17 

respectively. After excluding discrete tax impacts, during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, our tax rate was 10.1 and 27.2 , respectively. We believe excluding discrete tax impacts on our tax rate provides a more comparable view of our effective income tax rate. The decrease in our tax rate from 27.2 to 10.1 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the prior year period primarily relates to the effects of the non-cash goodwill impairment charge. 
 
 Net loss was 129.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to net income of 63.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Adjusted EBITDA was 155.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to 149.6 million for the same period in 2023. The increase in our Adjusted EBITDA was primarily due to net favorable impacts in our same-unit results, primarily from an increase in revenue. 
 
 Diluted net loss per common and common equivalent share was 1.56 on weighted average shares outstanding of 83.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to diluted net income per common and common equivalent share of 0.77 on weighted average shares outstanding of 82.5 million for the same period in 2023. Adjusted EPS was 0.99 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to 0.94 for the same period in 2023. 
 
 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 
 As of September 30, 2024, we had 103.8 million of cash and cash equivalents as compared to 73.3 million at December 31, 2023. Additionally, we had working capital of 155.1 million at September 30, 2024, an increase of 60.6 million from working capital of 94.5 million at December 31, 2023. The increase in working capital is primarily due to net favorable impacts in our same-unit results, primarily from an increase in revenue. 
 
 Cash Flows from Continuing Operations 
 
 Cash provided by (used in) operating, investing and financing activities is summarized as follows (in thousands): 

Nine Months Ended September 30,

(20,968) 

Operating Activities 
 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, our net cash provided by operating activities for continuing operations was 82.4 million, compared to 73.1 million for the same period in 2023. The net increase in cash provided of 9.3 million was primarily due to increases in cash flow from accounts payable and accrued expenses, partially offset by decreases in cash flow from accounts receivable. 
 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, cash inflow from accounts receivable was 0.6 million, as compared to 22.1 million for the same period in 2023. The decrease in cash flow from accounts receivable for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the prior year period was primarily due to the prior year period reflecting a significant improvement in cash collections. 
 
 DSO is one of the key factors that we use to evaluate the condition of our accounts receivable and the related allowances for contractual adjustments and uncollectibles. DSO reflects the timeliness of cash collections on billed revenue and the level of reserves on outstanding accounts receivable. Our DSO for continuing operations was 51.6 days at September 30, 2024 as compared to 50.5 days at December 31, 2023 and 50.4 days at September 30, 2023. The change in our DSO was primarily related to revenue cycle management transition activity. 
 
 Investing Activities 
 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, our net cash used in investing activities of 33.5 million consisted primarily of capital expenditures of 18.6 million, net purchases of investments of 9.1 million and acquisition payments of 8.2 million. 
 
 Financing Activities 
 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, our net cash used in financing activities of 9.5 million primarily consisted of payments on our Term A Loan (as defined below). 
 
 Liquidity 
 
 On February 11, 2022, we issued 400.0 million of 5.375 unsecured senior notes due 2030 (the 2030 Notes ). We used the net proceeds from the issuance of the 2030 Notes, together with 100.0 million drawn under our Revolving Credit Line (as defined below), 250.0 million of Term A Loan and approximately 308.0 million of cash on hand, to redeem (the Redemption the 2027 Notes, which had an outstanding principal balance of 1.0 billion, and to pay costs, fees and expenses associated with the Redemption and the Credit Agreement Amendment (as defined below).

Also in connection with the Redemption, we amended and restated the Credit Agreement (the "Credit Agreement"), and such amendment and restatement (the Credit Agreement Amendment ), concurrently with the issuance of the 2030 Notes. The Credit Agreement, as amended by the Credit Agreement Amendment (the Amended Credit Agreement ), among other things, (i) refinanced the prior unsecured revolving credit facility with a 450.0 million unsecured revolving credit facility, including a 37.5 million sub-facility for the issuance of letters of credit (the Revolving Credit Line ), and a new 250.0 million term A loan facility Term A Loan and (ii) removed JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as the administrative agent under the Credit Agreement and appointed Bank of America, N.A. as the administrative agent for the lenders under the Amended Credit Agreement. 
 
 The Amended Credit Agreement matures on February 11, 2027 and is guaranteed on an unsecured basis by substantially all of our subsidiaries and affiliated professional contractors. At our option, borrowings under the Amended Credit Agreement bear interest at (i) the Alternate Base Rate (defined as the highest of (a) the prime rate as announced by Bank of America, N.A., (b) the Federal Funds Rate plus 0.50 and (c) Term Secured Overnight Financing Rate ("SOFR") for an interest period of one month plus 1.00 with a 1.00 floor) plus an applicable margin rate of 0.50 for the first two fiscal quarters after the date of the Credit Agreement Amendment, and thereafter at an applicable margin rate ranging from 0.125 to 0.750 based on our consolidated net leverage ratio or (ii) Term SOFR rate (calculated as the Secured Overnight Financing Rate published on the applicable Reuters screen page plus a spread adjustment of 0.10 , 0.15 or 0.25 depending on if we select a one-month, three-month or six-month interest period, respectively, for the applicable loan with a 0 floor), plus an applicable margin rate of 1.50 for the first two full fiscal quarters after the date of the Credit Agreement Amendment, and thereafter at an applicable margin rate ranging from 1.125 to 1.750 based on our consolidated net leverage ratio. The Amended Credit Agreement also provides for other customary fees and charges, including an unused commitment fee with respect to the Revolving Credit Line ranging from 0.150 to 0.200 of the unused lending commitments under the Revolving Credit Line, based on our consolidated net leverage ratio. 
 
 The Amended Credit Agreement contains customary covenants and restrictions, including covenants that require us to maintain a minimum interest coverage ratio, a maximum consolidated net leverage ratio and to comply with laws, and restrictions on the ability to pay dividends, incur indebtedness or liens and make certain other distributions subject to baskets and exceptions, in each case, as specified therein. Failure to comply with these covenants would constitute an event of default under the Amended Credit Agreement, notwithstanding the ability of the company to meet its debt service obligations. The Amended Credit Agreement includes various customary remedies for the lenders following an event of default, including the acceleration of repayment of outstanding amounts under the Amended Credit Agreement. In addition, we may increase the principal amount of the Revolving Credit Line or incur additional term loans under the Amended Credit Agreement in an aggregate principal amount such that on a pro forma basis after giving effect to such increase or additional term loans, we are in compliance with the financial covenants, subject to the satisfaction of specified conditions and additional caps in the event that the Amended Credit Agreement is secured. 
 
 At September 30, 2024, we had an outstanding principal balance on the Amended Credit Agreement of 218.8 million, composed of the Term A Loan. There was no balance outstanding under the Revolving Credit Line. We had 450.0 million available on our Amended Credit Agreement at September 30, 2024. 
 
 At September 30, 2024, we had an outstanding principal balance of 400.0 million on the 2030 Notes. Our obligations under the 2030 Notes are guaranteed on an unsecured senior basis by the same subsidiaries and affiliated professional contractors that guarantee our Amended Credit Agreement. Interest on the 2030 Notes accrues at the rate of 5.375 per annum, or 21.5 million, and is payable semi-annually in arrears on February 15 and August 15, beginning on August 15, 2022. 
 
 The indenture under which the 2030 Notes are issued, among other things, limits our ability to (1) incur liens and (2) enter into sale and lease-back transactions, and also limits our ability to merge or dispose of all or substantially all of our assets, in all cases, subject to a number of customary exceptions. Although we are not required to make mandatory redemption or sinking fund payments with respect to the 2030 Notes, upon the occurrence of a change in control, we may be required to repurchase the 2030 Notes at a purchase price equal to 101 of the aggregate principal amount of the 2030 Notes repurchased plus accrued and unpaid interest. 
 
 At September 30, 2024, we believe we were in compliance, in all material respects, with the financial covenants and other restrictions applicable to us under the Amended Credit Agreement and the 2030 Notes. We believe we will be in compliance with these covenants throughout 2024. 
 
 We maintain professional liability insurance policies with third-party insurers, subject to self-insured retention, exclusions and other restrictions. We self-insure our liabilities to pay self-insured retention amounts under our professional liability insurance coverage through a wholly owned captive insurance subsidiary. We record liabilities for self-insured amounts and claims incurred but not reported based on an actuarial valuation using historical loss information, claim emergence patterns and various actuarial assumptions. Our total liability related to professional liability risks at September 30, 2024 was 284.2 million, of which 29.0 million is classified as a current liability within accounts payable and accrued expenses in the Consolidated Balance Sheet. In addition, there is a corresponding insurance receivable of 28.3 million recorded as a component of other assets for certain professional liability claims that are covered by insurance policies. 
 
 We anticipate that funds generated from operations, together with our current cash on hand and funds available under our Amended Credit Agreement, will be sufficient to finance our working capital requirements, fund anticipated acquisitions and capital expenditures, fund expenses related to our transformational and restructuring activities, fund our share repurchase programs and meet our contractual obligations for at least the next 12 months from the date of issuance of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. 
 
 Caution Concerning Forward-Looking Statements 
 
 19 

Certain information included or incorporated by reference in this Quarterly Report may be deemed to be forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act ). Forward-looking statements may include, but are not limited to, statements relating to our objectives, plans and strategies, and all statements, other than statements of historical facts, that address activities, events or developments that we intend, expect, project, believe or anticipate will or may occur in the future are forward-looking statements. These statements are often characterized by terminology such as believe, hope, may, anticipate, should, intend, plan, will, expect, estimate, project, positioned, strategy and similar expressions, and are based on assumptions and assessments made by our management in light of their experience and their perception of historical trends, current conditions, expected future developments and other factors they believe to be appropriate. Any forward-looking statements in this Quarterly Report are made as of the date hereof, and we undertake no duty to update or revise any such statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. Forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and are subject to risks and uncertainties. Important factors that could cause actual results, developments and business decisions to differ materially from forward-looking statements are described in the 2023 Form 10-K, including the section entitled Risk Factors.

Item 3. Quantitative and Qual itative Disclosures about Market Risk 
 
 We are subject to market risk primarily from exposure to changes in interest rates based on our financing, investing and cash management activities. We intend to manage interest rate risk through the use of a combination of fixed rate and variable rate debt. We borrow under our Amended Credit Agreement at various interest rate options based on the Alternate Base Rate or SOFR rate depending on certain financial ratios. At September 30, 2024, we had an outstanding principal balance of 218.8 million on our Amended Credit Agreement under our Term A Loan. Considering the total outstanding balance, a 1 change in interest rates would result in an impact to income before taxes of approximately 2.2 million per year. 
 
 Item 4. Controls a nd Procedures 
 
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 
 We maintain disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) that are designed to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by the Company in reports it files or submits under the Exchange Act is (i) recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in SEC rules and forms and (ii) accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 
 
 We carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures. Based upon that evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective at the reasonable assurance level as of September 30, 2024. 
 
 Changes in Internal Controls Over Financial Reporting 
 
 No changes in our internal control over financial reporting occurred during the three months ended September 30, 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 

21 

PART II - OTH ER INFORMATION 
 
 Item 1.	Legal Pro ceedings	 
 
 We expect that audits, inquiries and investigations from government authorities and agencies will occur in the ordinary course of business. Such audits, inquiries and investigations and their ultimate resolutions, individually or in the aggregate, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and the trading price of our securities. 
 
 In the ordinary course of our business, we become involved in pending and threatened legal actions and proceedings, most of which involve claims of medical malpractice related to medical services provided by our affiliated physicians. Our contracts with hospitals generally require us to indemnify them and their affiliates for losses resulting from the negligence of our affiliated physicians and other clinicians. We may also become subject to other lawsuits, including with payors or other counterparties that could involve large claims and significant defense costs. We believe, based upon a review of pending actions and proceedings, that the outcome of such legal actions and proceedings will not have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows or the trading price of our securities. The outcome of such actions and proceedings, however, cannot be predicted with certainty and an unfavorable resolution of one or more of them could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and the trading price of our securities. 
 
 	Although we currently maintain liability insurance coverage intended to cover professional liability and certain other claims, we cannot ensure that our insurance coverage will be adequate to cover liabilities arising out of claims asserted against us in the future where the outcomes of such claims are unfavorable to us. With respect to professional liability risk, we self-insure a significant portion of this risk through our wholly owned captive insurance subsidiary. Liabilities in excess of our insurance coverage, including coverage for professional liability and certain other claims, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and the trading price of our securities. 
 
 Item 1A. Risk Factors 
 
 There have been no material changes to the risk factors previously disclosed in our 2023 Form 10-K. 
 
 Item 2. Unregiste red Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds 
 
 During the three months ended September 30, 2024, we withheld 22,821 shares of our common stock to satisfy minimum statutory withholding obligations in connection with the vesting of restricted stock.

Our August 2018 repurchase program allows us to repurchase up to an additional 500.0 million of shares of our common stock, of which we repurchased 496.5 million as of September 30, 2024. 

(b) Shares withheld to satisfy nominal minimum statutory withholding obligations in connection with the vesting of restricted stock.

6.1 Successors . Employer shall require any successor (whether direct or indirect, by purchase, merger, consolidation or otherwise) acquiring a majority of Employer s voting common stock or any other successor to all or substantially all of the business and/or assets of Employer to expressly assume and agree to perform this Agreement in the same manner and to the same extent that Employer would be required to perform it if no such succession had taken place and Employee hereby consents to any such assignment. In such event, Employer shall mean Employer as previously defined and any successor to its business and/or assets which executes and delivers the agreement provided for in this Section 6 or which otherwise becomes bound by all the terms and provisions of this Agreement by operation of law.

7. Conflicts . Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, this Agreement constitutes the entire agreement among the parties pertaining to the subject matter hereof, and supersedes and revokes any and all prior or existing agreements, written or oral, relating to the subject matter hereof, and this Agreement shall be solely determinative of the subject matter hereof. 

8. Restrictive Covenants; Confidential Information; Work Product; Injunctive Relief. 

8.1 No Material Competition . Employer and Employee acknowledge and agree that a strong relationship and connection exists between Employer and its current and prospective patients, referral sources, and customers as well as the hospitals and healthcare facilities at which it provides professional services. Employer and Employee further acknowledge and agree that the restrictive covenants described in this Section are designed to enforce, and are ancillary to or part of, the promises contained in this Agreement and are reasonably necessary to protect the legitimate interests of Employer in the following: (1) the use and disclosure of the Confidential Information as described in Section 8.4 hereof; (2) the professional development activities described in Section 1.2 hereof; and (3) the goodwill of Employer, as promoted by Employee as provided in Section 1.2 hereof. The foregoing listing is by way of example only and shall not be construed to be an exclusive or exhaustive list of such interests. Employee acknowledges that the restrictive covenants set forth below are of significant value to Employer and were a material inducement to Employer in agreeing to the terms of this Agreement. Employee further acknowledges that the goodwill and other proprietary interest of Employer will suffer irreparable and continuing damage in the event Employee enters into competition with Employer in violation of this Section. 

Therefore, Employee agrees that, except with respect to services performed under this Agreement on behalf of Employer, Employee shall not , at any time during the Restricted Period (as defined below), for Employee or on behalf of any other person, persons, firm, partnership, corporation or employer, intentionally, knowingly, or willingly participate or engage in or own an interest in, directly or indirectly, any individual proprietorship, partnership, corporation, joint venture, trust or other form of business entity, whether as an individual proprietor, partner, joint venturer, officer, director, member, employee, consultant, independent contractor, stockholder, lender, landlord, finder, agent, broker, trustee, or in any manner whatsoever, if such entity or its affiliates is engaged in, directly or indirectly, Employer s Business , as defined on Exhibit A hereto. Employee acknowledges that, as of the date hereof, Employee s responsibilities will include matters affecting the businesses of Employer listed on Exhibit A . For purposes of this Section 8 , the Restricted Period shall mean the Employment Period plus (i) eighteen (18) months in the event this Agreement is terminated pursuant to Section 4.1 hereof, and (ii) twenty-four (24) months in the event the Agreement is terminated for any other reason. 
 8.2 No Hire . Employee further agrees that Employee shall not , at any time during the Employment Period and for a period of eighteen (18) months immediately following termination of this Agreement for any reason, for Employee or on behalf of any other person, persons, firm, partnership, corporation or employer, intentionally, knowingly, or willingly employ, or intentionally, knowingly, or willingly permit any company or business directly or indirectly controlled by Employee to (a) employ or otherwise engage (i) any person who is a then current 

8 

employee or exclusive independent contractor of Employer or one of its affiliates, or (ii) any person who was an employee or exclusive independent contractor of Employer or one of its affiliates in the prior six (6) month period, or (b) take any action that would reasonably be expected to induce an employee or independent contractor of Employer or one of its affiliates to leave his or her employment or engagement with Employer or one of its affiliates (including without limitation for or on behalf of a subsequent employer of Employee). 

8.3 Non-Solicitation. Employee further agrees that Employee shall not , at any time during the Employment Period and for a period of eighteen (18) months immediately following termination of this Agreement for any reason, for Employee or on behalf of any other person, persons, firm, partnership, corporation or employer, intentionally, knowingly, or willingly solicit or accept business from or take any action that would reasonably be expected to materially interfere with, diminish or impair the valuable relationships that Employer or its affiliates have with (i) hospitals or other health care facilities with which Employer or its affiliates have contracts to render professional services or otherwise have established relationships, (ii) patients, (iii) referral sources, (iv) vendors, (v) any other clients of Employer or its affiliates, or (vi) prospective hospitals, patients, referral sources, vendors or clients whose business Employee was aware that Employer or any affiliate of Employer was in the process of soliciting at the time of Employee s termination (including potential acquisition targets). 

8.4 Confidential Information . At all times during the term of this Agreement, Employer shall provide Employee with access to Confidential Information . As used in this Agreement, the term Confidential Information means any and all confidential, proprietary or trade secret information, whether disclosed, directly or indirectly, verbally, in writing or by any other means in tangible or intangible form, including that which is conceived or developed by Employee, applicable to or in any way related to: (i) patients with whom Employer has a physician/patient relationship; (ii) the present or future business of Employer; or (iii) the research and development of Employer. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Confidential Information includes: (a) the development and operation of Employer s medical practices, including information relating to budgeting, staffing needs, marketing, research, hospital relationships, equipment capabilities, and other information concerning such facilities and operations and specifically including the procedures and business plans developed by Employer for use at the hospitals where Employer conducts its business; (b) contractual arrangements between Employer and insurers or managed care associations or other payors; (c) the databases of Employer; (d) the clinical and research protocols of Employer, including coding guidelines; (e) the referral sources of Employer; or (f) other confidential information of Employer that is not generally known to the public that gives Employer the opportunity to obtain an advantage over competitors who do not know or use it, including the names, addresses, telephone numbers or special needs of any of its patients, its patient lists, its marketing methods and related data, lists or other written records used in Employer s business, compensation paid to employees and other terms of employment, accounting ledgers and financial statements, contracts and licenses, business systems, business plan and projections, and computer programs. The parties agree that, as between them, this Confidential Information constitutes important, material, and confidential trade secrets that affect the successful conduct of Employer s business and its goodwill. Employer acknowledges that the Confidential Information specifically enumerated above is special and unique information and is not information that would be considered a part of the general knowledge and skill Employee has or might otherwise obtain. 

9 

Notwithstanding the foregoing, Confidential Information shall not include any information that (i) was known by Employee from a third party source before disclosure by or on behalf of Employer, (ii) becomes available to Employee from a source other than Employer that is not, to Employee s knowledge, bound by a duty of confidentiality to Employer, (iii) becomes generally available or known in the industry other than as a result of its disclosure by Employee, or (iv) has been independently developed by Employee and may be disclosed by Employee without breach of this Agreement, provided, in each case, that Employee shall bear the burden of demonstrating that the information falls under one of the above-described exceptions. Pursuant to the Defend Trade Secrets Act of 2016, Employee acknowledges that Employee shall not have criminal or civil liability under any federal or state trade secret law for the disclosure of a trade secret that (A) is made (i) in confidence to a federal, state, or local government official, either directly or indirectly, or to an attorney and (ii) solely for the purpose of reporting or investigating a suspected violation of law; or (B) is made in a complaint or other document filed in a lawsuit or other proceeding, if such filing is made under seal. In addition, if Employee files a lawsuit for retaliation by Employer for reporting a suspected violation of law, Employee may disclose the trade secret to Employee s attorney and may use the trade secret information in the court proceeding, if Employee (X) files any document containing the trade secret under seal and (Y) does not disclose the trade secret, except pursuant to court order. 
 Additionally, notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, nothing in this Agreement or any other agreement between Employer and Employee shall prevent Employee from filing a charge, sharing information and communicating in good faith, without prior notice to Employer, with any federal government agency having jurisdiction over Employer or its operations, and cooperating in any investigation by any such federal government agency. 
 Unless disclosure is otherwise required by applicable law or stock exchange rules, Employee agrees that the terms of this Agreement shall be deemed Confidential Information for purposes of this Section. Employee shall keep the terms of this Agreement strictly confidential and will not, without the prior written consent of Employer, disclose the details of this Agreement to any third party in any manner whatsoever in whole or in part, with the exception of Employee s representatives (such as tax advisors and attorneys) who need to know such information. 
 Employee agrees that Employee will not at any time, whether during or subsequent to the term of Employee s employment with Employer, in any fashion, form or manner, unless specifically consented to in writing by Employer, either directly or indirectly, use or divulge, disclose, or communicate to any person, firm or corporation, in any manner whatsoever, any Confidential Information of any kind, nature, or description, subject to applicable law. The parties agree that any breach by Employee of any term of this Section 8.4 resulting in material harm to Pediatrix or Employer is a material breach of this Agreement and shall constitute Cause for the termination of Employee s employment hereunder pursuant to Section 4.1 hereof. In the event that Employee is ordered to disclose any Confidential Information, whether in a legal or a regulatory proceeding or otherwise, Employee shall provide Employer with prompt written notice of such request or order so that Employer may seek to prevent disclosure or, if that cannot be achieved, the entry of a protective order or other appropriate protective device or procedure in order to assure, to the extent practicable, compliance with the provisions of this Agreement. In the case of any disclosure required by law, Employee shall disclose only that portion of the 
 10 

Confidential Information that Employee is ordered to disclose in a legally binding subpoena, demand or similar order issued pursuant to a legal or regulatory proceeding. 
 All Confidential Information, and all equipment, notebooks, documents, memoranda, reports, files, samples, books, correspondence, lists, other written and graphic records, in any media (including electronic or video) containing Confidential Information or relating to the business of Employer, which Employee shall prepare, use, construct, observe, possess, or control shall be and remain Employer s sole property (collectively Employer Property ). Upon termination or expiration of this Agreement, or earlier upon Employer s request, Employee shall promptly deliver to Employer all Employer Property, retaining none. 
 8.5 Ownership of Work Product. Employee agrees and acknowledges that (i) all copyrights, patents, trade secrets, trademarks, service marks, or other intellectual property or proprietary rights associated with any ideas, concepts, techniques, inventions, processes, or works of authorship developed or created by Employee during the course of performing work for Employer and any other work product conceived, created, designed, developed or contributed by Employee during the term of this Agreement that relates in any way to Employer s Business (collectively, the Work Product ), shall belong exclusively to Employer and shall, to the extent possible, be considered a work made for hire within the meaning of Title 17 of the United States Code. To the extent the Work Product may not be considered a work made for hire owned exclusively by Employer, Employee hereby assigns to Employer all right, title, and interest worldwide in and to such Work Product at the time of its creation, without any requirement of further consideration. Upon request of Employer, Employee shall take such further actions and execute such further documents as Employer may deem necessary or desirable to further the purposes of this Agreement, including without limitation separate assignments of all right, title, and interest in and to all rights of copyright and all right, title, and interest in and to any inventions or patents and any reissues or extensions which may be granted therefore, and in and to any improvements, additions to, or modifications thereto, which Employee may acquire by invention or otherwise, the same to be held and enjoyed by Employer for its own use and benefit, and for the use and benefit of Employer s successors and assigns, as fully and as entirely as the same might be held by Employee had this assignment not been made. 

8.6 Clearance Procedure for Proprietary Rights Not Claimed by Employer. In the event that Employee wishes to create or develop, other than on Employer s time or using Employer s resources, anything that may be considered Work Product but to which Employee believes Employee should be entitled to the personal benefit of, Employee agrees to follow the clearance procedure set forth in this Section. Before beginning any such work, Employee agrees to give Employer advance written notice and provide Employer with a sufficiently detailed written description of the work under consideration for Employer to make a determination regarding the work. Unless otherwise agreed in a writing signed by Employer prior to receipt, Employer shall have no obligation of confidentiality with respect to such request or description. Employer will determine in its sole discretion, within thirty (30) days after Employee has fully disclosed such plans to Employer, whether rights in such work will be claimed by Employer. If Employer determines that it does not claim rights in such work, Employer agrees to so notify Employee in writing and Employee may retain ownership of the work to the extent that such work has been expressly disclosed to Employer. If Employer fails to so notify Employee within such thirty (30) day period, then Employer shall be deemed to have agreed that such work is not considered Work 

11 

Product for purposes of this Agreement. Employee agrees to submit for further review any significant improvement, modification, or adaptation that could reasonably be related to Employer s Business so that it can be determined whether the improvement, modification, or adaptation relates to the business or interests of Employer. Clearance under this procedure does not relieve Employee of the restrictive covenants set forth in this Section 8 . 

8.7 Non-Disparagement. During the Employment Period and for a period of ten (10) years after the termination of this Agreement, Employee will not, directly or indirectly, as an individual or on behalf of a firm, corporation, partnership or other legal entity, intentionally, knowingly, or willingly make any comment that would reasonably be expected to be materially disparaging or negative to any other person or entity regarding Employer or any of its affiliates, agents, attorneys, employees, officers and directors, Employee s work conditions or circumstances surrounding Employee s separation from Employer or otherwise impugn or criticize the name or reputation of Employer, its affiliates, agents, attorneys, employees, officers or directors, orally or in writing. 

8.8 Review by Employee. Employee has carefully read and considered the terms and provisions of this Section 8 , and having done so, agrees that the restrictions set forth in this Section 8 are fair and reasonably required for the protection of the interests of Employer. In the event that any term or provision set forth in this Section 8 shall be held to be invalid or unenforceable by a court of competent jurisdiction, the parties hereto agree that such invalid or unenforceable term(s) or provision(s) may be severed from this Agreement without, in any manner, affecting the remaining portions hereof. Without limiting other possible remedies available to Employer, Employee agrees that injunctive or other equitable relief will be available to enforce the covenants set forth in this Section 8 , such relief to be without the necessity of posting a bond. In the event that, notwithstanding the foregoing, any part of the covenants set forth in this Section 8 shall be held to be invalid, overbroad, or unenforceable by an arbitrator or a court of competent jurisdiction, the parties hereto agree that such invalid, overbroad, or unenforceable provision(s) may be modified or severed from this Agreement without, in any manner, affecting the remaining portions of this Section 8 (all of which shall remain in full force and effect). In the event that any provision of this Section 8 related to time period or areas of restriction shall be declared by an arbitrator or a court of competent jurisdiction to exceed the maximum time period, area or activities such arbitrator or court deems reasonable and enforceable, said time period or areas of restriction shall be deemed modified to the minimum extent necessary to make the geographic or temporal restrictions or activities reasonable and enforceable. 

8.9 Survival; Notice of Breach and Right to Cure. If Employer reasonably believes that Employee has breached a provision of this Section 8 , Employer shall provide prompt written notice thereof to Employee that explains such reasonably believed breach (the Alleged Breach ). Employer agrees to work in good faith with Employee to provide Employee a reasonable opportunity to promptly cure such Alleged Breach. In the event that Employee, acting in good faith, promptly takes actions that would reasonably be expected to cure the Alleged Breach, including, with respect to a comment made by Employee that Employer reasonably believes is in breach of Section 8.7 hereof, by Employee retracting such comment, then Employee shall be deemed not to be in breach of this Section 8 with respect to the Alleged Breach. Employer and Employee further agree that Employee shall not be deemed to be in breach of any term of Section 8.4 hereof unless such breach results in material harm to Pediatrix or Employer. 

12 

The provisions of this Section 8 shall survive the termination of this Agreement and Employee s employment with Employer. In the event of a breach of this Section 8 by Employee, as finally determined pursuant to Section 11 hereof, Employer retains the right to terminate any continuing payments to Employee provided for in Section 4 hereof. In the event of a breach of any provisions of this Section 8 by Employee, as finally determined pursuant to Section 11 hereof, the period for which those provisions would remain in effect shall be extended for a period of time equal to that period beginning when such breach commenced and ending when the activities constituting such breach shall have been finally terminated, in each case as finally determined pursuant to Section 11 hereof. The provisions of this Section 8 are expressly intended to benefit and be enforceable by other affiliated entities of Employer, who are express third party beneficiaries hereof. Employee shall not assist others in engaging in any of the activities described in the foregoing restrictive covenants. 
 9. Tax Matters 

9.1 Section 409A 

(a) In General. The parties intend that this Agreement will be administered in accordance with Section 409A of the Code. To the extent that any provision of this Agreement is ambiguous as to its compliance with Section 409A of the Code, the provision shall be read in such a manner so that all payments hereunder comply with Section 409A of the Code. Each payment pursuant to this Agreement is intended to constitute a separate payment for purposes of Treasury Regulation Section 1.409A-2(b)(2). For purposes of Section 409A of the Code, the right to a series of installment payments under this Agreement shall be treated as a right to a series of separate payments. The parties agree that this Agreement may be amended, as reasonably requested by either party, and as may be necessary to fully comply with Section 409A of the Code and all related rules and regulations in order to preserve the payments and benefits provided hereunder without additional cost to either party. Employer makes no representation or warranty and shall have no liability to Employee or any other person if any provisions of this Agreement are determined to constitute deferred compensation subject to Section 409A of the Code but do not satisfy an exemption from, or the conditions of, Section 409A. 

(b) Six-Month Delay. Anything in this Agreement to the contrary notwithstanding, if at the time of Employee s separation from service within the meaning of Section 409A of the Code, Employer determines that Employee is a specified employee within the meaning of Section 409A(a)(2)(B)(i) of the Code, then to the extent any payment or benefit that Employee becomes entitled to under this Agreement on account of Employee s separation from service (within the meaning of Section 409A) that would be considered non-qualified deferred compensation , such payment shall not be payable and such benefit shall not be provided until the date that is within fifteen (15) days after the end of the six-month period beginning on the date of such separation from service or, if earlier, within fifteen (15) days after the appointment of the personal representative or executor of Employee s estate following Employee s death. If any such delayed cash payment is otherwise payable on an installment basis, the first payment shall include a catch-up payment covering amounts that would otherwise have been paid during the six-month period but for the application of this provision, and the balance of the installments shall be payable in accordance with their original schedule. 

13 

(c) Reimbursements. All in-kind benefits provided and expenses eligible for reimbursement under this Agreement shall be provided by Employer or incurred by Employee during the time periods set forth in this Agreement. All reimbursements shall be paid as soon as administratively practicable, but in no event shall any reimbursement be paid after the last day of the taxable year following the taxable year in which the expense was incurred. The amount of in-kind benefits provided or reimbursable expenses incurred in one taxable year shall not affect the in-kind benefits to be provided or the expenses eligible for reimbursement in any other taxable year (except for any lifetime or other aggregate limitation applicable to medical expenses). Such right to reimbursement or in-kind benefits is not subject to liquidation or exchange for another benefit. 

(d) Separation from Service. To the extent that any payment or benefit described in this Agreement constitutes non-qualified deferred compensation under Section 409A of the Code, and to the extent that such payment or benefit is payable upon Employee s termination of employment, then such payments or benefits shall be payable only upon Employee s separation from service as defined under Section 409A. The determination of whether and when a separation from service has occurred shall be made in accordance with the presumptions set forth in Treasury Regulation Section 1.409A-1(h). 

(e) Later Calendar Year . To the extent that any payment or benefit described in this Agreement constitutes non-qualified deferred compensation under Section 409A of the Code, and not otherwise exempt from the application of Section 409A, then, if the period during which Employee may consider and sign the Release or the period in which the Employer can make a severance payment spans two calendar years, any payment or benefit described in this Agreement will not be made or begin until the later calendar year. 

9.2 Section 280G . Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement or any other plan, arrangement or agreement to the contrary, if any of the payments or benefits provided or to be provided by Employer or its affiliates to Employee or for Employee s benefit pursuant to the terms of this Agreement or otherwise (the Covered Payments constitute parachute payments (the Parachute Payments within the meaning of Section 280G of the Code and, but for this Section 9 , would be subject to the excise tax imposed under Section 4999 of the Code (or any successor provision thereto) or any similar tax imposed by state or local law or any interest or penalties with respect to such taxes (collectively, the Excise Tax ), then prior to making the Covered Payments, a calculation shall be made comparing (i) the Net Benefit (as defined below) to Employee of the Covered Payments after payment of the Excise Tax to (ii) the Net Benefit to Employee if the Covered Payments are limited to the extent necessary to avoid being subject to the Excise Tax. Only if the amount calculated under (i) above is less than the amount under (ii) above will the Covered Payments be reduced to the minimum extent necessary to ensure that no portion of the Covered Payments is subject to the Excise Tax (that amount, the Reduced Amount ). Net Benefit shall mean the present value of the Covered Payments net of all federal, state, local, foreign income, employment and excise taxes. 

(a) Any such reduction shall be made in accordance with Section 409A and the following: (i) the Covered Payments consisting of cash severance benefits that do not constitute nonqualified deferred compensation subject to Section 409A shall be reduced first, in reverse chronological order; (ii) all other Covered Payments consisting of cash payments, and 

14 

Covered Payments consisting of accelerated vesting of equity based awards to which Treas.

Employer and Employee shall provide the Accountants with such information and documents as the Accountants may reasonably request in order to make a determination under this Section 9 . For purposes of making the calculations and determinations required by this Section 9 , the Accountants may rely on reasonable, good-faith assumptions and approximations concerning the application of Section 280G and Section 4999 of the Code. The Accountants determinations shall be final and binding on Employer and Employee. Employer shall be responsible for all fees and expenses incurred by the Accountants in connection with the calculations required by this Section 9 . 

(c) It is possible that after the determinations and selections made pursuant to this Section 9 , Employee will receive Covered Payments that are in the aggregate more than the amount intended or required to be provided after application of this Section 9 Overpayment or less than the amount intended or required to be provided after application of this Section 9 Underpayment ). 

(i) In the event that: (A) the Accountants determine, based upon the assertion of a deficiency by the Internal Revenue Service against either Employer or Employee that the Accountants believe has a high probability of success, that an Overpayment has been made or (B) it is established pursuant to a final determination of a court or an Internal Revenue Service proceeding that has been finally and conclusively resolved that an Overpayment has been made, then Employee shall pay any such Overpayment to Employer together with interest at the applicable federal rate (as defined in Section 7872(f)(2)(A) of the Code) from the date of Employee s receipt of the Overpayment until the date of repayment. 

(ii) In the event that: (A) the Accountants, based upon controlling precedent or substantial authority, determine that an Underpayment has occurred or (B) a court of competent jurisdiction determines that an Underpayment has occurred, any such Underpayment will be paid promptly by Employer to or for the benefit of Employee together with interest at the applicable federal rate (as defined in Section 7872(f)(2)(A) of the Code) from the date the amount should have otherwise been paid to Employee until the payment date. 

9.3 Tax Withholding. All amounts payable under this Agreement shall be subject to applicable income and employment tax withholding. 

15 

10. Dispute Resolution; Injunctive Relief . If any controversy or claim arises out of or relating to this Agreement, or any alleged breach hereof, Employee and Employer shall first try to resolve such controversy or claim through mediation using the services of the American Arbitration Association. If any such controversy or claim cannot be resolved by mediation pursuant to the foregoing, Employee and Employer agree that such controversy or claim shall be finally determined by a single arbitrator, jointly selected by Employee and Employer, provided that if Employee and Employer are unable to agree upon a single arbitrator after reasonable efforts, the arbitrator shall be an impartial arbitrator selected by the American Arbitration Association. 

Employer shall bear all costs associated with such mediation and, if necessary, arbitration, including but not limited to all costs of the mediator and arbitrator, and shall reimburse Employee on a monthly basis for Employee s reasonable legal and other expenses, including all fees, incurred in connection with any such mediation and, if necessary, arbitration, provided, however, that if Employer ultimately prevails in any arbitration (as determined by the arbitrator), the arbitrator shall have the power to require Employee to reimburse Employer for all or a portion of the advanced legal fees and other expenses as determined by the arbitrator (and, if the arbitrator finds that Employer prevailed on certain claims and Employee prevailed on others, the arbitrator shall have the power to require Employee to reimburse Employer for a portion of the advanced legal fees and other expenses determined by the arbitrator based on those claims on which Employer prevailed). The mediation and, if necessary, arbitration proceedings shall be held in Sunrise, Florida, unless otherwise mutually agreed by the parties, and shall be conducted in accordance with the American Arbitration Association National Rules for the Resolution of Employment Disputes then in effect. Judgment on any award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered and enforced by any court having jurisdiction thereof. Any such mediation and, if necessary, arbitration shall be treated as confidential by all parties thereto, except as otherwise provided by law or as otherwise necessary to enforce any judgment or order issued by the arbitrator. 
 Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, if Employer or Employee shall require immediate injunctive relief, then the party shall be entitled to seek such relief in any court having jurisdiction, and if the party elects to do so, the other party hereby consents to the jurisdiction of the state and federal courts sitting in the State of Florida and to the applicable service of process. Employee and Employer hereby waive and agree not to assert, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, any claim that (i) they are not subject to the jurisdiction of such courts, (ii) they are immune from any legal process issued by such courts and (iii) any litigation or other proceeding commenced in such courts is brought in an inconvenient forum. In the event that Employer brings suit against Employee seeking injunctive relief, Employer agrees to advance all of Employee s reasonable legal and other expenses, including all fees, incurred by Employee in connection with such action, provided, however, that if Employer ultimately prevails in seeking injunctive relief, Employee shall reimburse Employer all such advanced legal fees and other expenses.

EXHIBIT A 
 BUSINESS OF EMPLOYER 
 As of the date hereof, Employer, directly or through its affiliates, provides professional medical services and all aspects of practice management services in medical practice areas that include, but are not limited to, the following (collectively referred to herein as Employer s Business ): 
 (1) Neonatology, including hospital well baby care; 
 (2) Maternal Fetal Medicine, including general obstetrics services; 
 (3) Pediatric Intensive Care, including Pediatric Hospitalist Care; 
 (4) Newborn hearing screening services; 
 (5) Pediatric Surgery; and 
 (6) Pediatric Emergency Medicine; and 
 
 References to Employer s Business in this Agreement shall include such other medical service lines, practice management services and other businesses in which Employer is engaged during the Employment Period; provided, that to be considered a part of Employer s Business, Employer must have engaged in such other service line, practice management service or other business at least six (6) months prior to the termination date of this Agreement. For purposes of this Exhibit A , businesses of Employer shall include the businesses conducted by Employer s subsidiaries, entities under common control and affiliates as defined under Rule 144 of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. Such affiliates shall include the professional corporations and associations whose operating results are consolidated with Employer for financial reporting purposes. 
 Notwithstanding the foregoing, Employer acknowledges and agrees to the following exceptions and clarifications regarding the scope of Employer s Business. 
 A.	 Hospital Services. Employer and Employee acknowledge that, as of the date hereof, Employer does not currently operate hospitals, hospital systems or universities. Nevertheless, the businesses of hospitals, hospital systems and universities would be the same as Employer s Business where such hospitals, hospital systems or universities provide or contract with others to provide some or all of the medical services included in Employer s Business. Therefore, the parties desire to clarify their intent with respect to the limitations on Employee s ability to work for or contract with others to provide services for a hospital, hospital system or university during the Employment Period and during the Restricted Period. Section 8.1 shall not be deemed to restrict Employee s ability to work for a hospital, hospital system or university if the hospital, hospital system or university does not provide any of the medical services included in Employer s Business. Furthermore, even if a hospital, hospital system or university provides medical services that are included in Employer s Business, Employee may work for such hospital, hospital system or university if Employee has no direct supervisory responsibility for or involvement in the hospital s, hospital system s or university s provision of medical services that are Employer s Business. For the avoidance of doubt, Employer and Employee agree that if Employee becomes the Chief Operating Officer, Chief Legal Officer, Chief Compliance Officer, General Counsel or Chief Executive Officer of a hospital system or health system, or other 
 A 1 

executive officer of similar level to the foregoing, that Employee shall not be in breach of the provisions of this Agreement. Finally, Employer agrees that Employee may hold direct supervisory responsibility for or be involved in the medical services of a hospital, hospital system or university that are included in Employer s Business so long as such hospital, hospital system or university is located at least ten (10) miles from a medical practice owned or operated by Employer or its affiliate. Subject to paragraph B below, the provisions of this paragraph shall not apply to the extent that, after the date hereof, Employer enters into the business of operating a hospital or hospital system. 
 B.	 De Minimus Exception. Employer agrees that a medical service line (other than those listed in items (1) through (8) above), practice management service or other business in which Employer is engaged shall not be considered to be a part of Employer s Business if such medical service line, practice management service or other business constitutes less than three percent (3 of Employer s annual revenues. 
 C.	 Divested Lines of Service. Employer agrees that any medical service line (including those listed in items (1) through (8) above), practice management, or other business in which Employer is engaged that is divested pursuant to a disposition, sale of assets or equity, or otherwise after the Effective Date shall not be considered to be a part of Employer s Business effective as of the effective date of such divestiture. 
 D.	 Certain Ownership Interests. It shall not be deemed to be a violation of Section 8.1 for Employee to: (i) own, directly or indirectly, one percent (1 or less of a publicly traded entity that has a market capitalization of 1 billion or more; (ii) own, directly or indirectly, five percent (5 or less of a publicly traded entity that has a market capitalization of less than 1 billion; or (iii) own, directly or indirectly, less than ten percent (10 of a privately held business or company, if Employee is at all times a passive investor with no board representation, management authority or other special rights to control operations of such business or company.

Employee acknowledges that Employer encouraged Employee to consult with an attorney of Employee s choosing, and through this General Release of Claims encourages Employee to consult with Employee s attorney with respect to possible claims under the Age Discrimination in Employment Act ADEA and that Employee understands that the ADEA is a Federal statute that, among other things, prohibits discrimination on the basis of age in employment and employee benefits and benefit plans. Without limiting the generality of the release provided above, Employee expressly waives any and all claims under ADEA that Employee may have as of the date hereof. Employee further understands that by signing this General Release of Claims Employee is in fact waiving, releasing and forever giving up any claim under the ADEA as well as all other laws within the scope of this paragraph 1 that may have existed on or prior to the date hereof.

3. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, nothing in this Agreement or any other agreement between Employer and Employee shall prevent Employee from filing a charge, sharing information and communicating in good faith, without prior notice to Employer, with any federal government agency having jurisdiction over Employer or its operations, and cooperating in any investigation by any such federal government agency; however, to the maximum extent permitted by law, Employee agrees that if such an administrative claim is made, Employee shall not be entitled to recover any individual monetary relief or other individual remedies, provided that, for purposes of clarity, this limitation on monetary recovery does not apply to whistleblower proceedings before the United States Securities and Exchange Commission. 

4. Employee hereby acknowledges that Employer has informed Employee that Employee has up to twenty one (21) days to sign this General Release of Claims and Employee may knowingly and voluntarily waive that twenty one (21) day period by signing this General Release of Claims earlier. Employee also understands that Employee shall have seven (7) days following the date on which Employee signs this General Release of Claims within which to revoke it by providing a written notice of Employee s revocation to Employer. 

5. Employee acknowledges that this General Release of Claims will be governed by and construed and enforced in accordance with the internal laws of the State of Florida applicable to contracts made and to be performed entirely within such State. 

6. Employee acknowledges that Employee has read this General Release of Claims, that Employee has been advised that Employee should consult with an attorney before Employee executes this general release of claims, and that Employee understands all of its terms and executes it voluntarily and with full knowledge of its significance and the consequences thereof. 

7. This General Release of Claims shall take effect on the eighth day following Employee s execution of this General Release of Claims unless Employee s written revocation is delivered to Employer within seven (7) days after such execution.
