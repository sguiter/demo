The
Company s cash position may not be significant enough to support the Company s daily operations. While the Company believes
in the viability of its strategy and in its ability to raise additional funds, there can be no assurances to that effect. The Company s
ability to continue as a going concern is dependent upon its ability to improve profitability and the ability to acquire funding through
public offering. If funding from public offering is insufficient, then the Company shall rely on the financial support from its controlling

Company
Overview 

The
Company is engaging in the wholesale and retail of high quality, sustainable, environmentally friendly bio-carbon-based fertilizer (herein
referred to as BCBF ). BCBF not only enhances the crop yield but also contributes to environmental preservation. The Company s
BCBF is sourced from, and produced by, a third party through heating straw in a closed container with little or no available air. This
method is also known as thermal decomposition of organic material under limited supply of oxygen at relatively low temperature. In accordance
with requirements imposed by the PRC Ministry of Agriculture, the Company s Supplier of BCBF has registered with Sichuan Province
Provincial Department of Agriculture and Rural Affairs, which has an effective period of 5 years, from December 2019 to December 2024.
As of the date of this report, the Company does not maintain or operate any production and/or manufacturing of any BCBF facility, machine
and/or equipment. 

3 

The
Company is currently wholesaling and retailing BCBF through its wholly owned subsidiary SCQC Agriculture Co. Limited SCQC ).
Management of the Company believes that the BCBF sold by the Company is capable of maintaining soil fertility, enhancing crop yield,
improving soil structure, improving water and fertilizer retention capability and improving fertilizer utilization efficiency and effectiveness.
This is achieved through balancing carbon and nitrogen content, neutralizing soil pH while at the same time creating soil particle structure
that is conducive to plant growth. 

The
BCBF sold by the Company, produced through straw thermal decomposition, replaces the function of activated carbon. The combination of
soil and BCBF is capable of absorbing and reducing pollution content, such as heavy metals from agricultural residual wastes. Further,
the combination of water and BCBF is capable of purifying water by producing carbohydrates and glucose, which could be absorbed by and
is conducive to the growth of plants. Additionally, BCBF possesses outstanding water storage capacity, which can store up to 10 times
the water content when compared to soil without BCBF, which in turn provides farmers greater flexibility during times of hardship such
as a drought. 

As
such, the management of the Company believes that the Company s BCBF is not only a superior option compared to conventional fertilizer
in terms of environmentally sustainability, but also from an economic perspective due to the improvement in crop yield quality and quantity.
The Company s BCBF consists of roughly 45 organic matter, 20 bio-charcoal, 10 humic acid, 5 NPK and boats an effective microorganism
count of 20,000,000 per gram. 

On
July 25, 2022, the Company launched its online retailing business through an e-commerce platform, offering a range of daily use products
including healthcare, cosmetics, fashion, and household products. Customers will place orders through the platform and make payments
to the Company. The Company will then place orders with the supplier, who will deliver the products directly to the customer. Settlement
between the Company and the suppliers is scheduled on a weekly basis.

Revenue 

For
the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company generated revenue of 292,405, compared to 223,564 for the same period in
2023. This increase in total revenue is primarily attributed to the growth in the online retailing business, which accounted for 292,389 of all revenue generated. 

For
the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the BCBF trading business segment, the online retailing business segment and the beauty products
trading business segment contributed 0 , 100 and 0 of the total revenue, respectively. For the nine months ended September 30,
2023, the BCBF trading business segment, the online retailing business segment and the beauty products trading business segment contributed
26 , 44 and 30 of the total revenue respectively. 

Cost
of revenue 

The
cost of revenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 65,117, compared to a cost of revenue of 39,007 for the same
period in 2023. This increase is primarily attributable to higher sales costs associated with the online business, which aligns with
the increased revenue recorded in this segment. The rise in costs was partially offset by reduced costs of sales in the BCBF and
beauty products businesses. 

Gross
profits and margins 

For
the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company recorded a gross profit of 227,288 and a gross margin of 78 , compared to a
gross profit of 184,557 and a gross margin of 83 for the same period in 2023. The increase in gross profit is primarily driven by
higher revenue from our online retailing business. The slight decrease in gross margin is attributable to a reduction in the beauty
products business, which generally yields a higher margin compared to the BCBF trading and online retailing businesses. 

Expenses 

Selling
and distribution expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, were 51,058, compared to 495 for the same period in 2023.
This increase in expense is in line with the growth in revenue recorded during the period. 

General and administrative expenses for the nine months ended September
30, 2024, were 123,917, compared to 275,520 for the same period in 2023. The adjustment of the Company s business has led to a reduction
in general and administrative expenses.

Income/Loss 

The
Company incurred an operating profit of 52,313 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to an operating loss of
 91,458 for the same period in 2023. The increase in operating profit is attributed to a higher revenue and
reduced general and administrative expenses. Substantially all of the operating income during the period are generated by the online retailing
business. In addition, breakdown by countries, 36,037 of loss were from customers in the United States, which has been offset by 88,350
of profit generated in China.

to the director. 

For
the nine months ended September 30, 2023, the Company has received cash provided by director amounting to 171,308. 

Capital
Requirements 

We
intend to fund our capital requirements through a combination of cash on hand and cash flows generated from our daily operations. 

7 

Foreign
Currency 

Most
of our revenues and operating expenses are denominated in Renminbi. The Renminbi is currently freely convertible under the current
account, which includes dividends, trade and service-related foreign exchange transactions, but not under the capital account, 
which includes foreign direct investment and loans. Under our current corporate structure, our company in the United States may rely
on dividend payments from our PRC subsidiaries to fund any cash and financing requirements we may have. 

Under
existing PRC foreign exchange regulations, payments of current account items, including payment of dividends, interest payments and trade
and service-related foreign exchange transactions, can be made in foreign currencies without prior approval of the State Administration
of Foreign Exchange, or SAFE, by complying with certain procedural requirements. Our PRC subsidiaries may also retain foreign exchange
in its current account, subject to a ceiling approved by SAFE, to satisfy foreign exchange liabilities or to pay dividends. However,
we cannot assure you that the relevant PRC governmental authorities will not limit or eliminate our ability to purchase and retain foreign
currencies in the future. 

Since
a significant amount of our future revenues will be denominated in Renminbi, the existing and any future restrictions on currency exchange
may limit our ability to utilize revenues generated in Renminbi to fund our business activities outside China, if any, or expenditures
denominated in foreign currencies. 

Foreign
exchange transactions under the capital account are subject to limitations and require registration with or approval by the relevant
PRC governmental authorities. In particular, any transfer of funds from us to any of our PRC subsidiaries, either as a shareholder loan
or as an increase in registered capital, is subject to certain statutory limit requirements and registration or approval of the relevant
PRC governmental authorities, including the relevant administration of foreign exchange and/or the relevant examining and approval authority.
Our ability to use the U.S. dollar proceeds of the sale of our equity or debt to finance our business activities conducted through our
PRC subsidiaries will depend on our ability to obtain these governmental registrations or approvals. In addition, because of the regulatory
issues related to foreign currency loans to, and foreign investment in, domestic PRC enterprises, we may not be able to finance the operations
of our PRC subsidiaries by loans or capital contributions. We cannot assure you that we can obtain these governmental registrations or
approvals on a timely basis, if at all. 

The
amount of cash denominated in RMB is approximately CNY5,739 (approximately 817) as of September 30, 2024. 

Off-balance
Sheet Commitments and Arrangements 

As
of September 30, 2024, we have not entered into any other financial guarantees or other commitments to guarantee the payment obligations
of any third parties. In addition, we have not entered into any derivative contracts that are indexed to our own shares and classified
as shareholders equity, or that are not reflected in our consolidated financial statements. 

Critical
Accounting Policies 

We
prepare our financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted by the United States of America U.S.
GAAP ), which require us to make judgments, estimates, and assumptions that affect our reported amount of assets, liabilities,
revenue, costs and expenses, and any related disclosures. Although there were no material changes made to the accounting estimates and
assumptions in the past three years, we continually evaluate these estimates and assumptions based on the most recently available information,
our own historical experience and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Since the use of
estimates is an integral component of the financial reporting process, actual results could differ from our expectations as a result
of changes in our estimates. 

We
believe that our accounting policies involve a higher degree of judgment and complexity in their application and require us to make significant
accounting estimates. Accordingly, the policies we believe are the most critical to understanding and evaluating our consolidated financial
condition and results of operations are summarized in Note 3 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in the notes
to our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements. 

8 

GOING
CONCERN UNCERTAINTIES 

The
accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. The Company is currently
in a net liability position and incurred a net cash used in operating activities of 75,911 for the nine months ended September 30,
2024 resulting in accumulated deficit of 334,376 and a working capital deficit of 169,899. 

The
Company s cash position may not be significant enough to support the Company s daily operations. While the Company believes
in the viability of its strategy and in its ability to raise additional funds, there can be no assurances to that effect. The Company s
ability to continue as a going concern is dependent upon its ability to improve profitability and the ability to acquire funding through
public offering. If funding from public offering is insufficient, then the Company shall rely on the financial support from its controlling
shareholder. 

These
and other factors raise substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern within one year after the
date that financial statements are issued. These financial statements do not include any adjustments to reflect the possible future effects
on the recoverability and classification of assets or the amounts and classification of liabilities that may result in the Company not
being able to continue as a going concern. 

Recent
accounting pronouncements 

In
November 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-07, Improvement to Reportable Segment Disclosures (Topic 280). ASU 2023-07 aims to improve segment
disclosures through enhanced disclosures about significant segment expenses. The standard requires all public entities, including those
public entities that have a single reportable segment, shall disclose all of the following for each period for which an income statement
is presented. However, reconciliations of balance sheet amounts for reportable segments to consolidated balance sheet amounts are required
only for each year for which a balance sheet is presented. The amendments will be applied retrospectively to all prior periods presented in the financial statements and is
effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023, and interim periods in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024, with
early adoption permitted.
The Company is currently evaluating the impact of the additional disclosure requirements on the Company s condensed consolidated
financial statements. 

The
Company reviews new accounting standards as issued. Management has not identified any other new standards that it believes will have
a significant impact on the Company s consolidated financial statements. 

Emerging
Growth Company and Smaller Reporting Company Status 

As
an emerging growth company under the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012 (the JOBS Act), we can take advantage of an extended
transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standards. This period allows an emerging growth company to delay the
adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. We have elected to avail ourselves
of this exemption from new or revised accounting standards and, therefore, our financial statements may not be comparable to companies
that comply with new or revised accounting pronouncements as of public company effective dates. We also intend to rely on other exemptions
provided by the JOBS Act, including without limitation, not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section
404(b) of Sarbanes-Oxley. 

We
will remain an emerging growth company until the earliest of (i) the end of the fiscal year following the fifth anniversary of the completion
of our initial public offering, (ii) the first fiscal year after our annual gross revenues exceed 1.235 billion, (iii) the date on which
we have, during the immediately preceding three-year period, issued more than 1.0 billion in non-convertible debt securities or (iv)
the end of any fiscal year in which the market value of our common stock held by non-affiliates exceeds 700 million as of the end of
the second quarter of that fiscal year. 

We
are also a smaller reporting company, meaning that the market value of our stock held by non-affiliates plus the proposed
aggregate amount of gross proceeds to us as a result of this offering is less than 700 million and our annual revenue is less than 100
million during the most recently completed fiscal year. We may continue to be a smaller reporting company if either (i) the market value
of our stock held by non-affiliates is less than 250 million or (ii) our annual revenue is less than 100 million during the most recently
completed fiscal year and the market value of our stock held by non-affiliates is less than 700 million. If we are a smaller reporting
company at the time we cease to be an emerging growth company, we may continue to rely on exemptions from certain disclosure requirements
that are available to smaller reporting companies. Specifically, as a smaller reporting company we may choose to present only the two
most recent fiscal years of audited financial statements in our Annual Report on Form 10-K and, similar to emerging growth companies,
smaller reporting companies have reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation.

Item
3 Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk. 

As
a smaller reporting company as defined by Item 10 of Regulation S-K, the Company is not required to provide information
required by this Item. 

Item
4 Controls and Procedures. 

Disclosure
Controls and Procedures 

We
maintain disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the
 Exchange Act ), that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file
or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the Securities
and Exchange Commission s rules and forms and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including
our principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions
regarding required disclosure. 

We
carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our chief executive officer,
of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of September 30, 2024. Based on the evaluation of these disclosure
controls and procedures, and in light of the material weaknesses found in our internal controls over financial reporting, our chief executive
officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective. The matters involving internal controls and procedures
that our management considered to be material weaknesses under the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board were: (i)
lack of a functioning audit committee due to a lack of a majority of independent members and a lack of a majority of outside directors
on our board of directors, resulting in ineffective oversight in the establishment and monitoring of required internal controls and procedures;
(ii) inadequate segregation of duties and effective risk assessment; (iii) insufficient written policies and procedures for accounting
and financial reporting with respect to the requirements and application of both US GAAP and SEC guidelines; and (iv) lack of internal
audit function due to the fact that the Company lacks qualified resources to perform the internal audit functions properly and that the
scope and effectiveness of the internal audit function are yet to be developed. The aforementioned material weaknesses were identified
by our chief executive officer in connection with the review of our financial statements as of September 30, 2024. 

Management s
Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting 

Our
management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in Rules 13a-15(f)
and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act. Our internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding
the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally
accepted accounting principles. The internal controls for the Company are provided by executive management s review and approval
of all transactions. Our internal control over financial reporting also includes those policies and procedures that: 

1. 
 pertain
 to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of our assets; 

2. 
 provide
 reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with
 U.S. GAAP, and that our receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with the authorization of our management; and 

3. 
 provide
 reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of our assets that
 could have a material effect on the financial statements. 

Because
of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of
any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions,
or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. 

Management
assessed the effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2024. In making this
assessment, management used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission in Internal
Control-Integrated Framework. Management s assessment included an evaluation of the design of our internal control over financial
reporting and testing of the operational effectiveness of these controls. 

10 

As
of September 30, 2024, management assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on the criteria for
effective internal control over financial reporting established in Internal Control Integrated Framework issued by the Committee
of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission COSO in 2013 and SEC guidance on conducting such assessments.
Based on such evaluation, the Company s management concluded that, during the period covered by this Report, our internal control
over financial reporting were not effective due to the presence of material weaknesses. 

Management s
Remediation Initiatives 

Since
2021, we engaged Dude Business Consultants Limited as an external consultant to assist with the identification and address of complex
and proper accounting issues. Dude Business Consultants Limited has extensive experience on US listing and company reporting, including
GAAP conversion, account consolidation and drafting of notes to accounts. Their professional team focus on national stock exchanges and
OTC Markets listing, from corporate restructuring, supervision of listing timeline to strategy planning. 

In
an effort to remediate the identified material weaknesses and other deficiencies and enhance our internal controls, we also plan to initiate
the following series of measures to further strengthen the Company s internal controls going forward: 

1. 
 hire
 a reporting manager Internal Finance Manager who has the requisite relevant U.S. GAAP and SEC reporting experience
 and qualifications; 

2. 
 make
 an overall assessment on the current finance and accounting resources and hire additional accounting members with appropriate levels
 of accounting knowledge and experience; 

3. 
 streamline
 our accounting department structure and enhance our staff s U.S. GAAP and SEC reporting requirements on a continuous basis
 through internal training provided by the Internal Finance manager; 

4. 
 participate
 in trainings and seminars provided by professional services firms on a regular basis to gain knowledge on regular U.S. GAAP / SEC
 reporting requirements updates; and 

5. 
 engage
 an external Sarbanes-Oxley 404 consulting firm to help us implement Sarbanes-Oxley 404 internal controls compliance
 together with the establishment of our internal audit function. 

We
anticipate that these initiatives will be at least partially, if not fully, implemented by the end of fiscal year 2025. 

Changes
in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 

There
were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the three months ended September 30, 2024, that have materially
affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

January 2023, SCQC transferred a total of RMB1,000,000 (approximately 142,420) to Sichuan Aima as an advance payment for the
cooperative arrangement under the agreement. However, negotiations in March 2023 were unproductive, leading both parties to
terminate the cooperation. Sichuan Aima provided partial compensation to SCQC by offsetting the outstanding amount with goods of
equivalent value at RMB 466,637.20 (approximately 66,458). SCQC is now pursuing the recovery of the remaining balance of
RMB533,362.80 (approximately 75,961). 

On
September 9, 2024, the Sichuan Free Trade Zone People s Court formally accepted SCQC s claim against Sichuan Aima. The case is
scheduled to be heard on November 19, 2024. As of the date of this report, the case remains unresolved, and no settlement has been
reached. 

While this dispute is not anticipated to have material adverse impacts
on the Company s financial condition or operations, the Company continues to closely monitor its progress. Aside from the above,
the Company is not involved in, nor aware of, any unresolved legal proceedings, investigations, or claims that, in management s
opinion, would have a material adverse effect on its business, financial condition, or results of operations.
