 SPECIAL NOTE ON FORWARD-LOOKING INFORMATION 
 This document, and the documents incorporated by reference in this document, our press releases and oral statements made from time to time by us or on our behalf, may contain certain "forward-looking statements" within the meaning of the federal securities laws, including Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and are based on management's current expectations, that involve risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially from our current expectations. In this context, forward-looking statements often address expected future business and financial performance and financial condition, and often contain words such as "may," "can," "if," "continue," "project," "assumption," "should," "expect," "confidence," "goals," "trends," "anticipate," "intend," "estimate," "on track," "future," "well positioned to," "plan," "potential," "position," "deliver," "believe," "seek," "see," "will," "would," "uncertain," "achieve," "strategic," "growth," "target," "forecast," "outlook," "commit," "innovation," "drive," "proposed acquisition," "we can stretch what s possible," similar expressions, and variations or negatives of these words. Forward-looking statements by their nature address matters that are, to different degrees, uncertain. Such statements involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions. If such risks or uncertainties materialize or such assumptions prove incorrect, the results of Tapestry, Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries could differ materially from those expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements and assumptions. All statements other than statements of historical fact are statements that could be deemed forward-looking statements. Tapestry, Inc. assumes no obligation to revise or update any such forward-looking statements for any reason, except as required by law. 
 Tapestry, Inc. s actual results could differ materially from the results contemplated by these forward-looking statements and are subject to a number of risks, uncertainties, estimates and assumptions that may cause actual results to differ materially from current expectations due to a number of factors, including, but not limited to: (i) the impact of economic conditions, recession and inflationary measures; (ii) our exposure to international risks, including currency fluctuations and changes in economic or political conditions in the markets where we sell or source our products; (iii) our ability to retain the value of our brands and to respond to changing fashion and retail trends in a timely manner, including our ability to execute on our e-commerce and digital strategies; (iv) our ability to successfully implement the initiatives under our 2025 growth strategy; (v) the effect of existing and new competition in the marketplace; (vi) satisfaction of the conditions precedent to consummation of the proposed acquisition of Capri Holdings Limited ("Capri"), including the ability to secure regulatory approval in the United States on the terms expected, at all or in a timely manner; (vii) our ability to achieve intended benefits, cost savings and synergies from acquisitions, including our proposed acquisition of Capri; (xiii) the outcome of the antitrust lawsuit by the Federal Trade Commission against us and Capri related to the consummation of the proposed acquisition; (ix) our ability to control costs; (x) the effect of seasonal and quarterly fluctuations on our sales or operating results; (xi) the risk of cyber security threats and privacy or data security breaches; (xii) our ability to satisfy our outstanding debt obligations or incur additional indebtedness; (xiii) the risks associated with climate change and other corporate responsibility issues; (xiv) the impact of tax and other legislation; (xv) the risks associated with potential changes to international trade agreements and the imposition of additional duties on importing our products; (xvi) our ability to protect against infringement of our trademarks and other proprietary rights; and (xvii) the impact of pending and potential future legal proceedings and (xviii) such other risk factors as set forth in Part II, Item 1A. "Risk Factors" and elsewhere in this report and in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 29, 2024. These factors are not necessarily all of the factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed in any of our forward-looking statements.

 to days after shipment. Wholesale revenue is recorded net of estimates for returns, discounts, end-of-season markdowns, cooperative advertising allowances and other consideration provided to the customer. Discounts are based on contract terms with the customer, while cooperative advertising allowances and other consideration may be based on contract terms or negotiated on a case-by-case basis. Returns and markdowns generally require approval from the Company and are estimated based on historical trends, current season results and inventory positions at the wholesale locations, current market and economic conditions as well as, in select cases, contractual terms. The Company's historical estimates of these variable amounts have not differed materially from actual results. 
 Licensing 
 The Company recognizes licensing revenue over time during the contract period in which licensees are granted access to the Company's trademarks. These arrangements require licensees to pay a sales-based royalty and may include a contractually guaranteed minimum royalty amount. Revenue for contractually guaranteed minimum royalty amounts is recognized ratably over the license year and any excess sales-based royalties are recognized as earned once the minimum royalty threshold is achieved. Payments from the customer are generally due quarterly in an amount based on the licensee's sales of goods bearing the licensed trademarks during the period, which may differ from the amount of revenue recorded during the period thereby generating a contract asset or liability. Contract assets and liabilities and contract costs related to the licensing arrangements are immaterial as the licensing business represents approximately of total net sales in the three months ended September 28, 2024.

 per share, without interest, subject to any required tax withholding as provided in the Merger Agreement. The enterprise value is expected to be approximately billion (the "Capri Acquisition"). On October 25, 2023, at a special meeting of Capri's shareholders, Capri's shareholders approved the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby. The Company has received regulatory approval from all applicable jurisdictions except for the United States. On April 22, 2024, the FTC filed a complaint against the Company and Capri in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York seeking to enjoin the consummation of the Capri Acquisition. The FTC s complaint alleges that the Capri Acquisition, if consummated, would violate Section 7 of the Clayton Act and that the Merger Agreement and the Capri Acquisition constitute unfair methods of competition in violation of Section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act and should be enjoined. The trial commenced on September 9, 2024, and on October 24, 2024, the Court issued its Opinion and Order granting the FTC's request for a preliminary injunction of the Merger, pending an administrative trial on the merits which is scheduled to begin on December 9, 2024. On October 28, 2024, the Company and Capri filed a Notice of Appeal with respect to the October 24, 2024 Opinion and Order. On November 6, 2024, the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit entered an order setting an expedited briefing schedule for the appeal of the decision of the United States District Court of the Southern District of New York granting the preliminary injunction of the merger. Refer to Note 16, "Subsequent Events," for further information. 
 In order to finance the Capri Acquisition, on November 27, 2023, the Company issued billion of senior unsecured notes (the "Capri Acquisition USD Senior Notes") and billion of Euro-denominated senior unsecured notes (the "Capri Acquisition EUR Senior Notes" and, together with the Capri Acquisition USD Senior Notes, the "Capri Acquisition Senior Notes") which, together with the billion of delayed draw unsecured term loan facilities (the "Capri Acquisition Term Loan Facilities") executed on August 30, 2023, complete the expected financing for the Capri Acquisition. Until the close of the transaction, the Company will maintain the proceeds from the issuance of the Capri Acquisition Senior Notes in Cash and cash equivalents and Short-term investments. If (i) the Capri Acquisition has not been completed by February 10, 2025 (or such later date mutually agreed between the Company and Capri) (such date, the Special Mandatory Redemption End Date ), (ii) prior to the Special Mandatory Redemption End Date, the Merger Agreement is terminated in accordance with its terms or (iii) the Company otherwise notifies the trustee that it will not pursue the consummation of the Capri Acquisition, all of the Capri Acquisition Senior Notes will be redeemed at a redemption price equal to of their principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest to, but excluding, the special mandatory redemption date. Refer to Note 13, "Investments," and Note 12, "Fair Value Measurements," for further detail on our cash equivalents and Short-term investments, and Note 11, "Debt," for further information on our existing debt instruments related to the Capri Acquisition. 
 In conjunction with the Capri Acquisition, the Company incurred million and million respectively, in pre-tax expenses primarily related to financing-related expenses and professional fees during the three months ended September 28, 2024 and September 30, 2023.

 The Company expects that million of net derivative gain related to inventory purchases and interest rates included in Accumulated other comprehensive income at September 28, 2024 will be reclassified into earnings within the next 12 months. This amount will vary due to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. 
 The Company assesses the cross-currency swaps and forward exchange contracts used as net investment hedges under the spot method. This results in the cross-currency basis spread on the cross-currency swaps and the difference between the spot rate and the forward rate of the forward exchange contract being excluded from the assessment of hedge effectiveness, and recorded as incurred as a reduction in Interest expense, net in the Company s Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations. Accordingly, the Company recorded net interest income of million and million during three months ended September 28, 2024 and September 30, 2023 , respectively.

 Earnings per share amounts have been calculated based on unrounded numbers. Options to purchase shares of the Company's common stock at an exercise price greater than the average market price of the common stock during the reporting period are anti-dilutive and therefore not included in the computation of diluted net income (loss) per common share. In addition, the Company has outstanding restricted stock unit awards that are issuable only upon the achievement of certain performance goals. Performance-based restricted stock unit awards are included in the computation of diluted shares only to the extent that the underlying performance conditions and any applicable market condition modifiers (i) are satisfied as of the end of the reporting period or (ii) would be considered satisfied if the end of the reporting period were the end of the related contingency period and the result would be dilutive under the treasury stock method. As of September 28, 2024 and September 30, 2023, there were million and million, respectively, of additional shares issuable upon exercise of anti-dilutive options and contingent vesting of performance-based restricted stock unit awards, which were excluded from the diluted share calculations.

Capri Holdings Limited Acquisition 
 On August 10, 2023, the Company entered into the Merger Agreement by and among the Company, Sunrise Merger Sub, Inc., a direct wholly owned subsidiary of Tapestry, and Capri for 57.00 per share in cash for a total enterprise value of approximately 8.50 billion. The Capri Acquisition, once completed, will bring together six highly complementary brands with global reach, powered by the Company s data-rich customer engagement platform and diversified, direct-to-consumer operating model. In order to finance the Capri Acquisition, on November 27, 2023, the Company issued 4.50 billion of U.S. dollar-denominated senior unsecured notes (the "Capri Acquisition USD Senior Notes") and 1.50 billion of Euro-denominated senior unsecured notes (the "Capri Acquisition EUR Senior Notes" and, together with the Capri Acquisition USD Senior Notes, the "Capri Acquisition Senior Notes") which, together with the 1.40 billion of delayed draw unsecured term loan facilities (the "Capri Acquisition Term Loan Facilities") executed on August 30, 2023, complete the expected financing for the Capri Acquisition. The Company has received regulatory approval from all applicable jurisdictions except for the United States. On April 22, 2024, the FTC filed a complaint against the Company and Capri in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York seeking to enjoin the consummation of the Capri Acquisition. The FTC s complaint alleges that the Capri Acquisition, if consummated, would violate Section 7 of the Clayton Act and that the Merger Agreement and the Capri Acquisition constitute unfair methods of competition in violation of Section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act and should be enjoined. The trial commenced on September 9, 2024, and on October 24, 2024, the Court issued its Opinion and Order granting the FTC's request for a preliminary injunction of the Merger, pending an administrative trial on the merits which is scheduled to begin on December 9, 2024. On October 28, 2024, the Company and Capri filed a Notice of Appeal with respect to the October 24, 2024 Opinion and Order. On November 6, 2024, the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit entered an order setting an expedited briefing schedule for the appeal of the decision of the United States District Court of the Southern District of New York granting the preliminary injunction of the merger. Refer to Note 5, "Acquisitions" and Note 16, "Subsequent Events" for further information. 
 2025 Growth Strategy 
 In the first quarter of fiscal 2023, the Company introduced the 2025 growth strategy future speed ), designed to amplify and extend the competitive advantages of its brands, with a focus on four strategic priorities: 
 Building Lasting Customer Relationships: The Company s brands aim to leverage Tapestry s transformed business model to drive customer lifetime value through a combination of increased customer acquisition, retention and reactivation. 
 Fueling Fashion Innovation Product Excellence: The Company aims to drive sustained growth in core handbags and small leathergoods, while accelerating gains in footwear and lifestyle products. 
 Delivering Compelling Omni-Channel Experiences: The Company aims to extend its omni-channel leadership to meet the customer wherever they shop, delivering growth online and in stores. 
 Powering Global Growth: The Company aims to support balanced growth across regions, prioritizing North America and China, its largest markets, while capitalizing on opportunities in under-penetrated geographies such as Southeast Asia and Europe. 
 GLOBAL ECONOMIC CONDITIONS AND INDUSTRY TRENDS 
 The environment in which we operate is subject to a number of different factors driving global consumer spending. Consumer preferences, macroeconomic conditions, foreign currency fluctuations and geopolitical events continue to impact overall levels of consumer travel and spending on discretionary items, with inconsistent patterns across business channels and geographies. 
 We will continue to monitor the below trends and evaluate and adjust our operating strategies and cost management opportunities to mitigate the related impact on our results of operations, while remaining focused on the long-term growth of our business and protecting the value of our brands. 
 For a detailed discussion of significant risk factors that have the potential to cause our actual results to differ materially from our expectations, see Part I, Item 1A. "Risk Factors" herein and as disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended June 29, 2024. 
 Current Macroeconomic Conditions and Outlook 
 During the first quarter of fiscal 2025, the macroeconomic environment remained challenging and volatile. Several organizations that monitor the world s economy, including the International Monetary Fund, continue to forecast growth in the global economy, and remains unchanged since the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024. The forecast is below the historical growth average and is reflective of the current volatile environment, including tighter monetary and fiscal policies which have 
 29 

continued to moderate inflation, financial market volatility and the negative economic impacts of geopolitical instability in certain regions of the world. 
 In the first quarter of fiscal 2025, the U.S. Dollar continued to fluctuate as compared to foreign currencies in regions where we conduct our business. This trend has resulted in impacts to our business including, but not limited to, a decrease in Net sales of 6.0 million, a positive impact to gross margin of approximately 40 basis points which benefited from the Company's hedging activity and approximately 10 basis point positive impact to operating margin. 
 Currency volatility, political instability, such as the uncertainty associated with the potential impact of the new policies that may be implemented as a result of the U.S. Presidential election and potential changes to trade agreements or duty rates may also contribute to a worsening of the macroeconomic environment or adversely impact our business. Since fiscal 2019, the U.S. and China have both imposed tariffs on the importation of certain product categories into the respective country, with limited progress in negotiations to reduce or remove the tariffs. 
 During fiscal 2024, certain geopolitical events have impacted trade routes in the Red Sea which have modestly increased inventory in-transit times and costs. The Company has taken actions to minimize any potential disruptions and at this time, does not anticipate material impact to our business or operating results. We will continue to closely monitor the situation. 
 In response to the current environment, the Company continues to take strategic actions considering near-term exigencies and remains committed to maintaining the health of the brands and business. 
 Tax Legislation 
 On August 16, 2022, the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 was signed into law by the Biden Administration, with tax provisions primarily focused on implementing a 15 CAMT on global adjusted financial statement income and a 1 excise tax on share repurchases. The CAMT was effective at the beginning of fiscal 2024 and did not have a material impact on the Company s effective tax rate. 
 On December 12, 2022, the E.U. member states also reached an agreement to implement the OECD s reform of international taxation known as GloBE, which broadly mirrors the Inflation Reduction Act by imposing a 15 global minimum tax on multinational companies. Based on the countries in which we do business that have enacted legislation effective January 1, 2025, we do not expect the impact of these changes to be material for fiscal 2025. A number of other countries are also implementing similar legislation with effective dates starting in 2026. As a result, we do expect a modest negative impact on the Company s effective tax rate, however, this could change as other countries enact similar legislation and further guidance is released. We continue to closely monitor regulatory developments to assess potential impacts. 
 Seasonality 
 The Company's results are typically affected by seasonal trends. During the first fiscal quarter, we typically build inventory for the winter and holiday season. In the second fiscal quarter, working capital requirements are reduced substantially as we generate higher net sales and operating income, especially during the holiday season. 
 Fluctuations in net sales, operating income and operating cash flows of the Company in any fiscal quarter may be affected by the timing of wholesale shipments and other events affecting retail sales, including weather and macroeconomic events.

 These actions taken together negatively impacted operating income by 19.6 million, increased interest expense by 6.7 million and reduced the provision for income tax by 5.0 million resulting in a net decrease in net income by 21.3 million or 0.09 per diluted share.

Tapestry, Inc. Summary First Quarter of Fiscal 2025 
 Currency Fluctuation Effects 
 The change in net sales for the first quarter of fiscal 2025 compared to the first quarter of fiscal 2024 has been presented both including and excluding currency fluctuation effects. All percentages shown in the tables below and the discussion that follows have been calculated using unrounded numbers.

 Net sales in the first quarter of fiscal 2025 decreased 0.4 or 5.7 million to 1.51 billion. Excluding the impact of foreign currency, Net sales were even compared to the prior year. 
 Coach Net Sales increased 1.1 or 13.2 million to 1.17 billion in the first quarter of fiscal 2025. Excluding the impact of foreign currency, Net sales increased 1.6 or 18.3 million. This increase in Net sales was primarily due to an increase of 32.9 million in DTC sales driven by e-commerce sales globally. The increase in DTC sales was partially offset by a net 11.7 million decrease in wholesale sales driven by North America, which was partially offset by an increase in international wholesale sales. 
 Kate Spade Net Sales decreased 6.6 or 20.0 million to 283.2 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2025. Excluding the impact of foreign currency, Net sales decreased 6.3 or 18.9 million. This decrease in Net sales was due to a decrease of 24.4 million in DTC sales as a result of lower store and to a lesser extent, e-commerce sales. The decrease in DTC sales was partially offset by an increase of 4.9 million in wholesale sales. 
 Stuart Weitzman Net Sales increased 2.1 or 1.1 million to 53.7 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2025. Excluding the impact of foreign currency, Net sales increased 2.0 or 1.0 million.

 Gross profit increased 3.4 or 37.2 million to 1.13 billion in the first quarter of fiscal 2025 from 1.10 billion in the first quarter of fiscal 2024. Gross margin increased 280 basis points to 75.3 in the first quarter of fiscal 2025 from 72.5 in the first quarter of fiscal 2024. This increase in Gross margin was primarily attributed to net pricing improvements, lower freight costs and favorable currency impacts. Refer to "Current Macroeconomic Conditions and Outlook" for further information. 
 The Company includes inbound product-related transportation costs from our service providers within Cost of sales. The Company, similar to some companies, includes certain transportation-related costs due to our distribution network in SG A expenses rather than in Cost of sales; for this reason, our gross margins may not be comparable to that of entities that include all costs related to their distribution network in Cost of sales.

Excluding items affecting comparability of 33.4 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2025, SG A expenses increased 3.0 or 24.6 million to 849.5 million from 824.9 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2024. SG A as a percentage of net sales increased 190 basis points to 56.4 compared to 54.5 during the first quarter of fiscal 2024. This increase in SG A as a percentage of net sales was primarily due to higher marketing spend and increased compensation costs. 
 (1) In the first quarter of fiscal 2025, Corporate incurred charges affecting comparability of 33.4 million. Excluding those items affecting comparability, SG A expenses increased 3.6 or 4.3 million to 120.8 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2025 as compared to 116.5 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2024.

 Operating income decreased 1.2 million to 252.0 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2025 as compared to 253.2 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2024. Operating margin remained even at 16.7 in the first quarter of fiscal 2025 as compared to the first quarter of fiscal 2024. Excluding items affecting comparability of 33.4 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2025, operating income increased 12.6 million to 285.4 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2025 from 272.8 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2024; and operating margin increased 90 basis points to 18.9 in the first quarter of fiscal 2025 as compared to 18.0 in the first quarter of fiscal 2024. This increase in operating margin was primarily attributed to a 280 basis points increase in gross margin partially offset by an increase of 190 basis points in SG A as a percentage of sales. 
 Coach Operating Income increased 15.3 million to 386.6 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2025, resulting in an operating margin increase of 90 basis points to 33.0 , as compared to 371.3 million and 32.1 , respectively, in the first quarter of fiscal 2024. This increase in operating margin was primarily attributed to: 
 Gross Margin, increased 330 basis points mainly due to net pricing improvements, favorable currency impacts and lower freight costs; 
 SG A expenses as a percentage of net sales , increased 240 basis points mainly due to higher marketing spend and increased compensation costs.

This increase in operating margin was primarily attributed to: 
 Gross Margin , increased 140 basis points mainly due to lower freight costs; 
 SG A expenses as a percentage of net sales, increased 60 basis points mainly driven by higher occupancy costs due to one time corporate headquarter relocation, higher marketing spend, partially offset by lower depreciation. 
 Stuart Weitzman Operating Loss decreased 1.2 million to a loss of 7.4 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2025, resulting in an operating margin increase of 260 basis points to (13.7) , as compared to an operating loss of 8.6 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2024 and an operating margin of (16.3) . 
 Corporate Operating Expenses increased 13.3 or 18.1 million to 154.2 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2025. Excluding items affecting comparability, Corporate operating expenses increased 4.3 million to 120.8 million from 116.5 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2024. This increase in operating expenses was attributed to an increase in SG A expenses primarily due to higher compensation costs and higher professional fees, partially offset by lower occupancy costs. 
 Interest Expense, net 
 Net interest expense increased 17.4 million to 30.7 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2025 as compared to 13.3 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2024. Excluding items affecting comparability, net interest expense decreased 13.3 million to (6.7) million from 6.6 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2024. This decrease in Interest expense, net, was due to a decrease in interest expense on the Term Loan due 2027 as a result of repayment in fiscal 2024 and higher interest income. 
 Other Expense (Income) 
 Other income increased 5.8 million to 4.4 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2025 as compared to Other expense of 1.4 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2024. This increase in other income was related to an increase in foreign exchange gains. 
 Provision (Benefit) for Income Taxes 
 The effective tax rate was 17.3 in the first quarter of fiscal 2025 as compared to 18.2 in the first quarter of fiscal 2024. Excluding items affecting comparability, the effective tax rate was 18.5 in the first quarter of fiscal 2025 as compared to 18.3 in the first quarter of fiscal 2024. 
 Net Income (Loss) 
 Net income decreased 4.3 or 8.4 million to 186.6 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2025 as compared to 195.0 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2024.

Excluding items affecting comparability, net income per diluted share increased 0.09 to 1.02 in the first quarter of fiscal 2025 from 0.93 in the first quarter of fiscal 2024, primarily due to higher net income.

NON-GAAP MEASURES 
 The Company s reported results are presented in accordance with GAAP. The reported SG A expenses, operating income, interest expense, provision for income taxes, net income and earnings per diluted share in the first quarter of fiscal 2025 and fiscal 2024 reflect certain items affecting comparability, including the impact of Acquisition costs. As a supplement to the Company's reported results, these metrics are also reported on a non-GAAP basis to exclude the impact of these items along with a reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP measures. 
 These non-GAAP performance measures were used by management to conduct and evaluate its business during its regular review of operating results for the periods affected. Management and the Company s Board utilized these non-GAAP measures to make decisions about the uses of Company resources, analyze performance between periods, develop internal projections and measure management performance. The Company s internal management reporting excluded these items. In addition, the human resources committee of the Company s Board uses these non-GAAP measures when setting and assessing achievement of incentive compensation goals. 
 The Company operates on a global basis and reports financial results in U.S. dollars in accordance with GAAP. Fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates can affect the amounts reported by the Company in U.S. dollars with respect to its foreign revenues and profit. Accordingly, certain material increases and decreases in operating results for the Company and its segments have been presented both including and excluding currency fluctuation effects. These effects occur from translating foreign-denominated amounts into U.S. dollars and comparing to the same period in the prior fiscal year. Constant currency information compares results between periods as if exchange rates had remained constant period-over-period. The Company calculates constant currency revenue results by translating current period revenue in local currency using the prior year period's currency conversion rate. 
 We believe these non-GAAP measures are useful to investors and others in evaluating the Company s ongoing operating and financial results in a manner that is consistent with management's evaluation of business performance and understanding how such results compare with the Company s historical performance. Additionally, we believe presenting certain increases and decreases in constant currency provides a framework for assessing the performance of the Company's business outside the United States and helps investors and analysts understand the effect of significant year-over-year currency fluctuations. We believe excluding these items assists investors and others in developing expectations of future performance. 
 By providing the non-GAAP measures, as a supplement to GAAP information, we believe we are enhancing investors understanding of our business and our results of operations. The non-GAAP financial measures are limited in their usefulness and should be considered in addition to, and not in lieu of, GAAP financial measures. Further, these non-GAAP measures may be unique to the Company, as they may be different from non-GAAP measures used by other companies. 
 For a detailed discussion on these non-GAAP measures, see the GAAP to Non-GAAP Reconciliation discussions above in this Item 2. "Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations."

 The Company s cash and cash equivalents increased by 320.9 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2025 as compared to a decrease of 104.0 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2024, as discussed below. 
 Net cash provided by (used in) operating activities 
 Net cash provided by operating activities increased 44.2 million primarily due to changes in operating assets and liabilities of 104.6 million, lower impact of non-cash adjustments of 52.0 million, as well as lower net income of 8.4 million. 
 The 104.6 million increase in changes in operating asset and liability balances were primarily driven by the following: 
 Accounts payable were a source of cash of 92.9 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2025 compared to a use of cash of 28.4 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2024, primarily driven by higher in-transit inventory and the timing of payments compared to the prior year. 
 Accrued liabilities were a source of cash of 32.0 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2025 compared to a use of cash of 62.0 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2024, primarily driven by an increase in accrued interest due to issuance of the Capri Acquisition Senior Notes, partially offset by accrued incentive compensation. 
 Other assets were a use of cash of 11.5 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2025 compared to a use of cash of 43.1 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2024, primarily driven by a decrease in prepaid expenses due to the timing of renewed information technology projects and insurance prepayments. 
 Inventories were a use of cash of 181.4 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2025 compared to a use of cash of 29.8 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2024, primarily driven by higher in-transit inventory. 
 Net cash provided by (used in) investing activities 
 Net cash provided by investing activities in the first quarter of fiscal 2025 was 190.1 million as compared to a use of cash of 22.8 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2024, resulting in a 212.9 million increase in net cash provided by investing activities. 
 The 190.1 million of cash provided in the first quarter of fiscal 2025 was primarily due to maturities and sales of investments of 1.7 billion, partially offset by purchases of investments of 1.5 billion, mainly related to the proceeds of the Capri Acquisition Senior Notes. 
 The 22.8 million use of cash in the first quarter of fiscal 2024 was primarily due to capital expenditures of 20.9 million. 
 Net cash provided by (used in) financing activities 
 Net cash used in financing activities was 74.5 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2025 as compared to a use of cash of 149.4 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2024, resulting in a net decrease in use of cash for financing activities of 74.9 million. 
 The 74.5 million of cash used in the first quarter of fiscal 2025 was primarily due to dividend payments of 81.4 million and taxes paid to net settle share-based awards of 34.5 million, partially offset by proceeds from share-based awards of 41.7 million. 
 The 149.4 million of cash used in the first quarter of fiscal 2024 was primarily due to dividend payments of 80.2 million and taxes paid to net settle share-based awards of 31.6 million as well as debt issuance costs of 31.4 million. 
 38 

Effect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents 
 Effect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents was 85.8 million as compared to (7.1) million in the first quarter of fiscal 2024 primarily driven by the impact of changes in the exchange rate of the United States Dollar against the Euro on the Capri Acquisition EUR Senior Notes. 
 Working Capital and Capital Expenditures 
 The following table presents our financial condition as of September 28, 2024 and June 29, 2024: 
 September 28, 2024 June 29, 2024 Change (millions) Cash and cash equivalents (1) 
 6,462.9 6,142.0 320.9 Short-term investments (1)

 (7,008.3) (6,937.2) (71.1) Total (6.5) (36.8) 30.3 
 
 (1) As of September 28, 2024, approximately 3.9 of our cash and short-term investments were held outside the United States. 
 (2) Refer to Note 11, "Debt" for discussion of the carrying values of our debt. 
 Sources of Liquidity 
 Our primary sources of liquidity are the cash flows generated from our operations, our cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments, availability under our credit facilities, and other available financing options. 
 The following table presents the total availability, borrowings outstanding and remaining availability under our credit facilities as of September 28, 2024: 
 Total Availability Borrowings Outstanding Remaining Availability (millions) Revolving Credit Facility (1) 
 2,000.0 2,000.0 Capri Acquisition Term Loan Facilities (1) 
 1,400.0 1,400.0 China Credit Facility (1)(2) 
 35.7 35.7 Total 3,435.7 3,435.7 
 
 (1) Refer to Note 11, "Debt" for further information on these instruments. 
 (2) The carrying amounts of the China Credit Facility include the impact of changes in the exchange rate of the United States Dollar against the RMB. 
 We believe that our Revolving Credit Facility is adequately diversified with no undue concentrations in any one financial institution. As of September 28, 2024, there were 18 financial institutions participating in the Revolving Credit Facility and 24 financial institutions participating in the Capri Acquisition Term Loan Facilities, with no one participant maintaining a combined maximum commitment percentage in excess of 10 . We have no reason to believe at this time that the participating institutions will be unable to fulfill their obligations to provide financing in accordance with the terms of the facility in the event we elect to draw funds in the foreseeable future. 
 We have the ability to draw on our credit facilities or access other sources of financing options available to us in the credit and capital markets for, among other things, acquisition or integration-related costs, our restructuring initiatives, settlement of a material contingency, or a material adverse business or macroeconomic development, as well as for other general corporate business purposes. 
 39 

If (i) the Capri Acquisition has not been completed by February 10, 2025 (or such later date mutually agreed between the Company and Capri) (such date, the Special Mandatory Redemption End Date ), (ii) prior to the Special Mandatory Redemption End Date, the Merger Agreement is terminated in accordance with its terms or (iii) the Company otherwise notifies the trustee that it will not pursue the consummation of the Capri Acquisition, all of the Capri Acquisition Senior Notes will be redeemed at a redemption price equal to 101 of their principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest to, but excluding, the special mandatory redemption date. 
 Management believes that cash flows from operations, access to the credit and capital markets and our credit lines, on-hand cash and cash equivalents and our investments will provide adequate funds to support our operating, capital and debt service requirements for fiscal 2025 and beyond. There can be no assurance that any such capital will be available to the Company on acceptable terms or at all. Our ability to fund working capital needs, planned capital expenditures and scheduled debt payments, as well as to comply with all of the financial covenants under our debt agreements, depends on future operating performance and cash flow. This future operating performance and cash flow are subject to prevailing economic conditions, and to financial, business and other factors, some of which are beyond the Company's control. 
 Reference should be made to our most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K and other filings with the SEC for additional information regarding liquidity and capital resources. 
 Supply Chain Finance 
 To improve our working capital efficiency, we make available to certain suppliers, a voluntary supply chain finance SCF program that enables our suppliers to sell their receivables from the Company to a global financial institution on a non-recourse basis at a rate that leverages our credit rating. We do not have the ability to refinance or modify payment terms to the global financial institution through the SCF program. No guarantees are provided by the Company or any of our subsidiaries under the SCF program. Refer to Note 2, "Basis of Presentation and Organization," for additional information. 
 Capital Expenditures 
 During the first quarter of fiscal 2025 capital expenditures and cloud computing implementation costs were 29.6 million. The Company expects total fiscal 2025 capital expenditures and cloud computing cost to be approximately 190 million. Certain cloud computing implementation costs are recognized within Prepaid expenses and Other assets on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. 
 Stock Repurchase Plan 
 On May 12, 2022, the Company announced the Board of Directors authorized the additional repurchase of up to 1.50 billion of its common stock (the "2022 Share Repurchase Program"). Pursuant to this program, purchases of the Company's common stock will be made subject to market conditions and at prevailing market prices, through open market purchases. Repurchased shares of common stock will become authorized but unissued shares. These shares may be issued in the future for general corporate and other purposes. In addition, the Company may terminate or limit the stock repurchase program at any time. As of September 28, 2024 the Company had 800.0 million of additional shares available to be repurchased as authorized under the 2022 Share Repurchase Program. In August 2023, the Company suspended its share repurchase activity in connection with the Capri Acquisition. Refer to Note 5, "Acquisitions," for further information. There were no shares repurchased during the first quarter of fiscal 2025.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES 
 The Company's significant accounting policies are described in Note 3 to the audited consolidated financial statements in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for fiscal 2024. Our discussion of results of operations and financial condition relies on our condensed consolidated financial statements that are prepared based on certain critical accounting policies that require management to make judgments and estimates which are subject to varying degrees of uncertainty. While we believe that these accounting policies are based on sound measurement criteria, actual future events can and often do result in outcomes that can be materially different from these estimates or forecasts. 
 For a complete discussion of our critical accounting policies and estimates, see the "Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates" section of the Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for fiscal 2024. As of September 28, 2024, there have been no material changes to any of the critical accounting policies. 
 The Company performs its annual impairment assessment of goodwill as well as brand intangibles at the beginning of the fourth quarter of each fiscal year. In all fiscal years, the fair values of our Coach brand reporting units significantly exceeded their respective carrying values. The fair values of the Kate Spade brand reporting unit and indefinite-lived brand as of the fiscal 2024 testing date exceeded their carrying values by approximately 20 and 55 , respectively. Several factors could impact the Kate Spade brand's ability to achieve expected future cash flows, including the optimization of the store fleet productivity, the success of international expansion strategies, the impact of promotional activity, continued economic volatility and potential operational challenges related to macroeconomic factors, the reception of new collections in all channels, and other initiatives aimed at increasing profitability of the business. Given the relatively small excess of fair value over carrying value as noted above, if profitability trends decline during fiscal 2025 from those that are expected, it is possible that an interim test, or our annual impairment test, could result in an impairment of those assets. 
 
 ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 
 There have been no significant changes to the Company's market risk or the way the Company manages these exposures as set forth in Part II, Item 7A. "Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk" in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 29, 2024. Refer to Note 8, "Derivative Investments and Hedging Activities," Note 11, "Debt," and Note 13, "Investments," included in Part I of this Form 10-Q for additional information. 
 
 ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 
 Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 We have evaluated under the supervision and with the participation of management, including our principal executive and principal financial officers, the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures, as is defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, as of the end of the fiscal quarter covered by this quarterly report. Based on that evaluation, our principal executive and principal financial officers have concluded that the Company's disclosure controls and procedures were effective at the reasonable assurance level as of the fiscal quarter-end covered by this quarterly report on Form 10-Q. 
 Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 There were no changes in the Company's internal control over financial reporting during the first quarter of 2025 that were identified in connection with management's evaluation required by paragraph (d) of Rules 13a-15 and 15d-15 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company's internal control over financial reporting.

PART II OTHER INFORMATION 
 
 ITEM 1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS 
 The Company is involved in various routine legal proceedings as both plaintiff and defendant incident to the ordinary course of its business, such as to protect Tapestry, Inc.'s intellectual property rights, litigation instituted by persons alleged to have been injured by advertising claims or upon premises within the Company s control, contract disputes, insurance claims and litigation, including wage and hour litigation, with present or former employees. 
 Although the Company's litigation can result in large monetary awards, such as when a civil jury is allowed to determine compensatory and/or punitive damages, the Company believes that the outcome of all pending legal proceedings in the aggregate will not have a material effect on the Company's business or condensed consolidated financial statements. There have been no material developments with respect to any previously reported proceedings. 
 However, as previously disclosed, on August 10, 2023, the Company entered into a Merger Agreement by and among the Company, Merger Sub and Capri, pursuant to which, among other things, Merger Sub will merge with and into Capri (the Merger with Capri surviving the Merger and continuing as a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company. In connection with the Company s proposed acquisition of Capri, we have been named as a defendant in legal proceedings by the FTC. On April 22, 2024, the FTC filed a lawsuit in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York against us and Capri seeking to block the proposed acquisition of Capri, claiming that the proposed acquisition would violate Section 7 of the Clayton Act and that the Merger Agreement and the Merger constitute unfair methods of competition in violation of Section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act and should be enjoined.
