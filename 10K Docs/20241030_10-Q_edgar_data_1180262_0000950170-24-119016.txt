As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the majority of the Company s total outstanding accounts receivable were current. The Company records advance sales deposits when payment is received but revenue has not yet been recognized. In the majority of the Company s markets, advance sales deposits are generally recorded to income when the product is delivered to its Members. Additionally, advance sales deposits also include deferred revenues due to the timing of revenue recognition for products sold through China independent service providers. The estimated deferral period for advance sales deposits is generally within one week. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company recognized substantially all of the revenues that were included within advance sales deposits as of December 31, 2023 and any remaining such balance was not material as of September 30, 2024. Advance sales deposits are included in other current liabilities on the Company s condensed consolidated balance sheets. See Note 14, Detail of Certain Balance Sheet Accounts , for further information. In general, if a Member returns product to the Company on a timely basis, they may obtain replacement product from the Company for such returned products. In addition, in general the Company maintains a buyback program pursuant to which it will repurchase products sold to a Member who has decided to leave the business. Allowances for product returns, primarily in connection with the Company s buyback program, are provided at the time the sale is recorded. This accrual is based upon historical return rates for each country and the relevant return pattern, which reflects anticipated returns to be received over a period of up to 12 months following the original sale. Allowances for product returns were million and million as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. The Company s products are grouped in product categories: weight management; targeted nutrition; energy, sports, and fitness; outer nutrition; and literature and promotional items.

For the assessments related to fiscal years March 31, 2017 and March 31, 2018, the Company received a favorable verdict at the Tax Tribunal level; however, the government has appealed these verdicts to the High Court. The Company intends to litigate these cases for fiscal years ended March 31, 2017, 2018, 2020 and 2021. The Company currently believes that it is more likely than not that it will be successful in supporting its positions relating to these assessments. Accordingly, the Company has not accrued any amounts relating to these matters.

In addition, on August 28, 2020, the Company and the DOJ separately entered into a court-approved deferred prosecution agreement, or DPA, under which the DOJ deferred criminal prosecution of the Company for a period of three years related to a conspiracy to violate the books and records provisions of the FCPA. The Company paid the SEC and the DOJ aggregate penalties, disgorgement and prejudgment interest of approximately million in September 2020, of which million and million were recognized in selling, general, and administrative expenses within the Company s consolidated statements of income for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively, related to this matter. Among other things, the Company was required to undertake compliance self-reporting obligations for the terms of the agreements with the SEC and the DOJ. The DPA s three-year term expired on August 28, 2023. On February 28, 2024, the DOJ determined that the Company has complied with its obligations under the DPA and filed a motion to dismiss the action. The Court subsequently dismissed the deferred charge with prejudice on February 29, 2024. On January 17, 2022, the Company filed a lawsuit, titled Herbalife International of America, Inc. vs. Eastern Computer Exchange, Inc. , against a former technology services vendor in the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California. The Company alleges claims of breach of contract, breach of fiduciary duty, fraudulent concealment, conversion, and declaratory relief related to the defendant s request for payment for technology services and products that the company never authorized. The defendant asserted numerous counterclaims against the Company. On December 28, 2022, the Court partially granted a motion to dismiss counterclaims, leaving only breach of contract, promissory estoppel, and declaratory relief counterclaims. Summary judgment motions were filed, and the Court denied the defendant's motion for summary judgment and partially granted the Company's motion for summary judgment on March 18, 2024. The Company believes the defendant s remaining counterclaim is without merit and will vigorously defend itself while pursuing relief for its own claims. The current trial date for the action is April 8, 2025. The Company is currently unable to reasonably estimate the amount of the loss that may result from an unfavorable outcome and does not believe a loss is probable. 

 markets throughout the world and was organized and managed by five geographic regions: North America, Latin America, EMEA, Asia Pacific, and China. The Company defines its operating segments as those geographical operations. The Company aggregates its operating segments, excluding China, into a reporting segment, or the Primary Reporting Segment, as management believes that the Company s operating segments have similar operating characteristics and similar long-term operating performance. In making this determination, management believes that the operating segments are similar in the nature of the products sold, the product acquisition process, the types of customers to whom products are sold, the methods used to distribute the products, the nature of the regulatory environment, and their economic characteristics. China has been identified as a separate reporting segment as it does not meet the criteria for aggregation. The Company reviews its net sales and contribution margin by operating segment, and reviews its assets and capital expenditures on a consolidated basis and not by operating segment. Therefore, net sales and contribution margin are presented by reportable segment and assets and capital expenditures by segment are not presented.

 million and million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and million and million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The effective income tax rate was and for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 , respectively, and and for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The decrease in the effective tax rate for the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the same period in 2023, was due to changes in the geographic mix of the Company s income and an increase in tax benefits from discrete events. The increase in the effective tax rate for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as, compared to the same period in 2023, was due to changes in the geographic mix of the Company s income, partially offset by an increase in tax benefits from discrete events. As of September 30, 2024 , the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits, including related interest and penalties, was million. If the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits was recognized, million of unrecognized tax benefits, million of interest, and million of penalties would impact the effective tax rate. The Company believes that it is reasonably possible that the amount of unrecognized tax benefits could decrease by up to approximately million within the next twelve months. Of this possible decrease, million would be due to the expiration of statute of limitations in various jurisdictions. The remaining possible decrease of million would be due to the settlement of audits or resolution of administrative or judicial proceedings.

Dividends The Company has not declared or paid cash dividends since 2014. The declaration of future dividends is subject to the discretion of the Company s board of directors and will depend upon various factors, including its earnings, financial condition, Herbalife Ltd. s available distributable reserves under Cayman Islands law, restrictions imposed by the 2024 Credit Facility and the terms of any other indebtedness that may be outstanding, cash requirements, future prospects and other factors deemed relevant by its board of directors. Share Repurchases On February 9, 2021, the Company s board of directors authorized a three-year billion share repurchase program which had approximately million of remaining authorized capacity prior to the share repurchase program expiring on . This share repurchase program allowed the Company, which included an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of Herbalife Ltd., to repurchase the Company s common shares at such times and prices as determined by management, as market conditions warranted, and to the extent Herbalife Ltd. s distributable reserves were available under Cayman Islands law. The 2024 Credit Facility permits the Company to repurchase its common shares as long as no default or event of default exists and other conditions, such as specified consolidated leverage ratios, are met.

t repurchase any of its common shares through open-market purchases. The number of shares issued upon vesting or exercise for certain restricted stock units and SARs granted pursuant to the Company s share-based compensation plans is net of the statutory withholding requirements that the Company pays on behalf of its employees. Although shares withheld are not issued, they are treated as common share repurchases in the Company s condensed consolidated financial statements, as they reduce the number of shares that would have been issued upon vesting. These shares do not count against the authorized capacity under the Company s share repurchase program described above. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the Company withheld shares on its vested restricted stock units and exercised SARs relating to its share-based compensation plans. The Company reflects the aggregate purchase price of its common shares repurchased as an increase to shareholders deficit. The Company generally allocates the purchase price of the repurchased shares to accumulated deficit, common shares and additional paid-in capital. For both the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 , the Company s share repurchases, inclusive of transaction costs, were , under the Company s share repurchase programs, and million and million, respectively, due to shares withheld for tax purposes related to the Company s share-based compensation pl ans and have been recorded as an increase to shareholders deficit within the Company s condensed consolidated balance sheets.

The Company considers all highly liquid investments purchased with a maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents. Cash and cash equivalents are comprised of money market funds and foreign and domestic bank accounts. These cash and cash equivalents are valued based on Level 1 inputs which consist of quoted prices in active markets. To reduce its credit risk, the Company monitors the credit standing of the financial institutions that hold the Company s cash and cash equivalents. The Company s deferred compensation plan assets consist of Company-owned life insurance policies. As these policies are recorded at their cash surrender value, they are not required to be included in the fair value table above.

Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 
 The following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with other information, including our condensed consolidated financial statements and related notes included in Part I, Item 1, Financial Statements , of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, and Part I, Item 1A, Risk Factors , and our consolidated financial statements appearing in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, or the 2023 10-K. Unless the context otherwise requires, all references herein to the Company, we, us or our, or similar terms, refer to Herbalife Ltd., a Cayman Islands exempted company with limited liability, and its consolidated subsidiaries. 
 Overview 
 We are a global nutrition company that sells weight management; targeted nutrition; energy, sports, and fitness; and outer nutrition products to and through independent members, or Members. In China, we sell our products to and through independent service providers and sales representatives to customers and preferred customers, as well as through Company-operated retail platforms when necessary. We refer to Members that distribute our products and achieve certain qualification requirements as sales leaders. 
 We provide high-quality, science-backed products to Members and their customers who seek a healthy lifestyle and we also offer a business opportunity to those Members who seek additional income. We believe enhanced consumer awareness and demand for our products due to global trends such as the obesity epidemic, increasing interest in a fit and active lifestyle, living healthier, and the rise of entrepreneurship, coupled with the effectiveness of personalized selling through a direct sales channel, have been the primary reasons for our continued success. 
 Our products are grouped in four principal categories: weight management; targeted nutrition; energy, sports, and fitness; and outer nutrition, along with literature, promotional, and other items. Our products are often sold through a series of related products and literature designed to simplify weight management and nutrition for consumers and maximize our Members cross-selling opportunities. 
 While we continue to monitor the current global financial environment, including the impacts of the inflation, foreign exchange rate fluctuations, and the wars in Ukraine and the Middle East, we remain focused on the opportunities and challenges in retailing our products and enhancing the customer experience, sponsoring and retaining Members, improving Member productivity, further penetrating existing markets, globalizing successful Daily Methods of Operation, or DMOs, such as Nutrition Clubs, Fit Clubs, and Weight Loss Challenges, introducing new products and globalizing existing products, developing niche market segments and further investing in our infrastructure. 
 We sell our products in five geographic regions: 
 North America; 

Latin America, which consists of Mexico and South and Central America; 

EMEA, which consists of Europe, the Middle East, and Africa; 

Asia Pacific (excluding China); and 

China. 

On July 15, 2016, we reached a settlement with the U.S. Federal Trade Commission, or FTC, and entered into the Consent Order, which resolved the FTC s multi-year investigation of the Company. We continue to monitor the impact of the Consent Order and our Audit Committee assists our board of directors in overseeing continued compliance with the Consent Order. While we currently do not expect the settlement to have a long-term and materially adverse impact on our business and our Member base, our business and our Member base, particularly in the U.S., may be negatively impacted. The terms of the Consent Order do not change our going to market through direct selling by independent distributors, and compensating those distributors based upon the product they and their sales organization sell. See Part I, Item 1A, Risk Factors, of the 2023 10-K for a discussion of risks related to the settlement with the FTC. 
 Certain Factors Impacting Results 
 Global inflationary pressures and other macroeconomic factors such as foreign exchange rate fluctuations and geopolitical conflicts can impact our financial condition, results of operations and liquidity. For example, inflationary pressure impacts both our cost structures and our pricing. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we instituted pricing actions in certain markets to address region or market-specific conditions. We also instituted localized price increases in 2023. These actions are discussed further in the Sales by Geographic Region discussion further below. We continue to examine our cost structure and assess additional potential incremental pricing actions in response to ongoing inflationary pressures. 
 37 

The war in Ukraine has also impacted our results there as well as in Russia and certain neighboring markets; we do not have any manufacturing operations in Russia and Ukraine and our combined total assets in Russia and Ukraine, which primarily consists of short-term assets, was approximately 1 of our consolidated total assets as of September 30, 2024. 
 In addition, during October 2024, a three-day union strike at the U.S. East Coast and Gulf Coast harbors was suspended until January 15, 2025. If an agreement is not reached by the end of the suspension period and the union strike resumes, it may result in delays in the delivery of goods and increased transportation costs. We are actively monitoring these developments. 
 Given the unpredictable and fluid nature of these factors, we are unable to predict the extent to which they will adversely impact our business, financial condition, and results of operations, including the impact they may have on our geographic regions and individual markets. See Summary Financial Results and Sales by Geographic Region for more specific discussion of these and other factors. See Part I, Item 1A, Risk Factors , of the 2023 10-K for a further discussion of risks related to these matters. 
 Volume Points by Geographic Region 
 A key non-financial measure we focus on is Volume Points on a Royalty Basis, or Volume Points, which is essentially our weighted-average measure of product sales volume. Volume Points, which are unaffected by exchange rates or price changes, are used by management as a proxy for sales trends because in general, excluding the impact of price changes, an increase in Volume Points in a particular geographic region or country indicates an increase in our local currency net sales while a decrease in Volume Points in a particular geographic region or country indicates a decrease in our local currency net sales. The criteria we use to determine how and when we recognize Volume Points are not identical to our revenue recognition policies under U.S. GAAP. Unlike net sales, which are generally recognized when the product is delivered and when control passes to the Member, as discussed in greater detail in Note 2, Significant Accounting Policies , to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part I, Item 1, Financial Statements , of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, we recognize Volume Points when a Member pays for the order, which is generally prior to the product being delivered. Further, the periods in which Volume Points are tracked can vary slightly from the fiscal periods for which we report our results under U.S. GAAP. Therefore, there can be timing differences between the product orders for which net sales are recognized and for which Volume Points are recognized within a given period. However, historically these timing differences generally have been immaterial in the context of using changes in Volume Points as a proxy to explain volume-driven changes in net sales. 
 The specific number of Volume Points assigned to a product, which is generally consistent across all markets, is based on a Volume Point to suggested retail price ratio for similar products. If a product is available in different quantities, the various sizes will have different Volume Point values. In general, once assigned, a Volume Point value historically has been consistent in each region and country and has not changed from year to year. For strategic reasons and to respond to market conditions, we may from time to time adjust Volume Point values in particular markets or regions. For example, as described further below in the Latin America section of the Sales by Geographic Region, certain Volume Point values were adjusted during the second quarter of 2024 for most markets within the Latin America region, excluding Mexico. We use Volume Points for Member qualification and recognition purposes, as well as a proxy for sales trends, and therefore, generally, we have historically kept Volume Points for a similar or like product consistent on a global basis. However, because Volume Points are a function of value rather than product type or size, they are not a reliable measure for product mix. As an example, an increase in Volume Points in a specific country or region could mean a significant increase in sales of less expensive products or a marginal increase in sales of more expensive products.

(1) Excluding Volume Point adjustments made during the second quarter of 2024 for most products in Latin America markets, excluding Mexico, the percent change for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 would have been a decrease of 0.4 and 3.4 , respectively. 

(2) Excluding Volume Point adjustments made during the second quarter of 2024 for most products in Latin America markets, excluding Mexico, the percent change for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 would have been a decrease of 5.8 and 5.2 , respectively.

Volume Points decreased 5.4 and 5.0 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, after having decreased 5.6 and 11.0 , respectively, for the same periods in 2023. Excluding the adjustments made during the second quarter of 2024, Volume Points decreased 5.8 and 5.2 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively. 
 
 North America s Volume Point decreased for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the same periods in 2023, and the decreases were less than the prior period decreases. In North America, we continue to enhance our educational, training, and motivational programs and promotions. Latin America s Volume Point increased for the third quarter and had lesser Volume Point decreases for year to date in 2024 as compared to the same periods in 2023. Excluding the Volume Point adjustments, mentioned above, Latin America s Volume Point remained relatively flat for the third quarter as compared to the same period in 2023. In Latin America we have implemented certain pricing changes and marketing plan changes in most markets in the region during the second quarter of 2024, excluding Mexico, which we believe did positively impact certain of the region s markets; however, the year to date fluctuations continue to reflect the difficult economic conditions including inflationary impacts on Members operations, and political and social instability in certain markets. EMEA s Volume Point decreased for the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the same period in 2023 and the decreases were higher than the prior period decreases. EMEA s Volume Point decreased for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the same period in 2023, and the decreases were less than the prior period decreases. The Asia Pacific region Volume Point decreased for the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the same period in 2023, after a slight year-over-year increase for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The Asia Pacific region was relatively flat for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the same period in 2023, after a year-over-year decrease for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. In our India market, the largest market in the region, our growth rate for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was less than the growth rate experienced during the same period in 2023, and we also saw a slight Volume Point decline during the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to same period in 2023. China s Volume Point decreased for the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the same period in 2023, and the decreases were comparable to the year-over-year decreases during the three months ended September 30, 2023. China s Volume Point decreased for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the same period in 2023, and the decrease was less than prior period decrease. We believe, the recent economic difficulties experienced in the region are a contributing factor in China s recent Volume Point decreases. 
 
 For additional discussion on changes in net sales and volume points by region, refer to Sales by Geographic Region below. 
 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, our regions introduced a new training and recognition program that encourages recruitment and activity of new distributors. Despite the decreases in new Members in many of our markets, we believe this new training and recognition program could have been a contributing factor to increases in our new distributors in many of our markets during the third quarter of 2024. 
 
 Presentation 
 Net sales represent product sales to our Members, net of distributor allowances , and inclusive of any shipping and handling revenues, as described further below. 
 Our Members purchase product from us at a suggested retail price, less discounts referred to as distributor allowance . Each Member s level of discount is determined by qualification based on their volume of purchases. In cases where a Member has qualified for less than the maximum discount, the remaining discount, which we also refer to as a wholesale commission, is received by their sponsoring Members. Distributor allowances may also vary by country depending upon regulatory restrictions that limit or otherwise restrict distributor allowances. We also offer reduced distributor allowances with respect to certain products worldwide. 
 For U.S. GAAP purposes, shipping and handling services relating to product sales are recognized as fulfillment activities on our performance obligation to transfer products and are therefore recorded within net sales as part of product sales and are not considered as separate revenues. 
 In certain geographic markets, we have introduced segmentation of our Member base into two categories: preferred members who are simply consumers who wish to purchase product for their own household use, and distributors who are Members who also wish to resell products or build a sales organization. Additionally, in certain markets we are simplifying our pricing by eliminating certain shipping and handling charges and recovering those costs within suggested retail price.

Our international operations have provided and will continue to provide a significant portion of our total net sales. As a result, total net sales will continue to be affected by fluctuations in the U.S. dollar against foreign currencies. In order to provide a framework for assessing how our underlying businesses performed excluding the effect of foreign currency fluctuations, in addition to comparing the percent change in net sales from one period to another in U.S. dollars, we also compare the percent change in net sales from one period to another period using net sales in local currency. Net sales in local currency is not a U.S. GAAP financial measure. Net sales in local currency removes from net sales in U.S. dollars the impact of changes in exchange rates between the U.S. dollar and the local currencies of our foreign subsidiaries, by translating the current period net sales into U.S. dollars using the same foreign currency exchange rates that were used to translate the net sales for the previous comparable period. We believe presenting net sales in local currency is useful to investors because it allows a meaningful comparison of net sales of our foreign operations from period to period. However, net sales in local currency measures should not be considered in isolation or as an alternative to net sales in U.S. dollar measures that reflect current period exchange rates, or to other financial measures calculated and presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP. 
 Our gross profit consists of net sales less cost of sales, which represents our manufacturing costs, the price we pay to our raw material suppliers and manufacturers of our products as well as shipping and handling costs, including duties, tariffs, and similar expenses. 
 While certain Members may profit from their activities by reselling our products for amounts greater than the prices they pay us, Members that develop, retain, and manage other Members may earn additional compensation for those activities, which we refer to as Royalty overrides. Royalty overrides are a significant operating expense and consist of: 
 royalty overrides and production bonuses; 

the Mark Hughes bonus payable to some of our most senior Members; and 

other discretionary incentive bonuses to qualifying Members. 

Royalty overrides are compensation to Members for the development, retention and improved productivity of their sales organizations and are paid to several levels of Members on each sale. Royalty overrides are compensation for services rendered to us and, as such, are recorded as an operating expense. 
 In China, our independent service providers are compensated for marketing, sales support, and other services instead of the distributor allowances and royalty overrides utilized in our global Marketing Plan. The majority of service fees to China independent service providers are included in selling, general, and administrative expenses. 
 Because of local country regulatory constraints, we may be required to modify our Member incentive plans as described above. We also pay reduced royalty overrides with respect to certain products worldwide. Consequently, the total Royalty override percentage may vary over time. 
 Our contribution margins consist of net sales less cost of sales, Royalty overrides, and service fees to our independent service providers in China, for the purposes of segment reporting specifically, as discussed further below and described in our Note 6, Segment Information, to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part I, Item 1, Financial Statements , of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. 
 Selling, general, and administrative expenses represent our operating expenses, which include labor and benefits, service fees to China independent service providers, sales events, professional fees, travel and entertainment, Member promotions, occupancy costs, communication costs, bank fees, depreciation and amortization, foreign exchange gains and losses, and other miscellaneous operating expenses. 
 Our other operating income consists of government grant income related to China. 
 Our other expense (income), net consists of non-operating income and expenses such as gains or losses on extinguishment of debt. 
 Most of our sales to Members outside the United States are made in the respective local currencies. In preparing our financial statements, we translate revenues into U.S. dollars using average exchange rates. Additionally, the majority of our purchases from our suppliers generally are made in U.S. dollars. Consequently, a strengthening of the U.S. dollar versus a foreign currency can have a negative impact on gross profit and can generate foreign currency losses on intercompany transactions. Foreign currency exchange rates can fluctuate significantly. From time to time, we enter into foreign currency derivatives to partially mitigate our foreign currency exchange risk as discussed in further detail in Part I, Item 3, Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk , of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.

Summary Financial Results 
 Net sales were 1,240.3 million and 3,785.7 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively. Net sales decreased 41.0 million, or 3.2 , and 61.7 million, or 1.6 , for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, as compared to the same periods in 2023. In local currency, net sales decreased 0.3 and increased 0.8 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, as compared to the same periods in 2023. The 3.2 decrease in net sales for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily driven by a decrease in sales volume, as indicated by a 5.4 decrease in Volume Points, and a 2.9 unfavorable impact of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, partially offset by a 4.8 favorable impact of price increases. The 1.6 decrease in net sales for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily driven by a decrease in sales volume, as indicated by a 5.0 decrease in Volume Points, and a 2.4 unfavorable impact of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, partially offset by a 5.8 favorable impact of price increases. 
 Net income was 47.4 million, or 0.46 per diluted share, and 76.4 million, or 0.75 per diluted share, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively.

The increase in net income for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was mainly due to 11.3 million lower selling, general, and administrative expenses, and 10.6 million lower royalty overrides, partially offset by 18.0 million higher interest expense, net. The decrease in net income for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was mainly due to 46.8 million higher selling, general, and administrative expenses, 35.8 million higher interest expense, net, and a 10.5 million loss on extinguishment of debt related to the April 2024 debt refinancing transactions, partially offset by 25.8 million lower royalty overrides, and 12.9 million lower income taxes.

 The income tax impact of the expenses discussed above is based on forecasted items affecting our 2024 full year effective tax rate. Adjustments to forecasted items unrelated to these expenses, as well as impacts related to interim reporting, will have an effect on the income tax impact of these items in subsequent periods. 
 Net income for the three months ended September 30, 2023 included a 12.1 million pre-tax unfavorable impact 11.4 million post-tax) of expenses relating to our new Digital Technology Program focused on enhancing and rebuilding our Member facing technology platform and web-based Member tools; an 8.6 million pre-tax unfavorable impact 7.2 million post-tax) related to the Korea customs duty settlement (See Note 5, Contingencies , to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in our 2023 10-K for further discussion); a 4.6 million pre-tax unfavorable impact 4.8 million post-tax) of Transformation Program expenses, primarily relating to employee retention and separation costs; and a 1.0 million favorable impact 0.9 million post-tax) on the extinguishment of a portion of the 2024 Convertible Notes (See Note 4, Long-Term Debt , to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part I, Item 1, Financial Statements , of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for further discussion).

Reporting Segment Results 
 We aggregate our operating segments, excluding China, into a reporting segment, or the Primary Reporting Segment. The Primary Reporting Segment includes the North America, Latin America, EMEA, and Asia Pacific regions. China has been identified as a separate reporting segment as it does not meet the criteria for aggregation. See Note 6, Segment Information , to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part I, Item 1, Financial Statements , of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for further discussion of our reporting segments. See below for discussions of net sales and contribution margin by our reporting segments. 
 Net Sales by Reporting Segment 
 The Primary Reporting Segment reported net sales of 1,165.5 million and 3,554.0 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, representing a decrease of 26.3 million, or 2.2 , and 48.2 million, or 1.3 , respectively, as compared to the same periods in 2023. In local currency, net sales increased 1.0 for both the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, as compared to the same periods in 2023. The 2.2 decrease in net sales for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily due to a decrease in sales volume, as indicated by a 5.0 decrease in Volume Points, and a 3.2 unfavorable impact of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, partially offset by a 5.2 favorable impact of price increases. The 1.3 decrease in net sales for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily due to a decrease in sales volume, as indicated by a 5.1 decrease in Volume Points, and a 2.4 unfavorable impact of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, partially offset by a 6.2 favorable impact of prices increases. 
 42 

For a discussion of China s net sales for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, see the China section of Sales by Geographic Region below. 
 Contribution Margin by Reporting Segment 
 As discussed above under Presentation, contribution margin consists of net sales less cost of sales, Royalty overrides, and service fees to our independent service providers in China. Also, as discussed in Note 6, Segment Information , to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part I, Item 1, Financial Statements , of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, in the second quarter of 2024, the Company changed its presentation of this segment reporting measure for its China segment. Historical information discussed below has been adjusted to conform with the current period contribution margin. This change had no impact on the Company's accompanying condensed consolidated statements of income and only impacts the China contribution margin amounts discussed below and the operating information table in Note 6, Segment Information , to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part I, Item 1, Financial Statements , of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. 
 The Primary Reporting Segment reported contribution margin of 502.2 million, or 43.1 of net sales, and 1,517.1 million, or 42.7 of net sales for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, representing an increase of 16.1 million, or 3.3 , and 40.9 million, or 2.8 , respectively, as compared to the same periods in 2023. The 3.3 increase in contribution margin for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily the result of an 8.7 favorable impact of price increases and a 2.6 favorable impact of cost changes related to self-manufacturing and sourcing, partially offset by a 5.0 unfavorable impact of volume decreases as indicated by a decrease in Volume Points, and a 3.2 unfavorable impact of foreign currency fluctuations. The 2.8 increase in contribution margin for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily the result of a 10.3 favorable impact of price increases, partially offset by a 5.1 unfavorable impact of volume decreases as indicated by a decrease in Volume Points, and a 2.1 unfavorable impact of foreign currency fluctuations. 
 China reported contribution margin of 25.6 million and 79.6 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, representing a decrease of 4.7 million, or 15.5 , and 2.6 million, or 3.2 , for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, as compared to the same periods in 2023. The 15.5 decrease in contribution margin for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily the result of a 14.9 unfavorable impact of volume decreases as indicated by a decrease in Volume Points and a 3.4 unfavorable impact of sales mix, partially offset by a 3.2 favorable impact of cost changes related to self-manufacturing and sourcing. The 3.2 decrease in contribution margin for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily the result of a 2.9 unfavorable impact of foreign currency fluctuations, a 2.7 unfavorable impact of volume decreases as indicated by a decrease in Volume Points and a 2.6 unfavorable impact of sales mix. As described in the China section of the Sales by Geographic Region below, if Volume Points were recognized consistent with the timing of when net sales are recognized in accordance with U.S. GAAP, the unfavorable impact of volume decreases would have been 0.5 .

Changes in net sales are directly associated with the retailing of our products, recruitment of new Members, and retention of sales leaders. Our strategies involve providing quality products, improved DMOs, including daily consumption approaches such as Nutrition Clubs, easier access to product, systemized training and education of Members on our products and methods, leveraging technology to make it easier for our Members to do business, and continued promotion and branding of Herbalife products. 
 43 

Management s role, in-country and at the region and corporate level, is to provide Members with a competitive, broad, and innovative product line, offer leading-edge business tools and technology services, and encourage strong teamwork and Member leadership to make doing business with Herbalife simple. We continue to provide our Members with enhanced technology tools, which includes updated brand sites, for ordering, business performance, and customer retailing to make it easier for them to do business with us and to optimize their customers experiences. Management uses the Marketing Plan, which reflects the rules for our global network marketing organization that specify the qualification requirements and general compensation structure for Members, coupled with educational, training, and motivational programs and promotions to encourage Members to increase retailing, retention, and recruiting, which in turn affect net sales. Such programs include sales events such as Extravaganzas, Leadership Development Weekends and World Team Schools where large groups of Members network with other Members, learn retailing, retention, and recruiting techniques from our leading Members, and become more familiar with how to market and sell our products and business opportunities. Accordingly, management believes that these development and motivation programs increase the productivity of the sales leader network. The expenses for such programs are included in selling, general, and administrative expenses. We also use event and non-event product promotions to motivate Members to increase retailing, retention, and recruiting activities. These promotions have prizes ranging from qualifying for events to product prizes and vacations. In a number of markets, we have segmented our Member base into preferred members and distributors for more targeted and efficient communication and promotions for these two differently motivated types of Members. In certain other markets that have not been segmented, we use Member data to similarly categorize Members for communication and promotion efforts. 
 DMOs are being generated in many of our markets and are globalized where applicable through the combined efforts of Members and country, regional and corporate management. While we support a number of different DMOs, one of the most popular DMOs is the daily consumption DMO. Under our traditional DMO, a Member typically sells to its customers on an infrequent basis (e.g., monthly) which provides fewer opportunities for interaction with their customers. Under a daily consumption DMO, a Member interacts with its customers on a more frequent basis, including such activities as weekly weigh-ins, which enables the Member to better educate and advise customers about nutrition and the proper use of the products and helps promote daily usage as well, thereby helping the Member grow his or her business. Specific examples of globalized DMOs include the Nutrition Club concept in Mexico and the Weight Loss Challenge in the United States. Management s strategy is to review the applicability of expanding successful country initiatives throughout a region, and where appropriate, support the globalization of these initiatives. 
 The factors described above help Members increase their business, which in turn helps drive Volume Point growth in our business, and thus, net sales growth. The discussion below of net sales details some of the specific drivers of changes in our business and causes of sales fluctuations during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the same periods in 2023, as well as the unique growth or contraction factors specific to certain geographic regions or significant markets within a region during these periods. Net sales fluctuations, both Company-wide and within a particular geographic region or market, are primarily the result of changes in volume, changes in prices, or changes in foreign currency translation rates. The discussion of changes in net sales quantifies the impact of those drivers that are quantifiable such as changes in foreign currency translation rates, and cites the estimated impact of any significant price changes. The remaining drivers, which management believes are the primary drivers of changes in volume, are typically qualitative factors whose impact cannot be quantified. We use Volume Points as an indication for changes in sales volume. 
 Global inflationary pressures, supply chain challenges and other macroeconomic factors such as geopolitical conflict may impact both our cost structures and our pricing, with potential sales volume impact. However, given the unpredictable, unprecedented, and fluid nature of these factors, we are unable to predict the extent to which they will adversely impact our business, financial condition, and results of operations, including the impact it may have on our regions and individual markets. We continue to examine our cost structure and assess potential incremental pricing actions in response to ongoing inflationary pressures which could impact our net sales and sales volumes. See below for a more detailed discussion of each geographic region and individual market. 
 North America 
 The North America region reported net sales of 260.4 million and 809.4 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively. Net sales decreased 17.4 million, or 6.3 , and 69.2 million, or 7.9 , for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, as compared to the same periods in 2023. In local currency, net sales decreased 6.2 and 7.9 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, as compared to the same periods in 2023. The 6.3 decrease in net sales for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily due to a decrease in sales volume, as indicated by a 10.3 decrease in Volume Points, partially offset by a 5.0 favorable impact of price increases. The 7.9 decrease in net sales for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily due to a decrease in sales volume, as indicated by a 13.2 decrease in Volume Points, partially offset by a 5.3 favorable impact of price increases.

Net sales in the U.S. were 253.5 million and 787.5 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively. Net sales decreased 16.6 million, or 6.1 , and 67.1 million, or 7.9 , for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, as compared to the same periods in 2023. 
 Sales volumes continued to decline for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the 2023 prior year periods. Despite increases in new distributors, we continue to have fewer total number of new Members in the region during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the prior year periods. We are supporting Members with new product launches, a new training and recognition program, targeted communications and sales incentives, as well as modernizing our technological tools in order to enhance our Members ability to market and sell our products and promote business opportunities. The region implemented 3.0 price increases during March 2024. During 2023, the region implemented 3.5 price increases during March 2023 and September 2023. 
 Latin America 
 The Latin America region reported net sales of 207.1 million and 633.0 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively. Net sales decreased 4.9 million, or 2.3 , and increased 8.5 million, or 1.4 , for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, as compared to the same periods in 2023. In local currency, net sales increased 9.4 and 5.4 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, as compared to the same periods in 2023. The 2.3 decrease in net sales for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was due to an 11.7 unfavorable impact of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, partially offset by a 5.2 favorable impact of net price increases, and an increase in sales volume, as indicated by a 1.5 increase in Volume Points (0.4 decrease excluding the impact of the Volume Point adjustments noted above in the Volume Points by Geographic Region section). The 1.4 increase in net sales for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was due to a 6.9 favorable impact of net price increases, partially offset by a 4.1 unfavorable impact of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, and a decrease in sales volume, as indicated by a 2.2 decrease in Volume Points (3.4 decrease excluding the impact of the Volume Point adjustments noted above in the Volume Points by Geographic Region section). As described further above, Volume Points are generally recognized when a Member pays for an order, while net sales are generally recognized when product is delivered and when control passes to the Member or customer. If Volume Points were recognized consistent with the timing of when net sales are recognized in accordance with U.S. GAAP, sales volume for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 would have been an increase of 5.2 and a decrease of 0.8 , respectively (3.3 increase and 2.0 decrease excluding the impact of the Volume Point adjustments, respectively) as there was a more favorable timing difference between net sales and Volume Point recognition during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, as compared to the same periods in 2023. 
 Net sales in Mexico were 131.5 million and 415.1 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively. Net sales decreased 5.8 million, or 4.2 , and increased 11.5 million, or 2.8 , for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, as compared to the same periods in 2023. In local currency, net sales increased 6.1 and 2.2 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, as compared to the same periods in 2023. The fluctuation of foreign currency exchange rates had an unfavorable impact of 14.0 million and favorable impact of 2.9 million on net sales for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively. To a lesser extent, Mexico s Volume Point decreased for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the same periods in 2023. Macroeconomic conditions, such as a slowdown in the economy and prolonged high interest rates, have created challenges for Members and Members Nutrition Club operations, which continue to be an important DMO in the market. 
 During the second half of 2023 and in the first quarter of 2024, we experienced importation delays in Mexico as a result of the government delaying timely approval of importation permits which impacted certain of our inventory supply, which we believe adversely affected our net sales through the first quarter of 2024. To minimize the risk of disruption to our Mexico market, we continue to work closely with the Mexican government and, during the second quarter and third quarter of 2024, we have seen improvements as importation permits were timely received and are no longer experiencing any disruptions. The market saw a 5.25 price increase during March 2024. During 2023, the Mexico market implemented 2 and 5 price increases during June 2023 and January 2023, respectively. 
 Several markets in the region experienced sales volumes increases during the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the same period in 2023 and experienced lesser volume declines for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the same period in 2023. The sales volume declines in markets other than Mexico, were greatest for Chile, Colombia, and Argentina offset by increases in sales volume in our Guatemala market, for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same period in 2023. The majority of markets in the region instituted price increases to address market-specific conditions during the first quarter of 2024. During the second quarter of 2024, most markets within the Latin America region, excluding Mexico, implemented a 5 price reduction and Volume Point adjustments to enhance the competitiveness of our product pricing, aiming to stimulate incremental growth in volume and to increase our Members ability to promote the business opportunity. We believe these changes may have been a contributing factor for the increases in sales volume for certain of our markets in the region during the third quarter of 2024.

The region has seen difficult economic conditions as well as market-specific factors including political and social instability. Inflationary pressures, improving but remained elevated, and foreign exchange rate fluctuations in certain markets in the region have challenged our Members operations and customer demand. Promotional efforts within the region include increasing in-person activities, adding programs, supporting on a market-by-market basis the Nutrition Club DMO, utilizing segmented promotions and sales incentives, and launching new products. 
 EMEA 
 The EMEA region reported net sales of 261.9 million and 827.6 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively. Net sales increased 0.9 million, or 0.3 , and 8.9 million, or 1.1 , for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, as compared to the same periods in 2023. In local currency, net sales increased 2.2 and 4.1 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, as compared to the same periods in 2023. The 0.3 increase in net sales for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily due to a 8.3 favorable impact of price increases, and a 4.4 favorable impact of sales mix, partially offset by a decrease in sales volume, as indicated by a 9.7 decrease in Volume Points, and a 1.8 unfavorable impact of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. The 1.1 increase in net sales for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily due to a 10.5 favorable impact of price increases, and a 2.5 favorable impact of sales mix, partially offset by a decrease in sales volume, as indicated by an 8.1 decrease in Volume Points, and a 3.0 unfavorable impact of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. The EMEA region has no single market that accounts for a significant portion of our consolidated net sales. 
 Volumes declined across most EMEA markets during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the same periods in 2023. Economic conditions across the region, including inflation in certain markets, weakened consumer confidence, and foreign exchange rate fluctuations, as well as political uncertainty in certain markets appear to be further hindering business recovery. The volume declines across the EMEA markets during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the same period in 2023, were led by T rkiye, Spain and Russia, partially offset by increases in Kazakhstan. Our Russia entity had no sales during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 due to the suspension of product shipments to our Russia entity where its inventory had been fully depleted as of September 30, 2023; therefore our Russia entity will not have any product sales in future periods while its inventory remains fully depleted. As a result, Russian Members purchasing products in Kazakhstan, among other neighboring markets, has led to increases in volume in Kazakhstan. During the third quarter of 2024, the Kazakhstan market increased its pricing that could negatively impact future sales in this market. 
 Focus areas for Herbalife and our Members in the region include promotions and events, launching new products, enhancing both online and in person training programs and meetings to help distributors improve their business, supporting Nutrition clubs and other DMOs, and other promotional activities in order to grow our sales in the region. The majority of the markets in the region instituted price increases to address market-specific conditions during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 
 Asia Pacific 
 The Asia Pacific region, which excludes China, reported net sales of 436.1 million and 1,284.0 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively. Net sales decreased 4.9 million, or 1.1 , and increased 3.6 million, or 0.3 , for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, as compared to the same periods in 2023. In local currency, net sales increased 0.8 and 3.0 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, as compared to the same periods in 2023. The 1.1 decrease in net sales for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily due to a decrease in sales volume, as indicated by a 2.8 decrease in Volume Points and a 1.9 unfavorable impact of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, partially offset by a 3.4 favorable impact of price increases. The 0.3 increase in net sales for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily due to a 3.6 favorable impact of price increases, partially offset by a 2.7 unfavorable impact of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, and a decrease in sales volume, as indicated by a 0.2 decrease in Volume Points. 
 Net sales in India were 218.3 million and 626.4 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively. Net sales increased 2.4 million, or 1.1 , and 42.5 million, or 7.3 , for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, as compared to the same periods in 2023. In local currency, net sales increased 2.5 and 8.7 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, as compared to the same periods in 2023. The fluctuation of foreign currency exchange rates had an unfavorable impact of 2.9 million and 8.0 million on net sales for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively. Sales volumes in India increased 3.3 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the same period in 2023, however, sales volume decreased 1.4 in the third quarter of 2024, as compared to the same period in 2023. We continue to promote our brand, such as through sports sponsorships, in-person events, introducing new product line for skin care, strengthening the Preferred Customer program and making it easier for our Preferred Customers to convert to distributors in India. The India market had no price increase during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. During 2023, the India market implemented a 4.5 price increase during November 2023.

Net sales in Vietnam were 69.7 million and 208.2 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively. Net sales decreased 1.6 million, or 2.2 , and 0.3 million, or 0.1 , for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, as compared to the same periods in 2023. In local currency, net sales increased 2.5 and 5.4 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, as compared to the same periods in 2023. The fluctuation of foreign currency exchange rates had an unfavorable impact of 3.4 million and 11.6 million on net sales for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively. The sales volume was flat for the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the 2023 period but sales volume slightly increased for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the 2023 period and was partially driven by, we believe, the comparison to a 2023 first quarter that included lower level of sales as a result of a January 2023 increase in the local value added tax rate which may have had an adverse impact to our net sales during the first quarter of 2023. Members Nutrition Club operations continue to be an important DMO in the market which management continues to support and monitor, and we believe, macroeconomic conditions in the market continue to create challenges. The market implemented a 3.5 price increase in March 2024. During 2023, the Vietnam market implemented a 3 price increase during March 2023. Further, changes to direct-selling regulations in the market were approved by local government in April 2023; we continue to work closely with Vietnam government and monitor these regulations and any impact they may have on our business in Vietnam. 
 Across most of the region s other markets, sales volume was down for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the 2023 periods, most significantly for Indonesia and South Korea. We continued to see a decline of new Members for some markets. In addition, as Members Nutrition Club operations continue to recover from macroeconomic conditions including inflationary pressure and high interest rates in certain markets that have also challenged some areas of customer demand. Our efforts in the region include programs and promotional initiatives to incentivize sales, and launching new products. Most markets in the region instituted price increases to address market-specific conditions during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 
 China 
 The China region reported net sales of 74.8 million and 231.7 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively. Net sales decreased 14.7 million, or 16.4 , and 13.5 million, or 5.5 , for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, as compared to the same periods in 2023. In local currency, net sales decreased 17.3 and 3.1 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, as compared to the same periods in 2023. The 16.4 decrease in net sales for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily due to a decrease in sales volume, as indicated by a 14.9 decrease in Volume Points, and a 3.4 unfavorable impact of sales mix, partially offset by a 0.9 favorable impact of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. The 5.5 decrease in net sales for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily due to a decrease in sales volume, as indicated by a 2.7 decrease in Volume Points, a 2.4 unfavorable impact of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, and a 2.6 unfavorable impact of sales mix. As described further above, Volume Points are generally recognized when a Member pays for an order, while net sales are generally recognized when product is delivered and when control passes to the Member or customer. If Volume Points were recognized consistent with the timing of when net sales are recognized in accordance with U.S. GAAP, sales volume for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 would have been a decrease of 0.5 as there was a more favorable timing difference between net sales and Volume Point recognition during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the same period in 2023. The China region had no price increase during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and during the twelve months ended December 31, 2023. 
 Sales volume was down for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the 2023 periods as our Members adjust to our sales initiatives and they continue rebuilding and optimizing their business process. We believe, the recent economic difficulties experienced in the region are a contributing factor in China s recent Volume Point decreases. The frequency and attendance of our and our Members in-person training and sales meetings, which are important to the business as they are a central channel for attracting and retaining customers, providing personal and professional development for our Members, and promoting our products, are stabilizing, but continue to be below pre-pandemic levels. Other focus areas for China include enhancing our digital capabilities and offerings, such as improving the integration of our technological and enhanced tools to make it easier for our Members to do business, encouraging a customer-based approach through customer loyalty programs to engage customers, and supporting Nutrition Clubs. We have expanded our product line for the China market and continue to conduct sales promotions in the region.

 Gross Profit 
 Gross profit was 971.6 million and 978.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and 2,948.9 million and 2,944.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Gross profit as a percentage of net sales was 78.3 and 76.3 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, or a favorable net increase of 200 basis points, and 77.9 and 76.5 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, or a favorable net increase of 138 basis points. 
 The increase in gross profit as a percentage of net sales for the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the same period in 2023 included favorable cost changes related to self-manufacturing and sourcing of 111 basis points; the favorable impact of price increases of 110 basis points; and favorable other cost changes of 13 basis points; partially offset by unfavorable changes in sales mix of 34 basis points. 
 The increase in gross profit as a percentage of net sales for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the same period in 2023 included the favorable impact of price increases of 134 basis points; the favorable impact of lower inventory write-downs of 16 basis points; favorable other cost changes of 14 basis points; and the favorable impact of foreign currency fluctuations of 10 basis points; partially offset by unfavorable changes in sales mix of 19 basis points; and unfavorable cost changes related to self-manufacturing and sourcing of 17 basis points. 
 Generally, gross profit as a percentage of net sales may vary from period to period due to the impact of foreign currency fluctuations, changes in sales mix, price increases, cost changes related to inflation, self-manufacturing and sourcing, and inventory write-downs. 
 Royalty Overrides 
 Royalty overrides were 405.5 million and 416.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and 1,236.0 million and 1,261.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Royalty overrides as a percentage of net sales were 32.7 and 32.5 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and 32.6 and 32.8 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. 
 The increase in royalty overrides as a percentage of net sales for the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the same period in 2023 was primarily due to lower net sales in China as a proportion of our total worldwide net sales. The majority of service fees to our independent service providers in China are included in selling, general, and administrative expenses while Member compensation for all other countries is included in Royalty overrides. The decrease in royalty overrides as a percentage of net sales for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the same period in 2023 was primarily due to favorable changes in mix of products and countries. Generally, royalty overrides as a percentage of net sales may vary from period to period due to changes in the mix of products and countries because full royalty overrides are not paid on certain products and in certain countries.

Selling, General, and Administrative Expenses 
 Selling, general, and administrative expenses were 444.0 million and 455.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and 1,438.5 million and 1,391.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Selling, general, and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales were 35.8 and 35.5 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and 38.0 and 36.2 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. 
 The 11.3 million decrease in selling, general, and administrative expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the same period in 2023 was driven by 10.1 million in lower non-income taxes, 7.3 million in lower China service provider fees due to lower sales in China, and 4.0 million of gain on sale of the Company s land, building, and related building improvements of its office building in Torrance, California, partially offset by 11.4 million in higher labor and benefits costs. The increase in labor and benefit costs is primarily due to higher employee bonus accruals. 
 The 46.8 million increase in selling, general, and administrative expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the same period in 2023 was driven by 67.0 million in higher labor and benefits costs, 26.2 million in higher professional fees primarily from expenses related to the Digital Technology Program, and 6.6 million in higher depreciation and amortization expense, partially offset by 13.2 million in lower Member event and promotion costs, 7.6 million in lower China service provider fees primarily from lower sales in China, 7.2 million in lower non-income taxes, 6.9 million in lower advertising and sponsorship costs, and 4.0 million of gain on sale of the Company s land, building, and related building improvements of its office building in Torrance, California. The increase in labor and benefit costs includes higher expenses related to the Restructuring Program and higher employee bonus accruals, partially offset by lower expenses related to the Transformation Program. 
 See Note 13, Restructuring Activities , to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part I, Item 1, Financial Statements , of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for further discussion. 
 Other Operating Income 
 The 5.0 million of other operating income for the three months ended September 30, 2024 consisted of 5.0 million of government grant income for China (See Note 2, Significant Accounting Policies , to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part I, Item 1, Financial Statements , of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for further discussion). We did not recognize any government grant income related to our regional headquarters and distribution centers within China during the three months ended September 30, 2023. 
 The 5.0 million of other operating income for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 consisted of 5.0 million of government grant income for China. The 10.1 million of other operating income for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 consisted of 10.1 million of government grant income for China.

The increase in interest expense, net for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the same periods in 2023 was primarily due to an increase in our weighted-average interest rate as a result of the April 2024 debt refinancing transactions, partially offset by a decrease in our overall weighted-average borrowings. See Note 4, Long-Term Debt , to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part I, Item 1, Financial Statements , of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.

Other Expense (Income), Net 
 The 10.5 million of other expense (income), net for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 consisted of a loss on the extinguishment of the 2018 Credit Facility and the partial redemption of the 2025 Notes (See Note 4, Long-Term Debt , to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part I, Item 1, Financial Statements , of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for further discussion). 
 The 1.0 million of other expense (income), net for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 consisted of a gain on the extinguishment of a portion of the 2024 Convertible Notes. 
 Income Taxes 
 Income taxes were 23.2 million and 26.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and 40.4 million and 53.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The effective income tax rate was 32.9 and 38.2 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and 34.6 and 28.8 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The decrease in the effective tax rate for the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the same period in 2023, was due to changes in the geographic mix of our income and an increase in tax benefits from discrete events. The increase in the effective tax rate for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the same period in 2023, was due to changes in the geographic mix of our income, partially offset by an increase in tax benefits from discrete events. 
 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 We have historically met our short- and long-term working capital and capital expenditure requirements, including funding for expansion of operations, through net cash flows provided by operating activities. Variations in sales of our products directly affect the availability of funds. There are no material contractual restrictions on our ability to transfer and remit funds among our international affiliated companies. However, there are foreign currency restrictions in certain countries which could reduce our ability to timely obtain U.S. dollars. Even with these restrictions and the current inflationary environment, which is improving but has remained elevated in certain markets during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we believe we will have sufficient resources, including cash flow from operating activities and longer-term access to capital markets, to meet debt service obligations in a timely manner and be able to continue to meet our objectives. 
 Historically, our debt has not resulted from the need to fund our normal operations, but instead has resulted primarily from our share repurchase programs. Since inception in 2007, total share repurchases amounted to approximately 6.5 billion. While a significant net sales decline could potentially affect the availability of funds, many of our largest expenses are variable in nature, which we believe protects our funding in all but a dramatic net sales downturn. Our 402.5 million cash and cash equivalents as of September 30, 2024 and our senior secured credit facility, in addition to cash flow from operations, can be used to support general corporate purposes, including any future strategic investment opportunities, share repurchases, and dividends. 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we generated 215.8 million of operating cash flow as compared to 261.4 million for the same period in 2023. The decrease in our operating cash flow was primarily the result of 48.1 million of lower net income excluding non-cash and reconciling items disclosed within our condensed consolidated statement of cash flows, partially offset by 2.5 million of net favorable changes in operating assets and liabilities. The 48.1 million of lower net income excluding non-cash and reconciling items was primarily driven by higher selling, general and administrative expenses and higher interest expense, net; partially offset by lower royalty overrides (See Summary Financial Results above for further discussion). The 2.5 million of net favorable changes in operating assets and liabilities was primarily driven by favorable changes in prepaid expenses and other current assets, accounts payable, accrued interest, and accrued compensation primarily from higher employee bonus accrual; partially offset by unfavorable changes in inventories. 
 50 

Capital expenditures, including accrued capital expenditures, were 83.6 million and 99.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The majority of these expenditures during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 represented investments in management information systems, including initiatives to develop enhanced Member tools which includes our 400 million multi-year Digital Technology Program that is focused on enhancing and rebuilding our Member facing technology platform and web-based Member tools to provide enhanced digital capabilities and experiences to our Members, which we also refer to as Herbalife One. We expect to continue our investments in these areas and expect to incur total capital expenditures of approximately 120 million to 140 million for the full year 2024, which includes Herbalife One. Based on our estimates, we expect our total future capital expenditures to remain elevated during 2024 and 2025 as a result of Herbalife One, where we have incurred approximately 310 million of implementation costs relating to Herbalife One as of September 30, 2024. In addition, based on the Herbalife One implementation costs incurred thus far, we began to recognize non-cash amortization expenses during the first quarter of 2024 and continue to expect to recognize approximately 35 million of these non-cash amortization expenses within our full-year 2024 consolidated statement of income; thereafter, we expect to recognize similar amounts of non-cash amortization expenses which could vary depending on the total actual future Herbalife One related expenditures and the associated timing of future technology being available for deployment. The capital expenditures relating to Herbalife One, are separate to the Transformation Program described further below. 
 In March 2024, we hosted our annual global honors event where sales leaders from around the world met, shared best practices, and conducted leadership training, and our management awarded Members 74.9 million of Mark Hughes bonus payments related to their 2023 performance. In March 2023, our management awarded Members 77.9 million of Mark Hughes bonus payments related to their 2022 performance. 
 In 2021, we initiated a global transformation program to optimize global processes for future growth, or the Transformation Program. The Transformation Program involves the investment in certain new technologies and the realignment of infrastructure and the locations of certain functions to better support distributors and customers. The Transformation Program is expected to deliver annual savings of approximately 110 million with approximately 70 million of savings realized in 2023 and approximately 110 million of annual savings expected to be realized in 2024 and thereafter. We also expect to incur total pre-tax expenses of approximately 90 million to realize these annual run-rate savings. We have already incurred total pre-tax expenses of approximately 88.6 million through September 30, 2024, of which zero and 4.6 million were incurred in the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and 9.4 million and 42.0 million were incurred in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and recognized in selling, general, and administrative expenses within our condensed consolidated statements of income. In addition, we expect approximately 20.0 million of related capital expenditures through 2024, inclusive of the 19.3 million incurred from inception to date, primarily relating to technology, to support the Transformation Program. The Transformation Program is expected to be completed in 2024. 
 During the first quarter of 2024, we initiated a Restructuring Program to streamline our organizational structure to make it more efficient and effective and to allow our management team to work more closely to the markets, our distributors, and our customers. The Restructuring Program is expected to deliver annual savings of at least 80 million beginning in 2025 with at least 50 million of savings expected to be realized in 2024, where at least 20 million and at least 30 million was already realized during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively. We also expect to incur total pre-tax expenses of approximately 70 million relating to the Restructuring Program through 2024, of which 2.7 million and 68.2 million were recognized in selling, general, and administrative expenses within the condensed consolidated statement of income during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively. We expect to complete the Restructuring Program by the end of 2024. Since the Restructuring Program is still ongoing, these estimated amounts are preliminary and based on management s estimates and actual results could differ from such estimates. 
 Senior Secured Credit Facility 
 On August 16, 2018, we entered into a 1.25 billion senior secured credit facility, or the 2018 Credit Facility, consisting of a 250.0 million term loan A, or the 2018 Term Loan A, a 750.0 million term loan B, or the 2018 Term Loan B, and a 250.0 million revolving credit facility, or the 2018 Revolving Credit Facility, with a syndicate of financial institutions as lenders. 
 51 

Subsequently, the 2018 Credit Facility was amended in a series of amendments that, as of March 31, 2024, among other things, increased the borrowing capacity of the 2018 Term Loan A to a total of 286.2 million and the 2018 Revolving Credit Facility to a total of 330.0 million and establishing the Secured Overnight Financing Rate, or SOFR, for interest rate purposes under the 2018 Credit Facility. Borrowings utilizing SOFR under both the 2018 Term Loan A and 2018 Revolving Credit Facility, bore interest at, depending on the Company s total leverage ratio and the Adjusted Term SOFR, which is the rate per annum equal to Term SOFR plus a rate adjustment based on interest periods of one month, three months, six months and twelve months tenors equaling to approximately 0.11 , 0.26 , 0.43 and 0.72 , respectively. The maturity date of both the 2018 Term Loan A and 2018 Revolving Credit Facility was March 19, 2025. The 2018 Term Loan B maturity date was August 18, 2025. 
 The 2018 Credit Facility required us to comply with a leverage ratio. The 2018 Credit Facility also contained affirmative and negative covenants customary for financings of this type, including, among other things, limitations or prohibitions on repurchasing common shares, declaring and paying dividends and other distributions, redeeming and repurchasing certain other indebtedness, making loans and investments, incurring additional indebtedness, granting liens, and effecting mergers, asset sales and transactions with affiliates. In addition, the 2018 Credit Facility contained customary events of default. 
 On April 12, 2024, concurrently with the issuance of the 800.0 million aggregate principal amount of senior secured notes, or the 2029 Secured Notes, as described further below, we entered into the eighth amendment to the 2018 Credit Facility. The eighth amendment to the 2018 Credit Facility, among other things, refinanced and replaced in full the 2018 Credit Facility with, (i) a Term Loan B Facility, or the 2024 Term Loan B, with an aggregate principal amount of 400.0 million and (ii) a revolving credit facility, or the 2024 Revolving Credit Facility, with an aggregate principal amount of 400.0 million, collectively the 2024 Credit Facility. All obligations under the 2024 Credit Facility are unconditionally guaranteed by certain direct and indirect wholly-owned subsidiaries of Herbalife Ltd. and secured on a senior secured basis by the equity interests of certain of Herbalife Ltd. s subsidiaries and substantially all of the assets of the domestic loan parties. Interest is due at least quarterly on amounts outstanding under the 2024 Credit Facility. 
 The 2024 Term Loan B Facility was issued to the lenders at a 7.00 discount, or 28.0 million, and we incurred approximately 10.3 million of debt issuance costs in connection with the 2024 Credit Facility. We may prepay the 2024 Term Loan B at a 102 premium at any time on or before the first anniversary, 101 premium following the first anniversary and on or prior to the second anniversary, and, solely in connection with a repricing event, at a 101 premium after the second anniversary but on or prior to the third anniversary, and generally at no premium thereafter. The 2024 Term Loan B requires quarterly payments equal to 5.0 of the aggregate principal amount of the 2024 Term Loan B per annum, commencing in September 2024. In addition, pursuant to the terms of the 2024 Credit Facility, beginning in fiscal year 2025, the Company may be required to make mandatory prepayments towards the 2024 Term Loan B based on an excess cash flow calculation and consolidated leverage ratio as defined under the terms of the 2024 Credit Facility. 
 Proceeds from the 2024 Term Loan B together with the proceeds from the 2029 Secured Notes were used to repay indebtedness, including all borrowings outstanding under the 2018 Credit Facility, effectively terminating its 228.9 million outstanding principal balance on the 2018 Term Loan A, and repaying 584.3 million on the 2018 Term Loan B, 170.0 million on the 2018 Revolving Credit Facility, and a portion of the 2025 Notes described further below. For accounting purposes, pursuant to ASC 470, Debt , these transactions were accounted for as an extinguishment of the 2018 Credit Facility. As a result, we recognized 981.0 million as a reduction to long-term debt representing the carrying value of the 2018 Credit Facility repaid in full in the second quarter of 2024. We also recognized a loss on extinguishment of approximately 2.5 million, as a result, which was recorded in other expense, net within our condensed consolidated statement of income during the second quarter of 2024. 
 Borrowings utilizing SOFR under the 2024 Credit Facility use Adjusted Term SOFR. The applicable interest rates on our borrowings under the 2024 Term Loan B, as amended, bear interest at either, the Adjusted Term SOFR, which is the rate per annum equal to Term SOFR plus a rate adjustment based on interest periods of one month, three months, six months and twelve months tenors equaling to approximately 0.11 , 0.26 , 0.43 and 0.72 , respectively, plus a margin of 6.75 , or the base rate, which represents the highest of the Federal Funds Rate plus 0.50 , one-month Adjusted Term SOFR plus 1.00 , and the prime rate quoted by The Wall Street Journal, plus a margin of 5.75 . The Adjusted Term SOFR is subject to a floor of 0.00 and the base rate is subject to a floor of 1.00 . The 2024 Term Loan B Facility matures upon the earlier of (i) April 12, 2029, or (ii) March 16, 2028 if the outstanding principal on the 2028 Convertible Notes, as defined below, exceeds 100.0 million and we exceed certain leverage ratios as of that date, or (iii) June 2, 2025 if the outstanding principal on the 2025 Notes, as defined below, exceeds 200.0 million on such date. 
 Effective after April 12, 2024, depending on our total leverage ratio, borrowings under the 2024 Revolving Credit Facility bear interest at either the Adjusted Term SOFR plus a margin of between 5.50 and 6.50 , or the base rate plus a margin of between 4.50 and 5.50 . The 2024 Revolving Credit Facility matures upon the earlier of (i) April 12, 2028, (ii) December 16, 2027 if the outstanding principal on the 2028 Convertible Notes, as defined below, exceeds 100.0 million and we exceed certain leverage ratios as of that date, or (iii) March 3, 2025 if the outstanding principal on the 2025 Notes, as defined below, exceeds 200.0 million on such date. 
 52 

The 2024 Credit Facility contains affirmative, negative and financial covenants customary for financings of this type, including, among other things, limitations or prohibitions on declaring and paying dividends and other distributions, redeeming and repurchasing certain other indebtedness, making loans and investments, incurring additional indebtedness, granting liens, and effecting mergers, asset sales and transactions with affiliates. In addition, the 2024 Credit Facility contains customary events of default. The 2024 Revolving Credit Facility requires us to maintain a maximum total leverage ratio of 4.50:1.00 through December 31, 2024, stepping down to 4.25:1.00 on March 31, 2025 and 4.00:1.00 at September 30, 2025 and thereafter. The financial covenants also include a maximum first lien net leverage ratio of 2.50:1.00, a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio of 2.00:1.00, and a minimum liquidity of 200 million of revolver availability and accessible cash. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we were in compliance with its financial covenants under the 2024 Credit Facility and 2018 Credit Facility, respectively. 
 We are permitted to make voluntary prepayments, subject to the premiums as discussed above. These prepayments, if any, will be applied against remaining quarterly installments owed under the 2024 Term Loan B in order of maturity with the remaining principal due upon maturity, unless directed otherwise by us. Pursuant to the terms of the 2018 Credit Facility excess cash flow clause and based on the 2023 excess cash flow calculation and consolidated leverage ratio as of December 31, 2023, as described and defined under the terms of the 2018 Credit Facility, we made a 66.3 million mandatory prepayment towards the 2018 Term Loan B during the first quarter of 2024. 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we borrowed an aggregate amount of 1,144.5 million, including 944.5 million under the 2024 Credit Facility, which included 544.5 million of borrowings under the 2024 Revolving Credit Facility, and 200.0 million under the 2018 Credit Facility, all of which was under the 2018 Revolving Credit Facility, and repaid a total amount of 1,636.2 million, including 549.5 million on amounts outstanding under the 2024 Credit Facility, which included 544.5 million of repayments on amounts outstanding under the 2024 Revolving Credit Facility, and 1,086.7 million on amounts outstanding under the 2018 Credit Facility, which included 200.0 million of repayments on amounts outstanding under the 2018 Revolving Credit Facility and a 66.3 million mandatory prepayment on amounts outstanding under the 2018 Term Loan B pursuant to the terms of the 2018 Credit Facility excess cash flow clause. During the nine months ended September 30, 2023, we borrowed an aggregate amount of 195.0 million under the 2018 Credit Facility, all of which was under the 2018 Revolving Credit Facility, and repaid a total amount of 276.7 million on amounts outstanding under the 2018 Credit Facility, which included 255.0 million of repayments on amounts outstanding under the 2018 Revolving Credit Facility. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the U.S. dollar amount outstanding under the 2024 Credit Facility was 395.0 million and 2018 Credit Facility was 886.7 million, respectively. Of the 395.0 million outstanding under the 2024 Credit Facility as of September 30, 2024, 395.0 million was outstanding under the 2024 Term Loan B. Of the 886.7 million outstanding under the 2018 Credit Facility as of December 31, 2023, 236.1 million was outstanding under the 2018 Term Loan A and 650.6 million was outstanding under the 2018 Term Loan B. There were no borrowings outstanding under the 2024 Revolving Credit Facility and 2018 Revolving Credit Facility as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. In addition, as of both September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we had an issued but undrawn letter of credit against the 2024 Revolving Credit Facility and 2018 Revolving Credit Facility, respectively, of approximately 45 million which reduced our remaining available borrowing capacity under the 2024 Revolving Credit Facility and 2018 Revolving Credit Facility. As a result of the issued but undrawn letter of credit, as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the remaining available borrowing capacity under the 2024 Revolving Credit Facility and 2018 Revolving Credit Facility, respectively, was approximately 355 million and approximately 285 million, respectively. There were no outstanding foreign currency borrowings under both the 2024 Credit Facility and 2018 Credit Facility as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. As of September 30, 2024 the weighted-average interest rate for borrowings under the 2024 Credit Facility was 10.05 and as of December 31, 2023 the weighted-average interest rate for borrowings under the 2018 Credit Facility was 7.62 . 
 See Note 4, Long-Term Debt, to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part I, Item 1, Financial Statements , of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for a further discussion on the 2024 Credit Facility, 2018 Credit Facility, and the refinancing thereof. 
 Senior Secured Notes due 2029 
 In April 2024, we issued 800.0 million aggregate principal amount of senior secured notes due 2029, or the 2029 Secured Notes. The 2029 Secured Notes are guaranteed on a senior secured basis by us and each of our existing and future subsidiaries that is a guarantor of the obligations of any domestic borrower under our 2024 Credit Facility. The 2029 Secured Notes pay interest at a rate of 12.250 per annum payable semiannually in arrears on April 15 and October 15 of each year, beginning on October 15, 2024. The 2029 Secured Notes mature on April 15, 2029. The primary purpose of the issuance of the 2029 Secured Notes was to, along with proceeds from the 2024 Credit Facility, repay in full the 2018 Credit Facility and a partial redemption and private repurchase of the 2025 Notes. As of September 30, 2024, the outstanding principal on the 2029 Secured Notes was 800.0 million. See Note 4, Long-Term Debt , to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part I, Item 1, Financial Statements , of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for a further discussion on our 2029 Secured Notes. 
 53 

Convertible Senior Notes due 2024 
 In March 2018, we issued 550.0 million aggregate principal amount of convertible senior notes due 2024, or the 2024 Convertible Notes. The 2024 Convertible Notes were senior unsecured obligations which ranked effectively subordinate to any of our existing and future secured indebtedness, including amounts outstanding under the 2018 Credit Facility, to the extent of the value of the assets securing such indebtedness. The 2024 Convertible Notes paid interest at a rate of 2.625 per annum payable semiannually in arrears on March 15 and September 15 of each year, beginning on September 15, 2018. The 2024 Convertible Notes matured on March 15, 2024. 
 In December 2021, we made an irrevocable election under the indenture governing the 2024 Convertible Notes to require the principal portion of the 2024 Convertible Notes to be settled in cash and any excess in shares or cash. In December 2022, we issued 277.5 million aggregate principal amount of new convertible senior notes due 2028 as described below, and subsequently used the proceeds, to repurchase 287.5 million of our existing 2024 Convertible Notes from a limited number of holders in privately negotiated transactions for an aggregate purchase price of 274.9 million, which included 1.7 million of accrued interest. In August 2023, we repurchased 65.5 million of our existing 2024 Convertible Notes through open market purchases for an aggregate purchase price of 65.1 million, which included 0.8 million of accrued interest. During March 2024, we repaid a total amount of 197.0 million to repay in full amounts outstanding on the 2024 Convertible Notes upon maturity, as well as 2.6 million of accrued interest. 
 See Note 4, Long-Term Debt , to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part I, Item 1, Financial Statements , of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for a further discussion on our 2024 Convertible Notes. 
 Convertible Senior Notes due 2028 
 In December 2022, we issued 277.5 million aggregate principal amount of convertible senior notes due 2028, or the 2028 Convertible Notes.

Unless redeemed, repurchased or converted in accordance with their terms prior to such date, the 2028 Convertible Notes mature on June 15, 2028. The primary purpose of the issuance of the 2028 Convertible Notes was to repurchase a portion of the 2024 Convertible Notes.

See Note 4, Long-Term Debt , to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part I, Item 1, Financial Statements , of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for a further discussion on our 2028 Convertible Notes. 
 Senior Notes due 2025 
 In May 2020, we issued 600.0 million aggregate principal amount of senior notes due 2025, or the 2025 Notes. The 2025 Notes are senior unsecured obligations which rank effectively subordinate to any of our existing and future secured indebtedness, including amounts outstanding under the 2024 Credit Facility, to the extent of the value of the assets securing such indebtedness.

 54 

Senior Notes due 2029 
 In May 2021, we issued 600.0 million aggregate principal amount of senior notes due 2029, or the 2029 Notes.

See Note 4, Long-Term Debt , to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part I, Item 1, Financial Statements , of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for a further discussion on our 2029 Notes. 
 Cash and Cash Equivalents 
 The majority of our foreign subsidiaries designate their local currencies as their functional currencies. As of September 30, 2024, the total amount of our foreign subsidiary cash and cash equivalents was 364.2 million, of which 39.6 million was held in U.S. dollars. As of September 30, 2024, the total amount of cash and cash equivalents held by Herbalife Ltd. and its U.S. entities, inclusive of U.S. territories, was 38.3 million. 
 For earnings not considered to be indefinitely reinvested deferred taxes have been provided. For earnings considered to be indefinitely reinvested, deferred taxes have not been provided. Should we make a determination to remit the cash and cash equivalents from our foreign subsidiaries that are considered indefinitely reinvested to Herbalife Ltd. for the purpose of repatriation of undistributed earnings, we would need to accrue and pay taxes. As of December 31, 2023, Herbalife Ltd. had approximately 2.9 billion of permanently reinvested unremitted earnings relating to its operating subsidiaries. As of December 31, 2023, we do not have any plans to repatriate these unremitted earnings to Herbalife Ltd.; therefore, we do not have any liquidity concerns relating to these unremitted earnings and related cash and cash equivalents. See Note 12, Income Taxes , to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in our 2023 10-K for additional discussion on our unremitted earnings. 
 Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 
 As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we had no material off-balance sheet arrangements except for those described in Note 4, Long-Term Debt , and Note 5, Contingencies , to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part I, Item 1, Financial Statements , of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. 
 Dividends 
 We have not declared or paid cash dividends since 2014. The declaration of future dividends is subject to the discretion of our board of directors and will depend upon various factors, including our earnings, financial condition, Herbalife Ltd. s available distributable reserves under Cayman Islands law, restrictions imposed by the 2024 Credit Facility and the terms of any other indebtedness that may be outstanding, cash requirements, future prospects, and other factors deemed relevant by our board of directors. 
 Share Repurchases 
 On February 9, 2021, our board of directors authorized a three-year 1.5 billion share repurchase program which had approximately 985.5 million of remaining authorized capacity prior to the share repurchase program expiring on February 9, 2024. This share repurchase program allowed us, which included an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of Herbalife Ltd., to repurchase our common shares at such times and prices as determined by management, as market conditions warranted, and to the extent Herbalife Ltd. s distributable reserves were available under Cayman Islands law. The 2024 Credit Facility permits us to repurchase our common shares as long as no default or event of default exists and other conditions, such as specified consolidated leverage ratios, are met. 
 During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, we did not repurchase any of our common shares through open-market purchases. 
 See Note 10, Shareholders Deficit , to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part I, Item 1, Financial Statements , of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, for a further discussion on our share repurchases. 
 55 

Working Capital and Operating Activities 
 As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we had negative working capital of 40.4 million and positive working capital of 121.7 million, respectively, or a decrease of 162.1 million. The decrease was primarily due to a decrease in cash and cash equivalents, and an increase in other current liabilities, partially offset by an increase in inventories, decreases in royalty overrides and current portion of long-term debt. The decrease in current portion of long-term debt is primarily from the repayment of the remaining 197.0 million balance of the 2024 Convertible Notes which matured on March 15, 2024, a 66.3 million mandatory prepayment on the 2018 Term Loan B, and 28.6 million from repayment of the 2018 Term Loan A, partially offset by an increase of 261.6 million relating to our 2025 Notes, which mature in less than one year. See Note 4, Long-Term Debt , to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part I, Item 1, Financial Statements , of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for further discussion. 
 We expect that cash and funds provided from operations, available borrowings under the 2024 Credit Facility, and longer-term access to capital markets will provide sufficient working capital to operate our business, to make expected capital expenditures, and to meet foreseeable liquidity requirements for the next twelve months and thereafter. 
 The majority of our purchases from suppliers are generally made in U.S. dollars, while sales to our Members generally are made in local currencies. Consequently, strengthening of the U.S. dollar versus a foreign currency can have a negative impact on gross profit and can generate transaction gains or losses on intercompany transactions. For discussion of our foreign exchange contracts and other hedging arrangements, see Part I, Item 3, Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk , of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q . 
 Contingencies 
 See Note 5, Contingencies , to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part I, Item 1, Financial Statements , of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, for information on our contingencies as of September 30, 2024. 
 Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 
 U.S. GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the year. We regularly evaluate our estimates and assumptions related to revenue recognition, allowance for product returns, inventory, goodwill and purchased intangible asset valuations, deferred income tax asset valuation allowances, uncertain tax positions, tax contingencies, and other loss contingencies. We base our estimates and assumptions on current facts, historical experience and various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities and the recording of revenue, costs and expenses. Actual results could differ from those estimates. We consider the following policies to be most critical in understanding the judgments that are involved in preparing the financial statements and the uncertainties that could impact our operating results, financial condition and cash flows. 
 We are a nutrition company that sells a wide range of weight management; targeted nutrition; energy, sports, and fitness; and outer nutrition products. Our products are manufactured by us in our Changsha, Hunan, China extraction facility; Suzhou, China facility; Nanjing, China facility; Lake Forest, California facility; and Winston-Salem, North Carolina facility; and by third-party providers, and then are sold to Members who consume and sell Herbalife products to retail consumers or other Members. As of September 30, 2024, we sold products in 95 markets throughout the world and we are organized and managed by geographic region. We aggregate our operating segments into one reporting segment, except China, as management believes that our operating segments have similar operating characteristics and similar long-term operating performance. In making this determination, management believes that the operating segments are similar in the nature of the products sold, the product acquisition process, the types of customers to whom products are sold, the methods used to distribute the products, the nature of the regulatory environment, and their economic characteristics. 
 We generally recognize revenue upon delivery when control passes to the Member. Product sales are recognized net of product returns, and discounts referred to as distributor allowances. We generally receive the net sales price in cash or through credit card payments at the point of sale. Royalty overrides are generally recorded when revenue is recognized. See Note 2, Significant Accounting Policies , to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part I, Item 1, Financial Statements , of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, for a further discussion of distributor compensation in the U.S.

Allowances for product returns, primarily in connection with our buyback program, are provided at the time the sale is recorded. This accrual is based upon historical return rates for each country and the relevant return pattern, which reflects anticipated returns to be received over a period of up to 12 months following the original sale. Historically, product returns and buybacks have not been significant. Product returns and buybacks were approximately 0.1 of net sales for each of the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. 
 We adjust our inventories to lower of cost and net realizable value. Additionally we adjust the carrying value of our inventory based on assumptions regarding future demand for our products and market conditions. If future demand and market conditions are less favorable than management s assumptions, additional inventory write-downs could be required. Likewise, favorable future demand and market conditions could positively impact future operating results if previously written down inventories are sold. We have obsolete and slow moving inventories which have been adjusted downward 23.1 million and 24.2 million to present them at their lower of cost and net realizable value in our condensed consolidated balance sheets as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. 
 Goodwill and marketing-related intangible assets not subject to amortization are tested annually for impairment, and are tested for impairment more frequently if events and circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired. 
 Under the quantitative method for impairment testing of goodwill, which is done at the reporting unit level, we primarily use an income approach in order to determine the fair value of a reporting unit and compare it to its carrying amount. The determination of the fair value of the reporting units requires us to make significant estimates and assumptions. These estimates and assumptions include estimates of future revenues and expense growth rates, capital expenditures and the depreciation and amortization related to these capital expenditures, discount rates, and other inputs. Due to the inherent uncertainty involved in making these estimates, actual future results could differ. Changes in assumptions regarding future results or other underlying assumptions could have a significant impact on the fair value of the reporting unit. If the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, an impairment loss is recognized for any excess of the carrying amount of the reporting unit over its fair value. During fiscal year 2023, we performed a quantitative assessment and determined that the fair value of each reporting unit was significantly greater than its respective carrying value. 
 Under the quantitative method for impairment testing of our marketing-related intangible assets, we use a discounted cash flow model, or the income approach, under the relief-from-royalty method to determine the fair value of our marketing-related intangible assets in order to confirm there is no impairment required. An impairment loss is recognized to the extent that the carrying amount of the assets exceeds their fair value. During fiscal year 2023, we performed a quantitative assessment of our marketing-related intangible assets and determined that the fair value of the assets was significantly greater than their carrying value. 
 As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we had goodwill of approximately 93.1 million and 95.4 million, respectively. The decrease in goodwill during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was due to foreign currency translation adjustments. As of both September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we had marketing-related intangible assets of approximately 310.0 million. No goodwill or marketing-related intangibles impairment was recorded during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. 
 Contingencies are accounted for in accordance with FASB ASC Topic 450, Contingencies , or ASC 450. ASC 450 requires that we record an estimated loss from a loss contingency when information available prior to issuance of our financial statements indicates that it is probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred at the date of the financial statements and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. We also disclose material contingencies when we believe a loss is not probable but reasonably possible as required by ASC 450. Accounting for contingencies such as legal and non-income tax matters requires us to use judgment related to both the likelihood of a loss and the estimate of the amount or range of loss. Many of these legal and tax contingencies can take years to be resolved. Generally, as the time period increases over which the uncertainties are resolved, the likelihood of changes to the estimate of the ultimate outcome increases. 
 As part of the process of preparing our condensed consolidated financial statements, we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate prior to the completion and filing of tax returns for such periods. These estimates involve complex issues and require us to make judgments about the likely application of the tax law to our situation, as well as with respect to other matters, such as anticipating the positions that we will take on tax returns prior to us actually preparing the returns and the outcomes of disputes with tax authorities. The ultimate resolution of these issues may take extended periods of time due to examinations by tax authorities and statutes of limitations. In addition, changes in our business, including acquisitions, changes in our international corporate structure, changes in the geographic location of business functions or assets, changes in the geographic mix and amount of income, as well as changes in our agreements with tax authorities, valuation allowances, applicable accounting rules, applicable tax laws and regulations, rulings and interpretations thereof, developments in tax audit and other matters, and variations in the estimated and actual level of annual pre-tax income can affect the overall effective income tax rate.

We evaluate the realizability of our deferred tax assets by assessing the valuation allowance and by adjusting the amount of such allowance, if necessary. Although realization is not assured, we believe it is more likely than not that the net carrying value will be realized. The amount of the carryforwards that is considered realizable, however, could change if estimates of future taxable income are adjusted. The ability to forecast income over multiple years at a jurisdictional level is subject to uncertainty especially when our assessment of valuation allowances factor in longer term income forecasts. The impact of increasing or decreasing the valuation allowance could be material to our condensed consolidated financial statements. See Note 12, Income Taxes , to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part IV, Item 15, Exhibits, Financial Statement Schedules , of the 2023 10-K for additional information on our net deferred tax assets and valuation allowances. 
 We account for uncertain tax positions in accordance with FASB ASC Topic 740, Income Taxes , or ASC 740, which provides guidance on the determination of how tax benefits claimed or expected to be claimed on a tax return should be recorded in the financial statements. Under ASC 740, we must recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position. The tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such a position are measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than fifty percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate resolution. 
 Our policy is to account for global intangible low-taxed income as a period cost if and when incurred. 
 We account for foreign currency transactions in accordance with FASB ASC Topic 830, Foreign Currency Matters . In a majority of the countries where we operate, the functional currency is the local currency. Our foreign subsidiaries asset and liability accounts are translated for condensed consolidated financial reporting purposes into U.S. dollar amounts at period-end exchange rates. Revenue and expense accounts are translated at the average rates during the year. Our foreign currency translation adjustments are included in accumulated other comprehensive loss on our accompanying condensed consolidated balance sheets. Foreign currency transaction gains and losses and foreign currency remeasurements are generally included in selling, general, and administrative expenses in the accompanying condensed consolidated statements of income. 
 New Accounting Pronouncements 
 See discussion under Note 2, Significant Accounting Policies , to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part I, Item 1, Financial Statements , of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, for information on new accounting pronouncements. 
 Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 
 We are exposed to market risks, which arise during the normal course of business from changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates. On a selected basis, we use derivative financial instruments to manage or hedge certain of these risks. All hedging transactions are authorized and executed pursuant to written guidelines and procedures. 
 We apply FASB ASC Topic 815, Derivatives and Hedging , or ASC 815, which established accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments, including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts, and for hedging activities. All derivatives, whether designated in hedging relationships or not, are required to be recorded on the balance sheet at fair value. If the derivative is designated as a fair-value hedge, the changes in the fair value of the derivative and the underlying hedged item are recognized concurrently in earnings. If the derivative is designated as a cash flow hedge, changes in the fair value of the derivative are recorded in other comprehensive income (loss) and are recognized in the condensed consolidated statements of income when the hedged item affects earnings. ASC 815 defines the requirements for designation and documentation of hedging relationships as well as ongoing effectiveness assessments in order to use hedge accounting. For a derivative that does not qualify as a hedge, changes in fair value are recognized concurrently in earnings. 
 A discussion of our primary market risk exposures and derivatives is presented below. 
 58 

Foreign Exchange Risk 
 We transact business globally and are subject to risks associated with changes in foreign exchange rates. Our objective is to minimize the impact to earnings and cash flow associated with foreign exchange rate fluctuations. We enter into foreign exchange derivatives in the ordinary course of business primarily to reduce exposure to currency fluctuations attributable to intercompany transactions, translation of local currency earnings, inventory purchases subject to foreign currency exposure, and to partially mitigate the impact of foreign currency rate fluctuations. Due to volatility in foreign exchange markets, our current strategy, in general, is to hedge some of the significant exposures on a short-term basis. We will continue to monitor the foreign exchange markets and evaluate our hedging strategy accordingly. With the exception of our foreign currency forward contracts relating to forecasted inventory purchases and intercompany management fees discussed below, all of our foreign exchange contracts are designated as freestanding derivatives for which hedge accounting does not apply. The changes in the fair value of the derivatives not qualifying as cash flow hedges are included in selling, general, and administrative expenses within our condensed consolidated statements of income. 
 The foreign currency forward contracts and option contracts designated as freestanding derivatives are primarily used to hedge foreign currency-denominated intercompany transactions and to partially mitigate the impact of foreign currency fluctuations. The fair value of foreign exchange derivative contracts is based on third-party quotes. Our foreign currency derivative contracts are generally executed on a monthly basis. 
 We also purchase foreign currency forward contracts in order to hedge forecasted inventory transactions and intercompany management fees that are designated as cash flow hedges and are subject to foreign currency exposures. We applied the hedge accounting rules as required by ASC 815 for these hedges. These contracts allow us to buy and sell certain currencies at specified contract rates. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the aggregate notional amounts of these contracts outstanding were approximately 74.5 million and 76.3 million, respectively. As of September 30, 2024, the outstanding contracts were expected to mature over the next fifteen months. Our derivative financial instruments are recorded on the condensed consolidated balance sheets at fair value based on quoted market rates. For the forecasted inventory transactions, the forward contracts are used to hedge forecasted inventory transactions over specific months. Changes in the fair value of these forward contracts designated as cash flow hedges, excluding forward points, are recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss within shareholders deficit, and are recognized in cost of sales within our condensed consolidated statement of income during the period which approximates the time the hedged inventory is sold. We also hedge forecasted intercompany management fees over specific months. Changes in the fair value of these forward contracts designated as cash flow hedges, excluding forward points, are recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss within shareholders deficit, and are recognized in selling, general, and administrative expenses within our condensed consolidated statement of income during the period when the hedged item and underlying transaction affect earnings. As of September 30, 2024, we recorded assets at fair value of 7.2 million and liabilities at fair value of 0.3 million relating to all outstanding foreign currency contracts designated as cash flow hedges. As of December 31, 2023, we recorded assets at fair value of zero and liabilities at fair value of 3.3 million relating to all outstanding foreign currency contracts designated as cash flow hedges. These hedges remained effective as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. 
 As of both September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the majority of our outstanding foreign currency forward contracts related to freestanding derivatives had maturity dates of less than twelve months with the majority of freestanding derivatives expiring within one month.

Interest Rate Risk 
 As of September 30, 2024, the aggregate annual maturities of the 2024 Credit Facility were expected to be 5.0 million for the remainder of 2024, 20.0 million for 2025, 20.0 million for 2026, 20.0 million for 2027, 20.0 million for 2028, and 310.0 million thereafter. As of September 30, 2024, the fair value of the 2024 Term Loan B was approximately 375.0 million, and the carrying value was 363.4 million. As of December 31, 2023, the fair values of the 2018 Term Loan A and 2018 Term Loan B were approximately 236.1 million and 650.6 million, respectively, and the carrying values were 235.5 million and 648.2 million, respectively. There were no outstanding borrowings on the 2024 Revolving Credit Facility and 2018 Revolving Credit Facility as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. The 2024 Credit Facility bears variable interest rates, and as of September 30, 2024 the weighted-average interest rate for borrowings under the 2024 Credit Facility was 10.05 and the 2018 Credit Facility bore variable interest rates, and as of December 31, 2023 the weighted-average interest rate for borrowings under the 2018 Credit Facility was 7.62 . 
 Since our 2024 Credit Facility is based on variable interest rates, if interest rates were to increase or decrease by 1 for the year and our borrowing amounts on our 2024 Credit Facility remained constant, our annual interest expense could increase or decrease by approximately 4.0 million, respectively. 
 As of September 30, 2024, the fair value of the 2029 Secured Notes was approximately 803.8 million and the carrying value was 766.9 million. The 2029 Secured Notes pay interest at a fixed rate of 12.250 per annum payable semiannually in arrears on April 15 and October 15 of each year, beginning on October 15, 2024. The 2029 Secured Notes mature on April 15, 2029, unless redeemed or repurchased in accordance with their terms prior to such date. The 2029 Secured Notes are recorded at their carrying value and their fair value is used only for disclosure purposes, so an increase or decrease in interest rates would not have any impact to our condensed consolidated financial statements; however, if interest rates were to increase or decrease by 1 , their fair value could decrease by approximately 25.6 million or increase by approximately 26.9 million, respectively. 
 On March 15, 2024, the 2024 Convertible Notes matured and were repaid in full. As of December 31, 2023, the fair value of the 2024 Convertible Notes was approximately 196.2 million and the carrying value was 196.8 million. The 2024 Convertible Notes paid interest at a fixed rate of 2.625 per annum payable semiannually in arrears on March 15 and September 15 of each year, beginning on September 15, 2018. 
 As of September 30, 2024, the fair value of the 2028 Convertible Notes was approximately 205.4 million and the carrying value was 271.5 million. As of December 31, 2023, the fair value of the 2028 Convertible Notes was approximately 320.9 million, and the carrying value was 270.5 million. The 2028 Convertible Notes pay interest at a fixed rate of 4.25 per annum payable semiannually in arrears on June 15 and December 15 of each year, beginning on June 15, 2023. Unless redeemed, repurchased or converted in accordance with their terms prior to such date, the 2028 Convertible Notes mature on June 15, 2028. 
 As of September 30, 2024, the fair value of the 2025 Notes was approximately 261.7 million and the carrying value was 261.6 million. As of December 31, 2023, the fair value of the 2025 Notes was approximately 596.8 million and the carrying value was 597.1 million. The 2025 Notes pay interest at a fixed rate of 7.875 per annum payable semiannually in arrears on March 1 and September 1 of each year, beginning on March 1, 2021. The 2025 Notes mature on September 1, 2025, unless redeemed or repurchased in accordance with their terms prior to such date. The 2025 Notes are recorded at their carrying value and their fair value is used only for disclosure purposes, so an increase or decrease in interest rates would not have any impact to our condensed consolidated financial statements; however, if interest rates were to increase or decrease by 1 , their fair value could decrease by approximately 2.2 million or increase by approximately 2.2 million, respectively. 
 As of September 30, 2024, the fair value of the 2029 Notes was approximately 386.4 million and the carrying value was 595.1 million. As of December 31, 2023, the fair value of the 2029 Notes was approximately 471.6 million and the carrying value was 594.5 million. The 2029 Notes pay interest at a fixed rate of 4.875 per annum payable semiannually in arrears on June 1 and December 1 of each year, beginning on December 1, 2021. The 2029 Notes mature on June 1, 2029, unless redeemed or repurchased in accordance with their terms prior to such date. The 2029 Notes are recorded at their carrying value and their fair value is used only for disclosure purposes, so an increase or decrease in interest rates would not have any impact to our condensed consolidated financial statements; however, if interest rates were to increase or decrease by 1 , their fair value could decrease by approximately 13.5 million or increase by approximately 14.1 million, respectively.

Item 4. Controls and Procedures 
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures . Our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, has evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the Exchange Act) as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Based on such evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of September 30, 2024. 
 Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting. There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) that occurred during the quarter ended September 30, 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 
 62

 (c) On February 9, 2021, our board of directors authorized a three-year 1.5 billion share repurchase program which had approximately 985.5 million of remaining authorized capacity prior to the share repurchase program expiring on February 9, 2024. This share repurchase program allowed us, which included an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of Herbalife Ltd., to repurchase our common shares at such times and prices as determined by management, as market conditions warranted, and to the extent Herbalife Ltd. s distributable reserves were available under Cayman Islands law. The 2024 Credit Facility permits us to repurchase our common shares as long as no default or event of default exists and other conditions, such as specified consolidated leverage ratios, are met. We did not repurchase any of our common shares during the three months ended September 30, 2024.
