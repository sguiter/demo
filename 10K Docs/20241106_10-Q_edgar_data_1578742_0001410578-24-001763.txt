 million paid at the initial date of closing was put into escrow by Group 1 in November 2021 and was released to the Partnership on April 12, 2022. The net consideration received for the ownership transfer of Prime Subaru Manchester, including the initial closing consideration, was million. Sale of Substantially All of the Partnership s Assets On September 12, 2021, the Partnership and certain of its direct and indirect subsidiaries entered into a Purchase Agreement (the Purchase Agreement with Group 1. Pursuant to the Purchase Agreement, the Partnership agreed to sell substantially all of the assets of the Partnership, including, but not limited to the Partnership s real property (including entities owning real property), vehicles, parts and accessories, goodwill, permits, intellectual property and substantially all contracts, that relate to their automotive dealership and collision center businesses, subject to obtaining the relevant manufacturer approvals, and excluding certain assets such as cash and certain receivables (the Group 1 Sale ). The Purchase Agreement was approved by GPB (via Highline) and the Monitor (as defined below). In November 2021, the Partnership obtained the necessary manufacturer approvals and completed the sale of substantially all of its assets, including real estate, collision centers, for of its 29 dealerships to Group 1. In December 2021, the Partnership obtained the necessary manufacturer approval and completed the sale of its 28th dealership and the related real estate to a third-party. The aggregate consideration for all of the dealership purchases and real-estate was million after taking into account the payoff of floorplan financing and mortgage debt outstanding at the time of the Group 1 Sale. The aggregate consideration of million for the sale of dealerships and real-estate includes million received directly by GPB Prime, as defined below, and was therefore, restricted from distribution to the Partnership or any of its affiliates pursuant to the terms of the M T Credit Agreement. On December 28, 2021, the Partnership and GPB Prime Holdings, LLC GPB Prime ), an entity in which the Partnership holds a interest, reached an agreement in principle with M T Bank Corporation M T Bank to allow for a million distribution to the Partnership and GPB Holdings II, LP, of which million was distributed to GPB Holdings II, LP, an affiliated entity to the Partnership which holds a non-controlling interest in GPB Prime. In January 2022, the Partnership and GPB Prime entered into a Twelfth Amendment (the Amendment to the M T Credit Agreement. The Amendment, among other things, reaffirmed the agreement in principle which (i) allowed for distribution to the Partnership and GPB Holdings II, LP of million, representing a portion of the proceeds received from the Group 1 Sale; (ii) changed the definition of floor plan borrowers to mean Prime Subaru Manchester; (iii) decreased the credit limit that may be borrowed for vehicle floorplan financing from million to up to million; and (iv) replaced the benchmark interest rates for borrowings from the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) to the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR) subject to certain adjustments in the Amendment. The M T Credit Agreement was amended primarily to reflect that we owned only one new vehicle dealership and no longer required the same amount of debt financing as was previously in place. Proceeds from the Group 1 Sale were used in part to repay all other amounts outstanding under the M T Credit Agreement. On October 16, 2023, the Partnership transferred the legal ownership of the sole remaining dealership, Prime Subaru Manchester, to Group 1, following the parties settlement of litigation described above. Plan of Liquidation Concurrent with reaching an agreement in principle with M T Bank on December 28, 2021 to allow for distributions to the Partnership and GPB Holdings II, LP, Highline, on behalf of GPB, caused us to commence a plan to liquidate the Partnership s remaining net assets and wind up the Partnership Plan of Liquidation ). Highline reached its decision to commence the Plan of Liquidation because of, among other things, the advanced stage of the Group 1 Sale, the agreement in principle with M T Bank to allow for a million distribution, and the fact that no further plans to deploy capital in any other investments were contemplated. In accordance with U.S. GAAP, liquidation of the Partnership was thereby determined to be imminent, resulting in the need to adopt the liquidation basis of accounting as of December 28, 2021.

 million of deposited cash held in banks was in excess of the FDIC coverage limit. The Partnership regularly monitors the financial stability of these financial institutions and believes that it is not exposed to any significant credit risk in cash and cash equivalents. However, in March and April 2023, certain U.S. government banking regulators took steps to intervene in the operations of certain financial institutions due to liquidity concerns, which caused general heightened uncertainties in the financial markets. While these and other current events have not had a material direct impact on the Partnership s Plan of Liquidation, if further liquidity and financial stability concerns arise with respect to banks and financial institutions, either nationally or in specific regions of the United States, the Partnership s ability to access cash may be threatened, which could have a material adverse effect on its net assets in liquidation. Investment securities include Treasury Bills with original maturities on the date of purchase of greater than three months. As of September 30, 2024, million was invested in Treasury Bills with original maturities on the date of purchase in excess of three months and is presented as investment securities in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Net Assets in Liquidation. million of restricted cash as a result of cash collateral for Letters of Credit primarily relating to potential worker's compensation insurance liabilities.

Estimated receipts from investments consists of total estimated receipts during liquidation from estimated interest income accrued from investment securities. 2. Corporate expenditures primarily consists of (i) selling, general and administrative expenses, (ii) managerial assistant fees, and (iii) legal and consulting fees relating to our corporate activities. 3.

Changes in estimated future cash flows during liquidation includes adjustments to previous estimates and changes in estimated holding periods of our assets. 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Partnership accrued interest income expected to be received on the investment securities invested in Treasury Bills of approximately million. This resulted in an increase to the total estimated receipts during the remaining liquidation period within the liability for estimated costs in excess of estimated receipts during liquidation. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Partnership revised its projection for legal and legal indemnification costs, primarily as a result of significantly higher legal costs due to: (i) the guilty verdict returned in the Criminal Case (as defined in Note 7. Commitment and Contingencies) and the impact it has on our consideration of potential outcomes with respect to the Criminal Case and the appeal of the Receivership Order (as defined in Note 7. Commitment and Contingencies) (the Appeal Process and (ii) higher-than-expected activity in numerous current and ongoing legal matters. The Partnership s revision resulted in an increase of million, in selling, general and administrative expenses - corporate within the liability for estimated costs in excess of estimated receipts during liquidation during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. As the various pending legal matters against GPB and the Partnership continue, particularly with respect to the Appeal Process, the estimated legal and legal related costs could continue to be significantly adjusted resulting in additional changes to the liability for estimated cost in excess of estimated receipts. There is significant uncertainty surrounding estimated costs expected to be incurred during the liquidation term, and potentially thereafter, primarily due to the costs covered under the indemnification agreements described in more detail in Note 7. Commitment and Contingencies and the timing and potential outcomes of the Appeal Process. The remaining million of changes in estimated future cash flows during liquidation relates primarily to the change in estimated future costs during liquidation for other various insignificant changes to corporate cost estimates. million to the Partnership and GPB Holdings II, LP H2 ), of which million was distributed to H2, an affiliated entity to the Partnership which holds a non-controlling interest in GPB Prime. On April 5, 2024, GPB Prime distributed million to the Partnership and million was distributed to H2. As a result of these distributions, net assets in liquidation decreased by million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024.

GPB AISF ), an offshore financing facility formed for the benefit of the Partnership, AISF Note 5 and AISF Note 6 for a total of million and incurred debt issuance costs of million. In 2019, the Partnership entered into loan agreement AISF Note 7 with GPB AISF for million and incurred debt issuance costs of million. Each AISF note was initially set to mature from the issuance date, and accrued interest at per annum, payable monthly in arrears. In July 2021, AISF Note 5 and AISF Note 6 were amended to increase the interest rate to and to extend the maturity date to December 2022. AISF Note 7 had an original maturity date of April 2023. AISF Note 5, AISF Note 6, and AISF Note 7 entered into default in 2021. In August 2021, a waiver for the event of default was issued and the interest payments were deferred until December 2022 for AISF Note 5, AISF Note 6, and AISF Note 7. Upon maturity, payments had not been made for AISF Note 5, AISF Note 6 and AISF Note 7.

The Partnership is not in a position to make distributions until the United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York (the EDNY Court rules on the pending Receivership Application (as defined below) (See Note 7. Commitments and Contingencies ). There is significant uncertainty with respect to when the Receivership Application will be resolved which could cause future adjustments to our liquidation estimates. Until a ruling is made, the Partnership will continue to accrue interest on the outstanding notes each quarterly filing using management s best estimate of six months of interest past the reporting period end date. Accrued interest associated with the outstanding principal balance of these loans of million was included as a component of notes payable - related party in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Net Assets in Liquidation as of December 31, 2023.

As of September 30, 2024, the Partnership and the Directors of GPB AISF determined an additional million should be accrued as representing additional interest due on the historical unpaid interest, calculated by applying the contractual interest rates specified above for AISF Notes 5, 6 and 7. Going forward, the Partnership will continue to accrue interest on the outstanding principal and unpaid interest amounts for AISF Notes 5, 6 and 7 at the contractual rates specified above.

 OTHER RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS GPB s principals, certain other individuals and entities that have assisted and may in the future assist in our operations are and/or will be members in GPB Auto SLP, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (the Special LP ). The Special LP will receive a profit allocation, commonly referred to as carried interest , from the Partnership in accordance with the waterfall provisions in the LPA. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 there have been profit allocations allocated to the Special LP. As compensation for the services to be rendered by Highline, the Partnership pays an operation service provider OSP fee to Highline for an annual amount agreed to by GPB and Highline, subject to the Highline Board s approval, following Highline s delivery of the annual written budget to GPB detailing the fees, costs and expenses that will be incurred by Highline in providing its Services.

After the OSP fee payment in January 2024, management has suspended the payment of all OSP fees from the Partnership until further notice. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, GPB increased the OSP fees expected to be paid during the liquidation term in light of the change in the estimated liquidation completion date to December 31, 2025, resulting in an increase to the liability for estimated costs in excess of estimated receipts during liquidation in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Net Assets in Liquidation by and million, respectively.

 million and million, respectively. The increase in these legal and legal indemnification cost projections is primarily a result of significantly higher legal costs due to: (i) the guilty verdict returned in the Criminal Case (as defined below) and the impact it has on our consideration of potential outcomes with respect to the Criminal Case and Appeal Process and (ii) higher-than-expected activity in numerous current and ongoing legal matters. As the various pending legal matters against GPB and the Partnership continue, particularly with respect to the Appeal Process, the estimated legal and legal related costs could continue to be significantly adjusted resulting in additional changes to the liability for estimated cost in excess of estimated receipts. There is significant uncertainty surrounding estimated costs expected to be incurred during the liquidation term, and potentially thereafter, primarily due to the costs covered under the indemnification agreements and the timing and potential outcomes of the Appeal Process. Legal indemnification expenses paid during the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, were million and million, respectively, which reduced the liability for estimated costs in excess of estimated receipts during liquidation in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Net Assets in Liquidation by a corresponding amount. Legal indemnification expenses paid during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, were million and million, respectively, which reduced the liability for estimated costs in excess of estimated receipts during liquidation in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Net Assets in Liquidation by a corresponding amount. With respect to all significant litigation and regulatory matters facing us, our General Partner, and our dealerships, we have considered the likelihood of an adverse outcome. It is possible that we could incur losses pertaining to these matters that may have a material adverse effect on our operational results, financial condition or liquidity in any future reporting period. We understand that the General Partner is currently paying legal costs associated with these actions for itself and certain indemnified parties. The Partnership expects to provide partial, or in many cases complete, reimbursement to the General Partner as required by various agreements or governing law. Certain of these outstanding matters include speculative, substantial or indeterminate monetary amounts. We record a liability when we believe that it is probable a loss will be incurred, and that the amount can be reasonably estimated. If we determine that a loss is reasonably possible and the loss or range of loss can be estimated, we disclose the reasonably possible loss. We regularly evaluate developments in our legal matters that could affect the amount of liability that has been previously accrued, if any, and the matters and related reasonably possible losses disclosed, and make adjustments as appropriate. Significant judgement is required to determine both the likelihood of there being, and the estimated amount of a loss related to, such matters. We continue to evaluate these legal matters and potential future losses in accordance with FASB ASC 450, Contingencies. Regulatory and Governmental Matters GPB and certain of its principals and affiliates face various regulatory and governmental matters. GPB seeks to comply with all laws, rules, regulations and investigations into any potential or alleged violation of law. In such situations where GPB disagrees with the Government s allegations made against it, GPB intends to vigorously defend itself in court. These matters could have a material adverse effect on GPB and/or the Partnership s net assets in liquidation. Federal Matters On February 4, 2021, the SEC filed a contested civil enforcement action (the SEC Action against GPB, Ascendant Capital, LLC Ascendant ), Ascendant Alternative Strategies, LLC AAS ), David Gentile, Jeffry Schneider and Jeffrey Lash in the EDNY Court. No GPB-managed partnership is a named defendant in the SEC Action. The SEC Action alleges several violations of the federal securities laws, including securities fraud. The SEC is seeking disgorgement and civil monetary penalties, among other remedies.

 counts of wire fraud. Promptly following his indictment, Mr. Gentile resigned from all management and board positions with GPB and Highline, the GPB-managed funds, including the Partnership, and subsidiaries of the Partnership. On June 6, 2023, Mr. Lash pled guilty to one count of wire fraud in the Criminal Case pursuant to a plea agreement. On June 10, 2024, the trial in the Criminal Case commenced against Mr. Gentile and Mr. Schneider. The jury in the Criminal Case returned a guilty verdict on all counts against Mr. Gentile and Mr. Schneider on August 1, 2024. Sentencing of Mr. Gentile and Mr. Schneider is scheduled for March 6, 2025. Mr. Lash s sentencing is scheduled for March 27, 2025. Appointment of Monitor and Application for Receivership On February 11, 2021, the EDNY Court in the SEC Action appointed Joseph T. Gardemal III as the independent monitor over GPB (the Monitor until further order of the EDNY Court (the Monitor Order ). The EDNY Court appointed the Monitor in response to a request from the SEC, which asserted that the Monitor was necessary to protect investors in light of the alleged misconduct of GPB Capital s former CEO, David Gentile. In its February 4, 2021 complaint the Complaint in the SEC Action, the SEC alleged that Mr. Gentile, as the owner and then-CEO of GPB Capital, along with Jeffry Schneider, the owner of Ascendant, GPB s placement agent, lied to investors about the source of money used to make annualized distribution payments to investors. According to the SEC, Mr. Gentile and others allegedly told investors that the distribution payments were paid exclusively with monies generated by GPB portfolio companies, but as alleged, GPB actually used investor money to pay portions of the annualized distributions. The Complaint further contains allegations that Mr. Gentile and others manipulated financial statements of certain limited partnership funds that GPB manages to perpetuate the deception by giving the false appearance that the funds income was closer to generating sufficient income to cover the distribution payments than it actually was. Moreover, the Complaint alleges that Mr. Gentile engaged in undisclosed self-dealing, including by omitting from investor communications certain conflicts of interest and fees and other compensation that he received, totaling approximately million. In support of the Monitor Order, the SEC contended that the Monitor would provide assurances to investors, GPB s counterparties, and the public that an unbiased and qualified person who was not beholden to Mr. Gentile was vetting any significant transactions and decisions, and looking out for the interests of investors. Accordingly, pursuant to the Monitor Order, GPB shall (i) grant the Monitor access to all non-privileged books, records and account statements for the GPB-managed funds, including the Partnership, as well as their portfolio companies; and (ii) cooperate fully with requests by the Monitor reasonably calculated to fulfill the Monitor s duties. The Monitor Order provides that the Monitor will remain in place until terminated by order of the EDNY Court, and grants the Monitor the authority to approve or disapprove proposed material corporate transactions by GPB, the Partnership and its subsidiaries, extensions of credit by them outside the ordinary course of business, decisions to make distributions to the Limited Partners of the Partnership, or any decision to file any bankruptcy or receiver petition for any of them, among other actions. The Monitor is not required to approve the issuance of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q Form 10-Q ), nor has management sought or obtained approval from the Monitor. On April 14, 2021, the EDNY Court entered an amendment to the Monitor Order (the Amended Monitor Order ), which provided that, in addition to the SEC and GPB, certain State regulators will receive access to the periodic reports filed by the Monitor pursuant to the Amended Monitor Order. On May 31, 2022, Mr. Gentile filed a motion in the SEC Action to modify the Amended Monitor Order pursuant to Rule 60(b) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure Rule 60(b) Motion ). In his Rule 60(b) Motion, Mr. Gentile sought a court order to, among other things, (i) narrow the scope of the Monitor s responsibilities; and (ii) direct the Monitor to ensure that GPB does not sell or otherwise dispose of assets or portfolio companies that the Partnership owns before the completion of a strategic assessment to be conducted by three managers Mr. Gentile purported to have appointed to GPB on May 27, 2022. On that same day, May 31, 2022, the Monitor notified Mr. Gentile and GPB that Mr. Gentile s purported appointment of three new managers to GPB without Monitor approval was in violation of the Amended Monitor Order. Mr. Gentile and GPB were, at that time, given ten (10) business days to cure the violation of the Amended Monitor Order. The cure period expired without any steps having been taken to comply with the Monitor s notification of violation of the Amended Monitor Order.

 million and are seeking rescission, compensatory damages, unspecified equitable relief and punitive damages, and interest and attorneys fees in unspecified amounts. Any potential losses associated with this matter cannot be estimated at this time. Barbara Deluca and Drew R. Naylor, on behalf of themselves and other similarly situated Limited Partners, v. GPB Automotive Portfolio, LP et al. (S.D.N.Y., Case No. 19-CV-10498) In November 2019, plaintiffs filed a putative class action complaint in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York against GPB, GPB Holdings II, LP, the Partnership, David Gentile, Jeffery Lash, AAS, Axiom, Jeffry Schneider, Mark Martino, and Ascendant. The Complaint alleges fraud and material omissions and misrepresentations to induce investment and losses in excess of billion. The plaintiffs are seeking disgorgement, compensatory, consequential, and general damages; disgorgement; rescission; restitution; punitive damages; and the establishment of a constructive trust. While the parties to the action stipulated in 2021 to stay this action pending resolution of the Criminal Case against defendants David Gentile and Jeffry Schneider, the Court nevertheless ordered the stay lifted as to the so-called Auditor Defendants in January 2023. On June 24, 2024, in response to a June 20, 2024 joint letter request filed by several parties to the case to stay all proceedings pending the preparation of a formal stipulation of settlement, a Magistrate Judge in the case entered an Order that all deadlines and proceedings related to the action are stayed with respect to all parties until further order of the Court. Any potential losses associated with this matter cannot be estimated at this time. Kinnie Ma Individual Retirement Account, et al., individually and on behalf of all others similarly situated, v. Ascendant Capital, LLC, et al. (W.D. Texas, Case No. 19-CV-01050) In October 2019, plaintiffs filed a putative class action in the United States District Court for the Western District of Texas against GPB, certain GPB-managed limited partnerships, including the Partnership, for which GPB is the General Partner, AAS, and Ascendant, as well as certain principals of the GPB-managed limited partnerships, auditors, broker-dealers, a fund administrator, and other individuals. The Complaint alleges violations and/or aiding and abetting violations of the Texas Securities Act, fraud, substantial assistance in the commission of fraud, breach of fiduciary duty, substantial assistance in breach of fiduciary duty, and negligence.

On June 1, 2022, the Western District of Texas Court consolidated this matter with Barasch v. GPB Capital, et al. (19-cv-01079); only the Kinnie Ma case continues, including the claims at issue in the Barasch v. GPB Capital matter and Loretta Dehay (as described below), which were consolidated under the Kinnie Ma docket number. On June 23, 2022, the Court denied Defendants David Gentile and Jeffry Schneider s motion to stay the case pending the resolution of the Criminal Case, U.S. v. Gentile, et al., No. 1:21-CR-54-DG (E.D.N.Y. Jan. 29, 2021). Plaintiffs filed a consolidated complaint on July 1, 2022, and defendants filed answers thereafter. On August 21, 2023, the Court granted the indicted defendants May 2023 motion to stay proceedings pending resolution of the related Criminal Case. On March 21, 2024, the District Judge denied Plaintiffs appeal of the Magistrate Judge s order staying the case, and affirmed the order granting Defendants motion to stay. Any potential losses associated with this matter cannot be estimated at this time.

 million, punitive damages, and a declaration that Concorde is contractually indemnified by the Defendants. In October 2021, the New York State Supreme Court ordered the action be stayed so that the Plaintiffs could pursue claims in arbitration. By the same Order, the New York State Supreme Court denied the Defendants motions to dismiss the Complaint. Any potential losses associated with this action cannot be estimated at this time. Concorde Investment Services, LLC v. GPB Capital Holdings, LLC, GPB Holdings, LP, GPB Automotive Portfolio, LP, GPB Waste Management, LP (American Arbitration Association, Case No. 01-21-0018-1470) In December 2021, claimant Concorde Investment Services, LLC Concorde , the Plaintiff in the New York case set forth above) filed a Demand for Arbitration with the American Arbitration Association (AAA). The arbitration, however, was dormant while certain issues in the New York case were litigated. In January 2023, Concorde successfully sought the appointment of a 3-arbitrator panel to proceed against GPB Capital and the GPB-managed funds (the GPB Funds ). Concorde seeks indemnification related to lawsuits and arbitrations brought against Concorde by its clients with respect to the limited partnership interests Concorde sold in the GPB Funds, and based upon the so-called dealer agreements entered into between Concorde and the GPB Funds. On or about April 25, 2023, the panel denied the Respondents request to file either a motion to dismiss the arbitration, or to stay the arbitration pending the resolution of the related Criminal Case. On November 3, 2023, following a telephonic conference with the panel, the panel denied the GPB Respondents request to stay the arbitration pending a decision by the EDNY Court on the Receivership Application. Arbitration proceedings commenced on April 29, 2024 , and concluded after ten (10) days of hearing on May 10, 2024. The parties will file post - hearing briefs with the panel in the fourth quarter of 2024, after which the panel is expected to render its decision. Any potential losses associated with this action cannot be estimated at this time. Actions asserted by GPB GPB Capital Holdings, LLC et al. v. Patrick Dibre (New York Supreme Court, Nassau County, Case No. 606417/2017) In July 2017, GPB, the Partnership, GPB Holdings I, LP, GPB Holdings Automotive, LLC, and GPB Portfolio Automotive, LLC filed suit in New York State Supreme Court, Nassau County, against Patrick Dibre, one of their former operating partners, for breach of contract, breach of fiduciary duty, fraud and conversion arising out of the Defendant s sale of certain automobile dealerships to the GPB Plaintiffs. Mr. Dibre answered GPB s Complaint, and asserted counterclaims alleging breach of contract and unjust enrichment. Plaintiffs have since filed amended complaints, narrowing the prior claims to focus on certain specific provisions in the documents governing the sale of the dealerships at issue. The plaintiffs seek damages based on the value of the subject dealerships related to the alleged breach, and also seek an order of specific performance compelling Mr. Dibre to fulfill other obligations under the governing documents. Any ruling in favor of the Partnership or potential losses associated with this matter cannot be determined or estimated at this time. GPB Capital Holdings, LLC et al. v. Patrick Dibre and 2150 Aventura Realty LLC (11th Judicial Circuit Ct, Miami-Dade County, Case No. 2023-021013-CA-01) In August 2023, GPB and several of its partnerships, including the Partnership, filed suit in Florida State Court against Patrick Dibre and an entity under Dibre s control, seeking, among other things, declaratory relief preventing Dibre from transferring the real estate underlying one of the automotive dealerships at issue in the litigation pending against Dibre in New York Supreme Court (as set forth above). GPB at the same time recorded a Notice of Lis Pendens on the real property at issue, which is located in Miami-Dade County, Florida, making a formal legal record of GPB and the other Plaintiffs enforceable and legally cognizable equitable interests in and to the property at issue. Any potential ruling in favor of the Partnership cannot be determined at this time.

We undertake no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements, except as required by law. For purposes of this Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations section, we use the terms the Partnership , we , us , our or Registrant to refer to the business of GPB Automotive Portfolio, LP and its consolidated subsidiaries, unless otherwise indicated. Financial Condition, Results of Operations, and Liquidity OVERVIEW GPB Automotive Portfolio, LP (the Partnership , we , us , our or the Registrant is a holding company which was organized as a Delaware limited partnership on May 27, 2013, and commenced operations on that date. GPB Capital Holdings, LLC General Partner , Capital Holdings , GPB Capital , or GPB ), a Delaware limited liability company and registered investment adviser, is the Partnership s General Partner pursuant to the terms of the Fifth Amended and Restated Agreement of Limited Partnership, Dated April 27, 2018 (as the same may be amended from time to time, the LPA ). Pursuant to the LPA, GPB conducts and manages our business. Robert Chmiel, GPB s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, currently serves as the sole manager of GPB under the term of GPB s limited liability company agreement. However, GPB has entered into a management services agreement with GPB s wholly owned subsidiary, Highline Management, Inc. Highline ), pursuant to which Highline provides certain management services to GPB to assist GPB in fulfilling GPB s duties as the Partnership s General Partner. On February 4, 2021, the Securities and Exchange (the SEC filed a contested civil enforcement action (the SEC Action against GPB, Ascendant Capital, LLC Ascendant ), Ascendant Alternative Strategies, LLC AAS ), David Gentile, Jeffry Schneider and Jeffrey Lash in the EDNY Court, as defined below. No GPB-managed partnership is a named defendant. The SEC Action alleges several violations of the federal securities laws, including securities fraud. The SEC is seeking disgorgement and civil monetary penalties, among other remedies. Also on February 4, 2021, the U.S. Attorney s Office for the Eastern District of New York (the USAO brought a criminal indictment against Mr. Gentile (GPB s sole Member), Mr. Schneider, and Mr. Lash (the Criminal Case ). The indictment in the Criminal Case alleges conspiracy to commit securities fraud, conspiracy to commit wire fraud, and securities fraud against all three individuals. Mr. Gentile and Mr. Lash were also charged with two counts of wire fraud. Promptly following his indictment, Mr. Gentile resigned from all management and board positions with GPB and Highline, the GPB-managed funds, including the Partnership, and subsidiaries of the Partnership. On June 6, 2023, Mr. Lash pled guilty to one count of wire fraud in the Criminal Case pursuant to a plea agreement.

 On February 11, 2021, the United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York (the EDNY Court in the SEC Action appointed Joseph T. Gardemal III as the independent monitor over GPB (the Monitor until further order of the EDNY Court (the Monitor Order ). The Monitor was granted the authority to approve or disapprove proposed material corporate transactions by GPB, the Partnership or its subsidiaries. On April 14, 2021,the EDNY Court entered an amendment to the Monitor Order (the Amended Monitor Order ), which provided that, in addition to the SEC and GPB, certain State regulators will receive access to the periodic reports filed by the Monitor pursuant to the Amended Monitor Order. The Monitor is thus required to assess the Partnership s operations and business, and make recommendations to the EDNY Court, which may include continuation of the operations subject to his monitoring, or a liquidation of assets, or filing for reorganizing in bankruptcy. See Note 7. Commitments and Contingencies for additional information. Until the sale of substantially all of the Partnership s assets described below under Sale of Substantially All of the Partnership s Assets, we owned and operated multiple retail automotive dealerships in the northeastern United States, including in most cases their related real estate, and sought to further develop their operations to increase cash flow and income from operations on behalf of the Limited Partners. We disposed of our last dealership in October 2023, thus the Partnership no longer owns or operates any dealerships. Sale of Substantially All of the Partnership s Assets On September 12, 2021, the Partnership and certain of its direct and indirect subsidiaries entered into a Purchase Agreement (the Purchase Agreement with Group 1 Automotive, Inc., a Delaware corporation Group 1 ). Pursuant to the Purchase Agreement, the Partnership agreed to sell substantially all of the assets of the Partnership, including, but not limited to the Partnership s real property (including entities owning real property), vehicles, parts and accessories, goodwill, permits, intellectual property and substantially all contracts, that relate to their automotive dealership and collision center businesses, subject to obtaining the relevant manufacturer approvals, and excluding certain assets such as cash and certain receivables (the Group 1 Sale ). The Purchase Agreement was approved by GPB (via Highline) and the Monitor. In November 2021, the Partnership obtained the necessary manufacturer approvals and completed the sale of substantially all of its assets, including real estate, three collision centers, for 27 of its 29 dealerships to Group 1. In December 2021, the Partnership obtained the necessary manufacturer approval and completed the sale of its 28th dealership and the related real estate to a third-party. The aggregate consideration for all of the 28 dealership purchases and real-estate was 824.9 million after taking into account the payoff of floorplan financing and mortgage debt outstanding at the time of the Group 1 Sale. The foregoing description of the Purchase Agreement is a summary only and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the complete text of the Purchase Agreement, which is filed as Exhibit 2.1 in Item 6. Exhibits. Included in the aggregate consideration of 824.9 million for the sale of 28 dealerships and real-estate includes 763.6 million received directly by GPB Prime Holdings, LLC GPB Prime ), an entity in which the Partnership hold a 66.5 interest, and was therefore, restricted from distribution to the Partnership or any of its affiliates pursuant to the terms of the M T Credit Agreement. On December 28, 2021, the Partnership and GPB Prime reached an agreement in principle with M T Bank Corporation M T Bank to allow for distribution to the Partnership and GPB Holdings II, LP, of a sum of 570.0 million of which 188.8 million was distributed to GPB Holdings II, LP, affiliated entity to the Partnership which holds a 33.5 non-controlling interest in GPB Prime. In January 2022, the Partnership and GPB Prime entered into a Twelfth Amendment (the Amendment to the M T Credit Agreement. The Amendment, among other things, reaffirmed the agreement in principle which (i) allows for distribution to the Partnership and GPB Holdings II, LP of 570.0 million representing a portion of the proceeds received from the Group 1 Sale; (ii) changes the definition of floor plan borrowers to mean AMR Auto Holdings SM, LLC d/b/a Prime Subaru Manchester Prime Subaru Manchester (iii) decreases the credit limit that may be borrowed for vehicle floorplan financing from 360.0 million to up to 8.8 million; and (iv) replaces the benchmark interest rates for borrowings from the London Interbank Offered Rate LIBOR to Secured Overnight Financing Rate SOFR subject to certain adjustments in the Amendment. The M T Credit Agreement was amended primarily to reflect that we only owned one new vehicle dealership and no longer required the same amount of debt financing as was previously in place. Proceeds from the Group 1 Sale were used in part to repay all other amounts outstanding under the M T Credit Agreement. On October 16, 2023, GPB Prime transferred legal ownership of the sole remaining dealership, Prime Subaru Manchester, to Group 1, following the parties settlement of litigation.

 Plan of Liquidation Concurrent with reaching an agreement in principle with M T Bank on December 28, 2021, to allow for distributions to the Partnership and GPB Holdings II, LP, Highline, on behalf of GPB, caused us to commence a plan to liquidate the Partnership s remaining net assets and wind up the Partnership (the Plan of Liquidation ). Highline management reached its decision to commence the Plan of Liquidation because of, among other things, the advanced stage of the Group 1 Sale, the agreement in principle with M T Bank to allow for the 570.0 million distribution, and that no further plans to deploy capital in any other investments were contemplated. In accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles U.S. GAAP ), liquidation of the Partnership was thereby determined to be imminent, resulting in the need to adopt the liquidation basis of accounting as of December 28, 2021. The Highline Board of Directors (the Board formally approved the commencement of the Plan of Liquidation at the Board meeting held on February 3, 2022. The Board concluded that it was appropriate to adopt liquidation accounting in accordance with U.S. GAAP for financial reporting purposes, using a convenience date of December 31, 2021. The Partnership cannot predict the timing or amount of any distributions to its limited partners Limited Partners ), because uncertainties exist as to: (i) the ultimate amount of expenses associated with implementing its monetization strategy, liabilities, operating costs, and amounts to be set aside for claims; (ii) obligations and provisions during the liquidation and winding-up process; (iii) the timing and outcome of the pending litigation, and the related timing to complete such transactions during the overall liquidation process; and (iv) the related timing to complete such transactions during the overall liquidation process. Upon transitioning to the liquidation basis of accounting on December 31, 2021, the Partnership initially estimated the liquidation process would be complete by December 31, 2024, an estimate that was, in part, driven by the commencement date for the Criminal Case (see Note 7. Commitments and Contingencies ). As a result of the commencement date for the Criminal Case being set later than initially projected, the Partnership extended the expected liquidation completion date from December 31, 2024 to December 31, 2025, effective from the quarter ended March 31, 2023. No assurances can be provided that the expected liquidation completion date will be met and future changes to this expected date could have a material impact in the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements and the amount, if any, that is ultimately distributed to our limited partners. On May 14, 2024, Tom Lemke resigned from the Board. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS In light of the adoption of Liquidation Basis of Accounting as of December 31, 2021, we no longer discuss the changes in results of our operations. Liquidity and Capital Resources Since the adoption of our Plan of Liquidation, our ability to meet our obligations is contingent upon the disposal of our assets in accordance with the Plan of Liquidation. As of September 30, 2024, all significant non-cash or investment assets have been liquidated. We had 3.3 million in cash on hand and cash equivalents, 2.2 million in restricted cash, and 526.2 million in investment securities as of September 30, 2024. We expect that this cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash, and investment securities will be adequate to meet our obligations, pursuant to our Plan of Liquidation. Investment securities include Treasury Bills with original maturities on the date of purchase of greater than three months. As of September 30, 2024, 526.2 million was invested in Treasury Bills with original maturities on the date of purchase in excess of three months and is presented as investment securities in the Condensed Consolidated Statement of Net Assets in Liquidation. Contractual Payment Obligation As of September 30, 2024, there have been no material changes to the contractual payment obligations table included in the Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC on March 11, 2024 (the Form 10-K ). Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements We do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a material current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources.

 Critical Accounting Estimates As of and for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, there have been no material changes to the critical accounting estimates included in the Form 10-K. Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk There have been no material changes in our reported market risks or risk management policies since the filing of the Form 10-K. Item 4. Controls and Procedures The Partnership s management, with the participation of Rob Chmiel, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer of GPB, has evaluated the effectiveness of the Partnership s disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934), as amended (the Exchange Act as of September 30, 2024. Based on that evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer has concluded that at September 30, 2024, due to the existence of the material weaknesses in the Partnership s internal controls over financial reporting ICFR described below, the Partnership s disclosure controls and procedures were not effective. Notwithstanding such material weaknesses in the Partnership s ICFR, our management concluded that our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-Q present fairly, in all material respects, the Partnership s Condensed Consolidated Statements of Net Assets in Liquidation and Changes in Net Assets in Liquidation as of the dates, and for the periods presented, in conformity with U.S. GAAP for interim financial information and in accordance with the rules and regulations of the SEC. Internal Controls over Financial Reporting Material Weaknesses We have concluded that there are material weaknesses in our system of ICFR, which if not remediated could materially and adversely affect our ability to timely and accurately report our results of operations and financial condition. We have identified deficiencies, or a combination of deficiencies, relating to risk assessment, control activities and monitoring of the Partnership s control environment that have been determined to be material weaknesses in our internal controls. These identified weaknesses are attributed, in part, to insufficient and ineffective controls within our financial close and reporting process. Remediation Plan Our management is committed to maintaining a strong internal control environment and implementing measures designed to help ensure the financial statements are free of material error. To remediate the material weaknesses, management believes the following remediation plans would have to be developed, implemented, and tested: establishing a hierarchy of review with the appropriate complement of management personnel, and implementing intensive review policies and procedures to be performed at an appropriate level of precision. 
 Our management is currently determining the extent and timing of its remediation efforts including rationalizing the level of investment necessary to mitigate the level of risk brought on by our material weaknesses, in light of the progress being made in our Plan of Liquidation. We may decide to take additional measures to address control deficiencies or determine to modify, or, in appropriate circumstances, not to complete such actions due to the timing of carrying out the Plan of Liquidation. Changes in Internal Controls over Financial Reporting There were no changes in our ICFR during the three months ended September 30, 2024, that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our ICFR.
