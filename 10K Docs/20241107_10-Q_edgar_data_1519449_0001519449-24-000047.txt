 The Company regularly monitors its available-for-sale fixed maturity securities that have fair values less than cost or amortized cost for signs of impairment, an assessment that requires significant management judgment regarding the evidence known. Such judgments could change in the future as more information becomes known, which could negatively impact the amounts reported. Among the factors that management considers for fixed maturity securities are the financial condition of the issuer including receipt of scheduled principal and interest cash flows, and intent to sell, including if it is more likely than not that the Company will be required to sell the investments before recovery. 
 As of September 30, 2024, the Company had lots of fixed maturity securities in an unrealized loss position. The Company does not have an intent to sell these securities and it is not more likely than not that the Company will be required to sell these securities before maturity or recovery of its cost basis. The Company determined that no credit impairment existed in the gross unrealized holding losses because the credit ratings of these securities were consistent with the credit ratings when purchased and/or at origination, there were no adverse changes in financial condition of the issuer and no adverse credit quality events in underlying assets. The Company attributed the unrealized losses to the changes in interest rates.

 The transfers into Level 3 during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 were the result of securities that began receiving valuations from asset managers that utilized unobservable inputs at the end of the period. 
 The Company measures certain assets, including investments in indirect loans and loan collateral, equity method investments and other invested assets, at fair value on a nonrecurring basis only when they are deemed to be impaired. 
 In addition to the preceding disclosures on assets and liabilities recorded at fair value in the consolidated balance sheets, the Company is also required to disclose the fair values of certain other financial instruments for which it is practicable to estimate fair value. Estimated fair value amounts, defined as the quoted market price of a financial instrument, have been determined using available market information and other appropriate valuation methodologies. However, considerable judgements are required in developing the estimates of fair value where quoted market prices are not available. Accordingly, these estimates are not necessarily indicative of the amounts that could be realized in a current market exchange. The use of different market assumptions or estimating methodologies may have an effect on the estimated fair value amounts.

The increase in gross written premiums for the third quarter and first nine months of 2024, when compared to the same 2023 periods, was driven by double-digit premium growth primarily from our transactional E S, programs, captives, surety and global property agriculture underwriting divisions. 
 During the third quarter and first nine months of 2023, the Company cancelled a quota share reinsurance contract. The following table provides a reconciliation of the impact of the cancellation of the quota share reinsurance contract on ceded written premiums, net retention, net written premiums and net earned premiums for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023:

 Net written premiums for the third quarter of 2024 were 268.3 million compared to 280.7 million for the same 2023 period. Net written premiums for the first nine months of 2024 were 852.6 million compared to 696.6 million for the same 2023 period. Excluding the impact of the quota share reinsurance contract cancellation, net written premiums for the third quarter and first nine months of 2024 increased 16.5 and 32.0 , respectively, when compared to the same 2023 periods, primarily driven by the same reasons that drove the increases in gross written premiums discussed above. 
 Net earned premiums for the third quarter of 2024 were 269.6 million compared to 227.0 million for the same 2023 period. Net earned premiums for the first nine months of 2024 were 763.5 million compared to 604.2 million for the same 2023 period. Excluding the impact of the quota share reinsurance contract cancellation, net earned premiums for the third quarter and first nine months of 2024 increased 26.0 and 29.2 , respectively, when compared to the same 2023 periods, primarily driven by the same reasons that drove the increases in gross written premiums discussed above.

Table of Contents 

 The increase in income from our fixed income portfolio for the third quarter and first nine months of 2024, when compared to the same 2023 periods, was due to (i) a larger asset base as we continued to increase our allocation to this part of our investment portfolio and (ii) a higher book yield of 5.0 at September 30, 2024 compared to 4.2 at September 30, 2023. The increase in income from short-term investments for the third quarter and first nine months of 2024 when compared to the same 2023 periods, was due to higher investment yields and a larger asset base. The increase in income from alternative and strategic investments for the first nine months of 2024 was driven by the increase in the fair value of limited partnership investments when compared to the same 2023 period. Net investment income for the third quarter of 2024 and 2023 was impacted by a decline in the fair value of limited partnership investments. 
 When a fixed maturity has been determined to have an impairment, the impairment charge is separated into an amount representing the credit loss, which is recognized in earnings as a realized loss and on the balance sheet as an allowance for credit losses netted with the amortized cost of fixed maturities. Future increases in fair value, if related to credit factors, are recognized through earnings limited to the amount previously recognized as an allowance for credit losses. The amount related to non-credit factors is recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income and future increases or decreases in fair value, if not credit losses, are included in accumulated other comprehensive (loss) income. We reviewed our available-for-sale fixed maturities at September 30, 2024 and determined that no credit impairment existed in the gross unrealized holding losses.

Our effective tax rates for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 were 21.7 and 22.2 , respectively, compared to 21.9 and 21.8 , respectively, for the same 2023 periods. For additional information, see Note 7 of our condensed consolidated financial statements included in Item 1 of this Form 10-Q. 
 
 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 Sources and Uses of Funds 
 Our most significant source of cash is from premiums received from our insureds, which, for most policies, we receive at the beginning of the coverage period, net of the related commission amount for the policies. Our most significant cash outflow is for claims that arise when a policyholder incurs an insured loss. Because the payment of claims occurs after the receipt of the premium, often years later, we invest the cash in various investment securities that generally earn interest and dividends. We also use cash to pay for operating expenses such as salaries, rent and taxes and capital expenditures such as technology systems. We use reinsurance to manage the risk that we take on our policies. We cede, or pay out, part of the premiums we receive to our reinsurers and collect cash back when losses subject to our reinsurance coverage are paid. 
 The timing of our cash flows from operating activities can vary among periods due to the timing by which payments are made or received. Some of our payments and receipts, including loss settlements and subsequent reinsurance receipts, can be significant, and as a result their timing can influence cash flows from operating activities in any given period. Management believes that cash receipts from premiums and proceeds from investment income are sufficient to cover cash outflows in the foreseeable future.

 Our cash flows for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 were: 
 in thousands) 2024 2023 Cash and cash equivalents provided by (used in): Operating activities 283,216 218,539 Investing activities (227,963) (307,833) Financing activities (4,233) 67,549 Change in cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash 51,020 (21,745) 
 The increase in cash provided by operating activities in 2024 and 2023 was primarily due to positive cash flow from our insurance operations. Cash from operations can vary from period to period due to the timing of premium receipts, claim payments and reinsurance activity. Cash flows from operations in each of the past two years were used primarily to fund investing activities. 
 Net cash used in investing activities in 2024 was primarily driven by purchases of fixed maturity securities, partially offset by sales and maturities of investment securities and sales of short-term investments. Net cash used in investing activities in 2023 was primarily driven by purchases of fixed maturity securities and short-term investments. 
 Net cash used in financing activities in 2024 was driven by net payments on debt. 
 Credit Agreements 
 FHLB Loan 
 On August 30, 2024, we entered into a loan the FHLB Loan with the Federal Home Loan Bank of Dallas (the FHLB pursuant to its Advances and Security Agreement. The FHLB Loan is a 4.5-year term loan in the principal amount of 57.0 million. The FHLB Loan provides for interest-only payments during its term, with principal due in full at maturity. The interest rate is fixed over the term of the loan at 4.00 . The FHLB Loan is fully secured by a pledge of specific investment securities of HSIC. We used the proceeds to fund the redemption of the March 15, 2024 draw on the Revolving Credit Facility and redeem 7.0 million of the March 29, 2023 draw on the Revolving Credit Facility (see Revolving Credit Facility below for additional information regarding the redemption). 
 Revolving Credit Facility 
 On March 29, 2023, we entered into an unsecured revolving credit facility (the Revolving Credit Facility with a syndicate of participating banks. The Revolving Credit Facility provides us with up to a 150.0 million revolving credit facility and a letter of credit sub-facility of up to 30.0 million. 
 On March 14, 2024, we drew 50.0 million on the Revolving Credit Facility and used the proceeds and existing cash to fund the redemption of the Debentures (see Debentures below for additional information regarding the redemption). 
 On August 30, 2024, we fully redeemed the March 15, 2024 draw on the Revolving Credit Facility and redeemed 7.0 million of the March 29, 2023 draw on the Revolving Credit Facility. As of September 30, 2024, we had 43.0 million outstanding under the Revolving Credit Facility with another 107.0 million of undrawn capacity. 
 Interest on the Revolving Credit Facility is payable quarterly. The interest rate on the Revolving Credit Facility is the SOFR plus a margin of between 150 and 190 basis points based on the ratio of debt to total capital and a credit spread adjustment of 10 basis points. At September 30, 2024, the six-month SOFR on the Revolving Credit Facility was 4.25 , plus a margin of 1.60 . 
 We are subject to covenants on the Revolving Credit Facility based on minimum net worth, maximum debt to capital ratio, minimum A.M. Best Rating and minimum liquidity. As of September 30, 2024, we are in compliance with all covenants. 
 Debentures 
 In August 2006, we received 58.0 million of proceeds from a debenture offering through a statutory trust, Delos Capital Trust (the Trust ). The sole asset of the Trust consists of Fixed/Floating Rate Junior Subordinated Deferrable Interest Debentures (the Trust Preferred with a principal amount of 59.8 million issued by us and cash of 1.8 million from the issuance of Trust common shares purchased by us equal to 3 of the Trust capitalization. On March 15, 2024, the Company redeemed the Debentures and paid 1.4 million of accrued interest.

Table of Contents 

 Subordinated Debt 
 In May 2019, we issued unsecured subordinated notes (the Notes with an aggregate principal amount of 20.0 million. Interest on the subordinated notes is 7.25 fixed for the first eight years and 8.25 fixed thereafter. Early retirement of the debt ahead of the eight-year commitment requires all interest payments to be paid in full, as well as the return of all capital. Principal payment is due at maturity on May 24, 2039 and interest is payable quarterly. 
 At September 30, 2024 the ratio of total debt outstanding, including the FHLB Loan, the Revolving Credit Facility and the Notes, to total capitalization (defined as total debt plus stockholders equity) was 13.0 and at December 31, 2023, the ratio of total debt outstanding, including the Term Loan, the Revolver, the Trust Preferred and the Notes, to total capitalization was 16.3 . 
 Share Repurchase Program 
 In October 2024, the Board of Directors approved a share repurchase program authorizing the repurchase of up to 50.0 million of our common stock. The shares may be repurchased from time to time in open market purchases, privately-negotiated transactions, block purchases, accelerated share repurchase agreements or a combination of methods, including through Rule 10b5-1 trading plans. The timing, manner, price and amount of any repurchases under the share repurchase program will be determined by us in our discretion. The share repurchase program does not require us to repurchase any specific number of shares, and may be modified, suspended or terminated at any time. 
 
 Reinsurance 
 We strategically purchase reinsurance from third parties which enhances our business by protecting capital from severity events (either large single event losses or catastrophes) and reducing volatility in our earnings. Our reinsurance contracts are predominantly one year in length and renew annually throughout the year. At each annual renewal, we consider several factors that influence any changes to our reinsurance purchases, including any plans to change the underlying insurance coverage we offer, updated loss activity, the level of our capital and surplus, changes in our risk appetite and the cost and availability of reinsurance treaties. 
 We purchase quota share reinsurance, excess of loss reinsurance, and facultative reinsurance coverage to limit our exposure from losses on any one occurrence. The mix of reinsurance purchased considers efficiency, cost, our risk appetite and specific factors of the underlying risks we underwrite. 
 Quota share reinsurance refers to a reinsurance contract whereby the reinsurer agrees to assume a specified percentage of the ceding company s losses arising out of a defined class of business in exchange for a corresponding percentage of premiums, net of a ceding commission. 
 Excess of loss reinsurance refers to a reinsurance contract whereby the reinsurer agrees to assume all or a portion of the ceding company s losses for an individual claim or an event in excess of a specified amount in exchange for a premium payable amount negotiated between the parties, which includes our catastrophe reinsurance program. 
 Facultative coverage refers to a reinsurance contract on individual risks as opposed to a group or class of business. It is used for a variety of reasons, including supplementing the limits provided by the treaty coverage or covering risks or perils excluded from treaty reinsurance. 
 For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 our net retention on a written basis (calculated as net written premiums as a percentage of gross written premiums) was 67.1 and 62.9 , respectively, compared to 78.9 and 61.2 , respectively, for the same 2023 periods.
