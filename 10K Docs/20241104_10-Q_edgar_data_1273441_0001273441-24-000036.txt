 (2) Non-GAAP measures. 
 
 Operating netback, EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA, and funds flow from operations are non-GAAP measures that do not have any standardized meaning prescribed under GAAP. Management views these measures as financial performance measures. Investors are cautioned that these measures should not be construed as alternatives to oil sales, net income (loss) or other measures of financial performance as determined in accordance with GAAP. Our method of calculating these measures may differ from other companies and, accordingly, may not be comparable to similar measures used by other companies. Disclosure of each non-GAAP financial measure is preceded by the corresponding GAAP measure so as not to imply that more emphasis should be placed on the non-GAAP measure.

Operating netback, as presented, is defined as oil sales less operating and transportation expenses. Management believes that operating netback is a useful supplemental measure for management and investors to analyze financial performance and provides an indication of the results generated by our principal business activities prior to the consideration of other income and expenses. A reconciliation from oil sales to operating netback is provided in the table above. 
 
 EBITDA, as presented, is defined as net income (loss) adjusted for depletion, depreciation and accretion DD A expenses, interest expense and income tax expense or recovery. Adjusted EBITDA, as presented, is defined as EBITDA adjusted for non-cash lease expense, lease payments, foreign exchange gain or loss, stock-based compensation expense or recovery, transaction costs related to the acquisition of i3 Energy and other gain or loss. Management uses this supplemental measure to analyze performance and income generated by our principal business activities prior to the consideration of how non-cash items affect that income and believes that this financial measure is useful supplemental information for investors to analyze our performance and our financial results. A reconciliation from net (loss) income to EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA is as follows:

Operating expense s for the three months ended September 30, 2024, decreased by 7 to 46.1 million or by 0.67 per bbl to 19.66 compared to the corresponding period of 2023, primarily due to 0.96 per bbl lower lifting costs associated with power generation, equipment rental and road maintenance which were partially offset by 0.29 per bbl higher workover activities. 
 
 Operating expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, increased by 2 to 141.6 million or by 0.80 per bbl to 20.20 per bbl compared to the corresponding period of 2023, primarily as a result of 1.02 per bbl higher workover costs which were partially offset by 0.22 per bbl lower power generation costs. 
 
 Compared to the prior quarter, operating expenses decreased by 2 from 47.0 million, or by 0.86 per bbl from 20.52 per bbl primarily due to 1.41 per bbl lower workover costs which were partially offset by 0.55 per bbl higher lifting costs primarily associated with inventory fluctuation in Ecuador and community aid initiatives in Colombia. 

Transportation expenses 
 
 We have options to sell our oil through multiple pipelines and trucking routes. Each option has varying effects on realized sales price and transportation expenses. The following table shows the percentage of oil volumes we sold in Colombia and Ecuador using each option for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, and the prior quarter: 
 Three Months Ended September 30, Three Months Ended June 30, Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 2024 2024 2023 Volume transported through pipeline 5 3 2 4 2 Volume sold at wellhead 46 47 45 47 46 Volume transported via truck to sales point 49 50 53 49 52 100 100 100 100 100 
 
 Volumes transported through pipeline or via truck receive a higher realized price but incur higher transportation expenses. Conversely, volumes sold at the wellhead have the opposite effect of a lower realized price, offset by lower transportation expenses. 

Transportation expenses for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, increased by 2 and 34 to 3.9 million and 14.2 million, respectively, compared to the corresponding periods of 2023, due to an increase in trucking tariffs for Acordionero volumes and higher sales volumes transported in Ecuador during the current quarter. 
 27 

On a per bbl basis, transportation expenses for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, increased by 0.09 and 0.54 to 1.67 and 2.02, respectively, compared to the corresponding periods of 2023 due to higher sales volumes transported in Ecuador, an increase in trucking tariffs and the utilization of the longer distance delivery points for the first half of 2024 in response to lower water levels in the Magdalena river. 
 
 Transportation expenses decreased by 31 or 0.81 per bbl from 5.7 million or 2.48 per bbl in the prior quarter due to the utilization of shorter distance delivery points during the current quarter.

 Compared to the prior quarter, G A expenses before stock-based compensation decreased by 13 or 0.73 per bbl due to lower consulting, business development and travel expenses. 
 
 G A expenses after stock-based compensation for the three months ended September 30, 2024, decreased by 38 or 1.51 per bbl, compared to the corresponding period of 2023, due to stock-based compensation recovery attributed to a lower share price during the current quarter. 
 
 G A expenses after stock-based compensation for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, increased by 15 , or 0.80 per bbl, compared to the corresponding period of 2023 due to higher travel and general office expenses and higher stock-based compensation expense attributed to higher share price during current period. 
 
 Compared to the prior quarter, G A expenses after stock-based compensation decreased by 63 or 4.76 per bbl due to stock-based compensation recovery attributed to a lower share price during the current quarter.

Foreign Exchange Gains and Losses 
 
 For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, we had a 3.1 million and 8.3 million gain on foreign exchange compared to a 1.7 million and 8.1 million loss on foreign exchange in the corresponding periods of 2023, respectively, and a 4.4 million gain on foreign exchange in the prior quarter. Accounts payable, taxes receivable and payable and deferred income taxes are considered monetary items and require translation from local currencies to U.S. dollar functional currency at each balance sheet date. This translation was the primary source of the foreign exchange gains and losses in the periods.

Income Tax Expense 
 Three Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30, (Thousands of U.S. Dollars) 2024 2023 2024 2023 Income before income tax 21,900 46,860 66,516 92,950 Current income tax expense 15,217 26,343 61,422 63,706 Deferred income tax (recovery) expense

 Current income tax expense was 61.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 63.7 million in the corresponding period of 2023, due to lower taxable income in Colombia, partially offset by additional current tax expense related to a tax planning strategy. 
 
 The deferred income tax for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, was a recovery of 32.3 million primarily as a result of the recognition of additional tax losses resulting from a tax planning strategy, which were partially offset by depreciation being higher than accounting depreciation and the use of tax losses to offset taxable income in Colombia. 
 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the difference between the effective tax rate of 44 and the 50 Colombian tax rate was primarily due to a lower impact of foreign taxes, 2022 true-up related to tax planning strategy and non-taxable foreign exchange adjustments. These were partially offset by an increase in valuation allowance, other permanent differences, non-deductible stock-based compensation and non-deductible royalties in Colombia. 
 
 We strategically revised our 2022 tax return to use our tax receivables balance to offset current tax liabilities, rather than applying net operating loss carryforwards. This decision was driven by the expectation of higher future tax rates and increased profitability. As a result, there was an increase in current tax expense, which was offset by long-term tax receivables, ensuring no impact on cash flows. This approach preserved our net operating loss carryforwards for future periods, providing greater tax benefits and flexibility in recovering tax receivables, while strengthening our equity position. 
 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2023, the difference between the effective tax rate of 115 and the 50 Colombian tax rate was primarily due to an increase in non-deductible foreign exchange adjustments, the impact of foreign taxes, non-deductible royalties in Colombia and non-deductible stock-based compensation. These were partially offset by a decrease in valuation allowance. 
 
 The deferred income tax expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, was 43.2 million, primarily as a result of tax depreciation being higher than accounting depreciation and the use of tax losses to offset taxable income in Colombia.

 We believe that our capital resources, including cash on hand and cash generated from operations, will provide us with sufficient liquidity to meet our strategic objectives and planned capital program for the next 12 months, given the current oil price trends and production levels. We may also access capital markets to pursue financing, including for repayment of debt in the future. In accordance with our investment policy, available cash balances are held in our primary cash management banks or may be invested in U.S. or Canadian government-backed federal, provincial or state securities or other money market instruments with high credit ratings and short-term liquidity. We believe that our current financial position provides us with the flexibility to respond to both internal growth opportunities and those available through acquisitions. We intend to pursue growth opportunities and acquisitions from time to time, which may require significant capital to be located in basins or countries beyond our current operations, involve joint ventures, or be sizable compared to our current assets and operations.

As at December 31, 2023, we had a 36.4 million balance outstanding under the Company s credit facility. On February 6, 2024, the outstanding balance of 36.4 million was fully re-paid and the credit facility was terminated. 
 
 On August 19, 2024, we entered into a credit facility agreement Loan Facility with a market leader in the global commodities industry to fund the cash consideration payable to i3 Energy s shareholders in connection with the acquisition of i3 Energy and associated costs (Note 12). The Loan Facility has a borrowing base of 80.0 million (US 107.0 million) and bears interest based on a three-month secured overnight financing rate posted by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York plus a margin of 3.00 per annum for the first three months after the initial drawdown and 6.00 per annum thereafter. The Loan Facility is subject to a commitment fee equal to the higher of 0.5 million and 0.5 of the borrowing base converted to US dollars using the agreed upon GBP to USD foreign exchange rate at the time of initial drawdown date. The commitment fee is payable on the earlier of the date of the initial drawdown and the three months after signing date of the Loan Facility. The undrawn amounts under the Loan Facility bear interest at 0.5 per annum, based on the available amount. The Loan Facility was terminated on October 31, 2024. 
 
 As of September 30, 2024, there was no outstanding balance under the Loan Facility. 
 
 On February 6, 2024 and September 18, 2024, we issued additional 100.0 million and 150.0 million of 9.50 Senior Notes due October 2029 (the new 9.50 Senior Notes ), and received cash proceeds of 88.0 million and 139.8 million, respectively. The new 9.50 Senior Notes have the same terms and provisions as the previously issued 487.6 million 9.50 Senior Notes except for the issue price. 100.0 million of new 9.50 Senior Notes accrue interest from October 20, 2023, the date of issuance of previously issued 9.50 Senior Notes and 150.0 million of new 9.50 Senior Notes accrue interest from April 15, 2024, the date of last interest payment. We received a cash payment of 2.8 million and 6.1 million related to the accrued interest of the 100.0 million and 150.0 million of new 9.50 Senior Notes, respectively. 
 
 At September 30, 2024, we had a 24.8 million aggregate principal amount of 6.25 Senior Notes due 2025, 24.2 million aggregate principal amount of 7.75 Senior Notes due 2027, and 737.6 million aggregate principal amount of 9.50 Senior Notes due 2029, outstanding. 
 
 During the year ended December 31, 2023, we implemented a share re-purchase program (the 2023 Program ), which expired on November 2, 2024, through the facilities of the Toronto Stock Exchange TSX ), the NYSE American and eligible alternative trading platforms in Canada or United States. Under the 2023 Program, we were able to re-purchase at prevailing market prices up to 3,234,914 shares of Common Stock, representing approximately 10 of the public float as of October 20, 2023. Re-purchases are subject to prevailing market conditions, the trading price of our Common Stock, our financial performance and other conditions. 
 
 During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, we re-purchased 371,130 and 1,662,110 shares at a weighted average price of 9.37 and 7.31 per share (three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 - nil and 1,328,650 shares under the 2022 program at a weighted average price of nil and 8.15 per share), respectively. We cancelled 28,612 held as treasury shares as at December 31, 2023 and cancelled 371,130 and 1,662,110 shares re-purchased during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively. During the period from November 3, 2023 to September 30, 2024, we have re-purchased 2,703,914 shares under the 2023 Program. 
 
 On October 31, 2024, we acquired all of the issued and outstanding common shares of i3 Energy for 225.4 million, consisting of cash consideration of 168.9 million, a cash dividend of 4.2 million and approximately 6.0 million shares of Gran Tierra s Common Stock, the fair value of which was determined to be 52.3 million based on the closing price of the Company s shares on the acquisition date. i3 Energy is an oil and gas exploration and production company, incorporated in England and Wales with production assets located in the Western Canadian Sedimentary basin. The acquisition was accounted for as a business combination using the acquisition method. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, we incurred approximately 1.5 million in transaction costs associated with the acquisition of i3 Energy. 
 
 In connection with i3 Energy acquisition closing on October 31, 2024, we amended and restated the existing revolving credit facility agreement of i3 Energy Canada Ltd. i3 Energy Canada with National Bank of Canada dated March 22, 2024. As a result of the amendment and restatement, among other things, the borrowing base was revised to C 100.0 million (US 74.1 million) with available commitment of a C 50.0 million (US 37.0 million) revolving credit facility comprised of C 35.0 million (US 25.9 million) syndicated facility and C 15.0 million (US 11.1 million) of operating facility. Subject to the next borrowing base redetermination which will occur on or before June 30, 2025, the revolving credit facility is available until October 31, 2025 with a repayment date of October 31, 2026, which may be extended by further periods of up to 364 days, subject to lender approval. The drawn down amounts under the revolving credit facility can either be in Canadian or U.S. dollars and bear interest rates equal to either the Canadian prime rate or U.S. Base Rate plus a margin ranging from 2.00 to 4.00 per annum or for CORRA loans and SOFR loans plus a margin ranging from 3.00 to 5.00 per annum. Undrawn 
 34 

amounts under the revolving credit facility bear standby fee ranging from 0.75 to 1.25 per annum. In each case, the margin or standby fee, as applicable is based on Net Debt to EBITDA ratio of Gran Tierra Canada Ltd.

(1) Adjusted EBITDA and funds flow from operations are non-GAAP measures which do not have any standardized meaning prescribed under GAAP. Refer to note 2 Non-GAAP measures in Financial and Operational Highlights for a definition and reconciliation of this measure. 
 
 One of the primary sources of variability in our cash flows from operating activities is the fluctuation in oil prices. Sales volume changes, costs related to operations and debt transactions also impact cash flows. Our cash flows from operating activities are also impacted by foreign currency exchange rate changes. During the three months ended September 30, 2024, funds flow from operations decreased by 24 compared to the corresponding period of 2023, due to a decrease in Brent price, higher quality and transportation discounts, lower sales volumes and higher interest expense, partially offset by lower operating expenses and lower current income tax expense. Funds flow from operations for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, decreased by 6 , compared to the corresponding period of 2023, primarily due to lower sales volumes, higher operating costs and higher interest expense, partially offset by lower quality and transportation discounts and lower current income tax expense. 

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 
 
 Our critical accounting policies and estimates are disclosed in Item 7 of our 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K and have not changed materially since the filing of that document. 

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 
 
 Commodity price risk 
 
 Our principal market risk relates to oil prices. Oil prices are volatile and unpredictable and influenced by concerns over world supply and demand imbalance and many other market factors outside of our control. Our revenues are from oil sales at ICE Brent adjusted for quality differentials. 
 
 Foreign currency risk 
 
 Foreign currency risk is a factor for our Company but is ameliorated to a certain degree by the nature of expenditures and revenues in the countries where we operate. Our reporting currency is U.S. dollars and 100 of our revenues are related to the U.S. dollar price of Brent adjusted for quality differentials. We receive 100 of our revenues in U.S. dollars and the majority of our capital expenditures is in U.S. dollars or is based on U.S. dollar prices. The majority of value added taxes, operating and G A expenses in Colombia are in the local currency. Certain G A expenses incurred at our head office in Canada are denominated in Canadian dollars. While we operate in South America exclusively, the majority of our acquisition expenditures have been valued and paid in U.S. dollars. 
 
 Additionally, foreign exchange gains and losses result primarily from the fluctuation of the U.S. dollar to the Colombian peso due to our accounts payable, current and deferred tax assets and liabilities which are monetary assets and liabilities denominated in the local currency of the Colombian foreign operations. As a result, a foreign exchange gain or loss must be calculated on conversion to the U.S. dollar reporting currency. 
 
 Interest Rate Risk 
 
 Interest rate risk is the risk that future cash flows will fluctuate as a result of changes in market interest rates. As our Senior Notes bear interest at fixed rates, we have no material exposure to interest rate fluctuations. 

Item 4. Controls and Procedures 
 
 Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 
 We have established disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, or Exchange Act). Our disclosure controls and procedures are designed to provide reasonable assurance that the information required to be disclosed by Gran Tierra in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC rules and forms and that such information is accumulated and communicated to management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Our management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this report, as required by Rule l3a-15(b) of the Exchange Act. Based on this evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that Gran Tierra s disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of September 30, 2024. 
 36 

Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 
 There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) during the quarter ended September 30, 2024, that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect our internal control over financial reporting.

The unprecedented nature of ongoing conflicts in several parts of the world, along with volatility in the worldwide economy and oil and gas industry may make it more difficult to identify all the risks to our business, results of operations and financial condition and the ultimate impact of identified risks. 
 
 We may fail to successfully integrate the assets and operations of i3 Energy or realize the anticipated benefits and operating synergies expected from the acquisition of i3 Energy, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results. 
 
 The success of our acquisition of i3 Energy will depend, in significant part, on our ability to successfully integrate i3 Energy and realize the anticipated strategic benefits and synergies from the acquisition. The combination of independent businesses is complex, costly and time consuming, and we have devoted, and will continue to devote, significant management attention and resources to integrating the respective business practices and operations of the companies. Further, the anticipated benefits of the acquisition may not be realized fully or at all, or may take longer to realize than we expect. Actual operating, technological, strategic and revenue opportunities, if achieved at all, may be less significant than we expect or may take longer to achieve than anticipated. If we are not able to achieve these objectives and realize the anticipated benefits and synergies expected from the acquisition within a reasonable time, our business, financial condition and operating results may be adversely affected.

 1.7 Monetary References . 
 Whenever an amount of money is referred to in the Loan Documents, such amount will, unless otherwise expressly stated, be in Canadian Dollars.

 1.16 Accounting Changes . 
 (a) In the event that any Accounting Change occurs, the Borrower will deliver an Accounting Change Notice to the Agent together with a description of the nature of such Accounting Change and the effect, if any, of the Accounting Change on the Borrower s current and immediately prior year s financial statements. If the Borrower, the Agent or the Majority Lenders reasonably determine that any such change would cause an amount required to be determined for the purposes of any financial calculation hereunder (including for the purposes of determining the applicable margin in Section 3.9(a)) (each, a Financial Calculation to be materially different than the amount that would be determined without giving effect to such change, then the Borrower, the Agent or the Majority Lenders, as the case may be, shall deliver an Accounting Change Notice to the other Parties (through the Agent) of such Accounting Change. Such notice shall state whether the Borrower, the Agent or the Majority Lenders, as applicable, wishes to revise the method of calculating one or more of the Financial Calculations (including the revision of any of the defined terms used in the determination of such Financial Calculation(s)) in order that amounts determined after giving effect to such Accounting Change and the revised method of calculating such Financial Calculation(s) will approximate the amount that would be determined without 

- 5 - 

 giving effect to such Accounting Change and without giving effect to the revised method of calculating such Financial Calculation(s). The Accounting Change Notice shall be delivered by the Borrower to the Agent within 60 days after the end of the Fiscal Quarter in which the Accounting Change is implemented or, if such Accounting Change is implemented in the fourth Fiscal Quarter or in respect of an entire Fiscal Year, within 120 days after the end of such period. Following receipt of an Accounting Change Notice, either the Borrower or the Majority Lenders may provide a proposal to the other as to how to amend the provisions of this Agreement to give effect to the foregoing. 
 (b) If, pursuant to the Accounting Change Notice, the Borrower, does not indicate that it desires to revise the method of calculating one or more of the Financial Calculations, the Majority Lenders or the Agent, as applicable, may within 30 days after receipt of the Accounting Change Notice, notify the Borrower that they wish to revise the method of calculating one or more of the Financial Calculations in the manner described above. 
 (c) If the Agent, the Borrower or the Majority Lenders so indicate that they wish to revise the method of calculating one or more of the Financial Calculations, the Borrower and the Lenders shall in good faith attempt to agree on a revised method of calculating such Financial Calculation, provided that until such time as any such agreement in writing has been reached, such method of calculation shall not be revised and all amounts to be determined thereunder shall be determined without giving effect to the Accounting Change. For greater certainty, if no notice of a desire to revise the method of calculating the Financial Calculations in respect of an Accounting Change is given by either the Borrower, the Agent or the Majority Lenders within the applicable time period described above, then the method of calculating the Financial Calculations shall not be revised in response to such Accounting Change and all amounts to be determined pursuant to the Financial Calculations shall be determined after giving effect to such Accounting Change. 
 (d) If a Compliance Certificate is delivered in respect of a Fiscal Quarter or Fiscal Year in which an Accounting Change is implemented without giving effect to any revised method of calculating any of the Financial Calculations, and subsequently, as provided above, the method of calculating the Financial Calculation is revised in response to such Accounting Change, or the amounts to be determined pursuant to the Financial Calculations are to be determined without giving effect to such Accounting Change, the Borrower shall, as soon as reasonably possible, deliver a revised Compliance Certificate. Any Event of Default which arises as a result of the Accounting Change, and which is cured by this Section 1.16 shall be deemed to have never occurred. 
 (e) For the purposes of this Agreement, including all Financial Calculations required to be made hereunder, any lease which would have been accounted for as an 

- 6 - 

 operating lease under GAAP as in effect on December 31, 2018, shall, notwithstanding any subsequent change in GAAP, not constitute a Capital Lease hereunder (whether such lease is entered into or assumed before or after December 31, 2018). 
 1.17 Changes to LMR Regime 
 If (a) as a result of any change in any applicable Law, rule, policy, regulation, order or directive, any applicable Energy Regulator ceases to use a liability management (or equivalent) rating as a means of determining whether a corporation is in compliance with such regulator s abandonment and reclamation policies, regulations and directives in any one or more Material Jurisdiction, (b) the method of calculation of any LMR changes in any material manner in any Material Jurisdiction, or (c) if the threshold for which (i) license transfers of regulated properties shall be permitted under an Energy Regulator s licensee liability regime in any Material Jurisdiction changes in any material respect or (ii) any security deposits will be required to be provided to the applicable Energy Regulator changes in any material respect, then, in any such case, at the written request of the Agent to the Borrower or the Borrower to the Agent, the Borrower and the Agent shall enter into good faith discussions with a view to determining a comparable rating system or threshold, as applicable, to replace the concept of LMR as set forth herein that is, at such time, broadly accepted as the prevailing market practice for such regulation in the applicable Material Jurisdiction, with the intent of having the respective positions of the Lenders and the Borrower after such change conform as nearly as possible to their respective positions immediately prior to such change provided that, until any such agreement is reached, the LMR shall continue to be calculated in good faith by the Borrower as if no such change had occurred. Upon the Borrower and the Agent agreeing on such methodology for determining LMR and the thresholds set forth herein, the Borrower and the Lenders party hereto shall enter into documentation to amend the provisions hereof to refer to such rate and make all other adjustments incidental thereto. The Parties agree that such amendment shall require the consent of the Majority Lenders notwithstanding anything to the contrary set out herein.

 The interest rate on an Advance may be derived from an interest rate benchmark that may be discontinued or is, or may in the future become, the subject of regulatory reform. Upon the occurrence of a Benchmark Transition Event in respect of any Benchmark, Section 8.4 provides a mechanism for determining an alternative rate of interest. The Agent does not warrant or accept any responsibility for, and shall not have any liability with respect to (a) the continuation of, administration of, submission of, calculation of, performance of or any other matter related to any interest rate used in this Agreement (including the Canadian Prime Rate, U.S. Base Rate, Daily Simple SOFR, Adjusted Daily Simple SOFR, SOFR, the Term SOFR Reference Rate, Adjusted Term SOFR, Term SOFR, Term CORRA, Adjusted Term CORRA, Daily Compounded CORRA or Adjusted Daily Compounded CORRA) or any component definition thereof or rates referred to in the definition thereof, or with respect to any alternative or successor rate thereto, or replacement rate thereof (including any Benchmark Replacement), including whether the composition or characteristics of any such alternative, successor or replacement rate (including any Benchmark Replacement) will be similar to, or produce the same value or economic equivalence of, or have the same volume or liquidity as, Canadian Prime Rate, U.S. Base Rate, Daily Simple SOFR, Adjusted Daily Simple SOFR, SOFR, Term SOFR Reference Rate, Adjusted Term SOFR, Term SOFR, Term CORRA, Adjusted Term CORRA, Daily Compounded CORRA, Adjusted Daily Compounded CORRA or any other Benchmark (or any component thereof) prior to its discontinuance or unavailability or (b) the effect, implementation or composition of any Conforming Changes.

The Agent may select information sources or services in its discretion, acting reasonably, to ascertain any interest rate used in this Agreement, any component thereof, or rates referred to in the definition thereof or any other Benchmark, in each case pursuant to and in accordance with the terms of this Agreement, and shall have no liability to the Borrower, any Lender or any other Person for damages of any kind, including direct or indirect, special, punitive, incidental or consequential damages, costs, losses or expenses (whether in tort, contract or otherwise and whether at law or in equity), for any error or calculation of any such rate (or component thereof) provided by any such information source or service.

- 31 - 

 any Obligations remain outstanding under any Credit Facility, no Former Lender or any Affiliate thereof shall have any right to cause or require the enforcement of the Security or any right to participate in any decisions relating to the Security, including any decisions relating to the enforcement or manner of enforcement of the Security or decisions relating to any amendment to, waiver under, release of or other dealing with all or any part of the Security for certainty, the sole right of a Former Lender and its Affiliates with respect to the Security while any Obligations remain outstanding under the Credit Facilities is to share, on a pari passu basis, subject to Section 14.4, in any proceeds of realization and enforcement of the Security.

 5.3 Irrevocability . 
 A Notice of Borrowing, Notice of Rollover or Notice of Conversion when given by the Borrower will be irrevocable and will oblige the Borrower, the Agent and the Lenders to take the action contemplated herein and therein on the date specified therein, provided that, any such notice will not be binding on a Lender who makes a determination under Section 10.2. 
 5.4 Rollover or Conversion of Accommodations . 
 (a) Subject to Section 5.2, Article 8 and Article 9, the Borrower will be entitled to effect a Rollover of one type of Accommodation into the same type of Accommodation under the same Credit Facility or to effect a Conversion of one type of Accommodation into another type of Accommodation, in each case under the same Credit Facility, in the same currency and otherwise on the terms herein provided. 
 (b) Subject to Section 8.1(c), if the Borrower fails to give the Agent a duly completed Notice of Rollover or Notice of Conversion if and as required by Section 5.2, or if in giving such notice the Borrower fails to provide for the Rollover or Conversion of all of the Benchmark Loans then maturing, the Borrower will be deemed to have irrevocably elected to convert such maturing Benchmark Loans, or that part of such maturing Benchmark Loans which the Borrower has failed to provide for in such notice, as the case may be, into a Canadian Prime Rate Loan with respect to a CORRA Loan or a U.S. Base Rate Loan with respect to a SOFR Loan. 
 5.5 Agent s Obligations . 
 Upon receipt of a Notice of Borrowing, Notice of Rollover or Notice of Conversion with respect to a proposed Advance under the Syndicated Facility, the Agent will forthwith notify the applicable Lenders of the proposed date on which such Advance is to take place, of each 

- 34 - 

 applicable Lender s Rateable Portion of such Advance and of the account of the Agent to which each applicable Lender s Rateable Portion thereof is to be credited, if applicable. 
 5.6 Lenders Obligations . 
 Each Lender will, prior to 12 00 noon (Montreal time) on the proposed date on which an Advance under the Syndicated Facility is to take place, credit the account of the Agent specified in the Agent s notice given pursuant to Section 5.5 with such Lender s Rateable Portion of such Advance, and upon receipt of the funds from the Lender, the Agent will make available to the Borrower the amount so credited. 
 5.7 Failure of a Lender to Fund . 
 (a) Unless the Agent has actual notice that a Lender has not made or will not make available to the Agent for value on a Drawdown Date the applicable amount required from such Lender pursuant to Section 5.6, the Agent shall be entitled to assume that such amount has been or will be received from such Lender when so due and the Agent may (but shall not be obliged to), in reliance upon such assumption, make available to the Borrower a corresponding amount (except that no such amount shall be made available to the Borrower in the case of a deemed Advance). If such amount is not in fact received by the Agent from such Lender on such Drawdown Date and the Agent has made available a corresponding amount to the Borrower on such Drawdown Date as aforesaid (or is deemed to have made an Advance to the Borrower in such amount), such Lender shall pay to the Agent on demand an amount equal to the aggregate of the applicable amount required from such Lender pursuant to Section 5.6 plus an amount equal to the product of (i) the rate per annum applicable to overnight deposits made with the Agent for amounts approximately equal to the amount required from such Lender multiplied by (ii) the amount that should have been paid to the Agent by such Lender on such Drawdown Date and was not, multiplied by (iii) a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of days that have elapsed from and including such Drawdown Date to but excluding the date on which the amount is received by the Agent from such Lender and the denominator of which is 365 in the case of all Advances. A certificate of the Agent containing details of the amount owing by a Lender under this Section 5.7(a) shall be binding and conclusive in the absence of manifest error. If any such amount is not in fact received by the Agent from such Lender on such Drawdown Date, the Agent shall be entitled to recover from the Borrower, on demand, the related amount made available by the Agent to the Borrower as aforesaid together with interest thereon at the applicable rate per annum payable by the Borrower hereunder. The failure of any Lender to make its Rateable Portion of the applicable Advance will not relieve any other Lender of its obligation, if any, hereunder to make its Rateable Portion of such Advance on the date that such Advance is to take place, but no Lender will be responsible for the failure of any other Lender to provide its Rateable Portion of any such Advance under the applicable Credit Facility. 

- 35 - 

 (b) Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 5.7(a), if any Lender fails to make available to the Agent its Rateable Portion of any Advance, which for greater certainty includes a deemed Advance hereunder (such Lender being herein called the Non-Paying Lender ), the Agent shall forthwith give notice of such failure by the Non-Paying Lender to the Borrower (except where such failure relates to a deemed Advance) and to the other Lenders. The Agent shall then forthwith give notice to the other Lenders that any Lender may make available to the Agent all or any portion of the Non-Paying Lender s Rateable Portion of such Advance (but in no way shall any other Lender or the Agent be obliged to do so) in the place of the Non-Paying Lender. If more than one Lender gives notice that it is prepared to make funds available in the place of a Non-Paying Lender in such circumstances and the aggregate of the funds which such Lenders (herein collectively called the Contributing Lenders and individually called the Contributing Lender are prepared to make available exceeds the amount of the Advance which the Non-Paying Lender failed to make, then each Contributing Lender shall be deemed to have given notice that it is prepared to make available its Rateable Portion of such Advance based on the Contributing Lenders relative commitments to advance in such circumstances. If any Contributing Lender makes funds available in the place of a Non-Paying Lender in such circumstances, then the Non-Paying Lender shall pay to any Contributing Lender making the funds available in its place, forthwith on demand, any amount advanced on its behalf together with interest thereon at the rate applicable to such Advance from the date of advance to the date of payment, against payment by the Contributing Lender making the funds available of all interest received in respect of the Advance from the Borrower. The failure of any Lender to make available to the Agent its Rateable Portion of any Advance as required herein shall not relieve any other Lender of its obligations to make available to the Agent its Rateable Portion of any Advance as required herein. 
 (c) Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary, if any Lender becomes a Defaulting Lender, either as a result of being a Non-Paying Lender or otherwise, then the following provisions shall apply for so long as such Lender is a Defaulting Lender 
 (i) the standby fees payable pursuant to Section 3.9(f) shall cease to accrue on the unused portion of the Individual Commitment Amount of such Defaulting Lender 
 (ii) a Defaulting Lender shall not be included in determining whether, and the Individual Commitment Amount and the Rateable Portion of the Aggregate Principal Amount of such Defaulting Lender shall not be included in determining whether, all Lenders or the Majority Lenders have taken or may take any action hereunder (including any consent to any amendment or waiver pursuant to Section 16.16), provided that any waiver, amendment or modification requiring the consent of all Lenders or 

- 36 - 

 each affected Lender that affects such Defaulting Lender differently than other affected Lenders shall require the consent of such Defaulting Lender 
 (iii) subject to Section 5.7(b), for the purposes of any Advance requested hereunder while there is a Defaulting Lender, each Lender s Rateable Portion thereof shall be calculated based on such Lender s Individual Commitment Amount relative to the Commitment Amount reduced by the Individual Commitment Amount of the Defaulting Lender 
 (iv) the Agent may require such Defaulting Lender to pay to the Agent for deposit into an escrow account maintained by and in the name of the Agent an amount equal to such Defaulting Lenders maximum contingent obligations hereunder to the Agent 
 (v) the Agent may withhold any payments owing to such Defaulting Lender for set-off against such Defaulting Lender s existing or reasonably foreseeable future obligations hereunder and 
 (vi) for the avoidance of doubt, the Borrower shall retain and reserve its other rights and remedies respecting each Defaulting Lender. 
 5.8 Exchange Rate Fluctuations . 
 (a) Subject to Section 5.8(b), if as a result of currency fluctuation, the Canadian Dollar Exchange Equivalent of the Aggregate Principal Amount owing to 
 (i) the Lenders under the Credit Facilities exceeds the Commitment Amount 
 (ii) the Syndicated Facility Lenders under the Syndicated Facility exceeds the Syndicated Facility Commitment Amount or 
 (iii) the Operating Lender under the Operating Facility exceeds the Operating Facility Commitment Amount, 
 (in the case of (i), (ii) or (iii), the Excess ), 
 the Borrower will, within 3 Banking Days after a written request from the Agent, pay the applicable Excess to the Agent as a Principal Repayment for the benefit of the applicable Lenders to be shared on the basis of each applicable Lender s Rateable Portion. 
 (b) Notwithstanding Section 5.8(a) and Section 5.9, if the applicable Excess represents an amount which is less than 3 of the Commitment Amount under the applicable Credit Facility, then the Borrower will only be required to repay the applicable Excess on the earlier of the next Rollover Date or Conversion Date and 30 days after written request from the Agent. 

- 37 - 

 5.9 Excess Relating to Benchmark Loans and Letters of Credit . 
 Subject to Section 5.8(b), if to pay an Excess it is necessary to repay an Advance made by way of Benchmark Loan or Letter of Credit prior to the Maturity Date thereof, the Borrower will not be required to repay such Advances until the Maturity Date applicable thereto, provided, however, that at the request of the Agent, the Borrower will forthwith pay the Excess to the Agent for deposit into a Cash Collateral Account maintained by and in the name of the Agent for the benefit of the applicable Lenders. The Excess will be held by the Agent for set-off against future Obligations owing by the Borrower to the applicable Lenders in respect of such Excess, if any, or shall make such other arrangements to affect the same as may be agreed to by the affected Lenders. The Agent shall have exclusive control over all amounts at any time on deposit in such Cash Collateral Account. The deposit of the Excess by the Borrower with the Agent as herein provided, will not operate as a repayment of the Aggregate Principal Amount until such time as the Excess is actually paid to the Lenders as a Principal Repayment. If at any time the Borrower is no longer required to pay the Excess on deposit with the Agent, the Agent shall promptly return the Excess to the Borrower. 
 Article 6 DRAWDOWN UNDER THE CREDIT FACILITIES

The Agent will enter in such records details of all amounts from time-to-time owing, paid or prepaid by the Borrower to it hereunder. In addition, each Lender will maintain records, in written or electronic form, evidencing all Advances and other Obligations owing by the Borrower to such Lender. The information entered in such records will constitute prima facie evidence of the Obligations of the Borrower to the Agent and each Lender under the Loan Documents.

 (i) if such position or net position is a credit in favour of the Borrower, the Operating Lender may apply the amount of such credit or any part thereof as a repayment of the Aggregate Principal Amount of the Operating Facility, and the Operating Lender will debit the Borrower s Account with the amount of such repayment and

 (ii) if such position or net position is a debit in favour of the Operating Lender, the Operating Lender will make an overdraft borrowing under the Operating Facility of such amount as is required to place such account in such credit or net credit position as has been agreed between the Borrower and the Operating Lender from time-to-time, and the Operating Lender may increase the Aggregate Principal Amount under the Operating Facility and credit such account with such Advance, provided that at no time shall the Aggregate Principal Amount of the Operating Facility exceed the Operating Facility Commitment Amount. 
 7.5 Maximum Rate of Return . 
 Notwithstanding any provision herein to the contrary, in no event will the aggregate interest (as defined in section 347 of the Criminal Code (Canada)) payable under this Agreement exceed the maximum effective annual rate of interest on the credit advanced (as defined in that section 347) permitted under that section and, if any payment, collection or demand pursuant to this Agreement in respect of interest (as defined in that section 347) is determined to be contrary to the provisions of that section 347, such payment, collection or demand will be deemed to have been made by mutual mistake of the Borrower and the applicable Lenders and the amount of such payment or collection will be refunded to the Borrower.

 The Borrower agrees that, upon the occurrence and during the continuance of a Default or Event of Default, in addition to (and without limitation of) any right of set off, bankers lien, counterclaim or other right or remedy that any Lender may otherwise have, each Lender will be entitled, at its option, to offset any and all balances and deposits held by it for the account of any Loan Party at any of its offices or branches, in any currency, against any and all amounts owed by any Loan Party to such Lender hereunder (regardless of whether any such balances are then due or payable to any Loan Party) or to a Swap Lender in connection with any Swap Indebtedness, in which case such Lender will promptly notify the Borrower and the Agent thereof provided that such Lender s failure to give any such notice will not affect the validity thereof. Any Person purchasing an interest in the obligations of the Borrower as contemplated herein may exercise all rights of set-off, bankers lien, counterclaim or similar rights with respect to such interest as fully as if such obligations had been originally incurred to such Person and such Person were the holder thereof. The rights of the Lenders under this Section 13.4 are in addition to the other rights and remedies which the Lenders may have. Nothing contained in the Loan Documents will require any Lender to exercise any right or will affect the right of any Lender to exercise and retain the benefits of exercising any right, with respect to any indebtedness or obligation of the Borrower existing otherwise than pursuant to the Loan Documents.

The Borrower hereby ratifies all that said attorneys will lawfully do or cause to be done by virtue hereof. This power of attorney is a power coupled with an interest and will be irrevocable until all of the Obligations have been unconditionally and irrevocably paid and performed in full. The Borrower also authorizes the Agent, at any time and from time-to-time, to execute any endorsements, assignments or other instruments of conveyance or transfer pursuant to the Security after an Event of Default and only if the Borrower fails to do so on a timely basis.

- 84 - 

 application will be in the same proportion as each Lender s Individual Commitment Amount was to the Commitment Amount immediately prior to the Event of Default resulting in such declaration. 
 (b) The obligations of each Lender under this Section 13.6 are unconditional, shall not be subject to any qualification or exception whatsoever and shall be performed in accordance with the terms and conditions of this Agreement under all circumstances including 
 (i) any lack of validity or enforceability of the Borrower s obligations hereunder 
 (ii) the occurrence of any Default or Event of Default or the exercise of any rights by the Agent under Section 13.2 and 
 (iii) the absence of any demand for payment being made, any proof of claim being filed, any proceeding being commenced or any judgment being obtained by a Lender or the Operating Lender against the Borrower. 
 13.7 GTE Change of Control 
 Notwithstanding Section 13.1(r), the Agent and the Lenders hereby consent to, and waive any Default or Event of Default that would otherwise occur hereunder, or under the Existing Credit Agreement, solely as a result of the GTE Change of Control.

As to any matters not expressly provided for by the Loan Documents, the Agent will not be required to exercise any discretion or take any action, but will be required to act or to refrain from acting (and will be fully indemnified and protected by the Lenders to the greatest extent permitted by Law in so acting or refraining from acting) upon the instructions of the Majority Lenders, and such instructions will be binding upon all Lenders, provided however that the Agent will not be required to take any action which, in the opinion of the Agent, might expose the Agent to liability in such capacity, which could result in the Agent incurring any costs and expenses, or which is contrary to the spirit and intent of this Agreement. 
 (b) Lenders Determination . Where the provisions of this Agreement provide that any waiver of or any amendment to any provision of the Loan Documents may be made or any action, consent or other determination in connection with the Loan Documents may be taken or given, with the consent or agreement of the Lenders or the Majority Lenders (in accordance with Section 16.16), then any such waiver, amendment, action, consent or determination so made, so taken or so given with the consent or agreement of the Lenders or the Majority Lenders, as applicable, will be binding on all of the Lenders and all of the Lenders will cooperate in all ways necessary or desirable to implement and effect such waiver, amendment, action, consent or determination. 

- 88 - 

 (c) Deemed Non-Consent . If the Agent delivers a notice to a Lender requesting advice from such Lender as to whether it consents or objects to any matter in connection with the Loan Documents, then, except as otherwise expressly provided herein, if such Lender does not deliver to the Agent its written consent or objection to such matter within 10 Banking Days of the delivery of such notice by the Agent to such Lender, such Lender will be deemed not to have consented thereto upon the expiry of such 10 Banking Day period. 
 (d) Release and Discharge of Security . Each Lender hereby irrevocably authorizes the Agent to execute and deliver such releases and no-interest letters as may be required in connection with any disposition of assets by any Loan Party in respect of which the Agent has received an officer s certificate of the Borrower certifying that such disposition is permitted hereunder, together with any other information from the Borrower reasonably required by the Agent, if any, to satisfy itself that any such disposition is permitted hereunder. 
 (e) Intercreditor Agreement . The Lenders authorize the Agent to enter into and perform its obligations under any Intercreditor Agreement required hereunder from time to time. 
 16.2 Procedure for Making Advances . 
 (a) Pro Rata Advances . All Advances under a Credit Facility made by the Lenders will be made in accordance with each Participating Lender s Rateable Portion of such Advance. The Agent shall determine all adjustments to the amounts required to be advanced by the Lenders to reflect as nearly as practicable the respective Rateable Portions of the Lenders under the Credit Facilities. 
 (b) Instructions from Borrower . Other than with respect to overdraft borrowings under the Operating Facility, the Lenders, through the Agent, will make Advances under a Credit Facility available to the Borrower as required hereunder by debiting the account of the Agent to which each Lender s Rateable Portion in respect of such Credit Facility of such Advances have been credited in accordance with Section 5.6 (or causing such account to be debited) and, in the absence of other arrangements agreed to by the Agent and the Borrower in writing, by transferring (or causing to be transferred) like funds in accordance with the instructions of the Borrower as set forth in the Notice of Borrowing, Notice of Rollover or Notice of Conversion, as the case may be, in respect of each Advance under a Credit Facility, provided that the obligation of the Agent hereunder will be limited to taking such steps as are in keeping with its normal banking practice and which are commercially reasonable in the circumstances to implement such instructions, and the Agent will not be liable for any damages, claims or costs which may be suffered by the Borrower or any of the Lenders and occasioned by the failure of such funds to reach their designated destination, unless such failure is due to the gross negligence or wilful misconduct of the Agent (as determined by a final, non-appealable judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction). 

- 89 - 

 (c) Assumption Respecting Availability . Unless the Agent has been notified by a Lender within 1 Banking Day prior to an anticipated Advance under a Credit Facility that such Lender will not make available to the Agent its Rateable Portion of such Advance, the Agent may assume, without any enquiry required on its part, that such Lender has made or will make such portion of the Advance available to the Agent on the date such Advance is to take place, in accordance with the provisions hereof and the Agent may, in reliance upon such assumption, make available to the Borrower on such date a corresponding amount. If and to the extent such Lender will not have so made its Rateable Portion of an Advance under the applicable Credit Facility available to the Agent, such Lender agrees to pay to the Agent, forthwith on demand, such Lender s Rateable Portion of the Advance and all reasonable costs and expenses incurred by the Agent in connection therewith together with interest thereon (at the rate payable thereunder by the Borrower in respect of such Advance) for each day from the date such amount is made available to the Borrower until the date such amount is paid to the Agent, provided however, that if such Lender fails to so pay, the Borrower covenants and agrees that without prejudice to any rights the Borrower may have against such Lender, it will repay the amount of such Lender s Rateable Portion of the Advance (without duplication) to the Agent for the account of the Agent after receipt of the certificate referred to below and forthwith after demand therefor by the Agent. The amount payable to the Agent pursuant hereto will be as set forth in a certificate delivered by the Agent to such non-paying Lender and the Borrower (which certificate will contain reasonable details of how the amount payable is calculated) and will be conclusive and binding, for all purposes, in the absence of manifest error. If such Lender makes the payment to the Agent as required herein, the amount so paid will constitute such Lender s Rateable Portion of the Advance under the applicable Credit Facility for purposes of this Agreement. The failure of any Lender to make its Rateable Portion of the Advance will not relieve any other Lender of its obligation, if any, hereunder to make its Rateable Portion of the Advance on the date that such Advance is to take place, but no Lender will be responsible for the failure of any other Lender to provide its Rateable Portion of any Advance under the applicable Credit Facility. 
 16.3 Remittance of Payments . 
 Forthwith after receipt of any payment by the Borrower hereunder, and subject to Section 13.3, the Agent, if and to the extent a Lender is entitled thereto, will remit to such Lender its Rateable Portion of such payment, provided that, if the Agent, on the assumption that it will receive on any particular date a payment of principal, interest or fees hereunder, remits to a Lender its Rateable Portion of such payment and the Borrower fails to make such payment, each such Lender agrees to repay to the Agent forthwith on demand such Lender s Rateable Portion of any such payment, together with all reasonable costs and expenses incurred by the Agent in connection therewith and interest thereon at the rate and calculated in the manner customarily applicable to interbank payments for each day from the date such amount is remitted to such Lender. The exact amount of the repayment required to be made by a Lender pursuant hereto will 

- 90 - 

 be set forth in a certificate delivered by the Agent to such Lender, which certificate will be conclusive and binding for all purposes in the absence of manifest error. 
 16.4 Redistribution of Payment . 
 Each Lender agrees that, subject to Section 13.3 
 (a) If it exercises any right of counter-claim, set off, bankers lien or similar right with respect to any property of any Loan Party or if under applicable Law it receives a secured claim, the security for which is a debt owed by it to any Loan Party, it will apportion the amount thereof proportionately between 
 (i) amounts outstanding at such time owed by the Loan Party to such Lender under this Agreement, which amounts will be applied in accordance with this Section 16.4 and 
 (ii) amounts otherwise owed to it by a Loan Party, provided that any cash collateral account held by such Lender as collateral for a letter of credit or bankers acceptance issued or accepted by such Lender on behalf of a Loan Party may be applied by such Lender to such amounts owed by such Loan Party to such Lender pursuant to such letter of credit or in respect of any such bankers acceptance without apportionment. 
 (b) If it receives, through the exercise of a right or the receipt of a secured claim described in Section 16.4(a) or otherwise, payment of a proportion of the aggregate amount of principal, interest and fees due to it hereunder which is greater than the proportion received by any other Lender in respect of the aggregate amount of principal, interest and fees due in respect of a Credit Facility (having regard to the respective proportionate amounts advanced as Advances by each of the Lenders under such Credit Facility), the Lender receiving such proportionately greater payment will purchase a participation (which will be deemed to have been done simultaneously with receipt of such payment) in that portion of the applicable Credit Facility of the other Lenders so that their respective receipts will be pro rata to their respective Rateable Portions, provided however that, if all or part of such proportionately greater payment received by such purchasing Lender is otherwise recovered by it, such purchase will be rescinded and the purchase price for such participation will be returned to the extent of such recovery, but without interest. Such Lender will exercise its rights in respect of such secured claim in a manner consistent with the rights of the Lenders entitled under this Section 16.4 to share in the benefits of any recovery on such secured claims. 
 (c) If it does any act or thing permitted by Sections 16.4(a) or 16.4(b), it will promptly provide full particulars thereof to the Agent. 

- 91 - 

 (d) Except as permitted under Sections 16.4(a) or 16.4(b), no Lender will be entitled to exercise any right of counter-claim, set off, bankers lien or similar right without the prior written consent of the other Lenders. 
 (e) Notwithstanding anything else in this Section 16.4, any amounts which are lawfully received by any Swap Lender under a Swap Document prior to the delivery by the Agent of a declaration of all Obligations becoming due pursuant to Section 13.1 are not required to be shared pursuant to the provisions of this Section 16.4. 
 16.5 Duties and Obligations . 
 The Agent or any of its directors, officers, agents or employees (and, for purposes hereof, the Agent will be deemed to be contracting as agent for and on behalf of such Persons) will not be liable to any Lender for any action taken or omitted to be taken by it under or in connection with the Loan Documents, except for its own gross negligence or wilful misconduct, as determined by a final, non-appealable judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Agent 
 (a) may assume that there has been no assignment or transfer by the Lenders of their rights under the Loan Documents, unless and until the Agent receives a duly executed Assignment Agreement from such Lender 
 (b) may consult with counsel (including Borrower s Counsel), independent public accountants and other experts selected by it and will not be liable for any action taken or omitted to be taken in good faith by it in accordance with or reliance upon the advice of such counsel, accountants or experts 
 (c) will incur no liability under or in respect of the Loan Documents by acting upon any notice, consent, certificate or other instrument or writing believed by it to be genuine and signed or sent by the apparently proper Person or by acting upon any representation or warranty of any Loan Party made or deemed to be made hereunder 
 (d) may assume that no Default or Event of Default has occurred and is continuing unless it has actual knowledge to the contrary and 
 (e) may rely, as to any matter of fact which might reasonably be expected to be within the knowledge of any Person, upon a certificate signed by or on behalf of such Person. 
 Further, the Agent (i) does not make any warranty or representation to any Lender nor will it be responsible to any Lender for the accuracy or completeness of the data made available to any of the Lenders in connection with a Credit Facility, or for any statements, warranties or representations (whether written or oral) made in connection with a Credit Facility, (ii) will not have any duty to ascertain or to 

- 92 - 

 enquire as to the performance or observance of any of the terms, covenants or conditions of the Loan Documents on the part of any Loan Party or to inspect the property (including books and records) of any Loan Party, and (iii) will not be responsible to any Lender for the due execution, legality, validity, enforceability, genuineness, sufficiency or value of the Loan Documents or any other instrument or document furnished pursuant hereto or thereto. 
 16.6 Prompt Notice to the Lenders . 
 Notwithstanding any other provision herein, the Agent agrees to provide to the Lenders, with copies where appropriate, all information, notices and reports required to be given to the Agent by the Borrower hereunder, promptly upon receipt of same, excepting therefrom information and notices relating solely to the role of the Agent hereunder. The Agent shall have no duty to disclose any information obtained or received by it or any of its Affiliates relating to the Loan Parties or any of their Subsidiaries to the extent such information was obtained or received in any capacity other than as the Agent hereunder. 
 16.7 Agent and Agent Authority . 
 With respect to its Rateable Portion of a Credit Facility and the Advances made by it as a Lender thereunder, as applicable, the Agent will have the same rights and powers under the Loan Documents as any other Lender and may exercise the same as though it were not the Agent. The Agent may accept deposits from, lend money to, and generally engage in any kind of business with the Borrower, its Subsidiaries, their respective shareholders or any Person owned or controlled by any of them and any Person which may do business with any of them, all as if the Agent was not serving as Agent, and without any duty or obligation to account therefor to the Lenders. 
 16.8 Lenders Credit Decisions . 
 It is understood and agreed by each Lender that it has itself been, and will continue to be, solely responsible for making its own independent appraisal of and investigations into the financial condition, creditworthiness, condition, affairs, status and nature of the Loan Parties. Accordingly, each Lender confirms with the Agent that it has not relied, and will not hereafter rely, on the Agent (a) to check or inquire on its behalf into the adequacy, accuracy or completeness of any information provided by the Borrower or any other Person under or in connection with the Credit Facilities (whether or not such information has been or is hereafter distributed to such Lender by the Agent) or (b) to assess or keep under review on its behalf the financial condition, creditworthiness, condition, affairs, status or nature of any Loan Party. Each Lender acknowledges that copies of the Loan Documents have been made available to it for review and each Lender acknowledges that it is satisfied with the form and substance of the Loan Documents. A Lender will not make any independent arrangement with any Loan Party for the satisfaction of any Obligations owing to it under the Loan Documents without the written consent of the other Lenders. 

- 93 - 

 16.9 Indemnification . 
 The Lenders hereby agree to indemnify the Agent and its directors, officers, agents and employees (to the extent not reimbursed by the Borrower) in accordance with their respective Rateable Portions, from and against any and all liabilities, obligations, losses, damages, penalties, actions, judgments, suits, costs, expenses or disbursements of any kind or nature whatsoever which may be imposed on, incurred by, or asserted against the Agent or its directors, officers, agents and employees in any way relating to or arising out of the Loan Documents or any action taken or omitted by the Agent under or in respect of the Loan Documents in its capacity as Agent, provided that no Lender will be liable for any portion of such liabilities, obligations, losses, damages, penalties, actions, judgments, suits, costs, expenses or disbursements resulting from the Agent s gross negligence or wilful misconduct, as determined by a final, non-appealable judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, each Lender agrees to reimburse the Agent promptly upon demand for its Rateable Portion of any reasonable out-of-pocket expenses (including legal fees, on a solicitor and his own client full indemnity basis) incurred by the Agent in connection with the preservation of any right of the Agent or the Lenders under, or the enforcement of, or legal advice in respect of rights or responsibilities under, the Loan Documents, to the extent that the Agent is not reimbursed for such expenses by the Borrower. This indemnity will survive the termination of the other provisions of this Agreement as a separate and continuing covenant of the Lenders. Each Lender hereby agrees to promptly reimburse the Agent for any amount distributed by the Agent to such Lender as a payment on account of any Credit Facility if the Agent does not actually receive such payment from the Borrower on the date of said distribution. 
 16.10 Successor Agent . 
 The Agent may, as hereinafter provided, resign at any time by giving 30 days notice (the Resignation Notice thereof to the Lenders and the Borrower. The remaining Lenders, with the consent of the Borrower, such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, will forthwith upon receipt of the Resignation Notice unanimously appoint a successor administrative agent (the Successor Agent to assume the duties hereunder of the resigning Agent. Upon the acceptance of any appointment as administrative agent hereunder by a Successor Agent, such Successor Agent will thereupon succeed to and become vested with all the rights, powers, privileges and duties as administrative agent under the Loan Documents of the resigning Agent. Upon such acceptance, the resigning Agent will be discharged from its further duties and obligations as agent under the Loan Documents, but any such resignation will not affect such resigning Agent s obligations hereunder as a Lender, including for its Rateable Portion of the Commitment Amount. After the resignation of the Agent as administrative agent hereunder, the provisions of this Article 16 will continue to enure to its benefit as to any actions taken or omitted to be taken by it while it was the administrative agent of the Lenders hereunder. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the remaining Lenders fail to appoint a Successor Agent within 30 days of receipt of the Resignation Notice, the resigning Agent may and with the approval of the Borrower prior to an Event of Default, such approval not to be unreasonably withheld, appoint a Successor Agent from among the Lenders, subject to such Lender accepting such appointment. The Agent may also be removed at any time by the Majority Lenders upon 30 days notice to the Agent and the 

- 94 - 

 Borrower as long as the Majority Lenders, in consultation with the Borrower, appoint and obtain the acceptance of a successor within such 30 days, in accordance with the terms and conditions set out in this Section 16.10. 
 16.11 Taking and Enforcement of Remedies . 
 Except as otherwise provided herein, each Lender hereby acknowledges that, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, rights and remedies provided under the Loan Documents to the Lenders are for the benefit of the Lenders collectively and not severally and further acknowledges that its rights and remedies thereunder are to be exercised not severally but collectively through the Agent upon the decision of the Lenders (with the required majority or unanimity as herein provided), regardless of whether acceleration of Obligations hereunder was made, and accordingly, notwithstanding any of the provisions contained herein, each of the Lenders hereby covenants and agrees that it will not be entitled to take any action with respect to the Credit Facilities, including any acceleration of Obligations thereunder, but that any such action will be taken only by the Agent with the prior written direction of the Lenders (with the required majority or unanimity as herein provided). Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the absence of written instructions from the Lenders, and where in the sole opinion of the Agent the exigencies of the situation warrant such action, the Agent may without notice to or consent of the Lenders take such action on behalf of the Lenders as it deems appropriate or desirable in the circumstances. Each of the Lenders hereby covenants and agrees that it has not heretofore and will not seek, take, accept or receive any security for any of the Obligations of the Loan Parties under the Loan Documents and will not enter into any agreement with any of the Parties relating in any manner whatsoever to the Credit Facilities, unless all of the Lenders will at the same time obtain the benefit of any such security or agreement, as the case may be. 
 16.12 Reliance Upon Agent . 
 The Borrower will be entitled to rely upon any certificate, notice or other document or other advice, statement or instruction provided to it by the Agent pursuant to the Loan Documents, and the Borrower will be entitled to deal with the Agent with respect to matters under the Loan Documents which the Agent is authorized hereunder to deal with, without any obligation whatsoever to satisfy itself as to the authority of the Agent to act on behalf of the Lenders and without any liability whatsoever to the Lenders for relying upon any certificate, notice or other document or other advice, statement or instruction provided to them by the Agent, notwithstanding any lack of authority of the Agent to provide the same. 
 16.13 Agent May Perform Covenants . 
 If the Borrower fails to perform any covenant on its part herein contained, the Agent may give notice to the Borrower of such failure and if, within 10 days of such notice (or after the expiry of such other time or cure period as may be required in this Agreement), such covenant remains unperformed, the Agent on behalf of the Lenders may, in its sole discretion but need not, perform any such covenant capable of being performed by it and, if the covenant requires the payment or expenditure of money, the Agent may make such payment or expenditure and all sums so expended will be forthwith payable by the Borrower to the Agent on behalf of the

 Lenders and will bear interest at the interest rate applicable to Canadian Prime Rate Loans plus 2 per annum. 
 16.14 No Liability of Agent . 
 The Agent, in its capacity as agent of the Lenders under the Loan Documents, will have no responsibility or liability to the Borrower or the Lenders on account of the failure of any Lender to perform its obligations hereunder, or to any Lender on account of the failure of the Borrower to perform its obligations under the Loan Documents. 
 16.15 Nature of Obligations under this Agreement . 
 (a) Obligations Separate. The obligations of each Lender and the Agent under this Agreement are separate. The failure of any Lender to carry out its obligations hereunder will not relieve the other Lenders, the Agent or the Borrower of any of their respective obligations hereunder. 
 (b) No Liability for Failure by Other Lenders. Neither the Agent nor any Lender will be liable or otherwise responsible for the obligations of any other Lender hereunder. 
 16.16 Unanimity .
