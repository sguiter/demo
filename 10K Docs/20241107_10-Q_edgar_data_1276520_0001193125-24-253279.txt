 (e) Commercial Mortgage Loans 

Our mortgage loans are collateralized by commercial properties, including multi-family residential buildings. The carrying value of commercial mortgage loans is stated at original cost net of principal payments, amortization and allowance for credit losses. 
 We diversify our commercial mortgage loans by both property type and geographic region.

As of September 30, 2024, we had one commercial mortgage loan with an amortized cost of million that was more than 90 days past due in the industrial property type. We recognized an increase in the allowance for credit losses of
 million to reduce the carrying value of this loan to its collateral value as of September 30, 2024. We had other commercial mortgage loans past due or on non-accrual status as of September 30, 2024. As of December 31, 2023, we had commercial mortgage loans past due or on non-accrual status. For a discussion of our policy related to placing commercial mortgage loans on non-accrual status, see Note 2 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies included in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in our 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K. 
 commercial mortgage loan where the borrower was determined to be experiencing financial difficulty. This loan was included in the office property type with an amortized cost of million as of September 30, 2024, which represented of the total asset class. The modification extended the contractual term of the loan by and resulted in an increase to the interest rate. This previously interest-only loan also became amortizing as a result of the modification. As of September 30, 2024, this modified commercial mortgage loan remained current. 
 We did not have any other loan modifications or extensions associated with borrowers experiencing financial difficulty that resulted in the consideration of whether to establish a new loan or to continue accounting for the modification or extension under the existing loan during the 12 months prior to September 30, 2024 or during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023. 

Provision

Write-offs

Recoveries

Ending balance

During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, we increased the provision for credit losses as a result of annual updates to underlying metrics included in the analytical model used to determine the adequacy of the allowance for credit losses, which resulted in higher estimated loss rates. 

In evaluating the credit quality of commercial mortgage loans, we assess the performance of the underlying loans using both quantitative and qualitative criteria. Certain risks associated with commercial mortgage loans can be evaluated by reviewing both the debt-to-value

 and debt service coverage ratio to understand both the probability of the borrower not being able to make the necessary loan payments as well as the ability to sell the underlying property for an amount that would enable us to recover our unpaid principal balance in the event of default by the borrower. The average debt-to-value

 ratio is based on our most recent estimate of the fair value for the underlying property which is evaluated at least annually and updated more frequently if necessary to better indicate risk associated with the loan. A lower debt-to-value

 indicates that our loan value is more likely to be recovered in the event of default by the borrower if the property were sold. The debt service coverage ratio is based on normalized annual income of the property compared to the payments required under the terms of the loan. Normalization allows for the removal of annual one-time
 events such as capital expenditures, prepaid or late real estate tax payments or non-recurring
 third-party fees (such as legal, consulting or contract fees). This ratio is evaluated at least annually and updated more frequently if necessary to better indicate risk associated with the loan. A higher debt service coverage ratio indicates the borrower is less likely to default on the loan. The debt service coverage ratio is not used without considering other factors associated with the borrower, such as the borrower s liquidity or access to other resources that may result in our expectation that the borrower will continue to make the future scheduled payments.

Cash Flow Hedges

Certain derivative instruments are designated as cash flow hedges. The changes in fair value of these instruments are recorded as a component of other comprehensive income (loss) OCI ). We designate and account for the following as cash flow hedges when they have met the effectiveness requirements: (i) various types of interest rate swaps to convert floating rate liabilities into fixed rate liabilities; (ii) receive U.S. dollar fixed on foreign currency swaps to hedge the foreign currency cash flow exposure of foreign currency denominated investments; (iii) forward starting interest rate swaps to hedge against changes in interest rates associated with future fixed rate bond purchases and/or interest income; (iv) forward bond purchase commitments to hedge against the variability in the anticipated cash flows required to purchase future fixed rate bonds; and (v) other instruments to hedge the cash flows of various forecasted transactions.

of our portfolio was priced using third-party pricing services as of September 30, 2024. These pricing services utilize industry-standard valuation techniques that include market-based approaches, income-based approaches, a combination of market-based and income-based approaches or other proprietary, internally generated models as part of the valuation processes. These third-party pricing vendors maximize the use of publicly available data inputs to generate valuations for each asset class. Priority and type of inputs used may change frequently as certain inputs may be more direct drivers of valuation at the time of pricing. Examples of significant inputs incorporated by pricing services may include sector and issuer spreads, seasoning, capital structure, security optionality, collateral data, prepayment assumptions, default assumptions, delinquencies, debt covenants, benchmark yields, trade data, dealer quotes, credit ratings, maturity and weighted-average life. We conduct regular meetings with our pricing services for the purpose of understanding 
the methodologies, techniques and inputs used by the third-party pricing providers.

Purchases, sales, issuances and settlements represent the activity that occurred during the period that results in a change of the asset or liability but does not represent changes in fair value for the instruments held at the beginning of the period. Such activity primarily consists of purchases, sales and settlements of fixed maturity and equity securities and purchases, issuances and settlements of derivative instruments. 

Issuances for fixed indexed annuity and indexed universal life embedded derivative liabilities represent the amount of the premium received that is attributed to the value of the embedded derivative. Settlements of embedded derivatives are characterized as the change in fair value upon exercising the embedded derivative instrument, effectively representing a settlement of the embedded derivative instrument. We have shown these changes in fair value separately based on the classification of this activity as effectively issuing and settling the embedded derivative instrument with all remaining changes in the fair value of these embedded derivative instruments being shown separately in the category labeled included in net (income) in the tables presented above.

 Assets and Liabilities Not Required to Be Carried at Fair Value 

Assets and liabilities that are reflected in the accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements at fair value are not included in the following disclosure of fair value. Such items include cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments, investment securities, MRBs, separate accounts and derivative instruments. Apart from certain of our borrowings and certain marketable securities, few of the instruments are actively traded and their fair values must often be determined using internal models. The fair value estimates are made at a specific point in time, based upon available market information and judgments about the financial instruments, including estimates of the timing and amount of expected future cash flows and the credit standing of counterparties. Such estimates do not reflect any premium or discount that could result from offering for sale at one time our entire holdings of a particular financial instrument, nor do they consider the tax impact of the realization of unrealized gains or losses. In many cases, the fair value estimates cannot be substantiated by comparison to independent markets.

million in the liability for future policy benefits primarily due to favorable updates to approval amounts and implementation timing of in-force
 rate actions. This decrease in the liability for future policy benefits was partially offset in our reinsurance recoverable by the impact of cash flow assumption updates related to fully reinsured blocks of business. The impact of actual versus expected experience for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 resulted in an increase of million in the liability for future policy benefits primarily due to higher claims and lower terminations. 
 In the fourth quarter of 2023, we completed our annual review of cash flow assumptions including expected claim incidence and terminations, expenses, interest rates, benefit utilization trend and in-force
 rate actions, among other assumptions. The impact of changes in cash flow assumptions during the year ended December 31, 2023 resulted in a decrease of million in the liability for future policy benefits primarily as a result of a favorable update to our disabled life mortality assumptions to reflect an expectation that mortality will continue at elevated levels in the near term post the coronavirus pandemic COVID-19 ).
 This was partially offset by unfavorable updates to our healthy life assumptions to better reflect near-term experience for cost of care, mortality, incidence and lapse rates. We also evaluated our assumptions regarding expectations of future premium rate increase approvals and benefit reductions and did not make significant changes to our multi-year in-force
 rate action plan. However, we did increase our assumption for future approvals and benefit reductions given our current plans for rate increase filings and our historical experience regarding approvals and regulatory support, as well as benefit reductions and legal settlement results. The impact of actual versus expected experience during the year ended December 31, 2023 resulted in an increase of million in the liability for future policy benefits primarily driven by higher claims and unfavorable timing impacts related to a legal settlement.

In the fourth quarter of 2023, as part of our annual review of assumptions, we increased our additional insurance liabilities primarily to reflect unfavorable updates to our persistency and mortality assumptions to better reflect emerging experience. Our mortality assumption updates included more modest mortality improvement and reflected an expectation that mortality will continue at elevated levels in the near term post-COVID-19.

As part of these reserve releases, Enact decreased its assumptions for the rate at which delinquencies go to claim, primarily resulting from sustained favorable cure performance and lessening uncertainty in the economic environment, impacting both current and prior year delinquencies. The favorable development related to insured events of prior years for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 was predominantly associated with million of reserve releases in our Enact segment primarily related to favorable cure performance, including on delinquencies related to COVID-19.

Effective rate

The effective tax rate for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was above the statutory U.S. federal income tax rate of largely due to tax expense on certain forward starting swap gains that are tax effected at the previously enacted federal income tax rate of as they are amortized into net investment income. The decrease in the effective tax rate for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the
 three months ended September 30, 2023 was primarily attributable to tax expense on certain forward starting swap gains and non-deductible
 expenses in relation to pre-tax
 income, as well as the change in tax benefits related to stock-based compensation. The decrease in the effective tax rate for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023 was primarily attributable to the change in tax benefits related to stock-based compensation. 
 U.S. GAAP generally requires an annualized effective tax rate to be used for interim reporting periods, utilizing projections of full year results. However, in certain circumstances it is appropriate to record the actual effective tax rate for the period if a reliable estimate cannot be made for the full year. Accordingly, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, we utilized the actual effective tax rate for the interim period to record the provision for income taxes for our Long-Term Care Insurance and Life and Annuities segments and the annualized projected effective tax rate for our Enact segment and Corporate and Other.

 factors when calculating cost of insurance rates and failed to decrease cost of insurance charges in light of improved expectations of future mortality, and seeks unspecified compensatory damages, costs, and equitable relief. On October 29, 2018, we filed a motion to enjoin the case in the Middle District of Georgia, and a motion to dismiss and motion to stay in the Eastern District of Virginia. We moved to enjoin the prosecution of the Eastern District of Virginia action on the basis that it involves claims released in a prior nationwide class action settlement (the McBride settlement that was approved by the Middle District of Georgia. Plaintiff filed an amended complaint on November 13, 2018. On December 6, 2018, we moved the Middle District of Georgia for leave to file our counterclaim, which alleges that plaintiff breached the covenant not to sue contained in the prior settlement agreement by filing its current action. On March 15, 2019, the Middle District of Georgia granted our motion to enjoin and denied our motion for leave to file our counterclaim. As such, plaintiff is enjoined from pursuing its class action in the Eastern District of Virginia. On March 29, 2019, plaintiff filed a notice of appeal in the Middle District of Georgia, notifying the Court of its appeal to the United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit from the order granting our motion to enjoin. On March 29, 2019, we filed our notice of cross-appeal in the Middle District of Georgia, notifying the Court of our cross-appeal to the Eleventh Circuit from the portion of the order denying our motion for leave to file our counterclaim. On April 8, 2019, the Eastern District of Virginia dismissed the case without prejudice, with leave for plaintiff to refile an amended complaint only if a final appellate Court decision vacates the injunction and reverses the Middle District of Georgia s opinion. On May 21, 2019, plaintiff filed its appeal and memorandum in support in the Eleventh Circuit. We filed our response to plaintiff s appeal memorandum on July 3, 2019. The Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals heard oral argument on plaintiff s appeal and our cross-appeal on April 21, 2020. On May 26, 2020, the Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals vacated the Middle District of Georgia s order enjoining plaintiff s class action and remanded the case back to the Middle District of Georgia for further factual development as to whether Genworth has altered how it calculates or charges cost of insurance since the McBride settlement. The Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals did not reach a decision on Genworth s counterclaim. On June 30, 2021, we 

filed in the Middle District of Georgia our renewed motion to enforce the class action settlement and release and renewed our motion for leave to file a counterclaim. The briefing on both motions concluded in October 2021. On March 24, 2022, the Court denied our motions. On April 11, 2022, we filed an appeal of the Court s denial to the United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit. On June 22, 2022, we filed our opening brief in support of the appeal. Plaintiff filed its respondent s brief on September 20, 2022, and we filed our reply brief on November 10, 2022. The appeal was orally argued on August 17, 2023, and we are awaiting a decision from the Eleventh Circuit. We intend to continue to vigorously defend this action. 
 Burkhart et al. v. Genworth Financial et al. 

In September 2018, Genworth Financial, Genworth Holdings, Genworth North America Corporation, Genworth Financial International Holdings, LLC GFIH and Genworth Life Insurance Company GLIC were named as defendants in a putative class action lawsuit pending in the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware captioned Richard F. Burkhart, William E. Kelly, Richard S. Lavery, Thomas R. Pratt, Gerald Green, individually and on behalf of all other persons similarly situated v. Genworth et al

. Plaintiffs allege that GLIC paid dividends to its parent and engaged in certain reinsurance transactions causing it to maintain inadequate capital capable of meeting its obligations to GLIC policyholders and agents. The complaint alleges causes of action for intentional fraudulent transfer and constructive fraudulent transfer and seeks injunctive relief. We moved to dismiss this action in December 2018. On January 29, 2019, plaintiffs exercised their right to amend their complaint. On March 12, 2019, we moved to dismiss plaintiffs amended complaint. On April 26, 2019, plaintiffs filed a memorandum in opposition to our motion to dismiss, which we replied to on June 14, 2019. On August 7, 2019, plaintiffs filed a motion seeking to prevent proceeds that GFIH expected to receive from the then planned sale of its shares in Genworth MI Canada Inc. Genworth Canada from being transferred out of GFIH. On September 11, 2019, plaintiffs filed a renewed motion seeking the same relief as their August 7, 2019 motion with an exception that allowed GFIH to transfer million of expected proceeds from the sale of Genworth Canada through a dividend to Genworth Holdings to allow the pay-off
 of a senior secured term loan facility dated March 7, 2018 among Genworth Holdings as the borrower, GFIH as the limited guarantor and the lending parties thereto. Oral arguments on our motion to dismiss and plaintiffs motion occurred on October 21, 2019, and plaintiffs motion was denied. On January 31, 2020, the Court granted in part our motion to dismiss, dismissing claims relating to million in dividends GLIC paid to its parent from 2012 to 2014 (out of the million in total dividends subject to plaintiffs claims). The Court denied the balance of the motion to dismiss leaving a claim relating to million in dividends and unquantified claims relating to the 2016 termination of a reinsurance transaction. On March 27, 2020, we filed our answer to plaintiffs amended complaint. On May 26, 2021, the plaintiffs filed a second amended and supplemental class action complaint adding additional factual allegations and three new causes of action. On July 26, 2021, we moved to dismiss the three new causes of action and answered the balance of the second amended and supplemental class action complaint. Plaintiffs filed an opposition to our motion to dismiss on September 30, 2021. The Court heard oral arguments on the motion on December 7, 2021 and ordered each party to file supplemental submissions, which were filed on January 28, 2022. On May 10, 2022, the Court granted our motion to dismiss the three new causes of action. On January 27, 2022, plaintiffs filed a motion for a preliminary injunction seeking to enjoin GFIH from transferring any assets to any affiliate, including paying any dividends to Genworth Holdings and to enjoin Genworth Holdings and Genworth Financial from transferring or distributing any value to Genworth Financial s shareholders. On June 2, 2022, plaintiffs withdrew their motion for a preliminary injunction. On January 12, 2024, plaintiffs moved for class certification. We filed our opposition papers on February 23, 2024 and intend to continue to vigorously defend this action. 

Trauernicht et al v. Genworth Financial 

On August 1, 2022, a putative class action was filed in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia by two former Genworth employees against Genworth Financial, its Board of Directors and the Fiduciary and Investments Committee of Genworth Financial s Retirement and Savings Plan Savings Plan ). Plaintiffs purport to act on behalf of the Savings Plan and all similarly situated participants and beneficiaries of the Savings Plan. The complaint asserts that the defendants breached their fiduciary duties under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 by imprudently offering and inadequately monitoring a suite of BlackRock Target Date Funds as a retirement investment option for Genworth employees. Plaintiffs seek declaratory and injunctive relief, monetary damages and attorney s fees. By stipulation entered September 6, 2022, the complaint was dismissed, without prejudice, against the Board of Directors and the Fiduciary and Investments Committee of Genworth Financial s Savings Plan. On October 17, 2022, we moved to dismiss the complaint against the sole remaining defendant, Genworth Financial. Plaintiffs filed opposition papers on November 10, 2022, and we filed our reply papers on November 16, 2022. By order dated January 20, 2023, the Court granted plaintiffs motion to serve an amended complaint, rendering our initial motion to dismiss moot. On January 20, 2023, plaintiffs filed an amended complaint, and on February 2, 2023, we filed a motion to dismiss the amended complaint. On March 16, 2023, the Court directed plaintiffs to file a second amended complaint and denied our motion to dismiss the amended complaint. Plaintiffs filed the second amended complaint on April 17, 2023. On May 15, 2023, we answered and moved to dismiss the second amended complaint. On September 13, 2023, the Court granted in part and denied in part our motion to dismiss the second amended complaint. Plaintiffs moved for class certification on October 16, 2023, and we filed opposition papers on December 4, 2023. Oral argument on plaintiffs class certification motion was heard on February 12, 2024. On February 20, 2024, we moved for summary judgment dismissing the claims, and plaintiffs filed opposition papers on March 5, 2024. Oral argument was conducted on our summary judgment motion on March 25, 2024. On August 15, 2024, the Court granted plaintiffs motion and certified the case as a class action. On August 29, 2024, the Court denied our motion for summary judgment. We filed a motion for leave to appeal from the trial court s class certification order, and the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit granted leave to appeal on September 13, 2024. The case is now stayed in trial court pending the determination of our appeal to the Fourth Circuit. We intend to continue to vigorously defend this action. 
 M/O Arbitration Between Blue Cross Blue Shield Nebraska and GLIC 

On December 16, 2022, Blue Cross Blue Shield of Nebraska BCBSNE served an arbitration demand on GLIC in relation to BCBSNE s stated intent to recapture a block of long-term care insurance policies for which the risk was partly ceded to GLIC. In its arbitration demand, BCBSNE alleges that GLIC breached the governing reinsurance agreement by refusing to agree to transfer assets equal to the fair value of the liabilities being recaptured. BCBSNE asserts it has satisfied all its obligations under the reinsurance agreement and is seeking to recapture the ceded block of reinsurance. BCBSNE seeks damages equal to the fair value of the recaptured liabilities, plus interest and other damages, including attorneys fees and costs. The arbitration panel was appointed, and an organizational meeting was held on August 30, 2023. The arbitration proceeding occurred in September 2024. While we expect a decision from the arbitration panel in the coming months, we believe BCBSNE s claims are without merit and continue to defend our position in this arbitration proceeding.

 cases were subsequently withdrawn. The actions relate to the data security events involving the MOVEit file transfer system MOVEit Cybersecurity Incident ), which PBI Research Services PBI ), a third-party vendor, uses in the performance of its services. Our life insurance subsidiaries use PBI to, among other things, satisfy applicable regulatory obligations to search various databases to identify the deaths of insured persons under life insurance policies, and to identify the deaths of long-term care insurance and annuity policies which can impact premium payment obligations and benefit eligibility. Plaintiffs seek to represent various classes and subclasses of Genworth long-term care insurance policyholders and agents whose data was accessed or potentially accessed by the MOVEit Cybersecurity Incident, alleging that Genworth breached its purported duty to safeguard their sensitive data from cybercriminals. The complaints assert claims for, inter alia, negligence, negligence per se, breach of contract, unjust enrichment, and violations of various consumer protection and privacy statutes, and they seek, inter alia, declaratory and injunctive relief, compensatory and punitive damages, restitution, attorneys fees and costs. On October 4, 2023, the Joint Panel on Multidistrict Litigation issued an order consolidating all actions relating to the MOVEit Cybersecurity Incident before a single federal judge in the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts. All defendants, including the Genworth entities, filed a joint motion to dismiss the complaints on July 23, 2024. Oral argument on this motion occurred on October 9, 2024. We intend to vigorously defend these actions. 

 Silverstein v. GLIC

On October 20, 2023, GLIC was named as the defendant in a putative class action lawsuit in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia captioned Martin Silverstein, on behalf of himself and all others similarly situated v. Genworth Life Insurance Company

. The complaint alleges that GLIC subjected universal life insurance policyholders to impermissible increases in cost of insurance charges, thereby breaching the underlying contracts. The complaint seeks, among other things, monetary damages and reinstatement of any lapsed policies. On July 8, 2024, the parties reached an agreement in principle to settle the action for approximately million, subject to Court approval. We accrued million for this litigation as of June 30, 2024. The Court granted preliminary approval to the settlement on October 10, 2024, and the final approval hearing is scheduled for January 3, 2025. If the settlement is not finalized, we intend to continue to vigorously defend this action. 
 Fox v. GLAIC 

In March 2024, GLAIC was served with a putative class action lawsuit venued in the Superior Court of the State of California, Sacramento County, captioned James Fox, individually and on behalf of the class v. Genworth Life and Annuity Insurance Co

. Plaintiff, the holder of a lapsed California GLAIC life insurance policy, seeks to represent a class of current and former California GLAIC policyholders and beneficiaries whose policies were allegedly wrongfully terminated. The complaint alleges that GLAIC wrongfully terminated hundreds of California life insurance policies by failing to provide the policyholders with the notices and grace periods mandated by the contract and by the California Insurance Code as interpreted by the California Supreme Court in McHugh v. Protective Life Ins. Co

. The complaint asserts causes of action for breach of contract, violation of the California Insurance Code, unfair competition and bad faith, and it seeks, inter alia, declaratory 

and injunctive relief, compensatory damages, restitution, attorneys fees and costs. The action was removed to the United States District Court for the Eastern District of California on April 3, 2024. On May 8, 2024, we answered the complaint. On October 15, 2024, the court granted our motion to stay the action pending determination of an appeal in a related case. We intend to vigorously defend this action. 
 At this time, we cannot determine or predict the ultimate outcome of any of the pending legal and regulatory matters specifically identified above or the likelihood of potential future legal and regulatory matters against us. Except as disclosed above, we are not able to provide an estimate or range of reasonably possible losses related to these matters. Therefore, we cannot ensure that the current investigations and proceedings will not have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. In addition, it is possible that related investigations and proceedings may be commenced in the future, and we could become subject to additional unrelated investigations and lawsuits. Increased regulatory scrutiny and any resulting investigations or proceedings could result in new legal precedents and industry-wide regulations or practices that could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.

Overview Genworth Financial, through its principal insurance subsidiaries, offers mortgage and long-term care insurance products. Genworth Financial is the parent company of Enact Holdings, a leading provider of private mortgage insurance in the United States through its mortgage insurance subsidiaries. Genworth Financial s principal U.S. life insurance subsidiaries offer long-term care insurance and also manage in-force blocks of life insurance and annuity products. Genworth Financial also has a start-up business whereby it offers fee-based services, advice, consulting and other aging care products and services through CareScout. We report our business results through three segments: Enact; Long-Term Care Insurance; and Life and Annuities. The products in the Life and Annuities segment include traditional and non-traditional life insurance (term, universal and term universal life insurance as well as corporate-owned life insurance and funding agreements), and fixed and variable annuities, none of which are actively marketed or sold. In addition to our three reportable segments, we also have Corporate and Other, which includes debt financing expenses that are incurred at the Genworth Holdings, Inc. Genworth Holdings level, unallocated corporate income and expenses, and eliminations of inter-segment transactions. Corporate and Other also includes the results of other businesses that are not individually reportable, such as CareScout start-up results and certain international businesses. Enact Holdings is a public company traded on the Nasdaq Global Select Market exchange under the ticker symbol ACT. Genworth Financial maintains control of Enact Holdings through an indirect majority voting interest and accordingly, Enact Holdings remains a consolidated subsidiary of Genworth Financial. Enact Holdings and its mortgage insurance subsidiaries comprise, and can therefore generally be viewed as, our Enact segment, or commonly referred to as Enact. Strategic Update Creating shareholder value We continue to create shareholder value through Enact s growing market value and capital returns. Enact Holdings provided 81 million of capital returns to Genworth Holdings in the third quarter of 2024. Based on Genworth Financial s ownership of approximately 81 of Enact Holdings, we expect to receive capital returns from Enact Holdings at the higher end of our previously anticipated range of 245 million to 285 million for the full year 2024. The final amount and form of capital returns will ultimately depend on business performance, market conditions and regulatory approvals. We believe capital returns from Enact will continue to benefit our shareholders by funding our strategic initiatives, including new CareScout products and services, as well as share repurchases and opportunistic debt reduction. Since the initial authorization of Genworth Financial s share repurchase program in May 2022 and through October 2024, we have repurchased 503 million worth of shares of Genworth Financial s common stock. For additional information on our share repurchase program, see Liquidity and Capital Resources. Legacy businesses We continue to make progress on our strategic priority to maintain self-sustaining, customer-centric legacy U.S. life insurance companies, including our long-term care insurance, life insurance and annuity businesses. Our long-term care insurance multi-year in-force rate action plan continues to be our most effective tool in supporting this strategic priority. We achieved an estimated cumulative economic benefit of approximately 30 billion, on a net present value basis, of approved rate actions since 2012 through the third quarter of 2024. As we manage our legacy life insurance subsidiaries on a standalone basis, these entities will continue to rely on their statutory capital, significant reserves, prudent management of the in-force blocks and long-term care insurance in-force rate actions to satisfy policyholder obligations. For additional information regarding our in-force rate actions, see Results of Operations and Selected Financial and Operating Performance Measures by Segment and Long-Term Care Insurance segment.

CareScout growth initiatives We plan to drive future growth through CareScout with innovative, consumer-focused aging care services and funding solutions. Through October 2024, we continued to expand our network of long-term care providers CareScout Quality Network to 49 states and 422 high-quality, person-centered home care providers who undergo a rigorous credentialing process. Substantially all of these providers have agreed to hourly rates below the median cost of care in their respective zip codes (as determined by Genworth s Cost of Care Survey conducted in 2023), with many agreeing to 20 discounts off their standard rates. We plan to add assisted living communities in large metropolitan areas in 2025, as well as other types of care providers to the network over time. While our initial focus has been with our long-term care insurance policyholders, we believe that over time and with national coverage of the CareScout Quality Network, we can expand the scope of our CareScout services business to additional consumer markets. In addition to the benefits to consumers, the discounts available through the network are expected to potentially further mitigate risk in our legacy long-term care insurance block by reducing claims costs. We aim to prudently scale and diversify our CareScout services business and expect to contribute approximately 35 million of capital to our CareScout services business for the full year 2024. We are also working to build the foundation necessary to re-enter the long-term care insurance market through our CareScout insurance business. Initially, we are engaging with regulators on an individual product with capped coverage limits and conservative assumptions designed to reduce the need for future premium increases. The new product would also include access to the CareScout Quality Network, which provides significant discounts on care costs to help policyholders optimize their claim dollars. We plan to continue innovating on future products to give families more options to plan for the increasing costs of care. We will continue to strive to maintain a disciplined approach in our capital allocation strategy, balancing investments in CareScout growth initiatives with returning value to shareholders.

Our Financial Information The financial information in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q has been derived from our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements. Revenues and expenses Our revenues consist primarily of the following: 

Premiums. Premiums consist primarily of premiums earned on insurance products for mortgage, long-term care and term life insurance. 

Net investment income. Net investment income represents the income earned on our investments. For discussion of the change in net investment income, see the comparison for this line item under Investments and Derivative Instruments. 

Net investment gains (losses). Net investment gains (losses) consist primarily of realized gains and losses from the sale of our investments, credit losses, and unrealized gains and losses on equity securities, limited partnership investments and derivative instruments. For discussion of the change in net investment gains (losses), see the comparison for this line item under Investments and Derivative Instruments. 

Policy fees and other income. Policy fees and other income consists primarily of fees assessed against policyholder and contractholder account values, surrender charges, cost of insurance assessed on universal and term universal life insurance policies, advisory and administration service fees assessed on investment contractholder account values, broker/dealer commission revenues, fee revenue from contract underwriting services and other fees. Our expenses consist primarily of the following: 

Benefits and other changes in policy reserves. Benefits and other changes in policy reserves consist primarily of benefits paid, interest accretion expense and other reserve activity related to future policy benefits for long-term care insurance, life insurance, and fixed and variable annuities, and claim costs incurred related to mortgage insurance products. 

Liability remeasurement (gains) losses. Liability remeasurement (gains) losses represent changes to the net premium ratio for actual versus expected experience and updates to cash flow assumptions used to measure long-duration traditional and limited-payment insurance contracts. 

Changes in fair value of market risk benefits and associated hedges. Changes in fair value of market risk benefits and associated hedges consist of fair value changes of market risk benefits (other than changes attributable to instrument-specific credit risk), net of changes in the fair value of non-qualified derivative instruments that support our market risk benefits. 

Interest credited. Interest credited represents interest credited on behalf of policyholder and contractholder general account balances. 

Acquisition and operating expenses, net of deferrals. Acquisition and operating expenses, net of deferrals, represent costs and expenses related to the acquisition and ongoing maintenance of insurance and investment contracts, including commissions, policy issuance expenses and other underwriting and general operating costs. These costs and expenses are net of amounts that are capitalized and deferred, which are costs and expenses that are related directly to the successful acquisition of new or renewal insurance policies and investment contracts, such as first-year commissions in excess of ultimate renewal commissions and other policy issuance expenses. We allocate corporate expenses to each of our segments using various methodologies. 

Amortization of deferred acquisition costs and intangibles. Amortization of deferred acquisition costs DAC and intangibles consists primarily of the amortization of capitalized acquisition costs, present value of future profits and capitalized software. 
 84 

Table of Contents 

Interest expense. Interest expense primarily represents interest incurred on borrowings of Genworth Holdings and Enact Holdings. 

Provision (benefit) for income taxes. We tax our businesses at the U.S. corporate federal income tax rate of 21 . Each segment is then adjusted to reflect the unique tax attributes of that segment, such as permanent differences between U.S. generally accepted accounting principles U.S. GAAP and tax law. The difference between the consolidated provision for income taxes and the sum of the provision for income taxes in each segment is reflected in Corporate and Other. The effective tax rates disclosed herein are calculated using whole numbers. As a result, the percentages shown may differ from an effective tax rate calculated using rounded numbers. The annually-determined tax rates and adjustments to each segment s provision for income taxes are estimates which are subject to review and could change from year to year. For a discussion of the effective tax rates used to record the provision for income taxes for our three reportable segments and Corporate and Other, see note 15 in our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements under Item 1 Financial Statements. 

Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests. Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests represents third party ownership interests in income of Enact Holdings, a consolidated subsidiary of Genworth Financial.

 We define NM as not meaningful for increases or decreases greater than 200 . Unless otherwise stated, all references to net income (loss), net income (loss) per share, adjusted operating income (loss) and adjusted operating income (loss) per share found in Item 2 Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations should be read as net income (loss) available to Genworth Financial, Inc. s common stockholders, net income (loss) available to Genworth Financial, Inc. s common stockholders per share, adjusted operating income (loss) available to Genworth Financial, Inc. s common stockholders and adjusted operating income (loss) available to Genworth Financial, Inc. s common stockholders per share, respectively. Use of non-GAAP measures Reconciliation of net income (loss) to adjusted operating income (loss) Management uses non-GAAP financial measures entitled adjusted operating income (loss) and adjusted operating income (loss) per share to evaluate performance and allocate resources. Adjusted operating income (loss) per share is derived from adjusted operating income (loss). We define adjusted operating income (loss) as income (loss) from continuing operations excluding the after-tax effects of income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests, net investment gains (losses), changes in fair value of market risk benefits and associated hedges, gains (losses) on the sale of businesses, gains (losses) on the early extinguishment of debt, restructuring costs and infrequent or unusual non-operating items. A component of our net investment gains (losses) is the result of estimated future credit losses, the size and timing of which can vary significantly depending on market credit cycles. In addition, the size and timing of other investment gains (losses) can be

subject to our discretion and are influenced by market opportunities, as well as asset-liability matching considerations. We exclude net investment gains (losses), changes in fair value of market risk benefits and associated hedges, gains (losses) on the sale of businesses, gains (losses) on the early extinguishment of debt, restructuring costs and infrequent or unusual non-operating items from adjusted operating income (loss) because, in our opinion, they are not indicative of overall operating performance. While some of these items may be significant components of net income (loss) determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP, we believe that adjusted operating income (loss), and measures that are derived from or incorporate adjusted operating income (loss), including adjusted operating income (loss) per share on a basic and diluted basis, are appropriate measures that are useful to investors because they identify the income (loss) attributable to the ongoing operations of the business. Management also uses adjusted operating income (loss), among other key performance indicators, as a basis for determining awards and compensation for senior management and to evaluate performance on a basis comparable to that used by analysts. However, the items excluded from adjusted operating income (loss) have occurred in the past and could, and in some cases will, recur in the future. Adjusted operating income (loss) and adjusted operating income (loss) per share on a basic and diluted basis are not substitutes for net income (loss) or net income (loss) per share on a basic and diluted basis determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP. In addition, our definition of adjusted operating income (loss) may differ from the definitions used by other companies. Adjustments to reconcile net income (loss) to adjusted operating income (loss) assume a 21 tax rate and are net of the portion attributable to noncontrolling interests. Changes in fair value of market risk benefits and associated hedges are adjusted to exclude changes in reserves, attributed fees and benefit payments.

Executive Summary of Consolidated Financial Results Below is an executive summary of our condensed consolidated financial results for the periods indicated. Amounts within this Executive Summary of Consolidated Financial Results are net of taxes, unless otherwise indicated. After-tax amounts assume a tax rate of 21 . For a discussion of selected financial information and detailed descriptions of operating performance measures, see Results of Operations and Selected Financial and Operating Performance Measures by Segment. Three Months Ended September 30, 2024 Compared to Three Months Ended September 30, 2023 

Net income for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was 85 million and 29 million, respectively, and adjusted operating income was 48 million and 42 million, respectively. 

Enact segment 

Adjusted operating income increased primarily attributable to higher net investment income and premiums, as well as a higher reserve release in the current year. 

Long-Term Care Insurance segment 

The adjusted operating loss decreased primarily driven by favorable cash flow assumption updates largely related to higher approval amounts on our in-force rate action plan and from less adverse actual versus expected experience, partially offset by lower renewal premiums in the current year. 
 89 

Table of Contents 

Life and Annuities segment 

Life insurance: 

The adjusted operating loss increased primarily due to unfavorable mortality in our universal and term universal life insurance products. This was partially offset by higher liability remeasurement losses in the prior year largely related to a voluntary recapture of previously ceded reinsurance. 

Fixed annuities: 

Adjusted operating income decreased primarily driven by unfavorable mortality compared to the prior year and lower net spread income in the current year largely driven by block runoff. 

Corporate and Other 

The adjusted operating loss increased primarily from higher expenses related to CareScout growth initiatives in the current year. Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 Compared to Nine Months Ended September 30, 2023 

Net income for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was 300 million and 288 million, respectively, and adjusted operating income was 258 million and 271 million, respectively. 

Enact segment 

Adjusted operating income increased primarily attributable to higher net investment income and premiums, partially offset by higher new delinquencies in the current year. 

Long-Term Care Insurance segment 

The adjusted operating loss decreased primarily driven by favorable cash flow assumption updates related to approval amounts and implementation timing of our in-force rate action plan, net insurance recoveries of 22 million, higher limited partnership income and higher policy terminations, partially offset by lower renewal premiums in the current year. 

Life and Annuities segment 

Life insurance: 

The adjusted operating loss increased primarily driven by unfavorable mortality experience and lower premiums from the runoff of our in-force blocks. These adverse developments were partially offset by higher remeasurement losses in the prior year largely related to a voluntary recapture of previously ceded reinsurance. 

Fixed annuities: 

Adjusted operating income decreased mainly from lower net spreads primarily related to block runoff. 

Corporate and Other 

The adjusted operating loss increased primarily from higher expenses related to CareScout growth initiatives, partially offset by higher net investment income and a higher benefit for income taxes in the current year. Significant Developments and Strategic Highlights Enact segment 

Mortgage insurance portfolio . Enact s primary persistency rate of 83 continued to offset the decline in new insurance written, contributing to insurance in-force growth in the third quarter of 2024. New insurance written decreased 6 in the third quarter of 2024 compared to the third quarter of 2023. 
 90 

Table of Contents 

Loss performance . Enact recorded a pre-tax reserve release of 65 million during the third quarter of 2024 primarily driven by favorable cure performance on 2023 and prior delinquencies compared to a pre-tax reserve release of 55 million in the third quarter of 2023. 

PMIERs compliance . Enact s PMIERs sufficiency ratio was 173 or 2,190 million above the PMIERs requirements as of September 30, 2024. On August 21, 2024, the government-sponsored enterprises GSEs and the Federal Housing Finance Agency FHFA released updated PMIERs requirements, which will be phased in between March 31, 2025 and September 30, 2026. The updated standards differentiate between bonds held as available assets under PMIERs based on credit quality and liquidity. The updates also establish limits for assets backed by residential mortgages or commercial real estate to mitigate the impact if such assets lose value during periods of housing stress. Enact expects to hold capital sufficiency well in excess of these requirements and does not expect the impact of these updates to be material to its sufficiency. 

Capital returns . Genworth Holdings received 81 million of capital returns from Enact Holdings during the third quarter of 2024. Long-Term Care Insurance segment 

In-force rate actions . We estimate that the cumulative economic benefit of approved rate actions in our long-term care insurance multi-year in-force rate action plan since 2012 through the third quarter of 2024 was approximately 30 billion, on a net present value basis. 

Claims . We expect higher paid claims in our long-term care insurance business as our blocks age, with peak claim years over a decade away. Paid claims on newer products continue to increase as policyholders approach peak claim age, while claims on our oldest products decline as those policyholders, on average, are past peak claim age. We also expect overall claim costs to continue to increase as the approximately 612,000 insured individuals in our two largest blocks, Choice I and Choice II, with average attained ages of 77 and 74, respectively, reach their peak claim years, at approximately age 85. Capital of U.S. life insurance subsidiaries 

As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the consolidated company action level risk-based capital ratio of our U.S. domiciled life insurance subsidiaries was approximately 317 and 303 , respectively. The increase was primarily attributable to statutory earnings in our long-term care insurance business primarily driven by premium increases and benefit reductions from in-force rate actions and legal settlements. The increase was also attributable to statutory earnings in our variable annuity products, including a benefit from the impact of interest rate and equity market performance. Genworth Financial share repurchase program 

Genworth Financial executed 135 million of share repurchases during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. Results of Operations and Selected Financial and Operating Performance Measures by Segment Management s discussion and analysis by segment contains selected operating performance measures including new insurance written, insurance in-force and risk in-force, which are commonly used in the insurance industry as measures of operating performance. Management regularly monitors and reports new insurance written for our Enact segment as a measure of volume of new business generated in a period. We consider new insurance written to be a measure of our Enact segment s operating performance because it represents a measure of new sales of mortgage insurance policies 
 91 

Table of Contents 

during a specified period, rather than a measure of revenues or profitability during that period. Management also regularly monitors and reports insurance in-force and risk in-force for our Enact segment. Insurance in-force is a measure of the aggregate unpaid principal balance as of the respective reporting date for loans insured by our U.S. mortgage insurance subsidiaries. Risk in-force is based on the coverage percentage applied to the estimated current outstanding loan balance. These metrics are presented on a direct basis and exclude reinsurance. We consider insurance in-force and risk in-force to be measures of our Enact segment s operating performance because they represent measures of the size of its business at a specific date which will generate revenues and profits in a future period, rather than measures of its revenues or profitability during that period. Management also regularly monitors and reports a loss ratio for our Enact segment, which is the ratio of benefits and other changes in policy reserves to net earned premiums. We consider the loss ratio to be a measure of underwriting performance and helps to enhance the understanding of the operating performance of our Enact segment. Management regularly monitors and reports on in-force rate actions, including state filing approvals; impacted in-force premiums; weighted-average percentage rate increases approved; and gross incremental premiums approved in our Long-Term Care Insurance segment. We also estimate the cumulative economic benefit of approved rate actions in our long-term care insurance multi-year in-force rate action plan on a net present value basis, discounted at our investment portfolio yield. This is defined as the net present value of historical and future expected premium increases and benefit reductions based on current assumptions as a result of rate increases approved on individual and group long-term care insurance policies. It also includes the net present value of reserve reductions related to legal settlements less cash payments made to policyholders who elect certain reduced benefit options in connection with the legal settlements, referred to as settlement payments. We monitor these selected operating performance measures for in-force rate actions to track our progress on maintaining the self-sustainability of our legacy life insurance subsidiaries. We consider these in-force rate action metrics to be measures of financial performance and help to enhance the understanding of the operating performance of our Long-Term Care Insurance segment. These operating performance measures enable us to compare our operating performance across periods without regard to revenues or profitability related to policies or contracts sold in prior periods or from investments or other sources. Enact segment Trends and conditions Results of our Enact segment are affected primarily by the following factors: competitor actions; unemployment or underemployment levels; other economic and housing market trends, including interest rates, home prices, the number of first-time homebuyers, and mortgage origination volume mix and practices; the size of the overall private mortgage insurance market and the effect of regulatory actions thereon; the levels and aging of mortgage delinquencies; the effect of seasonal variations; the inventory of unsold homes; loan modification and other servicing efforts; and litigation, among other items. References to Enact included herein Item 2 Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Enact segment are, unless the context otherwise requires, to our Enact segment. Macroeconomic environment While the U.S. economy continued to show positive signs during the third quarter of 2024, it faces lingering uncertainty due to inflationary pressure, the geopolitical environment and macroeconomic concerns. Mortgage origination activity has increased modestly in 2024 but remains relatively slow due to elevated mortgage rates and sustained low housing supply. Over the past few years, housing affordability has deteriorated as elevated mortgage rates and home price appreciation outpaced median family income, according to the National Association of Realtors Housing Affordability Index. National home prices continued to rise in 2024, according to the FHFA Monthly Purchase-Only House Price Index.

The unemployment rate remained flat at 4.1 in September 2024 compared to June 2024. As of September 30, 2024, the number of unemployed Americans was approximately 6.8 million, and the number of long term unemployed over 26 weeks was approximately 1.6 million. Forbearance and loss mitigation programs Borrowers ability to utilize extended forbearance timelines permitted through the Coronavirus Aid Relief and Economic Security Act and the GSEs coronavirus pandemic COVID-19 servicing-related policies ended in 2023. Borrowers that meet general hardship and program guidelines continue to have access to standard forbearance policies as a loss mitigation option. In addition, in March 2023, the GSEs announced new loss mitigation programs that allow six-month payment deferrals for borrowers facing financial hardship. Although it is difficult to predict the future level of reported forbearance and how many of the loans in a forbearance plan that remain current on their monthly mortgage payment will go delinquent, servicer reported forbearances have generally declined. As of September 30, 2024, approximately 1 or 9,987 of Enact s active primary policies were reported in a forbearance plan, of which approximately 28 were reported as delinquent. Approximately 9 of Enact s primary new delinquencies in the third quarter of 2024 were subject to a forbearance plan compared to 12 in the third quarter of 2023. Regulatory developments Private mortgage insurance market penetration and overall market size are affected in part by actions that impact housing or housing finance policy taken by the GSEs and the U.S. government, including but not limited to, the FHA and the FHFA. In the past, these actions have included announced changes, or potential changes, to underwriting standards, including changes to the GSEs automated underwriting systems, FHA pricing, GSE guaranty fees, loan limits and alternative products. On October 24, 2022, the FHFA announced its validation and approval of certain credit score models for anticipated use by the GSEs and proposed changing the required number of credit reports provided by lenders from all three nationwide consumer reporting agencies to only two. The validation of the new credit scores is currently expected to require lenders to deliver both credit scores for each loan sold to the GSEs. In February 2024, the FHFA announced that it is targeting the fourth quarter of 2025 for implementation, which will require system and process updates. On August 21, 2024, the GSEs and the FHFA released updated PMIERs requirements, which will be phased in between March 31, 2025 and September 30, 2026. The updated standards differentiate between bonds held as available assets under PMIERs based on credit quality and liquidity. The updates also establish limits for assets backed by residential mortgages or commercial real estate to mitigate the impact if such assets lose value during periods of housing stress. Enact expects to hold capital sufficiency well in excess of these requirements and does not expect the impact of these updates to be material to its sufficiency. The ultimate impact of the PMIERs changes will be influenced by investment portfolio maturities, dispositions, reinvestments, and overall business and economic performance between now and the phase-in dates. Competitive environment The U.S. private mortgage insurance industry is highly competitive. Enact Holdings market share is influenced by the execution of its go to market strategy, including but not limited to, pricing competitiveness relative to its peers and its selective participation in forward commitment transactions. Enact continues to manage the quality of new business through pricing and its underwriting guidelines, which are modified from time to time when circumstances warrant. The market and underwriting conditions, including the mortgage insurance pricing environment, are within Enact s risk adjusted return appetite, enabling it to write new business at returns it views as attractive.

Mortgage insurance portfolio New insurance written of 13.6 billion in the third quarter of 2024 decreased 6 compared to the third quarter of 2023 primarily driven by Enact s lower estimated market share. Enact s primary persistency rate was 83 during the third quarter of 2024 compared to 84 in the third quarter of 2023. Elevated persistency, driven by a large percentage of Enact s in-force policies with mortgage rates below current rates, continued to offset lower new insurance written, leading to an increase in primary insurance in-force of 1.9 billion as compared to June 30, 2024. Net earned premiums increased in the third quarter of 2024 compared to the third quarter of 2023 primarily driven by insurance in-force growth and higher assumed premiums, mostly consisting of Enact Re Ltd. s Enact Re GSE credit risk transfer participation, partially offset by higher ceded premiums. Loss experience Enact s loss ratio for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was 5 and 7 , respectively. Enact released reserves of 65 million during the third quarter of 2024 primarily related to favorable cure performance on 2023 and prior delinquencies. Enact recorded a favorable reserve adjustment of 55 million during the third quarter of 2023 primarily related to favorable cure performance on delinquencies from 2022 and earlier, including those related to COVID-19. The severity of loss on loans that go to claim may be negatively impacted by extended forbearance and foreclosure timelines, the associated elevated expenses and the higher loan amount of recent new delinquencies. These negative influences on loss severity could be mitigated in part by embedded home price appreciation. For loans insured on or after October 1, 2014, Enact s mortgage insurance policies limit the number of months of unpaid interest and associated expenses that are included in the mortgage insurance claim amount to a maximum of 36 months. New primary delinquencies in the third quarter of 2024 increased compared to the third quarter of 2023 primarily due to the aging of large, newer books of business. New primary delinquencies of 12,964 contributed 75 million of loss expense in the third quarter of 2024, while Enact incurred 72 million of losses from 11,107 new primary delinquencies in the third quarter of 2023. In determining the loss expense estimate, considerations were given to recent cure and claim experience and the prevailing and prospective economic conditions. Capital requirements As of September 30, 2024, EMICO s risk-to-capital ratio under North Carolina law and enforced by the North Carolina Department of Insurance NCDOI ), EMICO s domestic insurance regulator, was approximately 10.4:1, compared with a risk-to-capital ratio of 10.8:1 and 11.6:1 as of June 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. EMICO s risk-to-capital ratio remains below the NCDOI s maximum risk-to-capital ratio of 25:1. North Carolina s calculation of risk-to-capital excludes the risk in-force for delinquent loans given the established loss reserves against all delinquencies. EMICO s ongoing risk-to-capital ratio will depend principally on the magnitude of future losses incurred by EMICO, the effectiveness of ongoing loss mitigation activities, new business volume and profitability, the impact of quota share reinsurance, the amount of policy lapses and the amount of additional capital that is generated or distributed by the business. Under PMIERs, Enact is subject to operational and financial requirements that private mortgage insurers must meet in order to remain eligible to insure loans that are purchased by the GSEs. As of September 30, 2024, Enact had estimated available assets of 5,194 million against 3,004 million net required assets under PMIERs compared to available assets of 5,024 million against 2,967 million net required assets as of June 30, 2024. The sufficiency ratio as of September 30, 2024 was 173 or 2,190 million above the PMIERs requirements, compared to 169 or 2,057 million above the PMIERs requirements as of June 30, 2024. Enact s third-party

reinsurance transactions provided an aggregate of approximately 1,807 million and 1,756 million of PMIERs capital credit as of September 30, 2024 and June 30, 2024, respectively. Enact s PMIERs required assets as of September 30, 2024 and June 30, 2024 also benefited from the application of a 0.30 multiplier applied to the risk-based required asset amount factor for certain non-performing loans as defined under PMIERs. The application of the 0.30 multiplier to all eligible delinquencies provided 28 million and 31 million, respectively, of benefit to Enact s September 30, 2024 and June 30, 2024 PMIERs required assets. These amounts are gross of any incremental reinsurance benefit from the elimination of the 0.30 multiplier. Per guidance released by the GSEs in the third quarter of 2024, use of the multiplier will be discontinued effective March 31, 2025. Capital returns In March 2024, EMICO completed a distribution to Enact Holdings that supports its ability to pay a quarterly dividend. Future dividend payments are subject to quarterly review and approval by Enact Holdings board of directors and Genworth Financial. In addition to Enact s quarterly dividend program, Enact Holdings announced approval by its board of directors on May 1, 2024 of a share repurchase program which allows for the repurchase of up to 250 million of its common stock. Genworth Holdings has agreed to participate in share repurchases in order to maintain its overall ownership at approximately its current level. As the majority shareholder, Genworth Holdings received 81 million of capital returns from Enact Holdings during the third quarter of 2024 comprised of 23 million of quarterly dividends and 58 million of share repurchases. Returning capital to shareholders, balanced with growth and risk management priorities, remains a priority for Enact Holdings as it looks to enhance shareholder value through time. Future return of capital will be shaped by Enact Holdings capital prioritization framework, which sets the following priorities: supporting its existing policyholders, growing its mortgage insurance business, funding attractive new business opportunities and returning capital to shareholders. Enact Holdings total return of capital will also be based on its view of the prevailing and prospective macroeconomic conditions, regulatory landscape and business performance.

Enact released reserves of 196 million in the current year primarily related to favorable cure performance on 2023 and prior delinquencies. As part of the reserve adjustments, Enact decreased its claim rate assumptions largely as a result of sustained favorable cure performance and lessening uncertainty in the economic environment, impacting both current and prior year delinquencies. In the prior year, Enact recorded reserve releases of 188 million primarily related to favorable cure performance on delinquencies from prior years, including those related to COVID-19. Acquisition and operating expenses, net of deferrals, increased primarily due to an 11 million loss on the early redemption of Enact Holdings senior notes due in 2025 2025 Notes in the current year. Provision for income taxes.

Enact selected operating performance measures Primary mortgage insurance Substantially all of Enact s policies are primary mortgage insurance, which provides protection on individual loans at specified coverage percentages. Primary mortgage insurance is placed on individual loans at the time of origination and is typically delivered to Enact on a loan-by-loan basis. Primary mortgage insurance can also be delivered to Enact on an aggregated basis, whereby each mortgage in a given loan portfolio is insured in a single transaction after the point of origination. Pool mortgage insurance Pool mortgage insurance transactions provide coverage on a finite set of individual loans identified by the pool policy. Pool policies contain coverage percentages and provisions limiting the insurer s obligation to pay claims until a threshold amount is reached (known as a deductible or capping the insurer s potential aggregate liability for claims payments (known as a stop loss or a combination of both provisions. Pool mortgage insurance is typically used to provide additional credit enhancement for certain secondary market mortgage transactions.

 Primary insurance in-force and risk in-force Primary insurance in-force increased mainly from new insurance written. In addition, primary persistency remained elevated largely driven by suppressed refinancing activity in the current year due to a large percentage of in-force policies with mortgage rates below current rates. The primary persistency rate was 83 and 84 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Total risk in-force increased primarily as a result of higher primary insurance in-force. New insurance written Changes in new insurance written are primarily impacted by the size of the mortgage insurance market and Enact s market share.

 The loss ratio is the ratio of benefits and other changes in policy reserves to net earned premiums. The expense ratio is the ratio of general expenses to net earned premiums. Enact s general expenses consist of acquisition and operating expenses, net of deferrals, and amortization of DAC and intangibles. The loss ratio decreased for the three months ended September 30, 2024 largely from a higher reserve release, partially offset by higher new delinquencies in the current year. The loss ratio increased for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 primarily due to higher new delinquencies, partially offset by higher favorable reserve adjustments in the current year.

 Direct primary case reserves exclude loss adjustment expenses, pool, incurred but not reported IBNR and reinsurance reserves. Reserves as a percentage of risk in-force as of September 30, 2024 decreased compared to December 31, 2023 as Enact has experienced cures among long-term delinquencies with higher reserves and has reduced the expected claim rate on new delinquencies.

 Direct primary case reserves exclude loss adjustment expenses, pool, IBNR and reinsurance reserves. Loss reserves in policy years 2008 and prior are outsized compared to their representation of risk in-force. The size of these policy years at origination combined with the significant decline in home prices led to significant losses in policy years prior to 2009. Although uncertainty remains with respect to the ultimate losses Enact will experience on these policy years, they have become a smaller percentage of its total mortgage insurance portfolio. The concentration of loss reserves has shifted to newer book years in line with changes in risk in-force. As of September 30, 2024, Enact s 2017 and newer policy years represented approximately 96 of its primary risk in-force and 81 of its total direct primary case reserves. Long-Term Care Insurance segment Trends and conditions The results of our long-term care insurance business depend upon how our actual experience compares with our valuation assumptions, including but not limited to in-force rate actions, morbidity, mortality and persistency. Estimates for in-force rate actions reflect certain simplifying assumptions that may vary materially from actual results, including but not limited to consistent policyholder behavior over time in addition to a uniform rate of coinsurance and premium taxes. Actual policyholder behavior may differ significantly from these assumptions. Results of our long-term care insurance business are also influenced by our ability to improve investment yields and manage expenses and reinsurance, among other factors. Changes in laws or government programs, including long-term care insurance rate action legislation, regulation and/or practices, could also impact our long-term care insurance business either positively or negatively. Because these factors are not known in advance, change over time, are difficult to accurately predict and are inherently uncertain, we cannot determine with precision the ultimate amounts we will pay for actual claims or the timing of those payments as our actual claims experience will emerge over many years, or decades. For example, average claim reserves for new claims have trended higher over time as the mix of claims continues to evolve, with an increasing number of policies with higher daily benefit amounts and higher inflation factors going on claim. Although new claim counts on certain of our oldest long-term care insurance blocks of business have reached their peak claim years and will decrease as the blocks run off, we are gaining more experience on the majority of our larger blocks of business and fully expect continued overall growth in new claims as policyholders reach their peak claim years. 
 103 

Table of Contents 

Additionally, we have observed an increase in the cost of care in our long-term care insurance business, due in part to elevated inflation. Increases in cost of care have resulted in higher claim payments in our long-term care insurance business, which could have a material adverse impact on our liquidity, results of operations and financial condition if these increases persist. We will continue to monitor our experience and make changes to our assumptions and methodologies, as appropriate, for our long-term care insurance products. Even small changes in assumptions or small deviations of actual experience from assumptions could have, and in the past have had, material impacts on our reserve levels, results of operations and financial condition. The impacts of assumption updates and actual versus expected experience will continue to drive volatility in our long-term care insurance results, particularly for our unprofitable capped cohorts. It is important to note that quarterly variations resulting from assumption updates and actual versus expected experience are typically expected to be relatively small compared to the overall size of our liability for future policy benefits of 42.4 billion, at the locked-in discount rate, for our long-term care insurance business as of September 30, 2024. The financial condition of our long-term care insurance business is also impacted by interest rates. We remeasure our liability for future policy benefits and the related reinsurance recoverables at the single-A bond rate each quarter. As a result, our reported insurance liabilities are sensitive to movements in interest rates, which will likely result in continued volatility to our reserve balances and equity. Annual review of cash flow assumptions We will complete the required annual review of our cash flow assumptions, including mortality, benefit utilization, expected claim incidence and terminations, and benefit reductions related to in-force rate actions and legal settlements, among other assumptions, for our long-term care insurance products in the fourth quarter. In connection with our 2024 cash flow assumption reviews, we are focused on short-term trends in assumptions, including benefit utilization, incidence, mortality and in-force rate actions. Our 2024 assumption review will consider trends during the pandemic years, but any proposed updates to long-term assumptions will generally exclude or adjust experience data after 2019, as we do not have sufficient information around the long-term effects of COVID-19. While our reviews are still underway and not yet complete, the long-term care insurance assumption updates are expected to result in a negative impact to our financial results, as experience has been mixed, and could be more unfavorable than in 2023. However, we expect this would be a very small percentage change compared to the overall size of our liability for future policy benefits mentioned above. For capped cohorts, these updates would be reported immediately in earnings. While our reviews are not yet complete, we currently expect that the impacts from the assumption updates in the aggregate for our long-term care insurance and life insurance and annuity products would be in a similar range as in 2023. For a discussion of our 2024 assumption reviews for our life insurance and annuity products, see Life and Annuities segment Trends and conditions. We will also complete statutory cash flow testing for our life insurance companies in the fourth quarter. Under cash flow testing, changes impacting active life reserves are included in our margin review and only impact statutory income if the margin falls below zero. However, changes to our claim reserve assumptions are immediately reflected in statutory income. While our statutory process is not yet complete and work remains, our early assessment is that the margin for Genworth Life Insurance Company, one of our principal life insurance subsidiaries, should remain positive. In-force rate actions and legal settlements Given the ongoing challenges in our long-term care insurance business, we continue to pursue initiatives to improve the risk and profitability profile of our business, including premium rate increases and associated benefit reductions on our in-force policies. Executing on our multi-year long-term care insurance in-force rate action plan with premium rate increases and associated benefit reductions on our legacy long-term care insurance policies is critical to the business. For an update on in-force rate actions, refer to the selected operating performance measures below. 
 104 

Table of Contents 

In addition, we have reached three legal settlements regarding alleged disclosure deficiencies in premium increases for long-term care insurance policies. These legal settlements cover approximately 70 of our long-term care insurance block and have had the effect of accelerating benefit reductions. We began implementing the third and final legal settlement during the second quarter of 2023 and expect that settlement to be materially complete by the end of 2024. While the legal settlements are similar, the ultimate impact depends on the policyholder election rates and the types of reduced benefits elected. Given our experience with prior settlements, we expect the third legal settlement to result in an overall net favorable economic impact to our long-term care insurance business as it reduces tail risk on these long-duration liabilities. While we expect renewal premiums to decline over time as the block runs off, benefit reductions elected by policyholders in connection with our in-force rate actions and legal settlements have accelerated that decline. However, we expect this decline to be partially offset by future approved rate actions.

Adjusted operating loss available to Genworth Financial, Inc. s common stockholders The adjusted operating loss decreased primarily driven by favorable cash flow assumption updates largely related to higher approval amounts on our in-force rate action plan and from less adverse actual versus expected experience, partially offset by lower renewal premiums in the current year. Revenues Premiums decreased primarily driven by lower renewal premiums from benefit reduction elections in connection with our in-force rate actions and legal settlements and from policy terminations in the current year. For a discussion of the change in net investment gains (losses), see the comparison for this line item under Investments and Derivative Instruments. Benefits and expenses The liability remeasurement loss in the current year was largely due to adverse actual versus expected experience primarily driven by higher claims and lower terminations, partially offset by favorable cash flow assumption updates largely related to higher approval amounts on our in-force rate action plan. The liability remeasurement loss in the prior year was primarily due to adverse actual versus expected experience largely driven by timing impacts related to the second legal settlement, higher claims and lower terminations. Acquisition and operating expenses, net of deferrals, increased principally from higher operating costs in the current year. Provision (benefit) for income taxes. The tax provision in the current year was primarily attributable to tax expense on certain forward starting swap gains that are tax effected at the previously enacted federal income tax rate of 35 as they are amortized into net investment income, as well as tax expense related to pre-tax income. The tax benefit in the prior year was primarily related to the pre-tax loss, partially offset by tax expense on certain forward starting swap gains.

Table of Contents 

Benefits and expenses Benefits and other changes in policy reserves decreased primarily from policy terminations, partially offset by aging of the in-force block, including higher interest accretion, as well as higher loss adjustment expenses in the current year. The liability remeasurement loss in the current year was largely due to adverse actual versus expected experience primarily driven by higher claims and lower terminations, partially offset by favorable cash flow assumption updates primarily related to approval amounts and implementation timing of our in-force rate action plan. The liability remeasurement loss in the prior year was mainly attributable to adverse actual versus expected experience related to timing impacts from the second legal settlement, higher claims and lower terminations. Acquisition and operating expenses, net of deferrals, decreased principally from 28 million of net insurance recoveries in the current year related to previously incurred legal settlement expenses, as well as a 13 million accrual for legal settlement costs in the prior year that did not recur. The decrease was partially offset by higher operating costs in the current year. Provision for income taxes. The tax provision in the current year was primarily attributable to tax expense on certain forward starting swap gains that are tax effected at the previously enacted federal income tax rate of 35 as they are amortized into net investment income, as well as tax expense related to pre-tax income. The tax provision in the prior year was primarily attributable to tax expense on certain forward starting swap gains, partially offset by the tax benefit related to the pre-tax loss. Long-Term Care Insurance selected operating performance measures Liability remeasurement (gains) losses We include expectations for benefit reductions related to in-force rate actions and legal settlements as well as settlement payments in our assumptions for the liability for future policy benefits, which have impacted and will continue to impact our reported U.S. GAAP financial results. We update the net premium ratio quarterly for actual versus expected experience; therefore, forecasted cash flow assumptions will be replaced with actual cash flows each quarter with any difference recorded in net income (loss). As a result, variances between actual experience and our expectations for benefit reductions will be reflected in liability remeasurement (gains) losses in our operating results on a quarterly basis. We experienced quarterly fluctuations in actual to expected experience in 2023 related to the second legal settlement, which primarily covered older, unprofitable capped cohorts, after including this settlement in our 2022 assumptions. However, the third legal settlement, for which we updated cash flow assumptions in the fourth quarter of 2023, covers profitable uncapped cohorts and had a more muted impact on current period earnings. Overall, we expect the legal settlements to result in a net favorable economic impact to our long-term care insurance business as they reduce tail risk on these long-duration liabilities.

For additional discussion of the change in liability remeasurement (gains) losses, see the comparison for this line item above in Segment results of operations. In-force rate actions As part of our strategy for our long-term care insurance business, we have been implementing, and expect to continue to pursue, significant premium rate increases and associated benefit reductions in order to maintain the self-sustainability of our legacy life insurance subsidiaries and reduce the strain on earnings and capital. The following table sets forth filing approvals as part of our multi-year in-force rate action plan for the periods indicated:

 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we also submitted 54 new filings on approximately 276 million in annualized in-force premiums. Although we expect this amount to increase in the fourth quarter, we anticipate the total in-force premiums submitted in 2024 to be lower than previous years due to past successes in achieving approvals. In some cases, we received large approvals that either materially completed the current multi-year rate action plan, which removed the need to re-file in the near-term, or resulted in multi-year implementations, which delayed the expected submission of a subsequent filing to beyond 2024. The approval process for in-force rate actions and the amount and timing of the premium rate increases and associated benefit reductions approved vary by state and product. In certain states, the decision to approve or disapprove a rate increase can take a significant amount of time, and the approved amount may be phased in over time. After approval, insureds are provided with written notice of the increase, and increases are generally applied on the insured s next policy anniversary date. As a result, the benefits of any rate increase are not fully realized until the implementation cycle is complete and are, therefore, expected to be realized over time. We continue to work closely with the National Association of Insurance Commissioners and state regulators to demonstrate the broad-based need for actuarially justified rate increases in order to pay future claims. Because obtaining actuarially justified rate increases and associated benefit reductions is important to our ability to pay future claims, we will consider litigation against states that decline to approve those actuarially justified rate increases. As of September 30, 2024, we were in litigation with two states that have refused to approve actuarially justified rate increases for certain products. Life and Annuities segment Trends and conditions Many factors can affect the results of our life insurance and annuity products, as further discussed below. Because these factors are not known in advance, change over time, are difficult to accurately predict and are inherently uncertain, we cannot determine with precision the ultimate amounts we will pay for actual claims or the timing of those payments. We will continue to monitor our experience and assumptions closely and make changes to our assumptions and methodologies, as appropriate, for our life insurance and annuity products. Even small changes in assumptions or small deviations of actual experience from assumptions could have, and in the 
 109 

Table of Contents 

past have had, material impacts on our reserve levels, results of operations and financial condition. Results of our life insurance and annuity products depend significantly upon the extent to which our actual future experience is consistent with assumptions and methodologies we have used in calculating our reserves. Results of our life insurance and annuity products are also impacted by interest rates. For a discussion of the potential impacts and risks associated with changes in interest rates, see Item 1A Risk Factors Interest rates and changes in rates, including changes in monetary policy to combat inflation, could materially adversely affect our business and profitability in our 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K. We no longer solicit sales of traditional life insurance and annuity products; however, we continue to service our existing retained and reinsured blocks of business. In June 2022, we outsourced operational servicing of our life insurance and fixed annuity blocks to a third-party servicer. In connection with the outsourcing, we are converting certain administrative systems to those used by the third-party servicer over the next few years, with a targeted completion date in 2026. In October 2024, we completed the conversion of certain of our term and whole life insurance products on one legacy system. Annual review of cash flow assumptions We will complete the required annual review of our cash flow assumptions for our life insurance and annuity products in the fourth quarter. In connection with our 2024 cash flow assumption reviews, we are reviewing mortality, lapse rates and the potential impacts of the recent decline in interest rates. Consistent with our long-term care insurance business, our 2024 assumption review will consider trends during the pandemic years, but any proposed updates to long-term assumptions will generally exclude or adjust experience data after 2019, as we do not have sufficient information around the long-term effects of COVID-19. While our reviews are still underway and not yet complete, we currently expect these assumption updates to have a negative impact on earnings, although the impact could be less unfavorable than in 2023. Our universal life insurance products with secondary guarantees are subject to additional reserves on a statutory basis using a regulatory prescribed reinvestment rate which is measured from July to June each year. Given the increase in rates from July 2023 to June 2024, we currently anticipate a favorable benefit from the reinvestment rate. From a statutory income perspective, we believe the favorable benefit from the reinvestment rate will help offset any potential negative impacts from the assumption updates. Our statutory reviews are still underway and not yet complete, and we plan to report the outcome of these reviews in connection with our release of our fourth quarter of 2024 financial results. Life insurance Results of our life insurance products are impacted primarily by mortality, persistency, investment yields, expenses, reinsurance and statutory reserve requirements, among other factors. Mortality levels may deviate each period from historical trends. Overall mortality experience was unfavorable during the third quarter of 2024 compared to the second quarter of 2024 and the third quarter of 2023. We have experienced unfavorable mortality compared to our then-current and priced-for assumptions in recent years for our universal life insurance block. Reinsurance costs typically increase due to natural aging of the yearly renewable term YRT reinsured blocks. We have also received some YRT reinsurance premium increases from some of our reinsurance partners that reflect unfavorable mortality. Fixed annuities Results of our fixed annuity products are affected primarily by investment performance, interest rate levels, the slope of the interest rate yield curve, net interest spreads, equity market conditions, mortality, persistency and expense and commission levels.

We monitor and change crediting rates on fixed deferred annuities on a regular basis to maintain spreads and targeted returns, if applicable. However, we have seen and could continue to see declines in our fixed annuity spreads and margins as interest rates change, depending on the severity of the change. For fixed indexed annuities, equity market and interest rate performance and volatility could also result in additional gains or losses, although associated hedging activities are expected to partially mitigate these impacts. Variable annuities Results of our variable annuity products are affected primarily by investment performance, interest rate levels, the slope of the interest rate yield curve, net interest spreads, equity market conditions, mortality, surrenders and scheduled maturities. In addition, the results of our variable annuity products can significantly impact our regulatory capital requirements and liquidity. We use hedging strategies as well as liquidity planning and asset-liability management to help mitigate these impacts. In addition, we have used reinsurance to help mitigate volatility in our variable annuity results. Equity market volatility and interest rate movements have caused fluctuations in the results of our variable annuity products and regulatory capital requirements. In the future, equity market and interest rate performance and volatility could result in additional gains or losses in these products, although associated hedging activities are expected to partially mitigate these impacts.

The adjusted operating loss in our life insurance products increased primarily due to unfavorable mortality in our universal and term universal life insurance products. This was partially offset by higher liability remeasurement losses in the prior year largely related to a voluntary recapture of previously ceded reinsurance. 

Adjusted operating income in our fixed annuity products decreased primarily driven by unfavorable mortality compared to the prior year and lower net spread income in the current year largely driven by block runoff. Revenues Premiums . The decrease was driven by our life insurance products largely due to the continued runoff of our in-force blocks. Net investment income 

Our life insurance products decreased 23 million primarily from lower policy loan rates in our corporate-owned life insurance products in the current year. 

Our fixed annuity products decreased 9 million primarily attributable to lower average invested assets in the current year driven mostly by block runoff. Net investment gains (losses) . For a discussion of the change in net investment gains (losses), see the comparison for this line item under Investments and Derivative Instruments. Benefits and expenses Benefits and other changes in policy reserves. The increase was primarily from our life insurance products mainly due to unfavorable mortality in our universal and term universal life insurance products, partially offset by lower claims in our term life insurance products in the current year. Liability remeasurement (gains) losses 

The liability remeasurement loss in our life insurance products decreased 17 million. The prior year loss was mostly driven by higher projected benefits as compared to prior expectations largely due to a voluntary recapture of previously ceded reinsurance.

The gain in the prior year was primarily due to favorable mortality compared to expectations. Changes in fair value of market risk benefits and associated hedges 

Our fixed annuity products had an unfavorable variance of 26 million primarily driven by lower interest rates in the current year. 

Our variable annuity products had an unfavorable variance of 19 million primarily attributable to interest rate impacts, partially offset by a favorable equity market impact in the current year compared to an unfavorable impact in the prior year. The increase was also partially offset by derivative gains in the current year compared to losses in the prior year. Interest credited . The decrease was primarily driven by lower policy loan rates in our corporate-owned life insurance products in the current year. Acquisition and operating expenses, net of deferrals.

The benefit for income taxes in the prior year was partially offset by non-deductible expenses. Investments and Derivative Instruments Trends and conditions Investments During the three months ended September 30, 2024, our investment portfolio was impacted, and we believe will continue to be impacted, by the following macroeconomic trends: 

The U.S. Federal Reserve decreased interest rates by 50 basis points at its September 2024 meeting and forecasted additional decreases for the fourth quarter of 2024 as it continues to monitor inflation and labor market conditions. 

During the third quarter of 2024, U.S. Treasury yields decreased compared to June 30, 2024. The two-year U.S. Treasury yield ended the third quarter of 2024 lower than the ten-year U.S. Treasury yield for the first time since 2022. 

Credit spreads tightened during the third quarter of 2024 as overall credit market performance remained strong with macroeconomic data continuing to support market optimism for a soft economic landing. 

As of September 30, 2024, our investment portfolio exposure to Israel was immaterial and there has been no impact on our results of operations from the Israel-Hamas conflict. At this time, we do not believe there is a material risk to the valuation of our investment portfolio due to credit losses or direct write-offs that may arise as a result of the conflict. 

As of September 30, 2024, our fixed maturity securities portfolio, which was 97 investment grade, comprised 76 of our total invested assets and cash. Derivatives 

As of September 30, 2024, 1.2 billion notional of our derivatives portfolio was cleared through the Chicago Mercantile Exchange CME ). 

The customer swap agreements that govern our cleared derivatives contain provisions that enable our clearing agents to request initial margin in excess of CME requirements. As of September 30, 2024, we posted initial margin of 85 million to our clearing agents, which represented 43 million more than was otherwise required by the clearinghouse. Because our clearing agents serve as guarantors of our obligations to the CME, the customer agreements contain broad termination provisions that are not specifically dependent on ratings. 

As of September 30, 2024, 12.7 billion notional of our derivatives portfolio was in bilateral over-the-counter derivative transactions pursuant to which we have posted aggregate independent amounts of 518 million and are holding collateral from counterparties in the amount of 25 million.

 Investment income for other invested assets includes amortization of terminated cash flow hedges, which have no corresponding book value within the yield calculation. Yields are based on net investment income as reported under U.S. GAAP and are consistent with how we measure our investment performance for management purposes. Yields are annualized, for interim periods, and

are calculated as net investment income as a percentage of average quarterly asset carrying values except for fixed maturity securities, derivatives and derivative counterparty collateral, which exclude unrealized fair value adjustments. For the three months ended September 30, 2024, gross annualized weighted-average investment yields decreased primarily driven by lower net investment income on lower average invested assets. Net investment income for the three months ended September 30, 2024 decreased largely from lower yields on a large block of policy loans in our corporate-owned life insurance products. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, gross annualized weighted-average investment yields increased from lower average invested assets.

Three Months Ended September 30, 2024 Compared to Three Months Ended September 30, 2023 

We recorded 41 million of higher net unrealized gains on limited partnerships in the current year driven by more favorable private equity market performance. We also recorded net unrealized gains on equity securities of 22 million in the current year driven by favorable equity market performance compared to net unrealized losses of 12 million in the prior year from unfavorable performance. 

We had 10 million of net investment gains related to derivatives in the current year compared to 28 million of net investment losses in the prior year primarily attributable to gains from forward bond purchase commitments in the current year compared to losses in the prior year. Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 Compared to Nine Months Ended September 30, 2023 

We recorded 10 million of lower net realized losses related to the sale of available-for-sale fixed maturity securities in the current year. The prior year included net losses on sales related to portfolio repositioning and liquidity management, as well as reducing regional bank exposure, including a 15 million loss related to the sale of First Republic Bank U.S. corporate bonds.

We recorded 46 million of higher net unrealized gains on equity securities in the current year driven by more favorable equity market performance. The current year also included 8 million of lower net unrealized gains on limited partnerships driven by less favorable private equity market performance. 

We had 3 million of net investment gains related to derivatives in the current year compared to 17 million of net investment losses in the prior year primarily attributable to lower losses from forward bond purchase commitments.

For a discussion of the change in cash, cash equivalents and invested assets, see the comparison for these line items under Consolidated Balance Sheets. See note 4 in our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements under Item 1 Financial Statements for additional information related to our investment portfolio. We hold fixed maturity and equity securities, limited partnerships, derivatives, embedded derivatives and certain other financial instruments, which are carried at fair value. Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. As of September 30, 2024, approximately 6 of our investment holdings recorded at fair value was based on significant inputs that were not market observable and were classified as Level 3 measurements.

Bank loan investments increased from funding of additional investments, partially offset by principal repayments. Derivatives increased largely from a decrease in current market rates compared to contracted notional interest rates, as well as favorable equity market performance in the current year. Short-term investments decreased from net maturities and sales in the current year. Derivatives The activity associated with derivative instruments can generally be measured by the change in notional value over the periods presented. However, for fixed indexed annuity and indexed universal life embedded derivatives, the change between periods is best illustrated by the number of policies.

 The increase in the notional value of derivatives was primarily attributable to the addition of forward bond purchase commitments that support our long-term care insurance business and universal life insurance products, partially offset by a decrease in interest rate swaps that support our long-term care insurance business. The number of policies with embedded derivatives decreased as these products are no longer being offered and continue to runoff. Consolidated Balance Sheets Total assets . Total assets decreased 57 million from 90,817 million as of December 31, 2023 to 90,760 million as of September 30, 2024. 

Invested assets increased 769 million primarily attributable to increases of 561 million in fixed maturity securities, 279 million in limited partnerships and 96 million in policy loans, partially offset 
 124 

Table of Contents 

by a decrease of 270 million in commercial mortgage loans. The increase in fixed maturity securities was predominantly related to tightening credit spreads and lower interest rates increasing the fair value of our fixed maturity investment portfolio, partially offset by net sales and maturities in the current year. Limited partnerships increased largely from capital calls, and policy loans increased primarily due to loan advances outpacing payoffs in our corporate-owned life insurance products in the current year. Commercial mortgage loans decreased mostly due to payments outpacing originations. 

Cash and cash equivalents decreased 158 million largely due to net withdrawals from our investment contracts and repurchases of Genworth Financial s common stock, partially offset by net sales and maturities of fixed maturity securities in the current year. 

Deferred acquisition costs decreased 157 million largely driven by amortization in our life and long-term care insurance products in the current year. 

Reinsurance recoverable decreased 426 million primarily due to runoff of certain ceded products. 

Deferred tax asset decreased 106 million principally from a decrease in net unrealized losses on investments and derivatives, partially offset by an increase related to insurance reserves in the current year. 

Separate account assets (and liabilities) increased 114 million primarily due to favorable equity market performance, partially offset by surrenders, withdrawals and benefit payments in the current year. Total liabilities . Total liabilities decreased 977 million from 82,482 million as of December 31, 2023 to 81,505 million as of September 30, 2024. 

The liability for future policy benefits decreased 352 million primarily from the runoff of our fixed annuity and life insurance products, partially offset by an increase in our long-term care insurance products. The increase in our long-term care insurance products was largely driven by aging of the in-force block, including higher interest accretion, partially offset by benefit payments outpacing premiums collected in the current year. 

Policyholder account balances decreased 676 million largely driven by surrenders, withdrawals and benefit payments in our fixed annuity and universal and term universal life insurance products in the current year. Total equity . Total equity increased 920 million from 8,335 million as of December 31, 2023 to 9,255 million as of September 30, 2024. 

We reported net income available to Genworth Financial, Inc. s common stockholders of 300 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 

Unrealized gains (losses) on investments increased equity by 725 million primarily due to tightening credit spreads and a decrease in interest rates in the current year. 

Derivatives qualifying as hedges decreased total equity by 139 million largely due to amortization of forward starting swap gains into net investment income. 

Treasury stock increased 136 million due to the repurchase of Genworth Financial s common stock, at cost, including excise taxes and other costs paid in connection with acquiring the shares, resulting in a decrease to total equity in the current year. Liquidity and Capital Resources Liquidity and capital resources represent our overall financial strength and our ability to generate cash flows from our businesses, borrow funds at competitive rates and raise new capital to meet our operating and growth needs.

Table of Contents 

Overview of cash flows Genworth and subsidiaries Our principal sources of cash include sales of our products and services, income from our investment portfolio and proceeds from sales and maturities of investments. Cash flows related to operating activities are affected by the timing of premiums, fees and investment income received and benefits, claims and expenses paid. Cash flows from operating activities have been invested to support the obligations of our insurance and investment products and required capital supporting these products. In analyzing our cash flows, we focus on the change in the amount of cash available and used in investing activities. Changes in cash from financing activities primarily relate to deposits to, and redemptions and benefit payments on, universal life insurance and investment contracts; the issuance of debt and equity securities; the repayment or repurchase of borrowings; the repurchase of common stock presented as treasury stock; and other capital transactions. The following table sets forth our unaudited condensed consolidated cash flows for the nine months ended September 30:

Net cash inflows from operating activities were lower in the current year primarily driven by higher benefit payments, including settlement payments, and lower premiums collected in our long-term care insurance business. Net cash inflows from investing activities were lower in the current year mainly due to lower net sales and maturities of fixed maturity securities, partially offset by lower capital calls on limited partnerships and commercial mortgage loan payments outpacing originations at a higher pace. Net cash outflows related to financing activities were lower in the current year primarily due to lower net withdrawals from our investment contracts and lower repurchases of Genworth Financial s common stock, partially offset by higher repurchases of Genworth Holdings debt and expenses associated with Enact Holdings early debt redemption and issuance of new debt. Genworth holding company liquidity In consideration of our liquidity, it is important to separate the needs of our holding companies from the needs of their respective subsidiaries. Genworth Financial and Genworth Holdings each act as a holding company for their respective subsidiaries and do not have any significant operations of their own. Genworth Financial s and Genworth Holdings principal sources of cash are derived from dividends and other returns of capital from Enact Holdings. Additional sources of cash have included subsidiary payments to them under tax sharing and expense reimbursement arrangements and proceeds from borrowings or securities issuances. The primary uses of funds at Genworth Financial and Genworth Holdings include payments of principal, interest and other expenses on borrowings or other obligations, payment of holding company general operating expenses (including employee benefits and taxes), payments under guarantees (including guarantees of certain subsidiary obligations), payments to subsidiaries (or, in the case of Genworth Holdings, to Genworth Financial) under tax sharing agreements, investments in CareScout, repurchases of debt securities, repurchases of Genworth Financial s common stock and, in the case of Genworth Holdings, loans, dividends or other distributions to Genworth Financial. Management s focus is predominantly on Genworth Holdings liquidity given it is the issuer of our outstanding public debt. We manage our legacy life insurance subsidiaries on a standalone basis and accordingly, 
 126 

Table of Contents 

do not expect to receive any dividends or other returns of capital from them. Therefore, our liquidity at the holding company level is highly dependent on the performance of Enact Holdings and its ability to pay timely dividends and other forms of capital returns to Genworth Holdings as anticipated. Genworth Financial has the right to appoint a majority of directors to the board of directors of Enact Holdings; however, actions taken by Enact Holdings and its board of directors are subject to and may be limited by the interests of Enact Holdings, including but not limited to, its use of capital for growth opportunities and regulatory requirements. Future dividends will be subject to quarterly review and approval by Enact Holdings board of directors and Genworth Financial and will also be dependent on a variety of economic, market and business conditions, among other considerations. In addition, insurance laws and regulations regulate the payment of dividends and other distributions to Genworth Financial and Genworth Holdings by their insurance subsidiaries. In addition to its quarterly cash dividend program, on August 1, 2023, Enact Holdings announced the approval by its board of directors of a share repurchase program under which Enact Holdings could repurchase up to 100 million of its outstanding common stock. On May 1, 2024, Enact Holdings announced a new share repurchase authorization of 250 million. Genworth Holdings has agreed to participate in order to maintain its overall ownership at approximately its current level. The timing and number of future shares repurchased under the share repurchase program will depend on a variety of factors, including Enact Holdings stock price, capital availability, business and market conditions, regulatory requirements and debt covenant restrictions, among other factors. As the majority shareholder, Genworth Holdings received 205 million of capital returns from Enact Holdings during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. Enact Holdings capital allocation strategy includes supporting its existing policyholders, growing its mortgage insurance business, funding attractive new business opportunities and returning capital to its shareholders. Based on Genworth Financial s ownership of approximately 81 of Enact Holdings, we expect to receive capital returns from Enact Holdings at the higher end of our previously anticipated range of 245 million to 285 million for the full year 2024. The total amount and form of capital returns will be based on Enact Holdings capital allocation strategy as well as its view of the prevailing and prospective macroeconomic conditions, regulatory landscape and business performance. On July 31, 2023, Genworth Financial s Board of Directors authorized an additional 350 million of share repurchases under its existing share repurchase program that began in May 2022. Pursuant to the program, during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, Genworth Financial repurchased 21,551,602 shares of its common stock at an average price of 6.26 per share for a total of 135 million before excise taxes and other costs. Genworth Financial also authorized repurchases under its share repurchase program through a Rule 10b5-1 trading plan under which 1,401,753 shares of its common stock were repurchased in October 2024 at an average price of 6.84 per share, leaving approximately 197 million available for repurchase under the program as of October 31, 2024. Further repurchases under the program will continue to be funded from holding company capital, as well as future cash flow generation, including expected future capital returns from Enact Holdings. Under the program, share repurchases may be made at Genworth s discretion from time to time in open market transactions, privately negotiated transactions, or by other means, including through Rule 10b5-1 trading plans. The timing and number of future shares repurchased under the program will depend on a variety of factors, including Genworth Financial s stock price and trading volume, and general business and market conditions, among other factors. The authorization has no expiration date and may be modified, suspended or terminated at any time. Our future use of liquidity and capital will prioritize future strategic investments in CareScout and returning capital to Genworth Financial s shareholders through share repurchases. In addition, we also expect to continue to repurchase or redeem outstanding debt from time to time (with cash on hand, proceeds from the issuance of new debt and/or the proceeds from asset or stock sales) in open market purchases, tender offers, privately negotiated transactions or otherwise. Genworth Holdings had 369 million and 350 million of unrestricted cash and cash equivalents as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. The increase was principally driven by capital returns 
 127 

Table of Contents 

from Enact Holdings, partially offset by repurchases of Genworth Financial s common stock and interest payments on Genworth Holdings debt. The 369 million of Genworth Holdings cash and cash equivalents includes approximately 162 million of advance cash payments from our subsidiaries held for future obligations. We do not consider this cash when evaluating holding company liquidity for the purposes of allocating capital or computing our cash position relative to the cash management target discussed below. We believe Genworth Holdings unrestricted cash and cash equivalents provide sufficient liquidity to meet its financial obligations over the next twelve months. We expect Genworth Holdings liquidity to continue to be impacted by the amounts and timing of Genworth Financial s share repurchases as well as future dividends and other forms of capital returns from Enact Holdings. In addition, the amount of intercompany cash tax payments retained by Genworth Holdings from its subsidiaries will be lower in 2024 and thereafter as compared to the amounts retained during recent prior years based on our projection of current taxable income and the utilization of our remaining foreign tax credits. We actively monitor our liquidity position (most notably at Genworth Holdings), liquidity generation options and the credit markets given changing market conditions. Genworth Holdings cash management target is to maintain a cash buffer of two times expected annual external debt interest payments. Genworth Holdings may move below or above this targeted cash buffer during any given quarter due to the timing of cash outflows and inflows or as a result of planned future actions. Management of Genworth Financial continues to evaluate Genworth Holdings target level of liquidity as circumstances warrant. Capital resources and financing activities Our current capital resource plans do not include any additional debt offerings by Genworth Holdings or minority sales of Enact Holdings. The availability of additional capital resources will depend on a variety of factors such as market conditions, regulatory considerations, the general availability of credit, credit ratings and the performance of and outlook for Enact Holdings and the payment of dividends and other returns of capital therefrom. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, Genworth Holdings repurchased 6 million and 29 million principal of its 6.50 senior notes due in 2034 and its floating rate junior subordinated notes due in 2066 2066 Notes ), respectively, for a pre-tax gain of 5 million and paid accrued interest thereon. As of September 30, 2024, Genworth Holdings had 821 million aggregate principal amount of outstanding debt, with no maturities due until June 2034. Given the current interest rate environment, during the third quarter of 2024, Genworth Holdings entered into interest rate swaps designed to hedge the variable interest payments on 100 million aggregate principal amount of its 2066 Notes, locking in an approximate 5.5 fixed rate. In connection with the hedge agreement, Genworth Financial provided an unconditional guarantee to the counterparty, covering the obligations associated with the hedge transaction. On May 28, 2024, Enact Holdings issued 750 million aggregate principal amount of unsecured senior notes, maturing on May 28, 2029 2029 Notes ). The 2029 Notes bear interest at an annual rate of 6.25 , payable semi-annually in arrears on May 28 and November 28 of each year, commencing on November 28, 2024. On June 3, 2024, Enact Holdings redeemed all of its 750 million 2025 Notes for a pre-tax loss of 11 million. Enact Holdings funded the redemption primarily through the net proceeds from the issuance of its 2029 Notes. For additional information on Enact Holdings debt, see note 14 in our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements under Item 1 Financial Statements. Regulated insurance subsidiaries The liquidity requirements of our regulated insurance subsidiaries principally relate to the liabilities associated with their various insurance and investment products, operating costs and expenses, the payment of dividends to us, contributions to their subsidiaries, payments of principal and interest on their outstanding debt obligations and income taxes. Liabilities arising from insurance and investment products include the payment of 
 128 

Table of Contents 

benefits and claims, as well as cash payments in connection with policy surrenders and withdrawals, policy loans and obligations to redeem funding agreements. Our insurance subsidiaries principal cash inflows from operating activities are derived from premiums, annuity deposits and insurance and investment product fees and other income, including commissions, cost of insurance, mortality, expense and surrender charges, contract underwriting fees, investment management fees, investment income and dividends and distributions from their subsidiaries. We manage our legacy life insurance subsidiaries on a standalone basis. Accordingly, these subsidiaries will continue to rely on their statutory capital, significant reserves, prudent management of the in-force blocks and long-term care insurance in-force rate actions to satisfy policyholder obligations. Given the challenging macroeconomic environment in 2023 and through the third quarter of 2024, employee costs have increased driven in part by wage inflation, the competitive labor market and low labor participation. Additionally, in our long-term care insurance business, we have observed an increase in the cost of care due in part to elevated inflation. These inflationary pressures have not had a significant impact on our liquidity to date; however, if these conditions persist, they could have a material adverse impact on our liquidity, results of operations and financial condition. We will continue to monitor macroeconomic trends, including inflation, to help mitigate any potential adverse impacts to our liquidity. We also expect overall claim costs to continue to increase over time in our long-term care insurance business as our blocks age, with peak claim years over a decade away. Our insurance subsidiaries maintain investment strategies intended to provide adequate funds to pay benefits without forced sales of investments. Products having liabilities with longer durations, such as certain life insurance and long-term care insurance policies, are typically matched with investments having similar duration such as long-term fixed maturity securities and commercial mortgage loans. Shorter-term liabilities are typically matched with fixed maturity securities that have short- and medium-term fixed maturities. In addition, our insurance subsidiaries hold highly liquid, high quality short-term investment securities and other liquid investment grade fixed maturity securities to fund anticipated operating expenses, surrenders and withdrawals. As of September 30, 2024, our total cash, cash equivalents and invested assets were 62.6 billion. Our investments in privately placed fixed maturity securities, commercial mortgage loans, policy loans, bank loans, limited partnership investments and select mortgage-backed and asset-backed securities are relatively illiquid. These asset classes represented approximately 44 of the carrying value of our total cash, cash equivalents and invested assets as of September 30, 2024. Off-balance sheet commitments, guarantees and contractual obligations As of September 30, 2024, we were committed to fund 1,638 million in limited partnership investments, 271 million in private placement investments and 131 million of bank loan investments. Except as disclosed above, as of September 30, 2024, there have been no material additions or changes to guarantees provided by Genworth Financial and Genworth Holdings or to our contractual obligations as compared to the amounts disclosed within our 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K filed on February 29, 2024. Supplemental Condensed Consolidating Financial Information Genworth Financial provides a full and unconditional guarantee to the trustee and holders of Genworth Holdings outstanding senior and subordinated notes (registered securities under the Securities Act of 1933), on an unsecured unsubordinated and subordinated basis, respectively, of the full and punctual payment of the principal of, premium, if any and interest on, and all other amounts payable under, the outstanding senior and subordinated notes and their respective indentures. Genworth Holdings is a direct, 100 owned subsidiary of Genworth Financial. Excluding investments in subsidiaries, the assets, liabilities and results of operations of Genworth Financial and Genworth Holdings, on a combined basis, are not material to the consolidated financial position or the 
 129 

Table of Contents 

consolidated results of operations of Genworth. In addition, none of Genworth Financial s direct or indirect subsidiaries, other than Genworth Holdings, are issuers or guarantors of any guaranteed securities. Therefore, in accordance with Rule 13-01 of Regulation S-X, we are permitted, and we elected, to exclude the summarized financial information for both the issuer and guarantor of the registered securities. 

Item 3. 
 Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk Market risk is the risk of the loss of fair value resulting from adverse changes in market rates and prices, such as interest rates, equity prices and foreign currency exchange rates. Market risk is directly influenced by the volatility and liquidity in the markets in which the related underlying financial instruments are traded. There were no material changes in our market risks since December 31, 2023.
