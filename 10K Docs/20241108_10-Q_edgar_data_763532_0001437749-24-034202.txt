NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 

 (Unaudited) 

On occasion, the Company enters into bill-and-hold arrangements on a limited basis. Each bill-and-hold arrangement is reviewed and revenue is recognized only when certain criteria have been met: (1) the customer has requested delayed delivery and storage of the products by the Company because the customer wants to secure a supply of the products but lacks storage space; (ii) the risk of ownership has passed to the customer; (iii) the products are segregated from the Company s other inventory items held for sale; (iv) the products are ready for shipment to the customer; and (v) the Company does not have the ability to use the products or direct them to another customer. 

Disaggregation of Revenue 

The Company disaggregates the revenue from contracts with customers by the timing of revenue recognition because the Company believes it best depicts the nature, amount, and timing of its revenue and cash flows. The table below presents a reconciliation of the disaggregation by reportable segments: 

Products and services transferred over time 

Type of Product and Services 

LED lighting, digital signage solutions, electronic circuit boards 

Poles and other display solutions elements 

Project management, installation services, shipping and handling 

Products and services transferred over time 

Type of Product and Services 

LED lighting, digital signage solutions, electronic circuit boards 

Poles and other display solutions elements 

Project management, installation services, shipping and handling 

Practical Expedients and Exemptions 

The Company s contracts with customers have an expected duration of one year or less, as such, the Company applies the practical expedient to expense sales commissions as incurred and has omitted disclosures on the amount of remaining performance obligations. 

Shipping costs that are not material in context of the delivery of products are expensed as incurred. 

The Company s accounts receivable balance represents the Company s unconditional right to receive payment from its customers with contracts. Payments are generally due within 30 to 90 days of completion of the performance obligation and invoicing; therefore, payments do not contain significant financing components. 

The Company collects sales tax and other taxes concurrent with revenue-producing activities which are excluded from revenue. Shipping and handling costs are treated as fulfillment activities and included in cost of products and services sold on the Consolidated Statements of Operations. 

million, of which million of the purchase price was retained pending a review of the acquired working capital. In the first quarter of fiscal 2025, the company funded an additional related to the final settlement of the acquired working capital. The Company incurred acquisition-related costs totaling million which are included in the selling and administrative expense line of the consolidated statements of operations. The acquisition of EMI is expected to increase the Company s total addressable markets within the grocery, quick service restaurant and convenience store verticals. The Company funded the acquisition totaling million with a combination of cash on hand and from the million revolving line of credit. 

The Company accounted for this transaction as a business combination. The Company has preliminarily allocated the purchase price of approximately million which includes an estimate of customary post-closing purchase price adjustments to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed at estimated fair values, and the excess of the purchase price over the aggregate fair values is recorded as goodwill. This preliminary allocation is subject to the final determination of the purchase price which will be finalized in fiscal 2025, as well as the potential revision resulting from the finalization of pre-acquisition tax filings. The preliminary allocation of the purchase consideration to the fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed as of April 18, 2024, is as follows: 

Inventory 

Property, Plant and Equipment 

Operating Lease Right-Of-Use Assets 

Other Assets 

Intangible Assets 

Accounts Payable 

Accrued Expenses 

Operating Lease Liabilities 

Identifiable Assets 

Goodwill 

Net Purchase Consideration 

The gross amount of accounts receivable acquired was million. 

Goodwill recorded from the acquisition of EMI is attributable to the impact of the positive cash flow from EMI in addition to expected synergies from the business combination. The goodwill resulting from the acquisition is deductible for tax purposes. The trade name and technology used an income (relief from royalty) approach, the non-compete used an income (with or without) approach, and the customer relationships used an income (excess earnings) approach. The following table presents the details of the intangible assets acquired at the date of acquisition: 

Indefinite life 

Technology assets 

Non-compete 

Customer relationships 

EMI s post-acquisition results of operations for the period from April 18, 2024, through June 30, 2024, are included in the Company s Consolidated Statements of Operations. Since the acquisition date, net sales of EMI for the period from April 18, 2024, through June 30, 2024, were million and operating income was million. The operating results of EMI are included in the Display Solutions Segment. 

Pro Forma Impact of the Acquisition of EMI (Unaudited) 

The following table represents unaudited pro forma results of operations and gives effect to the acquisition of EMI as if the transaction had occurred on July 1, 2022. The unaudited pro forma results of operations have been prepared for comparative purposes only and are not necessarily indicative of what would have occurred had the business combination been completed at the beginning of the period or the results that may occur in the future. Furthermore, the unaudited pro forma financial information does not reflect the impact of any synergies or operating efficiencies resulting from the acquisition of EMI . 

The unaudited pro forma financial information for the twelve months ended June 30, 2024, and June 30, 2023, is prepared using the acquisition method of accounting and has been adjusted to reflect the pro forma events that are: (1) directly attributable to the acquisition; (2) factually supportable; and (3) expected to have a continuing impact on the combined results. The fiscal 2024 unaudited pro forma operating income of million excludes acquisition-related expenses of million.

In September 2021, the Company amended its existing million secured line of credit, to a million term loan and million remaining as a secured revolving line of credit. Both facilities expire in the third quarter of fiscal 2026. The principal of the term loan is repaid annually in the amount of million over a five -year period with a balloon payment of the remaining balance due on the last month. Interest on both the revolving line of credit and the term loan is charged based upon an increment over the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR) or a base rate, at the Company s option. The base rate is calculated as the highest of (a) the Prime rate, (b) the sum of the Overnight Funding Rate plus basis points and (c) the sum of the Daily SOFR Rate plus basis points. The increment over the SOFR borrowing rate fluctuates between and basis points, and the increment over the Base Rate fluctuates between and basis points, both of which depend upon the ratio of indebtedness to earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization EBITDA ), as defined in the line of credit agreement. As of September 30, 2024, the Company s borrowing rate against its revolving line of credit was . The increment over the SOFR borrowing rate will be basis points for the second quarter of fiscal 2025. The fee on the unused balance of the million committed line of credit fluctuates between and basis points. Under the terms of this line of credit, the Company is required to comply with financial covenants that limit the ratio of indebtedness to EBITDA and require a minimum fixed charge ratio. As of September 30, 2024, there was million available for borrowing under the million line of credit. 

The Company is in compliance with all of its loan covenants as of September 30, 2024.

Dividends on restricted stock units in the amount of million and million were accrued as of both September 30, 2024, and 2023, respectively. These dividends will be paid upon the vesting of the restricted stock units when shares are issued to the award recipients. In November 2024, the Board of Directors declared a regular quarterly cash dividend of per share payable , to shareholders of record as of . The indicated annual cash dividend rate is per share. 

and removed the Plan's fungible share counting feature. The purpose of the 2019 Omnibus Plan is to provide a means to attract and retain key personnel and to align the interests of the directors, officers, and employees with the Company's shareholders. The plan also provides a vehicle whereby directors and officers may acquire shares in order to meet the ownership requirements under the Company's Stock Ownership Policy. The 2019 Omnibus Plan allows for the grant of stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock awards, restricted stock units RSUs, performance stock units ("PSUs") and other awards. Except for Restricted Stock Unit ("RSU") grants which are time-based, participants in the Company's Long-Term Equity Compensation Plans are awarded the opportunity to acquire shares over a three -year performance measurement period tied to specific company performance metrics. The number of shares that remain reserved for issuance under the 2019 Omnibus Plan is as of September 30, 2024. 

In the three months ended September 30, 2024, the Company granted PSUs and RSUs, both with a weighted average market value of . Stock compensation expense was million and million for both the three months ended September 30, 2024, and 2023, respectively.

Employees may participate at their discretion and are able to purchase, through payroll deduction, common stock at a discount on a quarterly basis. Employees may end their participation at any time during the offering period, and participation ends automatically upon termination of employment with the company. During fiscal year 2025, employees purchased shares. At September 30, 2024, shares remained available for purchase under the ESPP.

The Company has periodically entered into short-term operating leases with an initial term of twelve months or less. The Company elected not to record these leases on the balance sheet. The rent expense for these leases was immaterial for September 30, 2024, and 2023. 

The Company has certain leases that contain lease and non-lease components and has elected to utilize the practical expedient to account for these components together as a single lease component. 

Lease expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term. The Company used its incremental borrowing rate when determining the present value of lease payments.

Net sales of 138.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, increased 12 as compared to net sales of 123.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. Lighting segment net sales of 58.4 million decreased 14 compared to prior year quarter net sales of 67.6 million. The decline in Lighting segment sales can be attributed to lower large project activity resulting from the lengthening of the conversion period for these large projects, and overall lower non-residential construction activity. Sales growth in the Refueling and Parking market verticals was offset by declines in Warehouse and other large project applications. Net sales in the Display Solutions segment of 79.7 million increased 43 compared to the same quarter last year sales of 55.8 million. The increase in net sales in the Display Solutions segment is the net result of 26.2 million in sales from the acquisition of EMI partially offset by the delayed timing of orders within the Grocery vertical.

Operating income of 9.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, represents a 17 decrease from operating income of 11.0 million in the three months ended September 30, 2023. Adjusted operating income, a Non-GAAP measure, was 11.9 million in the three months ended September 30, 2024, represents a 14 decline compared to 13.9 million in the three months ended September 30, 2023. Refer to Non-GAAP Financial Measures below for a reconciliation of Non-GAAP financial measures to U.S. GAAP measures. The decrease in operating income is the net result of a decrease in sales in the Lighting segment partially offset by an increase in sales in the Display Solutions segment which yield lower margins as a result of product mix. 

Non-GAAP Financial Measures 

This report includes adjustments to GAAP operating income, net income, and earnings per share for the three months ended September 30, 2024, and 2023. Operating income, net income, and earnings per share, which exclude the impact of long-term performance based compensation expense, the amortization expense of acquired intangible assets, commercial growth opportunity expense, acquisition costs, the lease expense on the step-up basis of acquired leases, and restructuring and severance costs, are non-GAAP financial measures. We further note that while the amortization expense of acquired intangible assets is excluded from the non-GAAP financial measures, the revenue of the acquired companies is included in the measures and the acquired assets contribute to the generation of revenue. We believe these non-GAAP measures will provide increased transparency to our core operating performance of the business. Also included in this report are non-GAAP financial measures, including Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization (EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA), Net Debt to Adjusted EBITDA, and Free Cash Flow. We believe that these are useful as supplemental measures in assessing the operating performance of our business. These measures are used by our management, including our chief operating decision maker, to evaluate business results, and are frequently referenced by those who follow the Company. These non-GAAP measures may be different from non-GAAP measures used by other companies. In addition, the non-GAAP measures are not based on any comprehensive set of accounting rules or principles. Non-GAAP measures have limitations, in that they do not reflect all amounts associated with our results as determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Therefore, these measures should be used only to evaluate our results in conjunction with corresponding GAAP measures. Below is a reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures to net income and earnings per share reported for the periods indicated along with the calculation of EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Free Cash Flow, and Net Debt to Adjusted EBITDA.

Display Solutions Segment net sales of 79.7 million in the three months ended September 30, 2024 increased 43 from net sales of 55.8 million in the same period in fiscal 2024. The increase in net sales in the Display Solutions segment is the net result of 26.2 million in sales from the acquisition of EMI partially offset by the timing of orders within the Grocery vertical. 

Gross profit of 15.0 million in the three months ended September 30, 2024 increased 13 from the same period of fiscal 2024. Gross profit as a percentage of net sales in the three months ended September 30, 2024 decreased to 19 from 24 in the same period of fiscal 2024 impacted by product and vertical market mix. The Company continues to maintain favorable program pricing and prudent cost management.

Lighting Segment net sales of 58.4 million in the three months ended September 30, 2024, decreased 14 compared to net sales of 67.6 million in the same period in fiscal 2024. The decline in Lighting segment sales can be attributed to lower large project activity resulting from the lengthening of the conversion period for these large projects, and overall lower non-residential construction activity. Sales growth in the Refueling and Parking market verticals was offset by declines in Warehouse and other large project applications. 

Gross profit of 18.6 million in the three months ended September 30, 2024 decreased 20 from the same period of fiscal 2023. The decline in gross profit is attributed to the decline in sales. While overall demand levels were lower in the fiscal first quarter, selling prices and material input costs remain stable. 

Operating expenses of 12.9 million in the three months ended September 30, 2024 decreased 11 from the same period of fiscal 2024, driven mostly by lower commission expense from lower sales, and effective cost management. 

Lighting Segment operating income of 5.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 decreased 34 from operating income of 8.8 million in the same period of fiscal 2024 primarily driven by decreased net sales.

Operating expenses of 4.3 million in the three months ended September 30, 2024, decreased 12 from the same period of fiscal 2024. The decrease was primarily the result of cost containment initiatives across several of the Company s cost categories. 

Consolidated Results 

The Company reported 0.9 million and 0.6 million of net interest expense in the three months ended September 30, 2024, and September 30, 2023, respectively. The increase in interest expense is the result of the funds borrowed to acquire EMI Industries, LLC in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024 partially offset by decreased borrowing costs. The Company also recorded other income of 0.1) million and 0.1 million of other expense in the three months ended September 30, 2024, and September 30, 2023, respectively, both of which is related to net foreign exchange currency transaction gains and losses through the Company s Mexican and Canadian subsidiaries. 

The 1.6 million of income tax expense in the three months ended September 30, 2024 represents a consolidated effective tax rate of 19.6 . The 2.3 million of income tax expense in the three months ended September 30, 2023 represents a consolidated effective tax rate of 22.6 . Impacting the effective tax rate of both reported periods was the favorable tax treatment of the Company s long-term performance based compensation. 

The Company reported net income of 6.7 million in the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to net income of 8.0 million in the three months ended September 30, 2023. Non-GAAP adjusted net income was 8.0 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to adjusted net income of 9.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023 (Refer to the Non-GAAP tables above). The decrease in Non-GAAP adjusted net income is primarily the net result of an increase in net sales offset by the profit margin impact of product mix. Diluted adjusted earnings per share of 0.22 was reported in the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 0.27 diluted adjusted earnings per share in the same period of fiscal 2024. The weighted average common shares outstanding for purposes of computing diluted earnings per share in the three months ended September 30, 2024 were 30,530,000 shares compared to 29,955,000 shares in the same period last year.

Liquidity and Capital Resources 

The Company considers its level of cash on hand, borrowing capacity, current ratio and working capital levels to be its most important measures of short-term liquidity. For long-term liquidity indicators, the Company believes its ratio of long-term debt to equity and our historical levels of net cash flows from operating activities to be the most important measures. 

At September 30, 2024, the Company had working capital of 86.8 million compared to 83.3 million at June 30, 2024. The ratio of current assets to current liabilities was 2.1 to 1 for both September 30, 2024, and June 30, 2024. The increase in working capital from June 30, 2024, to September 30, 2024, is primarily driven by a 2.1 million increase in net accounts receivable and a 2.9 million increase in cash partially offset by a 0.7 million decrease in refundable income taxes and a 0.9 million increase in current liabilities. 

Net accounts receivable was 80.7 million and 78.6 million at September 30, 2024, and June 30, 2024, respectively. DSO decreased to 54 days at September 30, 2024, from 58 days at June 30, 2024. 

Net inventories of 71.3 million at September 30, 2024, increased 0.4 million from 70.9 million at June 30, 2024. Lighting Segment net inventory decreased 1.1 million whereas net inventory in the Display Solutions Segment increased 1.5 million to support the growth in backlog resulting from an increase program activity. 

Cash generated from operations and borrowing capacity under the Company s line of credit is its primary source of liquidity. The Company has a 25 million term loan and 75 million remaining in a secured revolving line of credit. Both facilities expire in the third quarter of fiscal 2026. As of September 30, 2024, 41.6 million of the credit line was available. The Company is in compliance with all of its loan covenants. The 100 million credit facility plus cash flows from operating activities are adequate for operational and capital expenditure needs for the remainder of fiscal 2025. 

The Company generated 11.8 million of cash from operating activities in the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 10.6 million of cash generated from operating activities in the same period in fiscal 2024. The Company continues to effectively manage its working capital while generating increasing cash flow from earnings in both fiscal years, resulting in strong cash flow from operations. 

The Company used 0.8 million and 1.4 million of cash related to investing activities in the three months ended September 30, 2024, and September 30, 2023, respectively. The Company continues to invest in equipment and tooling to support sales growth. 

The Company had a net use of cash of 8.1 million and 7.4 million related to financing activities in the three months ended September 30, 2024, and September 30, 2023, respectively. The Company continues to generate positive cash flow from its operations in order to pay down its debt and fund its dividend payments to shareholders. 

The Company has on its balance sheet financial instruments consisting primarily of cash and cash equivalents, revolving lines of credit, and long-term debt. The fair value of these financial instruments approximates carrying value because of their short-term maturity and/or variable, market-driven interest rates. 

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 

The Company has no financial instruments with off-balance sheet risk and have no off-balance sheet arrangements. 

Cash Dividends 

In November 2024, the Board of Directors declared a regular quarterly cash dividend of 0.05 per share payable November 26, 2024, to shareholders of record as of November 18, 2024. The indicated annual cash dividend rate for fiscal 2025 is 0.20 per share. The Board of Directors has adopted a policy regarding dividends which indicates that dividends will be determined by the Board of Directors in its discretion based upon its evaluation of earnings, cash flow requirements, financial condition, debt levels, stock repurchases, future business developments and opportunities, and other factors deemed relevant.

LSI INDUSTRIES INC. 

FY25 LONG-TERM INCENTIVE PLAN 

Effective: August 14, 2024 

The LSI Industries Inc. Company 2019 Omnibus Plan authorizes the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors Compensation Committee to issue share-based incentive awards to Company Executives. The Fiscal Year 2024 Long Term Incentive Plan LTIP provides for grants to the Named Executive Officers NEOs ), and other employees of the Company designated by the Compensation Committee and the Chief Executive Officer CEO ). The employees receiving grants are collectively referred to as the Employees . 

The LTIP has been approved by the Compensation Committee as a retention tool to encourage Employees to maintain long-term employment with the Company. The LTIP provides for the issuance of three types of share-based awards: stock options, performance stock units and restricted stock units. All LTIP awards are granted effective the close of business on August 14, 2024 and at such other times and in such other manner as may be approved or authorized by the Compensation Committee. 

1. 

Stock Options . The Company may grant time-based stock option Stock Options awards to Employees. Stock Option awards have a ten-year exercise term; a three-year ratable vesting period; and a stated and fixed exercise price set by the Compensation Committee as the closing price of a share of Company common stock on the date of the grant. The form of Stock Option Agreement is set forth as Exhibit 1 hereto. 

2. 

Performance Stock Units . The Company may grant performance stock units PSUs to the Employees. The vesting of such PSUs is subject to the achievement of designated metrics for Return on Net Assets RONA and cumulative Adjusted Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization Adjusted EBITDA at the completion of the three-year performance period concluding on June 30, 2027 (FY27). The LTIP sets for a threshold (or minimum), target and maximum goals to be achieved in FY27 for each metric. If the threshold amount is not achieved for any performance metric, there shall be no payout under such metric. The grant made to the employee is the target number of PSUs. The actual number of PSUs at vesting may stretch to a greater amount than the target amount if greater than target performance is achieved; and may be less than the target number of PSUs if less than target performance is achieved. RONA achievement accounts for 50 of the vesting of the PSUs and Cumulative Adjusted EBITDA accounts for 50 of the vesting of the PSUs. The PSUs shall cliff vest at the completion of FY27 if the FY27 threshold, target or maximum is met pursuant to the matrix set forth in Section 2.1 below. The form of PSU Award Agreement is set forth as Exhibit 2 hereto. PSUs are settled in the Common Shares of the Company.

I. LTIP awards may be subject to assignment laws and other laws that require payment of the incentive award to an individual other than the grantee (such as IRS tax levies, child support arrearages, etc.). The Company will comply with all such applicable assignment laws. 

J. The LTIP does not create or imply the existence of a contract of employment. The Company reserves the right to amend, reduce, modify, interpret or discontinue all or part of the LTIP with or without reason as the Compensation Committee deems advisable in its sole and absolute discretion, subject to the terms and conditions of the 2019 Omnibus Plan and the terms and conditions of the grant documents.

In each such instance, the Company will, to the extent practicable, seek to recover from the officer the amount by which any performance-based awards paid to such officer for the relevant period exceeded the lower payment that would have been made based on the restated financial results.

M. The Company reserves the right to require each grantee to execute and deliver to the Company a non-compete / non-solicitation agreement, in the form satisfactory to Company, as a condition of the grant of any award or the payment of any amounts as may be due under the LTIP.
