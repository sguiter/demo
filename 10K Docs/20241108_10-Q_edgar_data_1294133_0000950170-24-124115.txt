 . On May 4, 2017, Inogen Europe Holding B.V. acquired all issued and outstanding capital stock of MedSupport Systems B.V. (MedSupport) and began operating under the name Inogen Europe B.V. The Company merged Inogen Europe Holding B.V. and Inogen Europe B.V. on December 28, 2018. Inogen Europe B.V. is the remaining legal entity. Inogen completed the acquisition of New Aera, Inc.

in cash consideration and the fair value of a potential earnout of based on future regulatory clearances. A potential earnout payment of either (without a clinical trial requirement) or (with a required clinical trial less related development costs) is dependent upon the achievement of one of two milestones related to U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) de novo authorization or 510(k) clearance for the Simeox Airway Clearance System within four years of the date of the closing of the transaction. The fair value of the earnout liability was measured using the probability weighted expected return methodology and was discounted using a rate and probability that appropriately captures the risk associated with the obligation. Assets and liabilities of the acquired company were recorded at their estimated fair values at the date of acquisition. The excess purchase price over the fair value of net tangible assets and identifiable intangible assets acquired has been allocated to goodwill. Goodwill represents the expected synergies with the existing business, the acquired assembled workforce, and future cash flows after the acquisition. The fair value assigned to the identifiable intangible assets was determined primarily by using the excess earnings method. The key assumptions included in the excess earnings method included revenue recognized, cost of revenue, and the discount rate. The purchase accounting for this acquisition has been finalized.

The number of shares of common stock reserved for issuance under the 2023 Plan was: (i) shares, plus (ii) (A) shares that, as of immediately before the termination or expiration of the 2014 Plan, had been reserved but not issued under any 2014 Plan awards and are not subject to any awards granted under the 2014 Plan, plus (B) any shares subject to awards granted under the 2014 Plan or the 2012 Plan that, after the 2014 Plan is terminated or expired, expire or otherwise terminate without having been exercised or issued in full or are forfeited to or repurchased by the Company due to failure to vest with the maximum number of shares that may be added to the 2023 Plan under subsection (ii) above equal to shares. As of September 30, 2024, awards with respect to shares of the Company's common stock were outstanding, and shares of common stock remained available for issuance under the 2023 Plan. The shares available for issuance under the 2023 Plan will be increased by any shares returned to the 2014 Plan as a result of expiration or termination of awards. Pursuant to the Nasdaq inducement grant exception, during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 , the Company issued shares of common stock to a certain new hire issuable upon (i) the vesting of a maximum of time-based restricted stock units granted, and (ii) the vesting of a maximum of shares of performance-based restricted stock units granted to induce the employee to accept employment with the Company in accordance with Nasdaq Listing Rule 5635(c)(4). Stock options Options expired from the date of grant and vest over terms.

Employee stock purchase plan The Company s 2014 Employee Stock Purchase Plan (ESPP) provides for the grant to all eligible employees an option to purchase stock under the ESPP, within the meaning Section 423 of the Internal Revenue Code. The ESPP permits participants to purchase common stock through payroll deductions of up to of their eligible compensation, which includes a participant s base straight time gross earnings, incentive compensation, bonuses, overtime, and shift premium, but exclusive of payments for equity compensation and other similar compensation. A participant may purchase a maximum of shares during a purchase period. Amounts deducted and accumulated by the participant are used to purchase shares of the Company s common stock at the end of each six-month period. The purchase price of the shares will be of the lower of the fair market value of the Company s common stock on the first trading day of each offering period or on the exercise date. The offering periods are currently approximately six months in length beginning on the first business day on or after March 1 and September 1 of each year and ending on the first business day on or after September 1 and March 1 approximately six months later. As of September 30, 2024 , a total of shares of common stock were available for sale pursuant to the ESPP. shares;

The contract with the customer states the final terms of the sale, including the description, quantity, and price of each product or service purchase. The decrease in deferred revenue related to lifetime warranties for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily driven by of revenue recognized that were included in the deferred revenue balances as of December 31, 2023 , partially offset by of payments received in advance of satisfying performance obligations. Deferred revenue related to lifetime warranties was and as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively, and is classified within deferred revenue - current and deferred revenue - noncurrent in the consolidated balance sheets.

Critical accounting policies and estimates 
 Our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America, or U.S. GAAP. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities, revenue and expenses at the date of the financial statements. Generally, we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions in accordance with U.S. GAAP that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from these estimates and such differences could be material to the financial position and results of operations. 
 Critical accounting policies and estimates are those that we consider the most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations because they require our most difficult, subjective or complex judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. Our critical accounting policies and estimates include those related to: 
 revenue recognition; 

acquisitions and related acquired intangible assets and goodwill; and 

long-lived asset impairment. 

There have been no material changes in our critical accounting policies and estimates in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to those disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, as filed with the SEC on March 1, 2024. 
 Recent accounting pronouncements 
 Information about recently adopted and proposed accounting pronouncements, if applicable, is included in Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report under the heading Recent Accounting Pronouncements and is incorporated herein by reference. 
 Macroeconomic environment 
 The global economy is experiencing increased inflationary pressures. The macroeconomic environment has had significant and potentially will continue to have unexpected adverse effects on businesses and healthcare institutions around the world and has and may continue to negatively impact our consolidated operating results. 
 We expect minimal inflated costs related to the acquisition of semiconductor chips to impact our cost of sales revenue throughout 2024. We incurred significant costs associated with acquiring chips on the open market and a portion of these costs increased our inventory given that these components were not yet in finished products that were sold during the period. 
 24 

We also have experienced, along with most other companies across many industries, the macroeconomic impact of a challenging employment environment related to hiring and retaining employees and wage inflation. We expect that these hiring, retention, and wage inflation challenges, as well as challenges related to maintaining our current workforce, will continue through 2024. These challenges may negatively affect our ability to grow our business and keep our best employees or increase our cost of operations. In response we have implemented more flexible workplace requirements for certain roles, including remote workplace opportunities, but we still expect to be challenged by the macroeconomic employment environment. 
 For additional information on risk factors that could impact our results, please refer to the sections entitled "Risk Factors" in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, our Annual Report on Form 10-K, and our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the calendar quarter ended March 31, 2024. 
 Overview 
 We are a medical technology company that primarily develops, manufactures, and markets innovative portable oxygen therapy solutions for patients with chronic respiratory conditions. Our leading portfolio of innovative POCs is optimized to deliver high output ratio-to-weight, meaningful sound suppression and among the longest run times in the industry so that we can meet the needs of patients across a variety of disease states. We are positioned in the market as both a medical technology company and as a home medical equipment provider that is accredited in all 50 states in the United States with a significant patient, prescriber and provider reach. Our products are sold internationally through distributors and medical equipment companies outside of the United States and through direct patient and prescriber sales, as well as resellers and home medical equipment companies in the United States. 
 We derive the majority of our revenue from the sale and rental of our Inogen One and Rove systems and related accessories to patients, insurance carriers, home healthcare providers, resellers, and distributors, including our private label partner. We sell multiple configurations of our Inogen One, Rove and Inogen At Home systems with various batteries, accessories, warranties, power cords, and language settings. Our goal is to design, build, and market oxygen solutions that redefine how long-term oxygen therapy is delivered. 
 To accomplish this goal, we intend to: 
 Optimize our domestic direct-to-consumer sales and prescriber sales teams and increase productivity. We have a continued focus on the prescriber sales force initiative, which markets directly to physicians through a consistent cadence of contact, gaining the prescription at initiation and maximizing the number of months of billing for long-term oxygen treatment. Also, as part of our growth plans, we expect to continue to expand sales and rental revenue capacity by focusing on increased productivity driven by improved sales management discipline, insights-informed tools, and optimized patient lead generation. 

Expand our domestic home medical equipment (HME) provider and reseller network. We have continued focus on our domestic business-to-business partnerships, including relationships with distributors, key accounts, resellers, our private label partner, and traditional HME providers. We offer patient-preferred, low total cost of ownership products to help providers convert their businesses to a non-delivery POC business model. 

Increase international business-to-business adoption. Although our main growth opportunity remains POC adoption in the United States given what we still believe is a relatively low penetration rate, we believe there is a sizable international market opportunity, particularly in Europe where there is existing oxygen reimbursement for respiratory conditions. In order to take advantage of these international markets, we have partnered with distributors who serve those markets and key customers in them. We additionally have an Inogen base of operations for sales and customer service in the Netherlands, and use a contract manufacturer, Foxconn, located in the Czech Republic to support the majority of our European sales volumes. 

Invest in our oxygen product offerings to develop innovative products and expand clinical evidence . We incurred 3.5 million and 4.5 million in the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and 15.7 million and 14.1 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, in research and development expenses, and we intend to continue to make such investments in the foreseeable future. 

We launched the Inogen Rove 6 TM , in December 2022 in the EU and UK. We have also received U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) 510(k) clearance for the Inogen Rove 4 TM , which we launched in October of this year. Inogen Rove 6 weighs 4.8 pounds and produces 1,260 ml per minute of oxygen output with very quiet operations at 37 dBA and long battery life at 6 hours and 15 minutes for a single battery and up to 12 hours and 45 minutes for a double battery, as well as improvements to provide ease-of-use and improvements to design in compliance to European Union medical device regulation (MDR) standards. The FDA clearance of Inogen Rove 6 was received June 30, 2023 and launched in the U.S. market in July 2023. Inogen Rove 4 weighs less than 3 pounds and delivers up to 840ml per minute of oxygen, in a lightweight user-friendly design. The product has three battery configurations providing up to 5 hours and 45 minutes of operation. 
 25 

The Inogen Rove 6 is the first POC with an 8-year expected service life. The 8-year expected service life also extends to the Inogen Rove 4 and the Inogen One G5 systems. In 2019, we launched the Inogen One G5, which is similar to the product specifications of the Inogen Rove 6. We estimate that the Inogen Rove 6 and Inogen One G5 are each suitable for over 90 of ambulatory long-term oxygen therapy patients based on our analysis of the patients who have contacted us and their clinical needs. 
 Inogen Connect, our connectivity platform on our Inogen One G4 , Inogen One G5, Inogen Rove 4 and Inogen Rove 6 products in the United States and Canada, is compatible with Apple and Android platforms and includes patient features such as purity status, battery life, product support functions, notification alerts, and remote software updates. 
 We plan to also invest in clinical studies to evaluate expected improvements in clinical, economic and patient reported outcomes associated with the use of our products as part of our efforts to drive payor and prescriber advocacy for our products. 
 Expand our product offerings and indications for use. We are focused on expanding new products that drive benefits to patients, prescribers, and our customers with a clinically relevant pipeline. These products would include innovations that strengthen our offerings in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, as well as future innovations that differentiate beyond devices to allow patients and clinicians to better manage respiratory disease with advanced POCs with digital health value added services, expansion of use to hypercapnia, shortness-of-breath, and to other related disease indications. 

Sales revenue 
 Our future financial performance will be driven primarily by the growth in sales of our POCs and our Simeox airway clearance, and, to a lesser extent, sales of batteries, other accessories, and our Inogen At Home stationary oxygen concentrators. We plan to grow our system sales in the coming years through multiple strategies including: improving sales force productivity, investing in consumer and physician awareness and advocacy through increased sales and marketing efforts, expanding our clinical evidence, expanding our sales infrastructure and efforts outside of the United States, expanding our business-to-business sales through key strategic partnerships, and enhancing our product offerings through additional product launches. While we believe HME providers are still in the process of converting their business model to a non-delivery model through the purchase of POCs, growth has been challenged due to HME restructuring efforts, lack of access to available credit, provider capital expenditure constraints, and risk of potential changes in reimbursement rates. 
 Our direct-to-consumer sales processes involve numerous interactions with the individual patient, their physician and the physician s staff, and includes an in-depth analysis and review of our product, the patient s diagnosis and prescribed oxygen therapy, including procuring an oxygen prescription. The patient may consider whether to finance the product through an Inogen-approved third party or purchase the equipment. Product is not deployed until both the prescription and payment are secured. Once a full system is deployed, the patient has 30 calendar days to return the product. Approximately 8-11 of consumers who purchase a system return the system during this 30-day return period. 
 Our business-to-business efforts are focused on selling to distributors, HME oxygen providers, our private label partner, and resellers who are based inside and outside of the United States. This process involves interactions with various key customer stakeholders including sales, purchasing, product testing, and clinical personnel. Businesses that have patient demand that can be met with our products place purchase orders to secure product deployment. This may be influenced based on outside factors, including the result of tender offerings, changes in insurance plan coverage or reimbursement rates, business restructuring activities toward a non-delivery model, capital constraints, mergers and acquisitions, and overall changes in the net oxygen therapy patient populations. As a result of these factors, product purchases can be subject to changes in demand by customers. 
 We sold approximately 43,900 systems in the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 35,400 systems for the same period in 2023. We sold approximately 119,100 systems in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 96,400 for the same period in 2023. The increase in the current period was primarily due to the result of increased demand from resellers. We continue to focus on optimizing profitability in our direct-to-consumer channel by driving sales productivity. 
 26 

Rental revenue 
 Our rental process involves numerous interactions with the individual patient, their physician and the physician s staff. The process includes an in-depth analysis and review of our product, the patient s diagnosis and prescribed oxygen therapy, and their medical history to confirm the appropriateness of our product for the patient s oxygen therapy and compliance with Medicare and private payor billing requirements, which often necessitates additional physician evaluation and/or testing for oxygen. Once the product is deployed, the patient receives instruction on product use and may receive a clinical titration from our licensed staff to confirm the product meets the patient s medical oxygen needs prior to billing. As a result, the period of time from initial contact with a patient to billing can vary significantly and be up to one month or longer. 
 Rental revenue decreased in the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023, primarily due lower average reimbursement rates per patient resulting from the change in mix of payors toward private insurance from Medicare. Medicare reimbursement rates for oxygen therapy have increased annually each January as they are subject to Consumer Price Index adjustments. We plan to add new rental patients on service in future periods through multiple strategies, including investing in patient and physician awareness and advocacy, expanding clinical evidence, and securing additional insurance contracts. 
 A portion of the rental patient population operates in a capped rental period during which no additional reimbursement is allowed unless additional criteria are met. This capped period begins after month 36 and continues until month 60. The ratio of billable patients to total patients on service is critical to maintaining rental revenue growth as patients on service increase. Medicare has noted a certain percentage of beneficiaries, approximately 25 , based on their review of Medicare claims, reach the 36 th month of eligible reimbursement and enter the post-36 month capped rental period. The percentage of capped patients may fluctuate over time as new patients come on service, patients come off service before and during the capped rental period, and existing patients enter the capped rental period. 
 We had approximately 51,400 and 51,900 oxygen rental patients as of September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023, respectively. Management focuses on patients on service as a leading indicator of likely future rental revenue; however, actual rental revenue recognized is subject to a variety of other factors, including billable patients as a percentage of patients on service, reimbursement levels by payor, patient location, the number of capped patients, write-offs for uncollectible balances, and rental revenue adjustments. 
 Reimbursement 
 We rely significantly on reimbursement from Medicare and private payors, including Medicare Advantage plans and Medicaid, for our rental revenue. For the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, approximately 55.6 and 65.0 , respectively, and for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, approximately 57.0 and 69.7 , respectively, of our rental revenue was derived from Medicare s traditional fee-for-service reimbursement programs. For additional discussion of our reliance on third-party reimbursement and the impact of the recent Medicare reimbursement proposals, see the discussion in the subsection entitled "Third-Party Reimbursement" in Item 1 of our Annual Report on Form 10-K and the section entitled Risk Factors in our Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC on March 1, 2024. 
 Basis of presentation 
 The following describes the line items set forth in our consolidated statements of comprehensive loss. 
 Revenue 
 We classify our revenue in two main categories: sales revenue and rental revenue. There will be fluctuations in mix between business-to-business sales, direct-to-consumer sales, and rental revenue from period-to-period. Product selling prices and gross margins may fluctuate based on revenue channel mix, as we introduce new products, our product costs change, we have changes in purchase volumes, and as currency variations occur. Additionally, fluctuations in the channel mix could cause variability in our gross margins, as direct-to-consumer sales and rental revenue have higher margins than the business-to-business channels. Quarter-over-quarter results may vary due to seasonality in both the international and domestic markets, as discussed in Item 1. Seasonality and elsewhere in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, as filed with the SEC on March 1, 2024. 
 Sales revenue 
 Our sales revenue is primarily derived from the sale of our Inogen Rove, Inogen One, and Inogen At Home systems in addition to our related accessories to individual consumers, our private label partner, HME providers, distributors, and resellers. Sales revenue is classified into two areas: business-to-business sales and direct-to-consumer sales. Generally, our direct-to-consumer sales have higher gross margins than our business-to-business sales. 
 27 

Rental revenue 
 Our rental revenue is primarily derived from the rental of our Inogen One and Inogen At Home systems to patients through reimbursement from Medicare, private payors, and Medicaid, which typically also includes a patient responsibility component for patient co-insurance and deductibles. We expect that our rental revenue will be impacted by the number of our sales representatives, reimbursement rate changes, the level of and response from potential customers to direct-to-consumer marketing spend, product launches, the number of billable patients and denial rates, and other uncontrollable factors such as changes in the market and competition. 
 Cost of revenue 
 Cost of sales revenue 
 Cost of sales revenue consists primarily of costs incurred in the production process, including component materials, assembly labor and overhead, warranty expense, provisions for slow-moving and obsolete inventory, rework, and delivery costs for items sold. Labor and overhead expenses consist primarily of personnel-related expenses, including wages, bonuses, benefits, and stock-based compensation for manufacturing, logistics, repair, manufacturing engineering, and quality assurance employees and temporary labor. Cost of sales revenue also includes manufacturing freight in, depreciation expense, facilities costs, and materials. Provisions for warranty obligations are included in cost of sales revenue and are provided for at the time of revenue recognition. 
 The impact of supply chain disruptions began negatively impacting our cost of sales revenue starting in the third quarter of 2021 and is expected to have minimal impact throughout 2024. The supply chain constraints are primarily associated with semiconductor chips used in our batteries and printed circuit boards which are components of our POCs. 
 We expect sales gross margin percentage to fluctuate over time based on the sales channel mix, product mix, and changes in average selling prices and manufacturing cost per unit. 
 Cost of rental revenue 
 Cost of rental revenue consists primarily of depreciation expense, consumable disposables, logistics costs, and service costs for our rental equipment, including rework costs, material, labor, and freight. 
 Rental gross margin percentage could fluctuate due to changes in depreciation expense, cost to service and maintain the rental fleet as well as the percentage of billable patients as a percentage of patients on service. 
 Operating expense 
 Research and development 
 Our research and development expense consists primarily of personnel-related expenses, including wages, bonuses, benefits, and stock-based compensation for research and development, engineering, and medical affairs employees. It also includes facility costs, laboratory supplies, product development materials, consulting fees, clinical studies costs, and testing costs for new product launches as well as enhancements to existing products. We have made substantial investments in research and development since our inception. Our research and development efforts have focused primarily on development and commercialization of new and existing products. 
 We plan to continue to invest in research and development activities to stay at the forefront of patient preference in oxygen and respiratory therapy, including significant investments in clinical research. We continue to invest in our engineering and technology teams to support our new and enhanced product research and development efforts and manufacturing improvements. We will also focus research and development efforts on broadening our product portfolio. 
 Sales and marketing 
 Our sales and marketing expense primarily supports our direct-to-consumer sales and rental strategy and consists mainly of personnel-related expenses, including wages, bonuses, commissions, benefits, and stock-based compensation for sales, marketing, customer service, rental intake, and clinical service employees. It also includes expenses for media and advertising, printing, informational kits, dues and fees, credit card/financing fees, recruiting, training, sales promotional activities, travel and entertainment expenses as well as allocated facilities costs. 
 28 

Going forward, our plan is to optimize our sales capacity while focusing on increased productivity, improved sales personnel and lead distribution systems, and improved training. We expect to continue to invest in sales and marketing by focusing on increased productivity driven by improved sales management discipline, insights-informed tools, and optimized patient lead generation as well as increasing our rental patient support infrastructure as our patient and customer base increases. 
 General and administrative 
 Our general and administrative expense consists primarily of personnel-related expenses, including wages, bonuses, benefits, and stock-based compensation for employees in our compliance, finance, medical billing, order intake, regulatory, legal, human resources, and information technology departments as well as facilities costs and board of directors expenses, including stock-based compensation. In addition, general and administrative expense includes professional services, such as legal, patent registration and defense costs, insurance, consulting and accounting services, including audit and tax services, and travel and entertainment expenses. General and administrative expense also includes one-time costs, such as restructuring, acquisition expenses, and changes in the fair value of the earnout liability. 
 We expect general and administrative expense may increase in absolute dollars as we continue to invest in corporate infrastructure to support our growth including personnel-related expenses, professional services fees, and compliance costs associated with operating as a public company. 
 Income taxes 
 We account for income taxes in accordance with ASC 740 Income Taxes . Under ASC 740, income taxes are recognized for the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current period and deferred tax liabilities and assets are recognized for the future tax consequences of transactions that have been recognized in our consolidated financial statements or tax returns. A valuation allowance is provided when it is more likely than not that some portion, or all, of the deferred tax asset will not be realized. 
 We account for uncertainties in income tax in accordance with ASC 740-10 Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes . ASC 740-10 prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. This accounting standard also provides guidance on derecognition, classification, interest and penalties, accounting in interim periods, disclosure, and transition. 
 The accounting for stock-based compensation will increase or decrease our effective tax rate based upon the difference between our stock-based compensation expense and the deductions taken on our U.S. tax return, which depends upon the stock price at the time of employee option exercise or award vesting. We recognize excess tax benefits or deficiencies on a discrete basis, and we anticipate our effective tax rate will vary from year-to-year depending on our stock price in each period.

Cost of sales revenue decreased 3.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 from the three months ended September 30, 2023, a decrease of 7.3 from the comparable period, due primarily to lower premiums paid for raw material components. The third quarter of 2024 did not include premiums associated with open-market purchases of semiconductor chips used in our POCs compared to 3.3 million in the third quarter of 2023. 
 Cost of rental revenue increased 0.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 from the three months ended September 30, 2023, an increase of 5.4 from the comparable period. The increase in cost of rental revenue was primarily attributable to an increase in service costs. Cost of rental revenue included 3.2 million of rental asset depreciation for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 3.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. 
 Gross margin on sales revenue increased to 47.2 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 from 37.2 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase was primarily due to lower material cost premiums associated with open-market purchases of semiconductor chips used in our POCs and adjustments in reserves, partially offset by a change in sales mix towards increased business-to-business sales. Total worldwide business-to-business sales revenue accounted for 74.3 of total sales revenue in the three months ended September 30, 2024 versus 63.1 in the three months ended September 30, 2023. 
 Gross margin on rental revenue decreased to 43.2 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 from 53.1 for the three months ended September 30, 2023, primarily due to a higher mix shift of private-payor reimbursement, lower net revenue per rental patient as a result of a decrease in the percentage of patients billed compared to total patients on service, and higher service costs.

Cost of sales revenue decreased 5.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from the nine months ended September 30, 2023, a decrease of 4.7 from the comparable period, due primarily to lower premiums paid for raw material components, partially offset by an increase in the number of systems sold. The first nine months of 2024 included less than 0.1 million of material cost premiums associated with open-market purchases of semiconductor chips used in our batteries and POCs compared to 11.3 million in the first nine months of 2023. 
 Cost of rental revenue increased 1.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from the nine months ended September 30, 2023, an increase of 6.6 from the comparable period. The increase in cost of rental revenue was primarily attributable to an increase in service costs. Cost of rental revenue included 9.6 million of rental asset depreciation for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 9.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 Gross margin on sales revenue increased to 46.7 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from 38.2 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase was primarily due to lower material cost premiums associated with open-market purchases of semiconductor chips used in our POCs, partially offset by a change in sales mix towards increased business-to-business sales. Total worldwide business-to-business sales revenue accounted for 70.6 of total sales revenue in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 versus 60.4 in the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 Gross margin on rental revenue decreased to 44.4 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from 52.6 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, primarily due to a higher mix shift of private-payor reimbursement, lower net revenue per rental patient as a result of a decrease in the percentage of patients billed compared to total patients on service, and higher service costs.

Net loss decreased 49.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from the nine months ended September 30, 2023, or a decrease of 65.6 from the comparable period. The decrease in net loss was primarily related to lower goodwill impairment and material cost premiums, partially offset by an increase in sales revenue. 
 Liquidity and capital resources 
 As of September 30, 2024, we had cash and cash equivalents of 105.7 million, which consisted of highly liquid investments with a maturity of three months or less. In addition, we held marketable securities of 15.0 million, which had maturities of greater than three months. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, we received 0.8 million and 1.5 million, respectively, in proceeds related to stock option exercises and our employee stock purchase plan. 
 Our principal use of our funds for liquidity and capital resources in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 consisted of cash used in investing activities of 14.0 million for additional rental equipment, other property, plant and equipment and intangible assets and 11.8 million for net purchases of marketable securities, partially offset by cash provided by operating activities of 8.9 million. 
 We believe that our current cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities and the cash to be generated from expected product sales and rentals will be sufficient to meet our projected operating and investing requirements for at least the next twelve months. However, our liquidity assumptions may prove to be incorrect, and we could utilize our available financial resources sooner than we currently expect. Our future funding requirements will depend on many factors, including market acceptance of our products; the cost of our research and development activities; payments from customers; the cost, timing, and outcome of litigation or disputes involving intellectual property rights, our products, employee relations, cyber security incidents, or otherwise; the cost and timing of acquisitions and integration thereof; the cost and timing of regulatory clearances or approvals; the cost and timing of establishing additional sales, marketing, and distribution capabilities; and the effect of competing technological and market developments. In the future, we may acquire businesses or technologies from third parties, and we may decide to raise additional capital through debt or equity financing to the extent we believe this is necessary to successfully complete these acquisitions. Our future capital requirements will also depend on many additional factors, including those set forth in the risk factors included in Item 1A. "Risk Factors" in our Annual Report on Form 10-K and our Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q filed with the SEC. 
 If we require additional funds in the future, we may not be able to obtain such funds on acceptable terms, or at all. In the future, we may also attempt to raise additional capital through the sale of equity securities or through equity-linked or debt financing arrangements. If we raise additional funds by issuing equity or equity-linked securities, the ownership of our existing stockholders will be diluted. If we raise additional financing by the incurrence of indebtedness, we will be subject to increased fixed payment obligations and could also be subject to restrictive covenants, such as limitations on our ability to incur additional debt, and other operating restrictions that could adversely impact our ability to conduct our business. Any future indebtedness we incur may result in terms that could be unfavorable to equity investors. There can be no assurances that we will be able to raise additional capital, which would adversely affect our ability to achieve our business objectives. In addition, if our operating performance during the next twelve months is below our expectations, our liquidity and ability to operate our business could be adversely affected. 
 The following tables show a summary of our cash flows and working capital for the periods and as of the dates indicated:

Operating activities 
 Historically, we derive operating cash flows from cash collected from the sales and rental of our products and services. These cash flows received are partially offset by our use of cash for operating expenses to support the growth of our business. 
 Net cash provided by operating activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 consisted primarily of non-cash adjustment items such as depreciation of equipment and leasehold improvements and amortization of intangibles of 15.9 million, provision for sales returns and doubtful accounts of 9.4 million, stock-based compensation expense of 5.7 million, net loss on disposal of rental assets and other assets of 3.1 million, and change in fair value of earnout liability of 1.8 million, partially offset by our net loss of 26.1 million. The net changes in operating assets and liabilities resulted in net cash provided of 0.1 million. 
 Net cash used in operating activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 consisted primarily of our net loss of 75.9 million, partially offset by non-cash adjustment items such as impairment charges of 32.9 million, depreciation of equipment and leasehold improvements and amortization of intangibles of 13.0 million, stock-based compensation expense of 8.5 million, provision for sales returns and doubtful accounts of 7.1 million, net loss on disposal of rental assets and other assets of 3.4 million, and provision for inventory obsolescence and other inventory losses of 2.3 million. The net changes in operating assets and liabilities resulted in net cash provided of 8.7 million. 
 Investing activities 
 Net cash used in investing activities generally includes the production and purchase of rental assets, property, plant and equipment, acquisitions, and intangibles to support our expanding business as well as maturities (purchases) of marketable securities. 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we invested 32.3 million in the purchase of marketable securities, 11.9 million in the production and purchase of rental assets and other property and equipment, and 2.1 million in intangible assets, partially offset by 20.5 million we received from maturities of marketable securities. 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2023, we invested 29.6 million in the Physio-Assist acquisition, net of cash acquired, 23.8 million in the purchase of marketable securities, 20.2 million in the production and purchase of rental assets and other property and equipment, and 0.5 million in intangible assets, partially offset by 10.5 million we received in maturities of marketable securities. 
 We expend significant manufacturing and production expense in connection with the development and production of our oxygen concentrator and other respiratory care products and, in connection with our rental business, we incur expense in the deployment and maintenance of rental equipment to our patients. Investments will continue to be required in order to grow our sales and rental revenue and continue to supply and replace rental equipment to our rental patients on service. 
 Financing activities 
 Historically, we have funded our operations through our sales and rental revenue and the issuance of preferred and common stock. 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, net cash provided by financing activities consisted of 0.8 million from the proceeds received from purchases under our employee stock purchase program, partially offset by the payment of employment taxes related to the vesting of restricted stock units of 0.3 million. 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2023, net cash provided by financing activities consisted of 1.5 million from the proceeds received from stock options that were exercised and purchases under our employee stock purchase program, partially offset by the payment of employment taxes related to the vesting of restricted stock awards and restricted stock units of 0.5 million. 
 Sources of funds 
 Our net cash provided by operating activities in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 8.9 million compared to net cash used in operating activities of 0.1 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2023. As of September 30, 2024, we had cash and cash equivalents of 105.7 million and marketable securities of 15.0 million. 
 Use of funds 
 Our principal uses of cash are funding our new rental asset deployments and other capital purchases, operations, and other working capital requirements and, from time-to-time, the acquisition of businesses. Over the past several years our cash flows from customer collections have remained consistent and our annual cash provided by operating activities has generally been a significant source of capital to the business. 
 36 

We may need to raise additional funds to support our investing operations, and such funding may not be available to us on acceptable terms, or at all. If we are unable to raise additional funds when needed, our operations and ability to execute our business strategy could be adversely affected. We may seek to raise additional funds through equity, equity-linked or debt financings. If we raise additional funds through the incurrence of indebtedness, such indebtedness would have rights that are senior to holders of our equity securities and could contain covenants that restrict our operations. Any additional equity financing may be dilutive to our stockholders. 
 Non-GAAP financial measures 
 EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are financial measures that are not calculated in accordance with U.S. GAAP. We define EBITDA as net loss excluding interest income, interest expense, taxes and depreciation and amortization. Adjusted EBITDA also excludes stock-based compensation, change in fair value of earnout liability, acquisition-related expenses, and restructuring-related and other charges. Below, we have provided a reconciliation of EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA to our net loss, the most directly comparable financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP. EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered alternatives to a net loss or any other measure of financial performance calculated and presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Our EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other organizations because other organizations may not calculate EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA in the same manner as we calculate these measures. 
 We include EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q because they are important measures upon which our management assesses our operating performance. We use EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA as key performance measures because we believe they facilitate operating performance comparisons from period-to-period by excluding potential differences primarily caused by variations in capital structures, tax positions, the impact of depreciation and amortization expense on our fixed assets and intangible assets, the impact of stock-based compensation expense, the impact of the change in fair value of the earnout liability, the impact of acquisition-related expenses, the impact of restructuring-related costs, and impairment charges. Because EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA facilitate internal comparisons of our historical operating performance on a more consistent basis, we also use EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA for business planning purposes, to incentivize and compensate our management personnel, and in evaluating acquisition opportunities. In addition, we believe EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA and similar measures are widely used by investors, securities analysts, ratings agencies, and other parties in evaluating companies in our industry as a measure of financial performance and debt-service capabilities. 
 Our uses of EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA have limitations as analytical tools and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under U.S. GAAP. Some of these limitations are: 
 EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA do not reflect our cash expenditures for capital equipment or other contractual commitments; 

although depreciation and amortization are non-cash charges, the assets being depreciated and amortized may have to be replaced in the future, and EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA do not reflect capital expenditure requirements for such replacements; 

EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA do not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, our working capital needs; 

Adjusted EBITDA does not include changes in fair value of earnout liability related to our acquisitions; 

Adjusted EBITDA does not include acquisition-related expenses, whether the acquisition was consummated or not pursued; 

Adjusted EBITDA does not include costs associated with workforce reductions and associated costs and other restructuring-related activities; and 

other companies, including companies in our industry, may calculate EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA measures differently, which reduces their usefulness as a comparative measure. 

In evaluating EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA, we anticipate that in the future we will incur expenses within these categories similar to this presentation. Our presentation of EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA should not be construed as an inference that our future results will be unaffected by certain expenses. When evaluating our financial results, EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA should be considered alongside other financial performance measures, including U.S. GAAP results.

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitat ive Disclosures About Market Risk 
 We are exposed to various market risks, including fluctuation in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates. Market risk is the potential loss arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices. We do not hold or issue financial instruments for trading purposes. 
 Foreign currency exchange risk 
 The principal market risk we face is foreign currency exchange risk. The majority of our revenue is denominated in U.S. dollars while the majority of our European sales are denominated in Euros. Our results of operations, certain balance sheet balances and cash flows are, therefore, subject to fluctuations due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates. The volatility of exchange rates depends on many factors that we cannot forecast with reliable accuracy. We have experienced and will continue to experience fluctuations in our net income or loss as a result of transaction gains or losses related to revaluing certain current asset and current liability balances that are denominated in currencies other than the functional currency in which they are recorded. The effect of a 10 adverse change in exchange rates on foreign denominated cash, receivables and payables as of September 30, 2024 would not have had a material effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. As our operations in countries outside of the United States grow, our results of operations and cash flows will be subject to fluctuations due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates, which could harm our business in the future. 
 We began entering into foreign exchange forward contracts to protect our forecasted U.S. dollar-equivalent earnings from adverse changes in foreign currency exchange rates. These hedging contracts reduce, but will not entirely eliminate, the impact of adverse currency exchange rate movements on revenue, cash, receivables, and payables. We performed a sensitivity analysis assuming a hypothetical 10 adverse movement in foreign exchange rates to the hedging contracts and the underlying exposures described above. As of September 30, 2024, the analysis indicated that these hypothetical market movements would not have a material effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. We estimate prior to any hedging activity that a 10 adverse change in exchange rates on our foreign denominated sales would have resulted in a 7.0 million decline in revenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. We designate these forward contracts as cash flow hedges for accounting purposes. The fair value of the forward contract is separated into intrinsic and time values. The fair value of forward currency-exchange contracts is sensitive to changes in currency exchange rates. Changes in the time value are coded in other income, net. Changes in the intrinsic value are recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss and subsequently reclassified into revenue to offset the hedged exposures as they occur. 
 Interest rate fluctuation risk 
 We had cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash of 105.7 million as of September 30, 2024, which consisted of highly liquid investments with a maturity of three months or less, and 15.0 million of marketable securities with maturity dates of greater than three months. The primary goals of our investment policy are liquidity and capital preservation. We do not enter into investments for trading or speculative purposes. We believe that we do not have any material exposure to changes in the fair value of these assets as a result of changes in interest rates due to the short-term nature of our cash and cash equivalents. Declines in interest rates, however, would reduce future investment income. We considered the historical volatility of short-term interest rates and determined that it was reasonably possible that an adverse change of 100 basis points could be experienced in the near term. A hypothetical 1.00 (100 basis points) increase in interest rates would not have materially impacted the fair value of our marketable securities as of September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023. If overall interest rates had increased or decreased by 1.00 (100 basis points), our interest income would not have been materially affected during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 or September 30, 2023.

I tem 4. Controls and Procedures 
 Evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures 
 The Company maintains a system of disclosure controls and procedures as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act ), which are designed to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed in the reports that the Company files or submits under the Exchange Act, is recorded, processed, summarized and reported accurately and completely within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms. These disclosure controls and procedures include, among other processes, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports that the Company files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Due to inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Further, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions over time, or that the degree of compliance with the policies and procedures may deteriorate. Accordingly, even effective disclosure controls and procedures can only provide reasonable assurance of achieving their control objectives. Our management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer, evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of September 30, 2024. Based upon the evaluation described above, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that, as of September 30, 2024, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective at the reasonable assurance level. 
 Changes in internal control over financial reporting 
 There has been no change in our internal control over financial reporting identified in connection with the evaluation required by paragraph (d) of Rule 13a-15 or 15d-15 that occurred during our most recent fiscal quarter that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 
 Limitations on effectiveness of controls 
 In designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives. In addition, the design of disclosure controls and procedures must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and that management is required to apply its judgment in evaluating the benefits of possible controls and procedures relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, have been detected. Because of the inherent limitations in any control system, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected.

P art II. OTHER INFORMATION 
 
 I tem 1. Legal Proceedings 
 We are party to various legal proceedings and investigations arising in the normal course of business. We carry insurance, subject to specified deductibles under the policies, to protect against losses from certain types of legal claims. At this time, we do not anticipate that any of these other proceedings arising in the normal course of business will have a material adverse effect on our business. Regardless of the outcome, litigation can have an adverse impact on us because of defense and settlement costs, diversion of management resources, and other factors. 
 I tem 1A. Risk Factors 
 The significant factors known to us that could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, or operating results are described in the Risk Factors section of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, as filed with the SEC on March 1, 2024 and our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2024, as filed with the SEC on May 8, 2024. Any of these factors could result in a significant or material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition. Additional risk factors not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also impair our business or results of operations. As of the date of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, there have been no material changes from the risk factors previously disclosed in our 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC on March 1, 2024 and our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2024, filed with the SEC on May 8, 2024, which are incorporated by reference herein.
