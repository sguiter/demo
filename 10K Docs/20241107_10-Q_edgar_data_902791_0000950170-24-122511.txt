Each stockholder of record at the close of business on June 14, 2024 received a dividend of three additional shares of common stock for each then-held share, distributed after close of trading on June 21, 2024. All share and per share amounts presented herein have been retroactively adjusted to reflect the impact of the 2024 Stock Split. The shares of common stock retain a par value of per share. Accordingly, an amount equal to the par value of the increased shares resulting from the stock split was reclassified from additional paid-in capital to common stock. , are renewable on an annual basis and typically require days written notice to cancel or terminate the contract by either party. In addition, our client service agreements provide for immediate termination upon any payment default of the client regardless of when notice is given. PEO customers are invoiced following the end of each payroll processing cycle, with payment generally due on the invoice date. Staffing customers are generally invoiced weekly based on agreed rates per employee and actual hours worked, typically with payment terms of days. The amount of earned but unbilled revenue is classified as a receivable on the condensed consolidated balance sheets. We report PEO revenues net of direct payroll costs because we are not the primary obligor for these payments to our clients employees. Direct payroll costs include salaries, wages, health insurance, and employee out-of-pocket expenses incurred incidental to employment.

If the financial condition of our customers deteriorates resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments, additional allowances may be required.

Premiums incurred but not paid are recorded as either current or long-term premium payable on the consolidated balance sheets based on the expected timing of the payments. 
 For claims incurred under the insured program prior to July 1, 2021, the Company retains risk of loss up to the first million per occurrence on policies issued after June 30, 2020 and million per occurrence on policies issued before that date. Claim obligations for policies issued under the insured program between February 1, 2014 and June 30, 2018 were removed through loss portfolio transfers in 2020 and 2021.

 The Company is required to maintain minimum collateral levels for certain policies issued under the insured program, which is held in a trust account (the trust account ). The balance in the trust account was million and million at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. The trust account balance is included as a component of the current and long-term restricted cash and investments in the Company s condensed consolidated balance sheets. Self-insured programs The Company is a self-insured employer with respect to workers compensation coverage for all employees, including employees of PEO clients that elect to participate in our workers compensation program, working in Colorado, Maryland, Ohio, and Oregon. In the state of Washington, state law allows only the Company s staffing services and internal management employees to be covered under the Company s self-insured workers compensation program. The Company also operates a wholly owned, fully licensed insurance company, Ecole, which provides workers compensation coverage to client employees working in Arizona and Utah. Approximately of the Company s workers compensation exposure is covered through self-insurance or Ecole (the self-insured programs ). For all claims incurred under the Company s self-insured programs, the Company retains risk of loss up to the first million per occurrence, except in Maryland and Colorado, where the Company s retention per occurrence is million and million, respectively. For claims incurred under the Company s self-insured programs prior to July 1, 2020, the Company retains risk of loss up to the first million per occurrence, except in Maryland and Colorado, where the retention per occurrence is million and million, respectively. The states of California, Maryland, Oregon, Washington, Colorado and Delaware required the Company to maintain collateral totaling million and million at September 30, 2024 and December 31,

million. Claims liabilities The Company provided a total of million and million at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 , respectively, as an estimated future liability for unsettled workers compensation claims liabilities. Of this amount, million and million at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 , respectively, represent case reserves and IBNR in excess of the Company s retention. The accrual for costs incurred in excess of retention is offset by a receivable from insurance carriers of million and million at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 , respectively, included in other assets in the condensed consolidated balance sheets. 

 million and a sublimit for standby letters of credit of million. Advances under the revolving credit line bear interest, as selected by the Company, of (a) or (b) . per year on the average daily unused amount of the revolving credit line, as well as a fee of of the face amount of each letter of credit reserved under the line of credit. The Company had outstanding borrowings on its revolving credit line at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. Th e credit facility is collateralized by the Company s accounts receivable and other rights to receive payment. The revolving credit facility will mature on , unless extended. The Agreement requires the satisfaction of certain financial covenants as follows: adjusted free cash flow [net profit after taxes plus interest expense (net of capitalized interest), depreciation expense, and amortization expense, less dividends/distributions] not less than million as of each fiscal quarter end, determined on a rolling 4-quarter basis; and 

 tangible net worth [aggregate of total stockholders equity plus subordinated debt less any intangible assets and less any loans or advances to, or investments in, any related entities or individuals] not less than million at each fiscal quarter end. 

 The Agreement imposes certain additional restrictions unless the Bank provides its prior written consent as follows: incurring additional indebtedness is prohibited, other than purchase financing for the acquisition of assets, provided that the aggregate of all purchase financing does not exceed million at any time; 

 the Company may not terminate or cancel any of the AICE policies; and 

 if an event of default occurs and is continuing, including on a pro forma basis, dividends or distributions would be permitted to be paid and redemptions and repurchases of the Company s stock would be permitted only up to million in any rolling 12-month period. 

 The Agreement also contains customary events of default and specified cross-defaults under the Company s workers compensation insurance arrangements. If an event of default under the Agreement occurs and is continuing, the Bank may declare any outstanding obligations under the Agreement to be immediately due and payable. At September 30, 2024 , the Company was in compliance with all covenants.

t recorded a valuation allowance against its deferred tax assets. The Company s realization of a portion of net deferred tax assets is based in part on our estimates of the timing of reversals of certain temporary differences and on the generation of taxable income before such reversals. The Company is subject to income taxes in U.S. federal and multiple state and local tax jurisdictions. The Internal Revenue Service (the IRS is examining the Company s federal tax returns for the years ended December 31, through . BBSI received notices that the IRS intends to disallow certain wage-based tax credits claimed for the years through , which could result in estimated total additional taxes of million and penalties of million. The Company disagrees with the IRS determination to disallow certain wage-based credits taken by the Company and has filed a U.S. Tax Court petition challenging these notices. We believe that the Company has the technical merits to defend its position. Based on management s more-likely-than-not assessment that the Company s position is sustainable, no reserve for the aforementioned IRS notices of disallowance of wage-based tax credits or underpayment penalties has been recorded in the financial statements. In the major jurisdictions where it operates, the Company is generally no longer subject to income tax examinations by tax authorities for tax years before 2017. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 , total gross unrecognized tax benefits, excluding interest and penalties, of million and million, respectively, would affect the Company s effective tax rate if recognized in future periods. The Company does not anticipate any material changes to the reserve in the next 12 months. A portion of the consolidated income the Company generates is not subject to state income tax. Depending on the percentage of this income as compared to total consolidated income, the Company's state effective tax rate could fluctuate from expectations. 

 state operating loss carryforwards. At September 30, 2024 , the Company did t have a federal general business tax credit carryforward or an alternative minimum tax credit carryforward.

Item 2.	Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 
 General 
 Company Background Barrett Business Services, Inc. BBSI, the Company, our or we ), is a leading provider of business management solutions for small and mid-sized companies. The Company has developed a management platform that integrates a knowledge-based approach from the management consulting industry with tools from the human resource outsourcing industry. This platform, through the effective leveraging of human capital, helps our business owner clients run their businesses more effectively. We believe this platform, delivered through a decentralized organizational structure, differentiates BBSI from our competitors. BBSI was incorporated in Maryland in 1965. 
 Business Strategy Our strategy is to align local operations teams with the mission of small and mid-sized business owners, driving value to their business. To do so, BBSI: 
 partners with business owners to leverage their investment in human capital through a high-touch, results-oriented approach; 

brings predictability to each client organization through a three-tiered management platform; and 

enables business owners to focus on their core business by reducing organizational complexity and maximizing productivity. 

Business Organization We operate a decentralized delivery model using operationally focused business teams, typically located within 50 miles of our client companies. These teams are led by experienced business generalists and include senior-level professionals with expertise in human resources, organizational development, risk mitigation and workplace safety, recruiting, employee benefits, and various types of administration, including payroll. These teams are responsible for growth and profitability of their operations, and for providing strategic leadership, guidance and expert consultation to our client companies. The decentralized structure fosters autonomous decision-making in which business teams deliver plans that closely align with the objectives of each business owner client. We support clients with a local presence in 68 markets throughout the United States. 
 Services Overview BBSI s core purpose is to advocate for business owners, particularly in the small and mid-sized business segment. Our evolution from an entrepreneurially run company to a professionally managed organization has helped to form our view that all businesses experience inflection points at key stages of growth. The insights gained through our own growth, along with the trends we see in working with more than 8,000 companies each day, define our approach to guiding business owners through the challenges associated with being an employer. BBSI s business teams align with each business owner client through a structured three-tiered progression. In doing so, business teams focus on the objectives of each business owner and deliver planning, guidance and resources in support of those objectives. 
 Tier 1: Tactical Alignment 
 The first stage focuses on the mutual setting of expectations and is essential to a successful client relationship. It begins with a process of assessment and discovery in which the business owner s business objectives, attitudes, and culture are aligned with BBSI s processes, controls and culture. This stage includes an implementation process, which addresses the administrative components of employment. 
 Tier 2: Dynamic Relationship 
 The second stage of the relationship emphasizes organizational development as a means of achieving each client s business objectives. There is a focus on process improvement, development of best practices, supervisor training and leadership development. 
 19 

Tier 3: Strategic Counsel 
 With an emphasis on advocacy on behalf of the business owner, the third stage of the relationship is more strategic and forward-looking with a goal of cultivating an environment in which all efforts are directed by the mission and long-term objectives of the business owner. 
 In addition to serving as a resource and guide, BBSI can provide workers compensation coverage as a means of meeting statutory requirements and protecting our clients from employment-related injury claims. Through our third-party administrators, we provide claims management services for our clients. We work to manage and reduce job injury claims, identify fraudulent claims and structure optimal work programs, including modified duty. 
 In 2023, BBSI began offering employee benefit programs to our clients. The employee benefit programs are offered through fully insured arrangements with third-party carriers and are designed to provide strategic value to our clients through access to best-in-class plans and service. Benefit plans available to clients include medical, dental and vision plans, flexible spending accounts and health savings accounts, life insurance and voluntary accident coverage, and critical illness and disability coverage, among others.

We report PEO revenues net of direct payroll costs because we are not the primary obligor for wage payments to our clients employees. However, management believes that gross billings and wages are useful in understanding the volume of our business activity and serve as an important performance metric in managing our operations, including the preparation of internal operating forecasts and establishing executive compensation performance goals. We therefore present for purposes of analysis gross billings and wage information for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023.

The presentation of revenue on a net basis and the relative contributions of PEO and staffing services revenue can create volatility in our gross margin as a percentage of revenue. Generally, a relative increase in PEO services revenue will result in a higher gross margin as a percentage of revenue. Improvement in gross margin percentage occurs because incremental client services revenue dollars are reported as revenue net of all related direct payroll costs. 
 We refer to employees of our PEO clients as worksite employees WSEs ). Management reviews average and ending WSE growth to monitor and evaluate the performance of our operations. Average WSEs are calculated by dividing the number of unique individuals paid in each month by the number of months in the period. Ending WSEs represents the number of unique individuals paid in the last month of the period.

Three Months Ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 
 Net income for the third quarter of 2024 amounted to 19.6 million compared to net income of 18.2 million for the third quarter of 2023. Diluted net income per share for the third quarter of 2024 was 0.74 compared to diluted net income per share of 0.67 for the third quarter of 2023. 
 Revenue for the third quarter of 2024 totaled 294.3 million, an increase of 21.0 million or 7.7 over the third quarter of 2023, which reflects an increase in the Company s PEO services revenue of 21.4 million or 8.5 and a decrease in staffing services revenue of 0.4 million or 1.9 . 
 The increase in PEO services revenue was primarily attributable to a 4.8 increase in average WSEs, a 2.9 increase in the average billing per WSE, as well as an increase in PEO client benefits revenue. 
 Gross margin for the third quarter of 2024 totaled 74.4 million or 25.3 of revenue compared to 68.3 million or 25.0 of revenue for the third quarter of 2023. The separate components of gross margin are discussed below. 
 Direct payroll costs for the third quarter of 2024 totaled 16.2 million or 5.5 of revenue compared to 16.3 million or 6.0 of revenue for the third quarter of 2023. The decrease in direct payroll costs as a percentage of revenues was primarily due to a decrease in staffing services within the mix of our customer base compared to the third quarter of 2023. 
 Payroll taxes and benefits for the third quarter of 2024 totaled 154.1 million or 52.4 of revenue compared to 135.7 million or 49.6 of revenue for the third quarter of 2023. The increase in payroll taxes and benefits expense as a percentage of revenue was primarily due to higher average payroll tax rates in the third quarter of 2024 and PEO client benefit costs of 9.0 million in the third quarter of 2024 compared to 3.4 million in the third quarter of 2023. 
 Workers compensation expense for the third quarter of 2024 totaled 49.5 million or 16.8 of revenue compared to 53.0 million or 19.4 of revenue for the third quarter of 2023. The decrease in workers compensation expense as a percentage of revenue was primarily due to favorable claims development as compared to the third quarter of 2023, as well as favorable prior year liability and premium adjustments of 4.3 million in the third quarter of 2024, compared to favorable prior year liability and premium adjustments of 2.2 million in the third quarter of 2023. 
 Selling, general and administrative SG A expenses for the third quarter of 2024 totaled 49.1 million or 16.7 of revenue compared to 44.2 million or 16.2 of revenue for the third quarter of 2023. The increase of 4.9 million in SG A expense was primarily attributable to increased employee-related costs, including increased variable employee compensation and incentive pay related to stronger financial results compared to the third quarter of 2023. 
 Other income, net for the third quarter of 2024 totaled 2.3 million compared to other income, net of 2.4 million for the third quarter of 2023. The decrease was primarily attributable to a decrease in investment income in the third quarter of 2024. 
 Our effective income tax rate for the third quarter of 2024 was 23.6 compared to 26.2 for the third quarter of 2023. Our income tax rate typically differs from the federal statutory tax rate of 21 primarily due to state taxes as well as federal and state tax credits.

 Revenue for the first nine months of 2024 totaled 839.7 million, an increase of 47.1 million or 5.9 over the first nine months of 2023, which reflects an increase in the Company s PEO services revenue of 50.9 million or 7.0 and a decrease in staffing services revenue of 3.8 million or 5.9 . 
 The increase in PEO services revenue was primarily attributable to a 3.9 increase in average WSEs, a 3.4 increase in the average billing per WSE, as well as an increase in PEO client benefits revenue. 
 Gross margin for the first nine months of 2024 totaled 181.9 million or 21.6 of revenue compared to 176.9 million or 22.3 of revenue for the first nine months of 2023. The separate components of gross margin are discussed below. 
 22 

Direct payroll costs for the first nine months of 2024 totaled 45.6 million or 5.4 of revenue compared to 48.3 million or 6.1 of revenue for the first nine months of 2023. The decrease in direct payroll costs as a percentage of revenues was primarily due to a decrease in staffing services within the mix of our customer base compared to the first nine months of 2023. 
 Payroll taxes and benefits for the first nine months of 2024 totaled 464.8 million or 55.4 of revenue compared to 414.4 million or 52.3 of revenue for the first nine months of 2023. The increase in payroll taxes and benefits expense as a percentage of revenue was primarily due to higher average payroll tax rates in the first nine months of 2024 and PEO client benefit costs of 22.6 million in the first nine months of 2024 compared to 6.6 million in the first nine months of 2023. 
 Workers compensation expense for the first nine months of 2024 totaled 147.4 million or 17.6 of revenue compared to 153.0 million or 19.3 of revenue for the first nine months of 2023. The decrease in workers compensation expense as a percentage of revenue was primarily due to favorable prior year liability and premium adjustments of 16.1 million in the first nine months of 2024 compared to favorable prior year liability and premium adjustments of 9.5 million in the first nine months of 2023, as well as favorable claims development as compared to the first nine months of 2023. 
 SG A expense for the first nine months of 2024 totaled 137.1 million or 16.3 of revenue compared to 129.2 million or 16.3 of revenue for the first nine months of 2023. The increase of 7.9 million in SG A expense was primarily attributable to increased employee-related costs. 
 Other income, net for the first nine months of 2024 totaled 8.6 million compared to other income, net of 6.8 million for the first nine months of 2023. The increase was primarily attributable to an increase in investment income in the first nine months of 2024. 
 Our effective income tax rate for the first nine months of 2024 was 24.2 compared to 26.8 for the first nine months of 2023. Our income tax rate typically differs from the federal statutory tax rate of 21 primarily due to state taxes as well as federal and state tax credits. 
 Fluctuations in Quarterly Operating Results 
 We historically have experienced significant fluctuations in our quarterly operating results, including losses or minimal income in the first quarter of each year, and expect such fluctuations to continue in the future. Our operating results may fluctuate due to a number of factors such as seasonality, wage limits on statutory payroll taxes, claims experience for workers compensation, demand for our services, and competition. Payroll taxes, as a component of cost of revenues, generally decline throughout a calendar year as the applicable statutory wage bases for federal and state unemployment taxes and Social Security taxes are exceeded on a per employee basis. Our revenue levels may be higher in the third quarter due to the effect of increased business activity of our customers businesses in the agriculture, food processing and forest products-related industries. In addition, revenues in the fourth quarter may be reduced by many customers practice of operating on holiday-shortened schedules. Workers compensation expense varies with both the frequency and severity of workplace injury claims reported during a quarter and the estimated future costs of such claims. Positive or adverse loss development of prior period claims during a subsequent quarter may also contribute to the volatility in the Company s estimated workers compensation expense. 
 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 The Company s cash balance of 28.7 million, which includes cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash, decreased 46.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to a decrease of 44.9 million for the comparable period of 2023. The decrease in cash at September 30, 2024 as compared to December 31, 2023 was primarily due to increased trade accounts receivable, purchases of investments and restricted investments, decreased workers compensation claims liabilities, repurchases of common stock, decreased premium payable, purchases of property, equipment and software, and dividend payments, partially offset by proceeds from sales and maturities of investments and restricted investments, net income, and increased accrued payroll, payroll taxes and related benefits. 
 23 

Net cash used in operating activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 amounted to 43.3 million, compared to cash provided of 10.0 million for the comparable period of 2023. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, net cash used in operating activities was primarily due to increased trade accounts receivable of 82.3 million, decreased workers compensation claims liabilities of 30.7 million, and decreased premium payable of 15.7 million, partially offset by net income of 36.2 million, and increased accrued payroll, payroll taxes and related benefits of 35.0 million.

Such factors with respect to the Company include: our ability to retain current clients and attract new clients; difficulties associated with integrating clients into our operations; economic trends in our service areas; the potential for material deviations from expected future workers compensation claims experience; changes in the workers compensation regulatory environment in our primary markets; PEO client benefit costs; security breaches or failures in the Company s information technology systems; collectability of accounts receivable; changes in executive management; changes in effective payroll tax rates and federal and state income tax rates; the carrying values of deferred income tax assets and goodwill (which may be affected by our future operating results); the effects of inflation on our operating expenses and those of our clients; the impact of and potential changes to the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, escalating medical costs, and other health care legislative initiatives on our business; the effect of conditions in the global capital markets on our investment portfolio; and the availability of capital, borrowing capacity on our revolving credit facility, or letters of credit necessary to meet state-mandated surety deposit requirements for maintaining our status as a qualified self-insured employer for workers compensation coverage or our insured program.

Item 3.	Quantitative and Qualitati ve Disclosures About Market Risk 
 The Company s exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates primarily relates to its investment portfolio and outstanding borrowings on its line of credit. The Company's investments and restricted investments, which are classified as available-for-sale, consist primarily of fixed-rate debt securities, the fair value of which fluctuates with prevailing interest rates. Our cash equivalents consist primarily of money market funds, which are not meaningfully impacted by interest rate risk. We attempt to limit our investment portfolio s exposure to market risk through low investment turnover and diversification. Based on the Company s overall interest exposure at September 30, 2024, a 50-basis-point increase in market interest rates would have a 4.6 million downward effect on the fair value of the Company s investment portfolio. Outstanding borrowings on the Company s line of credit bear interest at a variable market rate, which makes the cost of borrowing on the line of credit susceptible to changing interest rates. At September 30, 2024, the Company had no outstanding borrowings on its line of credit. 
 Item 4.	Controls and Procedures 
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 Management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting ICFR as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act. Our ICFR is a process designed by, or under the supervision of, our Chief Executive Officer CEO and Chief Financial Officer CFO ), to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of our condensed consolidated financial statements for external purposes in accordance with GAAP. 
 We maintain disclosure controls and procedures that are designed with the objective of providing reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed in the reports we file or submit under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act ), is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our CEO and CFO, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. In designing and evaluating our disclosure controls and procedures, our management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives, and our management is required to apply their judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures. 
 Based on their evaluation, the Company s CEO and CFO have concluded that the Company s disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) were effective as of September 30, 2024. 
 Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 There have been no changes in the Company s internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the quarter ended September 30, 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company s internal control over financial reporting. 
 Inherent Limitations 
 Control systems, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the control systems objectives are being met. Further, the design of any control systems must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of all controls must be considered relative to their costs. Due to the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within the Company have been detected. These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision making can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur because of simple errors or mistakes. Control systems can also be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people, or by management override of the controls. The design of any system of controls is based in part on certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions. Over time, controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or deterioration in the degree of compliance with policies or procedures.
