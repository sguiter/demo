 For the thirteen weeks ended September 29, 2024, the benefit for income taxes includes: (i) the impact of changes to the estimate of forecasted annual pre-tax book income relative to the prior quarter in 2024, (ii) the benefit of FICA tax credits on certain tipped wages and (iii) the temporary reduction in the Brazilian income tax rate from to under the new Brazil tax legislation. 
 
 For the thirteen weeks ended September 24, 2023, the benefit for income taxes includes the benefits of Brazil tax legislation, that included a temporary reduction in the Brazilian income tax rate from to , as well as the income tax exemption on Brazil state value added tax VAT benefits. 
 
 The effective income tax rate for the thirty-nine weeks ended September 29, 2024 is lower than the effective income tax rate for the thirty-nine weeks ended September 24, 2023, primarily due to the impact of nondeductible losses associated with the 2025 Notes Partial Repurchase which, relative to a pre-tax book loss during the period, resulted in a negative effective income tax rate. 
 
 On January 24, 2024, the Company s Brazilian subsidiary received an unfavorable second level court ruling related to its ongoing litigation regarding its eligibility for tax exemptions under the Brazil tax legislation. This legislation temporarily granted certain industries a exemption from income tax (IRPJ and CSLL) and federal value added taxes (PIS and COFINS). The Company claimed this benefit for the periods between September 2022 and December 2023. The Company is appealing this ruling and in connection with the appeal made a cash judicial deposit of million, inclusive of principal, interest and potential penalties, in July 2024. The deposit was recorded in Other assets, net, on the Company s Consolidated Balance Sheet. The judicial deposit accumulates interest income until final resolution of the judicial proceedings. The Company believes that it will more likely than not prevail in this appeal and, accordingly, has not recorded any expense or liability for the disputed amounts. 
 
 On November 6, 2024, the Company entered into a purchase agreement to sell of its Brazil operations. In connection with the purchase agreement, the Company expects to retain the legal rights to fully recover the judicial deposit related to the Brazil tax legislation. The Company is still evaluating the value of those legal rights to recovery and the accounting for such amounts. See Note 15 - Subsequent Events of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional details regarding the purchase agreement. 
 
 During the second quarter of 2024, Brazil enacted new tax legislation that temporarily grants certain industries a exemption from income tax (IRPJ and CSLL) for the periods between May 23, 2024 and December 2024 and exemption from federal value added taxes (PIS and COFINS) for the periods between May 23, 2024 and December 2026. The Company applied for this exemption and was approved by the Brazilian tax authorities. The Company s estimated annual effective income tax rate for the thirteen and thirty-nine weeks ended September 29, 2024 includes the benefit expected from this legislation. The new Brazil tax legislation also established a country-wide limitation to the total benefits that will be granted under this law. The exemption from value added taxes could end before December 2026 due to this country-wide limitation. 
 
 In the U.S., a restaurant company employer may claim a credit against its federal income taxes for FICA taxes paid on certain tipped wages (the FICA tax credit ). The level of FICA tax credits is primarily driven by U.S. Restaurant sales and is not impacted by costs incurred that may reduce Income before provision for income taxes.

 primarily due to the impact of nondeductible losses associated with the 2025 Notes Partial Repurchase which, relative to a pre-tax book loss during the period, resulted in a negative effective income tax rate. 
 
 The effective income tax rates for the thirteen and thirty-nine weeks ended September 24, 2023 were lower than the Company s blended federal and state statutory rate of approximately primarily due to the benefit of FICA tax credits on certain tipped wages, benefits of Brazil tax legislation that include a temporary reduction in the Brazilian income tax rate from to , and the income tax exemption on Brazil state VAT benefits.

While the Company believes that additional losses beyond these accruals are reasonably possible, it cannot estimate a possible loss contingency or range of reasonably possible loss contingencies beyond these accruals. 
 
 Lease Guarantees - The Company assigned its interest, and is contingently liable, under certain real estate leases. These leases have varying terms, the latest of which expires in 2032. As of September 29, 2024, the undiscounted payments that the Company could be required to make in the event of non-payment by the primary lessees was million. The present value of these potential payments discounted at the Company s incremental borrowing rate as of September 29, 2024 was million. In the event of default, the indemnity clauses in the Company s purchase and sale agreements generally govern its ability to pursue and recover damages incurred. As of September 29, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company s recorded contingent lease liability was million and million, respectively.

 The Shareholders Agreement will set forth a put-call mechanism pursuant to which: (i) Buyer may cause Seller to sell the totality of its interest in the Target Entities for a period between October 1, 2028 and December 31, 2028 (the Option Exercise Period ), and (ii) the Seller may cause Buyer to purchase the totality of Seller s interest in the Target Entities during the Option Exercise Period. 
 
 In connection with the Transaction, the Company expects to mitigate most of the exchange rate risk associated with the Purchase Price installment payments by entering into foreign exchange forward contracts.

 periods are not intended to express any future trends or indications of future performance, unless specifically expressed as such, and should only be viewed as historical data. 

Overview 
 
 We are one of the largest casual dining restaurant companies in the world with a portfolio of leading, differentiated restaurant concepts. As of September 29, 2024, we owned and operated 1,173 restaurants and franchised 290 restaurants across 46 states, Guam and 13 countries. We have four founder-inspired concepts: Outback Steakhouse, Carrabba s Italian Grill, Bonefish Grill and Fleming s Prime Steakhouse Wine Bar. 

Financial Overview - Our financial overview for the thirteen weeks ended September 29, 2024 includes the following: 
 
 U.S. combined and Outback Steakhouse comparable restaurant sales of (1.5) and (1.3) , respectively; 
 Decrease in Total revenues of (3.8) as compared to the third quarter of 2023; 
 Operating income and restaurant-level operating margins of 1.7 and 12.5 , respectively, as compared to 5.4 and 13.8 , respectively, for the third quarter of 2023; 
 Operating income of 17.2 million as compared to 58.2 million in the third quarter of 2023; and 
 Diluted earnings per share of 0.08 as compared to 0.45 for the third quarter of 2023. 

Agreement to Sell Majority Ownership of our Brazil Operations - On November 8, 2024, we announced an agreement to sell 67 of our Brazil operations at a total enterprise valuation of R 2.06 billion Brazilian Reais, which equals R 1.4 billion Brazilian Reais (approximately 243 million in U.S. Dollars based on current exchange rates) to Buyer. We will retain an indirect 33 interest in our Brazil operations. 
 
 The sale transaction is expected to close on or before December 31, 2024. Following the closing of the sale, our subsidiary will enter into amended and restated franchise agreements with the buyer and our Brazil restaurants will be operated as unconsolidated franchisees. See Note 15 - Subsequent Events of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional details regarding the sale agreement. 

Key Financial Performance Indicators - Key measures that we use in evaluating our restaurants and assessing our business include the following: 
 
 Average restaurant unit volumes average sales (excluding gift card breakage and the benefit of value added tax exemptions in Brazil) per restaurant to measure changes in customer traffic, pricing and development of the brand. 
 
 Comparable restaurant sales year-over-year comparison of the change in sales volumes (excluding gift card breakage and the benefit of value added tax exemptions in Brazil) for Company-owned restaurants that are open 18 months or more in order to remove the impact of new restaurant openings in comparing the operations of existing restaurants. 
 
 System-wide sales total restaurant sales volume for all Company-owned and franchise restaurants, regardless of ownership, to interpret the overall health of our brands. 
 
 Restaurant-level operating margin, Income from operations, Net income (loss) and Diluted earnings (loss) per share financial measures utilized to evaluate our operating performance. 
 
 Restaurant-level operating margin is a non-GAAP financial measure widely regarded in the industry as a useful metric to evaluate restaurant-level operating efficiency and performance of ongoing restaurant-level operations, and we use it for these purposes, overall and particularly within our two segments. Our 
 28 

Table of Contents

 MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF 
 FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS - Continued 

 restaurant-level operating margin is expressed as the percentage of our Restaurant sales that Food and beverage costs, Labor and other related expense and Other restaurant operating expense (including advertising expenses) represent, in each case as such items are reflected in our Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive (Loss) Income. The following categories of revenue and operating expenses are not included in restaurant-level operating income and corresponding margin because we do not consider them reflective of operating performance at the restaurant-level within a period: 
 
 (i) Franchise and other revenues, which are earned primarily from franchise royalties and other non-food and beverage revenue streams, such as rental and sublease income; 
 (ii) Depreciation and amortization, which, although substantially all of which is related to restaurant-level assets, represent historical sunk costs rather than cash outlays for the restaurants; 
 (iii) General and administrative expense, which includes primarily non-restaurant-level costs associated with support of the restaurants and other activities at our corporate offices; and 
 (iv) Asset impairment charges and restaurant closing costs, which are not reflective of ongoing restaurant performance in a period. 
 
 Restaurant-level operating margin excludes various expenses, as discussed above, that are essential to support the operations of our restaurants and may materially impact our Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive (Loss) Income. As a result, restaurant-level operating margin is not indicative of our consolidated results of operations and is presented exclusively as a supplement to, and not a substitute for, Net income (loss) or Income from operations. In addition, our presentation of restaurant-level operating margin may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies in our industry. 
 
 Adjusted restaurant-level operating margin, Adjusted income from operations, Adjusted net income and Adjusted diluted earnings per share non-GAAP financial measures utilized to evaluate our operating performance. 
 
 We believe that our use of these non-GAAP financial measures permits investors to assess the operating performance of our business relative to our performance based on U.S. GAAP results and relative to other companies within the restaurant industry by isolating the effects of certain items that may vary from period to period without correlation to core operating performance or that vary widely among similar companies. However, our inclusion of these adjusted measures should not be construed as an indication that our future results will be unaffected by unusual or infrequent items or that the items for which we have made adjustments are unusual or infrequent or will not recur. We believe that the disclosure of these non-GAAP measures is useful to investors as they form part of the basis for how our management team and Board evaluate our operating performance, allocate resources and administer employee incentive plans.

 (1) As a percentage of Restaurant sales. 
 Less than 1/10th of one percent of Total revenues. 

Thirteen weeks ended September 29, 2024 as compared to thirteen weeks ended September 24, 2023 

Food and beverage cost decreased as a percentage of Restaurant sales primarily due to 1.1 from increases in average check per person driven by an increase in menu pricing and 0.2 from cost-saving and productivity initiatives. These decreases were partially offset by an increase as a percentage of Restaurant sales of 0.6 from commodity inflation. 

Labor and other related expense increased as a percentage of Restaurant sales primarily due to 1.7 from higher hourly and field management labor costs, primarily due to wage rate inflation, partially offset by a decrease of 0.6 from an increase in average check per person. 

Other restaurant operating expense increased as a percentage of Restaurant sales primarily due to 0.7 from higher restaurant-level operating and supply expenses, primarily due to inflation, and 0.2 from higher pre-opening expense. These increases were partially offset by decreases as a percentage of Restaurant sales of 0.2 from an increase in average check per person and 0.2 from certain cost-saving and productivity initiatives. 

Depreciation and amortization expense increased primarily due to restaurant development and technology projects.

 MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF 
 FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS - Continued 

 General and administrative expense increased as a percentage of Total revenues primarily due to increases in professional fees and executive transition costs. 

Provision for impaired assets and restaurant closings increased primarily due to impairment and closure charges in connection with the Q2 2024 decision to close nine restaurants in Hong Kong and a net gain in Q3 2023 of 6.7 million in connection with the lease termination and closure of one U.S. restaurant. 

Interest expense, net increased primarily due to higher balances and interest rates on the unhedged portion of our revolving credit facility partially offset by a decrease in interest expense from the 2025 Notes Partial Repurchase. 

Benefit for income taxes for the thirteen weeks ended September 29, 2024 includes: (i) the impact of changes to the estimate of forecasted annual pre-tax book income relative to the prior quarter in 2024, (ii) the benefit of FICA tax credits on certain tipped wages and (iii) the temporary reduction in the Brazilian income tax rate from 34 to 0 under the new Brazil tax legislation. 

Thirty-nine weeks ended September 29, 2024 as compared to thirty-nine weeks ended September 24, 2023 

Food and beverage cost decreased as a percentage of Restaurant sales primarily due to 1.3 from increases in average check per person driven by an increase in menu pricing and 0.4 from cost-saving and productivity initiatives. These decreases were partially offset by increases as a percentage of Restaurant sales of 0.4 from unfavorable product mix and 0.4 from commodity inflation. 

Labor and other related expense increased as a percentage of Restaurant sales primarily due to 1.8 from higher hourly and field management labor costs, primarily due to wage rate inflation, partially offset by a decrease of 0.6 from an increase in average check per person. 

Other restaurant operating expense increased as a percentage of Restaurant sales primarily due to: (i) 1.0 from higher restaurant-level operating and supply expenses, primarily due to inflation, (ii) 0.4 from higher advertising expense and (iii) 0.2 from higher pre-opening expense. These increases were partially offset by decreases as a percentage of Restaurant sales of 0.3 from an increase in average check per person and 0.2 from certain cost-saving and productivity initiatives. 

Depreciation and amortization expense increased primarily due to restaurant development and technology projects. 

General and administrative expense increased as a percentage of Total revenues primarily due to increases in professional fees and executive transition costs. 

Provision for impaired assets and restaurant closings increased primarily due to impairment and closure charges in connection with the Q2 2024 decision to close nine restaurants in Hong Kong and the Q4 2023 decision to close 36 older, predominately underperforming restaurants within the U.S. segment. 

Loss on extinguishment of debt during the thirty-nine weeks ended September 29, 2024 was in connection with the 2025 Notes Partial Repurchase, which is described in further detail within Note 7 - Convertible Senior Notes of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. 

Interest expense, net increased primarily due to higher balances and interest rates on the unhedged portion of our revolving credit facility partially offset by a decrease in interest expense from the 2025 Notes Partial Repurchase and interest income in connection with the Brazil judicial deposit.

 (1) See the Adjusted Income from Operations Non-GAAP Reconciliations table above for details regarding Income from operations adjustments. 
 (2) Includes losses in connection with the 2025 Notes Partial Repurchase. See Note 7 - Convertible Senior Notes of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional details. 
 (3) Includes the tax effects of non-GAAP adjustments determined based on the nature of the underlying non-GAAP adjustments and their relevant jurisdictional tax rates for all periods presented. The difference between GAAP and adjusted effective income tax rates during the thirty-nine weeks ended September 29, 2024 primarily relates to nondeductible losses and other tax costs associated with the 2025 Notes Partial Repurchase. The thirteen and thirty-nine weeks ended September 24, 2023 include a 2.9 million adjustment related to a Brazil federal income tax exemption on certain state VAT benefits. 
 (4) Adjusted diluted weighted average common shares outstanding for the thirteen weeks ended September 29, 2024 and September 24, 2023 and the thirty-nine weeks ended September 29, 2024 and September 24, 2023 were calculated including the effect of 0.7 million, 5.4 million, 2.0 million and 5.1 million dilutive securities, respectively, for outstanding 2025 Notes and the effect of 0.3 million, 3.8 million, 1.4 million and 3.4 million dilutive securities, respectively, for the Warrant Transactions, as defined below. In connection with the offering of the 2025 Notes, we entered into convertible note hedge transactions (the Convertible Note Hedge Transactions and concurrently entered into warrant transactions relating to the same number of shares of our common stock (the Warrant Transactions ). If our stock price is in excess of the conversion price of the 2025 Notes 10.79 and 11.26 as of September 29, 2024 and September 24, 2023, respectively), the Convertible Note Hedge Transactions deliver shares to offset dilution from the 2025 Notes, which, in combination with the Warrant Transactions, effectively offset dilution from the 2025 Notes up to the strike price of the Warrant Transactions 15.11 and 15.77 as of September 29, 2024 and September 24, 2023, respectively). Adjusted diluted earnings per share and adjusted diluted weighted average common shares outstanding for the thirteen and thirty-nine weeks ended September 24, 2023 have been recast to remove the 5.4 million and 5.1 million share benefit, respectively, of the Convertible Note Hedge Transactions which was previously included as a non-GAAP share adjustment. 
 (5) Due to a GAAP net loss, antidilutive securities are excluded from diluted weighted average common shares outstanding for the thirty-nine weeks ended September 29, 2024. However, considering the adjusted net income position, adjusted diluted weighted average common shares outstanding incorporates securities that would have been dilutive for GAAP. 

System-Wide Sales - System-wide sales is a non-GAAP financial measure that includes sales of all restaurants operating under our brand names, whether we own them or not. Management uses this information to make decisions about future plans for the development of additional restaurants and new concepts, as well as evaluation of current operations. System-wide sales comprise sales of Company-owned and franchised restaurants. For a summary of sales of Company-owned restaurants, refer to Note 2 - Revenue Recognition of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

Liquidity and Capital Resources 

Cash and Cash Equivalents 

As of September 29, 2024, we had 83.6 million in cash and cash equivalents, of which 18.9 million was held by foreign affiliates. The international jurisdictions in which we have significant cash do not have any known restrictions that would prohibit repatriation. 

As of September 29, 2024, we had aggregate undistributed foreign earnings of approximately 35.7 million that may be repatriated to the U.S. without additional material U.S. federal income tax. These amounts are not considered indefinitely reinvested in our foreign subsidiaries.

 MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF 
 FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS - Continued 

 As of September 29, 2024, we had 407.2 million in available unused borrowing capacity under our revolving credit facility, net of letters of credit of 17.8 million. 
 
 Third Amended and Restated Credit Agreement - On September 19, 2024, we and OSI, as co-borrowers, entered into the Third Amended and Restated Credit Agreement which provides for senior secured financing of up to 1.2 billion consisting of the Senior Secured Credit Facility. The Senior Secured Credit Facility matures on September 19, 2029 and replaced our Former Credit Facility financing of up to 1.0 billion. Our total indebtedness and the interest rate applied to our borrowings remained unchanged as a result of the Third Amended and Restated Credit Agreement. See Note 6 - Supplemental Balance Sheet Information - Long-term debt, net of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional details regarding the Third Amended and Restated Credit Agreement. 
 
 Our credit agreement, as amended, contains various financial and non-financial covenants. A violation of these covenants could negatively impact our liquidity by restricting our ability to borrow under the revolving credit facility and cause an acceleration of the amounts due under the credit facilities. 
 
 As of September 29, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we were in compliance with our debt covenants. We believe that we will remain in compliance with our debt covenants during the next 12 months and beyond. 
 
 2025 Notes Partial Repurchase - On February 29, 2024, we and the Noteholders entered into the Exchange Agreements in which the Noteholders agreed to exchange 83.6 million in aggregate principal amount of our outstanding 2025 Notes for approximately 7.5 million shares of our common stock and 3.3 million in cash, including accrued interest. 
 
 Convertible Note Hedge and Warrant Transactions - In connection with the 2025 Notes Partial Repurchase, we entered into the Early Termination Agreements with the Derivative Counterparties. Upon settlement, we received approximately 118.2 million in cash and 0.3 million shares of our common stock from the Derivative Counterparties and paid 102.2 million in cash to the Derivative Counterparties during the thirty-nine weeks ended September 29, 2024. 
 
 See Note 7 - Convertible Senior Notes of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional details regarding the 2025 Notes Partial Repurchase and related Early Termination Agreements. 

Use of Cash 
 
 Cash flows generated from operating activities and availability under our revolving credit facility are our principal sources of liquidity, which we use for operating expenses, development of new restaurants, remodeling or relocating older restaurants, investments in technology, dividend payments and share repurchases. 
 
 We believe that our expected liquidity sources are adequate to fund debt service requirements, lease obligations, capital expenditures and working capital obligations during the 12 months following this filing. However, our ability to continue to meet these requirements and obligations will depend on, among other things, our ability to achieve anticipated levels of revenue and cash flow and our ability to manage costs and working capital successfully. 

Capital Expenditures - We estimate that our capital expenditures will total approximately 260 million to 270 million in 2024. The amount of actual capital expenditures may be affected by general economic, financial, competitive, legislative and regulatory factors, among other things, including raw material constraints.

 Brazil Judicial Deposit - In July 2024, we made a judicial deposit of 42.9 million, inclusive of principal, interest and potential penalties, in connection with our appeal of an unfavorable court ruling regarding our eligibility for tax exemptions under the Brazil tax legislation. The judicial deposit includes the disputed amounts through December 31, 2023 and was recorded in Other assets, net, on our Consolidated Balance Sheet. The judicial deposit accumulates interest income until final resolution of the judicial proceedings. We believe that we will more likely than not prevail in this appeal and, accordingly, have not recorded any expense or liability for the disputed amounts. 

Dividends and Share Repurchases - In October 2024, our Board declared a quarterly cash dividend of 0.24 per share, payable on December 11, 2024. Future dividend payments are dependent on our earnings, financial condition, capital expenditure requirements, surplus and other factors that our Board considers relevant, as well as continued compliance with the financial covenants in our debt agreements. 
 
 In February 2024, our Board canceled the remaining 57.5 million under our former share repurchase authorization and approved a new 350.0 million share repurchase authorization. The 2024 Share Repurchase Program includes capacity above our normal share repurchases activity to provide flexibility in retiring our 2025 Notes at or prior to their May 2025 maturity. The 2024 Share Repurchase Program will expire on August 13, 2025. 
 
 On March 1, 2024, we entered into the ASR Agreement, in connection with our previously announced 2024 Share Repurchase Program, with Wells Fargo to repurchase 220.0 million of our common stock. Under the ASR Agreement, we made an aggregate payment of 220.0 million to Wells Fargo and received an aggregate 7.9 million shares of our common stock during the thirty-nine weeks ended September 29, 2024. 
 
 See Note 8 - Stockholders Equity of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional details regarding the ASR Agreement. 
 
 As of September 29, 2024, 96.8 million remained available for repurchase under the 2024 Share Repurchase Program. 
 
 Following is a summary of dividends and share repurchases from fiscal year 2023 through September 29, 2024:

 Summary of Cash Flows and Financial Condition 

Cash Flows - The following chart presents a summary of our cash flows provided by (used in) operating, investing and financing activities for the periods indicated: 

Operating Activities - The decrease in net cash provided by operating activities during the thirty-nine weeks ended September 29, 2024 as compared to the thirty-nine weeks ended September 24, 2023 was primarily due to changes in working capital, lower net earnings and a judicial deposit in connection with tax exemptions under the Brazil tax legislation. 
 
 Investing Activities - The decrease in net cash used in investing activities during the thirty-nine weeks ended September 29, 2024 as compared to the thirty-nine weeks ended September 24, 2023 was primarily due to lower capital expenditures. 
 
 Financing Activities - Net cash provided by financing activities during the thirty-nine weeks ended September 29, 2024 was due to net draws on the revolving credit facility exceeding cash used to repurchase common stock and pay dividends on our common stock, and net cash received from the Early Termination Agreements. Net cash used in financing activities during thirty-nine weeks ended September 24, 2023 was primarily due to cash dividends on our common stock, repurchases of our common stock and net repayments on our revolving credit facility partially offset by proceeds from stock-based compensation. 

Financial Condition - Following is a summary of our current assets, current liabilities and working capital (deficit) as of the periods indicated: 
 (dollars in thousands) SEPTEMBER 29, 2024 DECEMBER 31, 2023 Current assets 261,058 343,314 Current liabilities 848,970 1,002,335 Working capital (deficit) (587,912) (659,021) 
 
 Working capital (deficit) includes: (i) Unearned revenue primarily from unredeemed gift cards of 293.5 million and 381.9 million as of September 29, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively, and (ii) current operating lease liabilities of 169.4 million and 175.4 million as of September 29, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively, with the corresponding operating right-of-use assets recorded as non-current on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. We have, and in the future may continue to have, negative working capital balances (as is common for many restaurant

 companies). We operate successfully with negative working capital because cash collected on restaurant sales is typically received before payment is due on our current liabilities, and our inventory turnover rates require relatively low investment in inventories. Additionally, ongoing cash flows from restaurant operations and gift card sales are typically used to service debt obligations and to make capital ex penditures. 

Recently Issued Financial Accounting Standards

For purposes of 16 C.F.R. 910.2, if applicable, you agree and acknowledge that (i) you are a senior executive of the Company, as such term is defined in 16 C.F.R. 910.1, and (ii) this Agreement was entered into prior to the effective date of the restrictions contained in 16 C.F.R. 910.2. 
 The restrictive covenants of Section 1, Section 2 and Section 4 of this Exhibit will be construed as agreements independent of any other provision in this Agreement, and the existence of any claim or cause of action you may have against the Company, whether predicated upon this Agreement or otherwise, will not constitute a defense to the enforcement of any restrictive covenant. 
 The refusal or failure of the Company to enforce any restrictive covenant of Section 1, Section 2 or Section 4 of this Exhibit (or any similar agreement) against any other employee, agent, or independent contractor, for any reason, will not constitute a defense to the enforcement by the Company of any such restrictive covenant, nor will it give rise to any claim or cause of action by you against the Company. 
 6. Reasonableness of Restrictions Reformation Enforcement . The parties hereto recognize and acknowledge that the geographical and time and scope of activity limitations contained in Section 1, Section 2 and Section 4 of this Exhibit are reasonable and properly required for the adequate protection of the Company s interests. You acknowledge that the Company or its Affiliate is the owner, or the licensee of the trademarks used by it, and the owner or the licensee of the restaurant operating systems. It is agreed by the parties hereto that if any portion of the restrictions contained in Section 1, Section 2 or Section 4 are held to be unreasonable, arbitrary, or against public policy, then the restrictions will be considered divisible, whether as to the time and or to the geographical area and or scope of activity, with each month of the specified period being deemed a separate period of time and each radius mile of the restricted territory being deemed a separate geographical area, so that the lesser period of time or geographical area will remain effective so long as the same is not unreasonable, arbitrary, or against public policy. The parties hereto agree that in the event any court of competent jurisdiction determines the specified period or the specified geographical area of the restricted territory or the scope of the restricted activity to be unreasonable, arbitrary, or against public policy, a lesser time period or geographical area or scope of activity that is determined to be reasonable, nonarbitrary, and not against public policy may be enforced against you. If you violate any of the covenants contained herein and if any court action is instituted by the Company to prevent or enjoin such violation, then the period of time during which your business activities will be restricted, as provided in this Agreement, will be lengthened by a period of time equal to the period between the date of your breach of the terms or covenants contained in this Agreement and the date on which the decree of the court disposing of the issues upon the merits will become final and not subject to further appeal. 
 If either party initiates legal proceedings to enforce, interpret or construe any of the covenants contained in this Agreement, each party will pay its own legal fees, and the prevailing party in such proceedings will be entitled to receive from the non-prevailing party, in addition to all other remedies, all costs of such proceedings including appellate proceedings. 

15 

7. Specific Performance . You agree that a breach of any of the covenants contained in Section 1, Section 2, Section 3 or Section 4 of this Exhibit will cause irreparable injury to the Company for which the remedy at law will be inadequate and would be difficult to ascertain and therefore, in the event of the breach or threatened breach of any such covenants, the Company will be entitled, in addition to any other rights and remedies it may have at law or in equity, to seek an injunction to restrain you from any threatened or actual activities in violation of any such covenants. You hereby consent and agree that temporary and permanent injunctive relief may be granted in any proceedings that might be brought to enforce any such covenants without the necessity of proof of actual damages, and in the event the Company does apply for such an injunction, you will not raise as a defense thereto that the Company has an adequate remedy at law. 
 8. Cooperation . You will cooperate fully with all reasonable requests for information and participation by the Company, its agents, or its attorneys, in prosecuting or defending claims, suits, and disputes brought on behalf of or against the Company and in which you are involved or about which you have knowledge. After the termination of your employment, the Company will instruct its attorneys to use reasonable efforts to schedule any proceeding requiring your participation in a manner that minimizes any interference with your personal or professional activities and will reimburse you for all reasonable expenses incurred by you in such cooperation. 
 9. Nondisparagement . During the term of employment and at all times thereafter, you will not publicly disparage the Company, its Affiliates, or its or their directors, officers, business or products. During the term of employment, the Company will not issue any official Company statements that publicly disparage you, unless the Company determines reasonably and in good faith that such statements are true and are necessary to avoid or mitigate reputational damage to the Company. Nothing contained herein will preclude any person from providing truthful testimony in any judicial or administrative proceeding or complying with any whistleblower or similar statute, or shall apply to internal discussions within the Company relating to your performance, or to truthful disclosures made by the Company pursuant to any securities law, or the rules of any securities exchange on which the Company s shares are listed.
