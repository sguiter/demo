described in prior filings as Sherman 6 (the tenant of which is affiliated with the tenant/purchaser) and Tamarack 14 which was vacant.
The purchaser was an unaffiliated third party and the price was established based on an arm s length negotiation. The sale price
was . As part of the transaction, a subsidiary of the Trust provided seller financing in the amount of with an initial

The
Trust has elected to be treated for tax purposes as a REIT, which means that it is exempt from U.S. federal income tax if a sufficient
portion of its annual income is distributed to its shareholders, and if certain other requirements are met. In order for the Trust to
maintain its REIT qualification, at least 90 of its ordinary taxable annual income must be distributed to shareholders. As of December

The
 fair value of above-or-below market leases is estimated based on the present value (using an interest rate which reflected the risks
 associated with the leases acquired) of the difference between contractual amounts to be received pursuant to the leases and management s
 estimate of market lease rates measured over a period equal to the estimated remaining term of the lease. An above market lease is
 classified as an intangible asset and a below market lease is classified as an intangible liability. The capitalized above-market
 or below-market lease intangibles are amortized as a reduction of, or an addition to, rental income over the estimated remaining
 term of the respective leases. 

Intangible
 assets related to leasing costs consist of leasing commissions and legal fees. Leasing commissions are estimated by multiplying the
 remaining contract rent associated with each lease by a market leasing commission. Legal fees represent legal costs associated with
 writing, reviewing, and sometimes negotiating various lease terms. Leasing costs are amortized over the remaining useful life of
 the respective leases. 

Construction
 in Progress (CIP) - The Trust classifies greenhouses or buildings under development and/or expansion as construction-in-progress
 until construction has been completed and certificates of occupancy permits have been obtained upon which the asset is then classified
 as an Improvement. The value of CIP is based on actual costs incurred.

30, 2024 and 2023, approximately and of depreciation expense was recorded, respectively. For the nine months ended
September 30, 2024 and 2023, approximately and depreciation expense was recorded, respectively. 

While
the Trust believes its estimates of future cash flows are reasonable, different assumptions regarding a number of factors, including
market rents, listing prices, economic conditions, and occupancies, could significantly affect these estimates. When impairment exists, the long-lived asset is adjusted to an estimate of fair value. In estimating fair value,
if appraisal reports are available, the Trust uses the sales comparable, income or cost approach methodology where applicable within appraisal
reports; when appraisal reports are not available, the Trust uses opinions of value from brokers involved with listing properties for
sale and other market value information available to it. The Trust will record an impairment charge if it believes that there is other
than a temporary decline in market value below the carrying value of the investment. During the first quarter 2024, an impairment charge was expensed in the amount of approximately ;
during the second quarter, 2024, an impairment charge was expensed in the amount of approximately 
and during the third quarter 2024, an impairment charge was expensed in the amount of approximately .
Therefore, the total impairment charge expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 is approximately 
for assets all considered held for sale as of September 30, 2024. There was 
impairment charge during the first and second quarter 2023. During the third quarter 2023, an impairment charge was recognized in
the amount of approximately ,
totaling approximately 
of impairment expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 for assets considered held for sale and held for use. 

Any
decline in the estimated fair values of the Trust s assets could result in impairment charges in the future. It is possible that
such impairments, if required, could be material. 

in straight-line rent receivable against rental income. This was based on its assessment of
collecting all remaining contractual rent on greenhouse property leases. These tenants rent payments will be recorded as rental
revenue on a cash basis. Expenses for which tenants are contractually obligated to pay, such as maintenance, property taxes and insurance
expenses are not reflected in the Trust s consolidated financial statements unless paid by the Trust.

million. As part of evaluating a plan to comply with the NYSE
American listing requirements, the Trust embarked on analysis of the accounting treatment for its Preferred Shares which historically
were classified as Mezzanine Equity. Based on its review, the Trust determined that the Preferred Shares should be treated as Equity.
The Trust retained a qualified third-party consultant to assist with its analysis of the accounting treatment for the Preferred Shares.
Ultimately, the Trust concluded that it had incorrectly classified the Preferred Shares on its balance sheet and that they should be
treated as Equity (not mezzanine equity) and the financial statements should be re-stated accordingly. 

While
the Trust believes that the restatement may be material from a quantitative perspective, it does not believe that the restatement is material
from a qualitative standpoint other than for the second quarter of 2024 as a result of the non-compliance with the NYSE listing requirements.
Accordingly, the Trust believes it is appropriate to file an amended 10-Q for the quarter ended June 30, 2024 on Form 10-Q/A which was
filed with the SEC on September 24, 2024 (the 10-Q/A). Management concluded that for the rest of the prior periods, the error was immaterial
and corrected within the 10-Q/A. 

The
only changes to the financial Statements contained in the original Form 10-Q and the 10-Q/A for the quarter ended June 30, 2024 are: 

- 
 Reclassification
 of the Preferred Shares on the Consolidated Balance Sheet to Equity 

- 
 Elimination
 of the accrual of undeclared dividends for the Preferred Shares consistent with treatment of the Preferred Shares as Equity (previously
 accrued as an increase to the carrying value of the Preferred Shares on the Balance Sheet) 

- 
 An
 Updated Consolidated Statement of Changes in Shareholders Equity to include the Preferred Shares

The
restatement contained in the 10-Q/A increased the Trust s Total Equity on its consolidated Balance Sheet to approximately million
which is above the threshold required for NYSE American compliance as of June 30, 2024. On September 26, 2024, the Trust filed a Form
8-K with the SEC and issued a Press Release indicating that it received a notice from the NYSE American LLC rescinding the Deficiency
Letter based on having total equity in excess of the applicable million requirement. As of September 30, 2024, the Trusts Total Equity
is approximately million which is above the applicable requirement. There can be no assurance that the Trust will continue to comply
with the NYSE American listing requirements in the future. 

as of September 30, 2024, a decrease of from
December 31, 2023. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the decrease in cash was primarily due to the property carrying costs
for the properties that are security for the Greenhouse Loan and paydown of the Greenhouse Loan. 

The
Trust s current loan liabilities totaled approximately million as of September 30, 2024. The current loan liabilities include
approximately million for the Greenhouse Loan which is in default and is non-recourse to the Trust. 

Of
the total amount of cash, approximately million is non-restricted cash available for general corporate purposes and approximately
 is restricted cash related to the Greenhouse Loan. 

For
the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Trust determined that there was substantial doubt as to its ability to continue as a going
concern as a result of current liabilities that far exceed current assets, net losses incurred, reduced revenue and increased property
expenses related to the greenhouse portfolio. 

In
early 2024, the Trust sold three properties which is expected to help with liquidity. The net proceeds from the sale of the Salisbury,
MA property was approximately of unrestricted cash and the approximately loan was retired at closing and is eliminated
from current liabilities. The sale of two greenhouse properties in Colorado produced approximately of restricted cash and should
generate cash flow from the seller financing provided that should provide cash to help service the Greenhouse Loan. 

The
Greenhouse Loan is in default and the subject of litigation (see Note 6 LONG-TERM DEBT). Power REIT continues to try to work
with the lender to establish a path forward. However, the Greenhouse Loan is non-recourse to Power REIT which means that in the
event it cannot resolve issues with the lender and they foreclose on the properties, Power REIT should be able to continue as a
going concern albeit with a smaller portfolio of assets given that non-restricted cash should provide greater than twelve months of
liquidity for capital needs unrelated to the greenhouse properties which are security for the Greenhouse Loan. In addition, it is
possible that the Greenhouse Loan will lead to distressed sales including possibly through foreclosures, which would have a negative
impact on the Trust s prospects. A forbearance agreement with the lender for the Greenhouse Loan was effective on May 10,
2024, which provides additional time to retire the loan. The expiration date of the original forbearance agreement was . On September 30, 2024, PW CanRE Holdings (defined below) entered into an amendment to the forbearance agreement
which moves the expiration of the forbearance agreement to January 31, 2025. PW CanRE Holdings is in discussions with the
lender to continue a process of orderly sales of assets to try and maximize value but there can be no assurance the bank will extend
the forbearance again if the loan is not retired in a timely fashion. There can be no assurance that the efforts to sell, re-lease
or recapitalize the assets which are security for the Greenhouse Loan will ultimately retire the loan per the requirements of the
forbearance agreement. 

As
of the filing date, The Trust s current liabilities far exceed current assets. If the Trust s plan to focus on selling properties,
entering into new leases, improving cash collections from existing tenants and raising capital in the form of debt or equity is effectively
implemented, the Trust s plan could potentially provide enough liquidity. However, the Trust cannot predict, with certainty, the
outcome of its actions to generate liquidity. 

Power
REIT s cash outlays at the parent company level consist principally of professional fees, consultant fees, NYSE American listing
fees, legal, insurance, shareholder service company fees, auditing costs, and general and administrative expenses. The Trust s
cash outlays related to its various property-owning subsidiaries consist principally of principal and interest expense on debts property
maintenance, property taxes, insurance, legal as well as other property related expenses that are not covered by tenants. To the extent
the Trust needs to raise additional capital to meet its obligations, there can be no assurance that financing on favorable terms will
be available when needed. If Power REIT is unable to sell certain assets when anticipated at prices anticipated, we may not have sufficient
cash to fund operations and commitments. 

. As part of the transaction, a subsidiary of the Trust provided seller financing in the amount of with an initial
 interest rate that increases over time to 15 until maturity. The note is secured by a first mortgage on the properties and certain corporate and personal guarantees. The

assurance the bank will extend the forbearance again if the loan is not retired in a timely fashion. There can be no assurance
that the efforts to sell, re-lease or recapitalize the assets which are security for the Greenhouse Loan will ultimately retire the loan
per the requirements of the forbearance agreement.

MANAGEMENT S
DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS 

We
are a Maryland-domiciled, internally-managed real estate investment trust (a REIT that owns a portfolio of real estate
assets related to transportation, energy infrastructure and Controlled Environment Agriculture CEA in the United States. 

We
are structured as a holding company and own our assets through twenty-four direct and indirect wholly-owned, special purpose subsidiaries
that have been formed in order to hold real estate assets, obtain financing and generate lease revenue. As of September 30, 2024, the
Trust s assets consisted of approximately 112 miles of railroad infrastructure and related real estate which is owned by its subsidiary
Pittsburgh West Virginia Railroad P WV ), approximately 447 acres of fee simple land leased to a number of utility
scale solar power generating projects with an aggregate generating capacity of approximately 82 Megawatts MW and approximately
249 acres of land with approximately 2,112,000 square feet of existing or under construction CEA properties in the form of greenhouses. 

During
the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Trust did not declare quarterly dividends of approximately 490,000 0.484375 per
share per quarter) on Power REIT s 7.75 Series A Cumulative Redeemable Perpetual Preferred Stock. 

Our
primary objective is to maximize the long-term value of the Trust for our shareholders. To that end, our business goals are to obtain
the best possible rental income at our properties in order to maximize our cash flows, net operating income, funds from operations, funds
available for distribution to shareholders and other operating measures and results, and ultimately to maximize the values of our properties. 

To
achieve this primary goal, we have developed a business strategy focused on increasing the values of our properties, and ultimately of
the Trust, which includes: 

Raising capital by monetizing the embedded value in our portfolio
to improve our liquidity position and, as appropriate reducing debt levels to strengthen our balance sheet; 

Selling off non-core properties and underperforming assets; 

Seeking to re-lease properties that are vacant or have non-performing
tenants 

Raising the overall level of quality of our portfolio and of
individual properties in our portfolio; 

Improving the operating results of our properties; and 

Taking steps to position
 the Company for future growth opportunities.

scale solar farms located in Salisbury, Massachusetts for gross proceeds of 1.2 million. The purchaser is an unaffiliated third party
and the price was established based on an arm s length negotiation. As part of the transaction, the Municipal Debt and the PWSS
Term Loan were paid off. 

Our
wholly owned subsidiary, PW MillPro NE LLC, PW MillPro ), owns a 1,121,513 square foot greenhouse cultivation facility
(the MillPro Facility on an approximately 86-acre property and a separate approximately 4.88-acre property with a 21-room
employee housing building (the Housing Facility located in O Neill, Nebraska (collectively the Property ).
Unfortunately, the market for tomatoes compressed and the original tenant was unable to meet its financial obligations and vacated the
property. In February of 2024, PW MillPro entered into a 20-year triple-net lease with a tenant with an initial rent of 1 million per
year after a 6-month deferred rent period along with a Letter of Intent to purchase the property for 9.2 million with a deadline of
December 31, 2024. There can be no assurance that the tenant will fulfill its lease obligations or purchase the property and the tenant
is currently in default on the lease. 

Effective
October 1, 2024, the PW CanRE Holdings entered into an extension of the forbearance agreement with the lender for the Greenhouse Loan. The forbearance
agreement terminates on January 31, 2025. 

On
November 17, 2023, Anchor Hydro Anchor initiated a complaint, as amended, in the Michigan Circuit Court for the County
of Calhoun (Case No. 2023-3145-CB) against Power REIT, PW MI CanRE Marengo LLC (collectively the PW Defendants for Breach
of Contract, Unjust Enrichment and Account Stated in the amount of approximately 600,000. The litigation relates to purported work by
Anchor at the greenhouse property owned by PW MI CanRE Marengo LLC in Michigan. On July 9, 2024, Anchor and the PW Defendants entered
into a settlement agreement whereby Anchor will complete certain work at the greenhouse property in Michigan and the PW Defendants will
pay Anchor 265,000 150,000 up front and 11,500 per month for ten months commencing on September 1, 2024) as well as the return of
certain uninstalled equipment provided by Anchor. In connection with the Anchor Settlement, the Trust recognized 351,000 as income related to forgiveness of accounts
payable during the quarter ended September 30, 2024. 

On
September 11, 2024, PW CO CanRE Cloud Nine LLC received a Final Order and Entry of Judgement in favor of PW CO CanRE Cloud Nine LLC
in the amount of approximately 10.9 million. The Trust is evaluating the potential to collect against the defendants in this
litigation for this Judgement, but will treat any recovery on a cash basis for accounting purposes. 

Improving
Our Balance Sheet by Reducing Debt and Leverage; Maintaining Liquidity 

Leverage 

We
continue to seek ways to reduce our debt and debt leverage by improving our operating performance and through a variety of other means
available to us. These means might include leasing vacant properties, selling properties, raising capital or through other actions. 

Capital
Recycling 

In
the later part of 2022, we commenced property reviews to establish a plan for the portfolio and, where appropriate, have been disposing
of and seeking to dispose of properties that we do not believe meet financial and strategic criteria given economic, market and other
circumstances. Disposing of these properties can enable us to redeploy or recycle our capital to other uses, such as to repay debt, to
reinvest in other real estate assets and development and redevelopment projects, and for other corporate purposes. Along these lines,
in 2023 and 2024 we completed sales of assets for total gross proceeds of approximately 9.81 million which included 2.1 million of
seller financing provided to the buyers. We also have several properties that we are marketing for sale and/or lease which have been
classified as Assets Held for Sale. 

Improving
Our Portfolio 

We
are currently seeking to refine our property holdings by selling properties and/or re-leasing them in an effort to improve the overall
performance going forward.

Taking
Steps to Position the Company for Future Growth Opportunities 

We
are taking steps designed to position the Trust to create shareholder value. In connection therewith, we have implemented processes designed
to ensure strong internal discipline in the use, harvesting and recycling of our capital, and these processes will be applied in connection
with seeking to reposition properties. 

We
may continue to seek to acquire, in an opportunistic, selective and disciplined manner, properties that have operating metrics that are
better than or equal to our existing portfolio averages, and that we believe have strong potential for increased cash flows and appreciation
in value. Taking advantage of any acquisition opportunities would likely involve some use of debt or equity capital. We will pursue transactions
that we expect can meet the financial and strategic criteria we apply, given economic, market and other circumstances. In addition, we
are exploring the potential to use our existing corporate structure for strategic transactions including potentially merging assets or
companies with the Trust.

Critical
Accounting Estimates 

The
consolidated financial statements are prepared in conformity with U.S. GAAP, which requires the use of estimates, judgments and assumptions
that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated
financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses in the periods presented. We believe that the accounting estimates
employed are appropriate and resulting balances are reasonable; however, due to inherent uncertainties in making estimates, actual results
may differ from the original estimates, requiring adjustments to these balances in future periods. The critical accounting estimates
that affect the consolidated financial statements and the judgments and assumptions used are consistent with those described under Part
II, Item 7 of the 2023 10-K. 

Results
of Operations 

Three
Months Ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 

Revenue
during the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was 1,426,112 and 488,531, respectively. Revenue during the three months
ended September 30, 2024, consisted of revenue from lease income from direct financing lease (railroad) of 228,750, total rental
income of 1,138,504 consisting of 200,780 from Regulus (solar farm), 13,000 from Colorado cannabis tenants and 924,724 of
security deposit recognized as rental income due to leases in default and other income of 58,858 consisting mostly of interest
income. The 937,581 increase in total revenue was primarily related to the Trust recognizing security deposits as rental income.
Expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 2023 decreased by 8,409,436 primarily due to a decrease in
non-cash impairment expense of 8,039,733 of property values offset by an increase in interest expense of 205,370 due to the
default interest rate and late charges, forbearance fees, legal fees, foreclosure fees and appraisal fees caused by the default of
the Greenhouse Loan, as well as a decrease in depreciation expense of 420,155 as many of the properties are considered held for
sale and not depreciated, a decrease in property expense of 46,038, a decrease in general and administrative expense of
 101,038, and a decrease in property taxes of 7,842. Other income/expense recognizes an increase forgiveness of accounts
payable by 350,704. Net loss attributable to common shares during the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was 488,222
and 10,185,943, respectively. Net loss attributable to common shares decreased by 9,697,721. 

Nine
Months Ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 

Revenue
during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was 2,480,073 and 1,684,559, respectively. Revenue during the nine months
ended September 30, 2024, consisted of revenue from lease income from direct financing lease (railroad) of 686,250, total rental
income of 1,628,922 consisting of 602,338 from Regulus (solar farm), 101,860 from Colorado and California cannabis tenants and
 924,724 of security deposit recognized as rental income due to leases in default, and other income of 164,901 consisting mostly of
of interest income. The 795,514 increase in total revenue was primarily related to the Trust recognizing security deposits as
rental income. Expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 2023 increased by 9,627,519 primarily due to
an increase in non-cash impairment expense of 9,959,248 of property values and an increase in interest expense of 1,175,784 due to
the default interest and late charges, forbearance fees, legal fees, foreclosure fees and appraisal fees related to the Greenhouse
loan, offset by a decrease in depreciation expense of 957,966 as many of the properties are considered held for sale and not
depreciated, a decrease in property expense of 279,593, a decrease of 90,255 in property tax and a decrease in general and
administrative expenses of 179,699. Other income/expense recognizes a decrease in gain on sale by 646,058 due to a smaller gain of
on the disposal of two properties in January, 2024, loan modification expense decreases by 160,000 and forgiveness of accounts
payable increases by 324,102. Net loss attributable to common shares during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was
 22,036,803 and 13,042,842, respectively. Net loss attributable to common shares increased by 8,993,961. 

Liquidity
and Capital Resources 

Our
cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash totaled 2,395,642 as of September 30, 2024, a decrease of 1,709,242 from December 31,
2023. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the decrease in cash was primarily due to the monthly expenses related to the
vacant greenhouse properties and paydown of the Greenhouse Loan. 

30 

Our
current loan liabilities totaled approximately 17.0 million as of September 30, 2024. The current loan liabilities include approximately
 16.3 million of a bank loan secured by the majority of the greenhouse portfolio (the Greenhouse Loan and which is in
default and is non-recourse to the Trust. We are not current on payment of property taxes for the greenhouse portfolio which are included
on the Balance Sheet as accrued expenses and liabilities held for sale for approximately 996,000. If the property tax remains
delinquent, the greenhouse portfolio will be subject to foreclosure actions starting in 2025. 

Of
the total amount of cash, approximately 2.2 million is non-restricted cash available for general corporate purposes and 163,000 is
restricted cash related to the Greenhouse Loan. 

For
the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Trust determined that there was substantial doubt as to its ability to continue as a going
concern as a result of current liabilities that far exceed current assets, net losses incurred, reduced revenue and increased
property expenses related to the greenhouse portfolio. 

In
early 2024, the Trust sold three properties which should help with liquidity. The net proceeds from the sale of the Salisbury, MA property
was approximately 662,000 of unrestricted cash and the approximately 456,000 loan was retired at closing and is eliminated from current
liabilities. The other sale produced approximately 53,000 of restricted cash and should generate cash flow from the seller financing
provided that should help with liquidity to service the Greenhouse Loan. 

The
Greenhouse Loan is in default and in March 2024, the lender filed a litigation seeking among other things, foreclosure and appointment
of a receiver. Since the Greenhouse Loan is non-recourse to Power REIT which means that in the event it cannot resolve issues with the
lender and they foreclose on the properties, Power REIT should be able to continue as a going concern albeit with a smaller portfolio
of assets given that non-restricted cash should provide greater than twelve months of liquidity for capital needs unrelated to the greenhouse
properties which are security for the Greenhouse Loan. If we cannot resolve matters with the lender, it may lead to distressed sales
which would have a negative impact on our prospects. A forbearance agreement with the lender for the Greenhouse Loan was effective on
May 10, 2024, which provides additional time to retire the loan. The expiration date of the original forbearance agreement was September
30, 2024. On September 30, 2024, the PW CanRE Holdings entered into an amendment to the forbearance agreement which moves the expiration of the forbearance
agreement to January 31, 2025. We are in discussions with the lender to continue a process of orderly sales of assets to try and maximize
value but there can be no assurance the bank will extend the forbearance again if the loan is not retired in a timely fashion. There
can be no assurance that the efforts to sell, re-lease or recapitalize the assets which are security for the Greenhouse Loan will ultimately
retire the loan per the requirements of the forbearance agreement. 

As
of the filing date, The Trust s current liabilities far exceed current assets. If the Trust s plan to focus on selling properties,
entering into new leases, improving cash collections from existing tenants and raising capital in the form of debt or equity is effectively
implemented, the Trust s plan could potentially provide enough liquidity. However, the Trust cannot predict, with certainty, the
outcome of its actions to generate liquidity. 

Our
cash outlays at Power REIT (parent company) consist principally of professional fees, consultant fees, NYSE American listing fees, legal,
insurance, shareholder service company fees, auditing costs and general and administrative expenses. Our cash outlays related to our
various property-owning subsidiaries consist principally of principal and interest expense on debts, property maintenance, property taxes,
insurance, legal as well as other property related expenses that are not covered by tenants. To the extent we need to raise additional
capital to meet our obligations, there can be no assurance that financing on favorable terms will be available when needed. If we are
unable to sell certain assets when anticipated at prices anticipated, we may not have sufficient cash to fund operations and commitments.

FUNDS
FROM OPERATIONS NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES 

We
assess and measure our overall operating results based upon an industry performance measure referred to as Core Funds From Operations Core FFO which management believes is a useful indicator of our operating performance. Core FFO is a non-GAAP financial
measure. Core FFO should not be construed as a substitute for net income (loss) (as determined in accordance with GAAP) for the purpose
of analyzing our operating performance or financial position, as Core FFO is not defined by GAAP. The following is a definition of this
measure, an explanation as to why we present it and, at the end of this section, a reconciliation of Core FFO to the most directly comparable
GAAP financial measure. Management believes that alternative measures of performance, such as net income computed under GAAP, or Funds
From Operations computed in accordance with the definition used by the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts NAREIT ),
include certain financial items that are not indicative of the results provided by our asset portfolio and inappropriately affect the
comparability of the Trust s period-over-period performance. These items include non-recurring expenses, such as one-time upfront
acquisition expenses that are not capitalized under ASC-805 and certain non-cash expenses, including stock-based compensation expense,
amortization and certain up front financing costs. Therefore, management uses Core FFO and defines it as net income excluding such items.
We believe that Core FFO is a useful supplemental measure for the investing community to employ, including when comparing us to other
REITs that disclose similarly Core FFO figures, and when analyzing changes in our performance over time. Readers are cautioned that other
REITs may use different adjustments to their GAAP financial measures than we use, and that as a result, our Core FFO may not be comparable
to the FFO measures used by other REITs or to other non-GAAP or GAAP financial measures used by REITs or other companies. 

A
reconciliation of our Core FFO to net income for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, and 2023 is included in the
table below:

4. Controls and Procedures 

Evaluation
of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

Management
is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate disclosure controls and procedures (as defined Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e)
under the Exchange Act) (to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of our financial reporting and preparation of financial
statements for external purposes in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Our disclosure controls and procedures
are also designed to ensure that such information is accumulated and communicated to management to allow timely decisions regarding required
disclosure. A control system, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired
control objectives. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, internal controls over financial reporting may not prevent
or detect misstatements. The design and operation of a control system must also reflect that there are resource constraints and management
is necessarily required to apply its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls. 

Our
management assessed the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures. Based on our evaluation,
we identified a Material Weakness in our procedures and internal controls over financial reporting and that we had ineffective Disclosure
Control and Procedures as described in the Form 10-Q/A for the quarter ended June 30, 2024. 

Changes
in Internal Control over Financial Reporting: 

During
the fiscal quarter ended September 30, 2024, there were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules
13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) of the Exchange Act) that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal
control over financial reporting.

PART
II. OTHER INFORMATION 

Item
1. Legal Proceedings 

We
are, from time to time, the subject of claims and suits arising out of matters related to our business. In general, litigation claims
can be expensive, and time consuming to bring or defend against and could result in settlements or damages that could significantly affect
financial results. It is not possible to predict the final resolution of the current litigation to which we are party to, and the impact
of certain of these matters on our business, results of operations, and financial condition could be material. Regardless of the outcome,
litigation has adversely impacted our business because of defense costs, diversion of management resources and other factors. 

On
November 17, 2023, Anchor Hydro Anchor initiated a complaint, as amended, in the Michigan Circuit Court for the
County of Calhoun (Case No. 2023-3145-CB) against Power REIT, PW MI CanRE Marengo LLC (collectively the PW Defendants for Breach of Contract, Unjust Enrichment and Account Stated in the amount of approximately 600,000. The litigation relates to
purported work by Anchor at the greenhouse property owned by PW MI CanRE Marengo LLC in Michigan. On July 9, 2024, Anchor and the PW
Defendants entered into a settlement agreement (the Anchor Settlement whereby Anchor will complete certain work at
the greenhouse property in Michigan and the PW Defendants will pay Anchor 265,000 150,000 up front and 11,500 per month for ten
months commencing on September 1, 2024) as well as the return of certain uninstalled equipment provided by Anchor. In connection with the Anchor Settlement, the Trust recognized 351,000 as income related to forgiveness of accounts
payable during the quarter ended September 30, 2024. 

On
March 13, 2024, East West Bank EWB initiated a complaint in the Superior Court of California, County of Los Angeles (Case

LLC, PW CA CanRE Canndescent LLC and PW MI CanRE Marengo LLC. The litigation relates to a loan secured by various properties held by
PW CanRE Holdings, LLC through its ownership of the various subsidiaries that are also named in the complaint. The complaint is seeking
(i) Judicial Foreclosure (ii) Specific Performance (iii) Appointment of Receiver; (iv) Injunctive Relief; (v) Breach of Contract (Security
Agreement); (vi) Breach of Contract (Guaranty); (vii) Money Due; and (viii) Account Stated. A forbearance agreement with the lender for
the Greenhouse Loan was effective on May 10, 2024, which provides additional time to retire the loan. The expiration date of the original
forbearance agreement was September 30, 2024. On September 30, 2024, we entered into an amendment to the forbearance agreement which
moves the expiration of the forbearance agreement to January 31, 2025. We are in discussions with the lender to continue a process of
orderly sales of assets to try and maximize value but there can be no assurance the bank will extend the forbearance. There can
be no assurance that our efforts to sell, re-lease or recapitalize the assets which are security for the Greenhouse Loan will ultimately
retire the loan per the requirements of the forbearance agreement. 

On
September 11, 2024, PW CO CanRE Cloud Nine LLC received a Final Order and Entry of Judgement in favor of PW CO CanRE Cloud Nine LLC
in the amount of approximately 10.9 million. The Trust is evaluating the potential to collect against the defendants in this
litigation for this Judgement, but will treat any recovery on a cash basis for accounting purposes.

Item
1A. Risk Factors. 

The
Trust s results of operations and financial condition are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties as described in the 2023
10-K, which risk factors are incorporated herein by reference. The following information updates, and should be read in conjunction with,
the information disclosed in Part I, Item 1A, Risk Factors, contained in the 2023 10-K. You should carefully consider the
risks set forth in the 2023 10-K and the following risks, together with all the other information in this Report, including our consolidated
financial statements and notes thereto. If any of the risks actually materialize, our operating results, financial condition and liquidity
could be materially adversely affected. Except as disclosed below, there have been no material changes from the risk factors disclosed
in the 2023 10-K. 

We
have identified material weaknesses in our internal controls, and we cannot provide assurances that these material weaknesses will be
effectively remediated or that additional weaknesses will not occur in the future. 

Our
management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over our financial reporting, as defined in Rule
13a- 15(f) under the Exchange Act. We identified a material weakness in our controls relating to accounting for complex transactions.
Specifically, Preferred Shares were historically classified as mezzanine equity instead of being classified as equity. 

While
we have hired outside consultants to aid in our accounting for complex transactions and plan to take remedial action to address the material
weakness in our internal controls, we cannot provide any assurance that such remedial measures, or any other remedial measures we take,
will be effective. In addition, a material weakness will not be considered remediated until the applicable controls operate for a sufficient
period of time and management has concluded, through testing, that these controls are designed and operate effectively. Although management
believes that the material weakness in our internal controls will be remediated, there can be no assurance that the deficiencies will
be remediated in the near future or that the internal control over financial reporting, as modified, will enable us to identify or avoid
material weaknesses in our internal controls in the future. 

As
a result of our failure to maintain an effective system of internal control over financial reporting, we may not be able to accurately
report our financial results or prevent fraud. As a result, security holders could lose confidence in our financial and other public
reporting, which would harm our business and the trading price of our common stock. 

Effective
internal control over financial reporting is necessary for us to provide reliable financial reports and, together with adequate disclosure
controls and procedures, is designed to prevent fraud. Our failure to maintain an effective system of internal controls, and any failure
by us to implement required new or improved internal controls or difficulties encountered in their implementation, could cause us to
fail to meet our reporting obligations. In addition, any testing by us, as and when required, conducted in connection with Section 404
of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, or Section 404, or any subsequent testing by our independent registered public accounting firm, as and when
required, may reveal deficiencies in our internal control over financial reporting that are deemed to be material weaknesses or that
may require prospective or retroactive changes to our financial statements or identify other areas for further attention or improvement.
As a growing company, implementing and maintaining effective controls may require more resources, and we may encounter internal control
integration difficulties. Our failure to maintain effective internal controls over financial reporting, may result in us not being able
to accurately report our financial results, detect or prevent fraud, or file our periodic reports in a timely manner, which may, among
other adverse consequences, cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information and lead to a decline in the trading
price of our common stock.

The
investment portfolio is, and in the future may continue to be, concentrated in its exposure to a relatively few numbers of investments,
industries and lessees. 

Historically,
the Trust s revenue has been concentrated to a relatively limited number of investments, industries and lessees. During the nine
months ended September 30, 2024, Power REIT collected approximately 92 of its consolidated revenue from two properties. The tenants
were Norfolk Southern Railway and Regulus Solar, LLC which represent 49 and 43 of consolidated revenue, respectively. The concentration
percentages do not include the income from the recognition of security deposits related to defaulted leases. As we see additional properties,
our revenue may be concentrated in a smaller number of investments. 

We
are exposed to risks inherent in this sort of investment concentration. Financial difficulty or poor business performance on the part
of any single lessee or a default on any single lease will expose us to a greater risk of loss than would be the case if we were more
diversified and holding numerous investments, and the underperformance or non-performance of any of its assets may severely adversely
affect our financial condition and results from operations. Our lessees could seek the protection of bankruptcy, insolvency or similar
laws, which could result in the rejection and termination of our lease agreements and could cause a reduction in our cash flows. Furthermore,
we may continue to concentrate our investment activities in the CEA and cannabis sectors, which subjects us to more risks than if we
were diversified across many sectors. At times, the performance of the infrastructure sector may lag the performance of other sectors
or the broader market as a whole. 

If
our acquisitions or our overall business performance fail to meet expectations, the amount of cash available to us to pay dividends may
decrease and we could default on our loans, which are secured by collateral in our properties and assets. 

We
may not be able to achieve operating results that will allow us to pay dividends at a specific level or to increase the amount of these
dividends from time to time. Also, restrictions and provisions in any credit facilities we enter into or any debt securities we issue
may limit our ability to pay dividends. We cannot assure you that you will receive dividends at a particular time, or at a particular
level, or at all. 

Unfortunately,
our tenants related to the greenhouse portfolio have failed to perform on their lease obligations which has created a significant liquidity
issue related to this portfolio of assets. Power REIT entered into a Greenhouse Loan with initial availability of 20 million that is
non-recourse to Power REIT and has liens against the Power REIT greenhouse portfolio of properties. The balance of the loan as of September
30, 2024, is approximately 16,267,000 and is in default. In March 2024, the lender filed a litigation seeking among other things, foreclosure
and appointment of a receiver. Unfortunately, this may lead to distressed sales which would have a negative impact on our prospects.
If we should fail to generate sufficient revenue to pay our outstanding secured debt obligations, the lenders may foreclose on the security
pledged decreasing our ability to generate revenue and our ability to pay dividends. In addition, Maryland law prohibits the payment
of dividends if we are unable to pay our debts as they come due. A forbearance agreement with the lender for the Greenhouse Loan was
effective on May 10, 2024, which provides additional time to retire the loan. The original expiration date of the forbearance agreement
was September 30, 2024. On September 30, 2024, the we entered into an amendment to the forbearance agreement which moves the expiration
of the forbearance agreement to January 31, 2025. The Trust is in discussions with the lender to continue a process of orderly sales
of assets to try and maximize value but there can be no assurance the bank will extend the forbearance again if the loan is not retired
in a timely fashion. There can be no assurance that the efforts to sell, re-lease or recapitalize the assets which are security
for the Greenhouse Loan will ultimately retire the loan per the requirements of the forbearance agreement. 

PW
Regulus Solar, LLC PWRS ), one of our subsidiaries, entered into the 2015 PWRS Loan Agreement (as defined below) that is
non-recourse to Power REIT and secured by all of PWRS interest in the land and intangibles. As of September 30, 2024, the balance
of the 2015 PWRS Loan was approximately 6,506,000 (net of unamortized debt costs of approximately 219,000). 

Pittsburgh
 West Virginia Railroad PWV ), one of our subsidiaries, entered into a Loan Agreement in the amount of 15,500,000
that is non-recourse to Power REIT and secured by our equity interest in our subsidiary PWV which is pledged as collateral. The balance
of the loan as of September 30, 2024 is 14,253,000 (net of approximately 269,000 of capitalized debt costs). 

36 

We
have substantial debt and preferred shares outstanding with substantial liquidation preference, which could adversely affect our overall
financial health and our operating flexibility. 

We
may need to raise additional capital or sell additional properties to fund our operations in order to continue as a going concern. 

As
of September 30, 2024, we had an accumulated deficit of 46.5 million and a net loss attributable to common shareholders of 22 million.
As of December 31, 2023, we had an accumulated deficit of 25.0 million and a net loss attributable to common shareholders of 15 million.
As of September 30, 2024, the Trust had approximately 2.4 million of cash and approximately 17.0 million of current loan liabilities.
The current loan liabilities include approximately 16.3 million of a bank loan secured by the majority of the greenhouse portfolio (the
 Greenhouse Loan and which is non-recourse to the Trust. 

Of
the total amount of cash, approximately 2.2 million is non-restricted cash available for general corporate purposes and 163,000 is
restricted cash related to the Greenhouse Loan. 

For
the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and the year ended December 31, 2023, the Trust determined that there was substantial doubt
as to its ability to continue as a going concern as a result of net losses incurred, reduced revenue and increased property
maintenance expenses related to the greenhouse portfolio. 

While
the current liabilities far exceed the current assets, if the Trust s plan to focus on selling properties, entering into new leases,
improving cash collections from existing tenants and the raising capital in the form of debt or equity is effectively implemented, the
Trust s plan could potentially provide enough liquidity to fund its operations. However, the Trust cannot predict, with certainty,
the outcome of its actions to generate liquidity, including its ability to sell properties, and the failure to do so could negatively
impact its future operations. 

In
early 2024, the Trust sold three properties which should help with liquidity. The net proceeds from the sale of the Salisbury, MA property
was approximately 662,000 of unrestricted cash and the approximately 456,000 loan was retired at closing and is eliminated from current
liabilities. The other sale produced approximately 53,000 of restricted cash and will generate cash flow from seller financing provided
that should help with liquidity to service the Greenhouse Loan. 

The
Greenhouse Loan is in default and we continue to work with the bank to establish a path forward. However, the Greenhouse Loan is non-recourse
to Power REIT which means that in the event it cannot resolve issues with the bank and they foreclose on the properties, Power REIT should
be able to continue as a going concern albeit with a significantly smaller portfolio of assets. In March 2024, the lender filed a litigation
seeking among other things, foreclosure and appointment of a receiver (See Note 6 LONG-TERM DEBT). A forbearance agreement with
the lender for the Greenhouse Loan was entered into effective May 10, 2024, which provides additional time to retire the loan. The expiration
date of the original forbearance agreement was September 30, 2024. On September 30, 2024, we entered into an amendment to the forbearance
agreement which moves the expiration of the forbearance agreement to January 31, 2025. We are in discussions with the lender to continue
a process of orderly sales of assets to try and maximize value but there can be no assurance the bank will extend the forbearance again
if the loan is not retired in a timely fashion. There can be no assurance that our efforts to sell, re-lease or recapitalize the
assets which are security for the Greenhouse Loan will ultimately retire the loan per the requirements of the forbearance agreement. 

The
issuance of securities with claims that are senior to those of our common shares, including our Series A Preferred Stock, may limit or
prevent us from paying dividends on its common shares. There is no limitation on our ability to issue securities senior to the Trust s
common shares or incur indebtedness. 

Our
common shares are equity interests that rank junior to our indebtedness and other non-equity claims with respect to assets available
to satisfy claims against us, and junior to our preferred securities that by their terms rank senior to our common shares in our capital
structure, including our Series A Preferred Stock. As of September 30, 2024, we had outstanding debt in the principal amount of 37.0
million and 8.5 million (par value) of Series A Preferred Stock. This debt and these preferred securities rank senior to the Trust s
common shares in our capital structure. We expect that in due course we may incur more debt, and issue additional preferred securities
as we pursue our business strategy. 

37 

In
the case of indebtedness, specified amounts of principal and interest are customarily payable on specified due dates. In the case of
preferred securities, such as our Series A Preferred Stock, holders are provided with a senior claim to distributions, according to the
specific terms of the securities. In contrast, however, in the case of common shares, dividends are payable only when, as and if declared
by the Trust s board of trustees and depend on, among other things, the Trust s results of operations, financial condition,
debt service requirements, obligations to pay distributions to holders of preferred securities, such as the Series A Preferred Stock,
other cash needs and any other factors that the board of trustees may deem relevant or that they are required to consider as a matter
of law. The incurrence by the Trust of additional debt, and the issuance by the Trust of additional preferred securities, may limit or
eliminate the amounts available to the Trust to pay dividends on our Series A Preferred Stock and common shares. 

From
time to time, our management team may own interests in our lessees or other counterparties, and may thereby have interests that conflict
or appear to conflict with the Trust s interests. 

On
occasion, our management may have financial interests that conflict, or appear to conflict with the Trust s interests. For
example, four of Power REIT s properties were leased by tenants in which Millennium Sustainable Ventures Corp., formerly
Millennium Investment Acquisition Company (ticker: MILC) had controlling interests. David H. Lesser, Power REIT s
Chairman and CEO, is also Chairman and CEO of MILC. MILC established cannabis cultivation projects in Colorado (through a loan),
Oklahoma, and Michigan which are related to our May 21, 2021, June 11, 2021, and September 3, 2021 acquisitions and a food crop
cultivation project in Nebraska related to our March 31, 2022 acquisition. Total rental income recognized for the nine months ended
September 30, 2024 from the affiliated tenants in Colorado, Oklahoma and Nebraska was 0. Total rental income recognized for the
three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 785,000 and 785,000, respectively, from the tenant affiliated with MILC in
Michigan based on the recognition of a security deposit as income during the third quarter of 2024. Total rental income recognized for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 is 0 from the tenants that
are affiliated with MILC in Michigan. The above leases are currently
in default and the Trust is evaluating the best path forward related thereto. Also, a portion of the property improvement budget
contained in a lease amendment with NorthEast Kind Assets, LLC for the property located in Maine, amounting to 2,205,000, was to be
supplied by IntelliGen Power Systems LLC which is owned by HBP, an affiliate of David Lesser, Power REIT s Chairman and CEO.
On January 23, 2023, the lease was amended to restructure the timing of rent payments and eliminate the funding of remaining capital
improvements for the cogeneration project, which includes eliminating payments that were expected to be paid to IntelliGen, a
related party. As of September 30, 2024, 1,102,500 had been paid to IntelliGen for equipment supplied. 

Although
our Declaration of Trust permits this type of business relationship and a majority of our disinterested trustees must approve, and in
those instances did approve, Power REIT s involvement in such transactions, in any such circumstance, there may be conflicts of
interest between Power REIT on one hand, and subsidiaries of MILC, IntelliGen, Mr. Lesser and his affiliates and interests on the other
hand, and such conflicts may be unfavorable to us.
