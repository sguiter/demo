 The valuation of these instruments is determined using widely accepted valuation techniques including discounted cash flow analysis on the expected cash flows of each derivative. This analysis reflects the contractual terms of the derivatives, including the period to maturity, and uses observable market-based inputs, including interest rate curves. 
 
 To comply with the provisions of ASC 820, the Company incorporates credit valuation adjustments to appropriately reflect both its own nonperformance risk and the respective counterparty s nonperformance risk in the fair value measurements. In adjusting the fair value of its derivative contracts for the effect of nonperformance risk, the Company has considered the impact of netting and any applicable credit enhancements, such as collateral postings, thresholds, mutual puts, and guarantees. 
 
 Although the Company has determined that the majority of the inputs used to value its derivatives fall within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy, the credit valuation adjustments associated with its derivatives utilize Level 3 inputs, such as estimates of current credit spreads to evaluate the likelihood of default by itself and its counterparties. However, as of September 30, 2024, the Company has assessed the significance of the impact of the credit valuation adjustments on the overall valuation of its derivative positions and has determined that the credit valuation adjustments are not significant to the overall valuation of its derivatives. As a result, the Company has determined that its derivative valuations in their entirety are classified in Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy.

 Business Overview 
 
 We are an internally managed real estate company that acquires, owns, and manages a diversified portfolio of single-tenant, retail commercial real estate subject to long-term net leases with high credit quality tenants across the United States. We also invest in property developments and mortgage loans secured by real estate. As of September 30, 2024, we owned or had investments in 671 single-tenant retail net leased properties that were diversified by tenant, industry and geography, including 93 different tenants, across 26 retail sectors in 45 states. This excludes eight property developments where rent has yet to commence. We focus on tenants in industries where a physical location is critical to the generation of sales and profits, with a focus on necessity goods and essential services in the retail sector, including home improvement, auto parts, drug stores and pharmacies, general retail, grocers, convenience stores, discount stores, and quick-service restaurants, all of which we refer to as defensive retail industries. As of September 30, 2024, our investments generated ABR 1 of 157.0 million. Approximately 61 of our ABR is from investment grade 2 credit rated tenants and an additional 14 of our ABR is derived from tenants with an investment grade profile 3 . Exclusive of mortgage loans receivable, our portfolio was 100 occupied with a weighted average remaining lease term WALT of 9.5 years, which we believe provides us with a strong stable source of recurring cash flow from our portfolio.

 Results of Operations 
 
 Overall 
 
 We continued to grow our assets during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 through the acquisition of properties, property developments, and investment in mortgage loans receivable. This growth was financed through a 100.0 million draw on our 250.0 million sustainably-linked senior unsecured term loan (the 2029 Term Loan ), settlement of shares of common stock through our forward sale agreements in an amount of 135.4 million, the usage of cash balances as a result of borrowings on our Revolver, the usage of restricted cash balances as a result of tax-free exchanges under Section 1031 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, and cash flows from operations during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 
 
 Acquisitions 
 
 During the three months ended September 30, 2024, we acquired 22 properties for a total purchase price of 111.5 million, inclusive of 1.1 million of capitalized acquisition costs. The acquisitions were all accounted for as asset acquisitions. These properties are located in 10 states with a WALT of approximately 12.1 years. The underwritten weighted-average capitalization rate on our second quarter acquisitions was approximately 7.3 . 
 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we acquired 68 properties for a total purchase price of 302.3 million, inclusive of 2.8 million of capitalized acquisition costs. The acquisitions were all accounted for as asset acquisitions. These properties are located in 24 states with a WALT of approximately 13.2 years. The underwritten weighted-average capitalization rate on our year to date acquisitions was approximately 7.3 . 
 
 Development 
 
 As of September 30, 2024, we had six property developments under construction. During the three months ended September 30, 2024, we invested 5.0 million in property developments. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we invested 27.9 million in property developments, including the land acquisition of four new developments with a combined initial purchase price of 2.0 million. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we completed development on 16 projects and reclassified approximately 47.8 million from property under development to land, buildings and improvements, and other assets (leasing commissions) in the accompanying condensed consolidated balance sheets. Rent commenced for 14 of the completed developments during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, while rent is expected to commence for the other two completed developments in the fourth quarter of 2024. The remaining six developments are expected to be substantially completed with rent commencing at various points throughout the fourth quarter of 2024 and the first quarter of 2025. The purchase price, including acquisition costs, and subsequent development are included in property under development in the accompanying condensed consolidated balance sheets as of September 30, 2024. 
 
 Dispositions

 Investment in Mortgage Loans Receivable 
 
 During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, we invested an additional 21.0 million and 39.0 million, respectively, in fully collateralized mortgage loans receivable with stated interest rates ranging from 6.9 to 13.1 , inclusive of 12.7 million provided through seller financing transactions for both periods presented. In addition, during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, we collected 8.9 million and 11.3 million, respectively, in principal on our mortgage loans receivable. The mortgage loans receivable are collateralized by real estate, primarily leased by investment grade credit rated tenants. The funds provided under the loans, in addition to discount and loan origination costs, net of loan origination fees of less than 0.2 million, are included in mortgage loans receivable, net in the accompanying condensed consolidated balance sheets as of September 30, 2024. See Note 4 - Real Estate Investments in Item 1 - Financial Statements (unaudited) for further discussion on our mortgage loans receivable portfolio. 
 
 Economic and Financial Environment 
 
 The annual inflation rate for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was 2.4 and 3.7 , respectively. While the Federal Reserve raised interest rates in an effort to lower inflation throughout 2022 and the first half of 2023, rates had remained unchanged for nearly a year until the first rate cut occurred in September 2024. There continues to be uncertainty in 2024 as to whether rates will be maintained or further cut, and the timing of potential cuts, leading to uncertainties in the financing market and broader economy. 
 
 In the commercial real estate market, property prices generally continue to fluctuate, which may impact our investment capitalization rates and operating costs. Likewise, during certain periods, including the current market, the credit markets have experienced significant price volatility, dislocations, and liquidity disruptions, which may impact our access to and cost of capital. We continually monitor the commercial real estate and credit markets carefully and, if required, will make decisions to adjust our business strategy accordingly.

 Revenue. Revenue for the three months ended September 30, 2024 increased by 7.4 million to 41.4 million from 34.0 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023, which is attributed to an increase in the number of our operating leases and properties securing our mortgage loans. The increase includes additional cash rental receipts of 6.8 million, an increase of 1.0 million related to interest income on mortgage loans receivable, and an increase of 0.5 million in straight-line rental revenue. The increase in revenue is offset by 0.6 million in other revenue recognized in the prior year related to the receipt of legal settlement proceeds associated with a lease termination, combined with net decreases of property expense reimbursements of 0.4 million. 
 
 Total operating expenses. Total expenses increased by 12.6 million to 39.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to 26.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase is primarily attributed to an increase in the number of operating properties, with the most significant increases being depreciation and amortization expense, provisions for impairment, and property-specific reimbursable expenses. The increase is offset by a decrease in payroll related costs. Total operating expenses include the following: 
 
 Property expenses. Property expenses increased 0.6 million to 4.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 from 3.9 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase is primarily attributed to the increase in the number of operating properties, including combined net increases of reimbursable property expenses of 0.6 million, of which 0.3 million, 0.1 million, and 0.2 million were related to reimbursable common area maintenance costs, reimbursable property insurance, and reimbursable property taxes, respectively. 
 
 General and administrative expenses. General and administrative expenses decreased 0.8 million to 4.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 from 5.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The decreases within general and administrative expense were primarily related to decreases of 0.3 million of payroll expenses and 0.7 million of bonus expenses, offset by other combined net increases of 0.2 million. While our general and administrative expenses will continue to rise in some measure as our portfolio grows, we expect that such expenses as a percentage of our portfolio will decrease over time due to efficiencies and economies of scale. 
 
 Depreciation and amortization. Depreciation and amortization expense increased 4.6 million to 20.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 from 15.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in depreciation and amortization is proportionate to the increase in the size of the portfolio over the comparable period with associated increases primarily in building depreciation expense of 2.5 million, building improvements depreciation expense of 0.9 million, and in-place lease amortization expense of 0.9 million. 
 
 Provision for impairment. For the three months ended September 30, 2024, we recorded provisions for impairment of 9.8 million on 18 properties, the majority of which were newly classified as held-for-sale or disposed of during the three months ended September 30, 2024. Three of the properties were held for investment as of September 30, 2024. For the three months ended September 30, 2023, we recorded provisions for impairment of 1.5 million on seven properties, which were either previously classified as held-for-sale, newly classified as held-for-sale, or disposed of during the three months ended September 30, 2023. These disposals relate to management s continuous assessment of our portfolio in an effort to improve returns and manage risk exposure. 
 
 Interest expense, net. Interest expense increased by 4.1 million to 8.0 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 from 3.9 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase is primarily attributed to an increase of 1.2 million of interest incurred under our 250.0 million senior unsecured term loan (the 2029 Term Loan ), an increase of 1.0 million of interest incurred under our 175.0 million senior unsecured term loan (the 2027 Term Loan ), an increase of 1.5 million of interest incurred under our Revolver primarily due to a increase in average borrowings outstanding during the respective periods, and a decrease of 0.3 million of interest capitalized on our property developments. 
 
 (Loss) gain on sales of real estate, net. Net loss on sales of real estate increased by 0.5 million to 0.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 from a 0.4 million net gain for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The table below summarizes the properties sold for the periods indicated (dollars in thousands):

Table of Contents 

 Other income (expense), net. The change in other income (expense), net is primarily related to a 0.2 million decrease in interest income earned on our cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash balances as presented in the condensed consolidated balance sheets, offset by a 0.3 million increase in insurance proceeds associated with property damages related to flooding. 
 
 Net (loss) income. Net (loss) income decreased 9.5 million to a net loss of 5.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 from net income of 4.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. Net (loss) income decreased primarily due to increases in interest expense, depreciation and amortization expense, and provisions for impairment, as set forth above. These decreases are offset by increases in additional rental revenues primarily due to the growth in the size of our real estate investment portfolio, in addition to increased interest income associated with our mortgage loans receivable.

 Revenue. Revenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 increased by 23.7 million to 118.7 million from 95.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, which is attributed to an increase in the number of our operating leases and properties securing our mortgage loans. The increase includes additional cash rental receipts of 20.2 million, an increase of 3.3 million related to interest income on mortgage loans receivable, and an increase of 1.0 million in straight-line rental revenue, offset by 0.6 million of combined net decreases of property expense reimbursements. 
 
 Total operating expenses. Total expenses increased by 24.0 million to 101.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to 77.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023.

 Property expenses. Property expenses increased 1.2 million to 12.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from 11.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023.

Table of Contents 

 General and administrative expenses. General and administrative expenses were 15.3 million for both the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. The net changes within general and administrative expense were primarily related to decreases of 0.7 million of payroll expenses and 1.1 million of bonus expenses, and decreases of 0.3 million of corporate insurance premiums, offset by increases in employee severance of 1.5 million, including cash severance of 1.0 million and the expense associated with the accelerated vesting of stock-based compensation of 0.5 million, and an increase of 0.6 million of stock-based compensation. While our general and administrative expenses will continue to rise in some measure as our portfolio grows, we expect that such expenses as a percentage of our portfolio will decrease over time due to efficiencies and economies of scale. 
 
 Depreciation and amortization. Depreciation and amortization expense increased 9.9 million to 56.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from 46.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in depreciation and amortization is proportionate to the increase in the size of the portfolio over the comparable period with associated increases primarily in building depreciation expense of 5.9 million, building improvements depreciation expense of 1.9 million, in-place lease amortization expense of 1.5 million, leasehold improvements depreciation expense of 0.3 million, and amortization of leasing commissions of 0.3 million. 
 
 Provision for impairment.

Nine of the properties were held for investment as of September 30, 2024. For the nine months ended September 30, 2023, we recorded provisions for impairment of 4.4 million on 10 properties, which were either previously classified as held-for-sale, newly classified as held-for-sale, or disposed of during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. These disposals relate to management s continuous assessment of our portfolio in an effort to improve returns and manage risk exposure. 
 
 Interest expense, net. Interest expense increased by 8.3 million to 21.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from 13.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase is primarily attributed to an increase of 6.6 million of interest incurred under our 2029 Term Loan, an increase of 2.5 million of interest incurred under our 2027 Term Loan, an increase of 0.5 million of interest incurred under our Revolver primarily due to an increase in average borrowings outstanding during the respective periods, and an increase of 0.5 million of loan fee amortization.

 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 
 Our primary capital requirements are to fund property acquisitions and developments, fund investments in mortgage loans receivable and required interest payments, and fund working capital needs, operating expenses, and capital expenditures. Our capital resources primarily consist of cash from operations, sales of equity securities and available borrowing facilities. As of September 30, 2024, we had 175.0 million outstanding principal amount under the senior unsecured term loan (the 2027 Term Loan ), 200.0 million outstanding principal amount under the senior unsecured term loan (the 2028 Term Loan ), 250.0 million outstanding principal amount under the 2029 Term Loan, and 150.0 million of borrowings outstanding under our 400.0 million senior unsecured revolving credit facility (the Revolver ). Additionally, as of September 30, 2024, we had 30.6 million and 2.6 million of unsettled forward equity under the 2023 ATM Program and 2024 ATM Program, respectively. As of September 30, 2024, 300.0 million of remaining gross proceeds were available for future issuances of shares of our common stock under the 2024 ATM Program, inclusive of unsettled shares under forward sale agreements. Lastly, we had 152.3 million of unsettled forward equity under the January 2024 forward sale agreements as of September 30, 2024. 
 
 We believe the availability of proceeds from the settlement of unsettled outstanding forward sale agreements, future issuances of shares of our common stock under the 2024 ATM Program, or subsequent at-the-market sale programs, as well as our cash flows from operations and available borrowing capacity under the Revolver, will be adequate to support our ongoing operations and to fund our debt service requirements, capital expenditures and working capital requirements for at least the next 12 months. We anticipate funding our long-term capital needs through cash provided from operations, borrowings under our Revolver, and issuances of common stock. 
 
 Contractual Obligations and Commitments 
 
 As of September 30, 2024, our contractual debt obligations primarily include the maturity of our 2027 Term Loan with the scheduled principal payment due on January 15, 2026, the maturity of our 2028 Term Loan with the scheduled principal payment due on February 11, 2028, the maturity of our 2029 Term Loan with the scheduled principal payment due on July 3, 2026, and the repayment of borrowings on our Revolver with a contractual maturity of August 11, 2026.

 (1) We entered into five interest rate hedges to fix the base interest rate (daily SOFR) on our 2027 Term Loan. The hedged fixed rate reset effective November 27, 2023 to 1.87 and will reset again effective December 23, 2024 to 2.40 . Accordingly, the projected interest rate obligations for the variable rate 2027 Term Loan are based on the hedged fixed rate of 1.87 through December 23, 2024, and 2.40 thereafter, compared to the variable 2027 Term Loan daily SOFR rate as of September 30, 2024 of 4.83 , plus a SOFR adjustment of 0.10 , and applicable margin of 1.15 based on the 175.0 million 2027 Term Loan outstanding through the contractual maturity date of January 15, 2026. 
 (2) We entered into three interest rate hedges to fix the base interest rate (one-month SOFR) on our 2028 Term Loan. Accordingly, the projected interest rate obligations for the variable rate 2028 Term Loan are based on the hedged fixed rate of 2.63 compared to the variable 2028 Term Loan one-month SOFR rate as of September 30, 2024 of 5.20 , plus a SOFR adjustment of 0.10 and applicable margin of 1.15 based on the 200.0 million 2028 Term Loan outstanding through the maturity date of February 11, 2028. 
 (3) We entered into four interest rate hedges to fix the base interest rate (daily SOFR) on our 2029 Term Loan. Accordingly, the projected interest rate obligations for the variable rate 2029 Term Loan are based on the hedged fixed rate of 3.74 compared to the variable 2029 Term Loan daily SOFR rate as of September 30, 2024 of 4.83 , plus a SOFR adjustment of 0.10 and applicable margin of 1.15 based on the 250.0 million 2029 Term Loan outstanding through the contractual maturity date of July 3, 2026. 
 (4) We are subject to a facility fee of 0.15 on our Revolver. 
 
 In August 2021, we entered into a lease agreement on a new corporate office space, which is classified as an operating lease. We began operating out of the new office in February 2022. The lease has a remaining noncancellable term of 7.8 years that expires on July 31, 2032 and is renewable at our option for two additional periods of five years. Annual rent expense, excluding operating expenses, is approximately 0.5 million during the initial term. 
 
 Additionally, in the normal course of business, we enter into various types of commitments to purchase real estate properties, fund development projects, or extend funds under mortgage notes receivable. These commitments are generally subject to our customary due diligence process and, accordingly, a number of specific conditions must be met before we are obligated to purchase or extend funding. As of September 30, 2024, we had commitments to fund properties under development and extend funds under mortgage notes receivable totaling 11.2 million and 13.5 million, respectively. Funding of properties under development is expected to occur over the next 9 months and funding of mortgage notes receivable is expected to occur throughout 2024 and 2025.

 Historical Cash Flow Information 
 
 Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 Compared with Nine Months Ended September 30, 2023 
 Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 (In thousands) (Unaudited) Net cash provided by (used in): Operating activities 62,128 51,512 Investing activities (319,379) (345,731) Financing activities 256,072 231,610 
 
 Cash Flows Provided By Operating Activities. Net cash provided by operating activities increased by 10.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase was largely attributed to the increase in the size of our real estate investment portfolio with an increase in rental receipts of 20.2 million, additional interest received under our mortgage loans receivable, offset primarily by an increase in cash interest paid of 10.0 million, increases in operating and general and administrative expenses paid associated with our larger portfolio, and further offset by changes in working capital accounts. 
 
 Cash Flows Used In Investing Activities. Net cash used in investing activities decreased by 26.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease was primarily due to a decrease in cash invested in mortgage loans receivable of 39.3 million, an increase of 18.1 million from proceeds from the sale of real estate, an increase of 11.3 million in principal collections on mortgage loans receivable, and a decrease of 10.4 million in real estate development and improvements, offset by an increase of 5.4 million of earnest money deposits and an increase of 47.6 million in acquisitions of real estate.

 Cash Flows Provided By Financing Activities. Net cash provided by financing activities increased by 24.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase was primarily attributed to an increase in net borrowings of 141.0 million under our Revolver during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, and a 3.3 million decrease in deferred financing costs. This increase is offset by a decrease in proceeds received of 50.0 million from term loans during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, 59.4 million of less proceeds received in 2024 due to fewer issuances of common stock in connection with our 2021 ATM Program and settlements of common stock under forward sale agreements. Lastly, the increase is further offset by 8.7 million of additional common stock dividends paid during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, and a 0.8 million increase in the repurchase of common stock for tax withholding obligations. 
 
 Income Taxes 
 
 The Company elected to be treated and qualify as a REIT for U.S. federal income tax purposes beginning with its short taxable year ended December 31, 2019. To qualify as a REIT, the Company must meet certain organizational, income, asset and distribution tests. Accordingly, the Company will generally not be subject to corporate U.S. federal or state income tax to the extent that it makes qualifying distributions of all of its taxable income to its stockholders and provided it satisfies on a continuing basis, through actual investment and operating results, the REIT requirements, including certain asset, income, distribution and share ownership tests. The Company intends to make sufficient distributions during 2024 to receive a full dividends paid deduction. 
 
 We maintain a taxable REIT subsidiary TRS which may be subject to U.S. federal, state, and local income taxes on its taxable income. In general, our TRS may perform services for tenants of the Company, hold assets that the Company cannot hold directly and may engage in any real estate or non-real estate-related business. 
 
 Recent Accounting Pronouncements 
 
 A discussion of recent accounting pronouncements and their possible effects on our condensed consolidated financial statements is included in Note 2 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in Item 1 Financial Statements (unaudited). 
 
 Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 
 
 Our accounting policies have been established to conform with U.S. GAAP. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires us to use judgment in the application of accounting policies, including making estimates and assumptions. These judgments affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the dates of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting periods. Management believes that we have made these estimates and assumptions in an appropriate manner and in a way that accurately reflects our financial condition. We continually test and evaluate these estimates and assumptions using our historical knowledge of the business, as well as other factors, to ensure that they are reasonable for reporting purposes. However, actual results may differ from these estimates and assumptions. If our judgment or interpretation of the facts and circumstances relating to the various transactions had been different, it is possible that different accounting policies would have been applied, thus resulting in a different presentation of the financial statements. Additionally, other companies may utilize different estimates that may impact comparability of our results of operations to those of companies in similar businesses. A summary of our critical accounting policies is included in the section entitled Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, which is accessible on the SEC s website at www.sec.gov. There have been no material changes to these policies during the periods covered by this quarterly report. 
 
 Non-GAAP Financial Measures 
 
 Our reported results are presented in accordance with GAAP. We also disclose the following non-GAAP financial measures: Funds From Operations FFO ), Core FFO, Adjusted FFO AFFO ), earnings before interest expense, income tax expense, and depreciation and amortization EBITDA ), EBITDA further adjusted to exclude gains (or losses) from the sales of depreciable property and real estate impairment losses EBITDAre ), Adjusted EBITDAre, Annualized Adjusted EBITDAre, Net Debt, Adjusted Net Debt, property-level net operating income Property-Level NOI ), property-level cash net operating income Property-Level Cash NOI ), property-level cash net operating income estimated run rate Property-Level Cash NOI Estimated Run Rate ), and total property-level cash net operating income estimated run rate Total Property-Level Cash NOI Estimated Run Rate ), all of which are detailed below. We believe these non-GAAP financial measures are industry measures used by analysts and investors to compare the operating performance of REITs.

 FFO, Core FFO and AFFO 
 
 The National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts ("NAREIT"), an industry trade group, has promulgated a widely accepted non-GAAP financial measure of operating performance known as FFO. Our FFO is net income in accordance with GAAP, excluding gains (or losses) resulting from dispositions of properties, plus depreciation and amortization and impairment charges on depreciable real property. 
 
 Core FFO is a non-GAAP financial measure defined as FFO adjusted to remove the effect of unusual and non-recurring items that are not expected to impact our operating performance or operations on an ongoing basis. These include non-recurring executive transition costs, severance and related charges, other loss (gain), net, and loss on debt extinguishments and other related costs. 
 
 AFFO is a non-GAAP financial measure defined as Core FFO adjusted for GAAP net income related to non-cash revenues and expenses, such as straight-line rent, amortization of above- and below-market lease-related intangibles, amortization of lease incentives, capitalized interest expense and earned development interest, non-cash interest expense, non-cash compensation expense, amortization of deferred financing costs, amortization of above/below-market assumed debt, and amortization of loan origination costs. 
 
 Historical cost accounting for real estate assets implicitly assumes that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time. In fact, real estate values historically have risen or fallen with market conditions. FFO is intended to be a standard supplemental measure of operating performance that excludes historical cost depreciation and valuation adjustments from net income. We consider FFO to be useful in evaluating potential property acquisitions and measuring operating performance. 
 
 We further consider FFO, Core FFO and AFFO to be useful in determining funds available for payment of distributions. FFO, Core FFO and AFFO do not represent net income or cash flows from operations as defined by GAAP. You should not consider FFO, Core FFO and AFFO to be alternatives to net income as a reliable measure of our operating performance nor should you consider FFO, Core FFO and AFFO to be alternatives to cash flows from operating, investing or financing activities (as defined by GAAP) as measures of liquidity. 
 
 FFO, Core FFO and AFFO do not measure whether cash flow is sufficient to fund our cash needs, including principal amortization, capital improvements and distributions to stockholders. FFO, Core FFO and AFFO do not represent cash flows from operating, investing or financing activities as defined by GAAP. Further, FFO, Core FFO and AFFO as disclosed by other REITs might not be comparable to our calculations of FFO, Core FFO and AFFO.

 EBITDA, EBITDAre, Adjusted EBITDAre and Annualized Adjusted EBITDAre 
 
 We compute EBITDA as earnings before interest expense, income tax expense, and depreciation and amortization. In 2017, NAREIT issued a white paper recommending that companies that report EBITDA also report EBITDA re . We compute EBITDA re in accordance with the definition adopted by NAREIT. NAREIT defines EBITDA re as EBITDA (as defined above) excluding gains (or losses) from the sales of depreciable property and impairment charges on depreciable real property. 
 
 Adjusted EBITDA re is a non-GAAP financial measure defined as EBITDA re further adjusted to exclude straight-line rent, non-cash compensation expense, non-recurring executive transition costs, severance and related charges, loss on debt extinguishment and other related costs, other non-recurring loss (gain), net, other non-recurring expenses (income), lease termination fees, adjustment for construction in process, and adjustment for intraquarter activities. Annualized Adjusted EBITDA re is Adjusted EBITDA re multiplied by four. 
 
 We present EBITDA, EBITDA re , Adjusted EBITDA re and Annualized Adjusted EBITDA re as they are measures commonly used in our industry. We believe that these measures are useful to investors and analysts because they provide supplemental information concerning our operating performance, exclusive of certain non-cash items and other costs. We use EBITDA, EBITDAre, Adjusted EBITDA re and Annualized Adjusted EBITDA re as measures of our operating performance and not as measures of liquidity. 
 
 EBITDA, EBITDA re , Adjusted EBITDA re and Annualized Adjusted EBITDA re do not include all items of revenue and expense included in net income, they do not represent cash generated from operating activities and they are not necessarily indicative of cash available to fund cash requirements; accordingly, they should not be considered alternatives to net income as a performance measure or cash flows from operations as a liquidity measure and should be considered in addition to, and not in lieu of, GAAP financial measures. Additionally, our computation of EBITDA, EBITDA re , Adjusted EBITDA re and Annualized Adjusted EBITDA re may differ from the methodology for calculating these metrics used by other equity REITs and, therefore, may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other equity REITs.

 Net Debt and Adjusted Net Debt 
 
 We calculate our Net Debt as our principal amount of total debt outstanding excluding deferred financing costs, net discounts and debt issuance costs less cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash available for future investment. 
 
 We further adjust Net Debt by the net value of unsettled forward equity as of period end to derive Adjusted Net Debt. We believe excluding cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash available for future investment from our principal amount in addition to excluding the net value of unsettled forward equity, all of which could be used to repay debt, provides an estimate of the net contractual amount of borrowed capital to be repaid. We believe these adjustments are additional beneficial disclosures to investors and analysts. 
 
 The following table reconciles the principal amount of total debt to Net Debt and Adjusted Net Debt (in thousands): As of September 30, 2024 Principal amount of total debt 783,245 Less: Cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash (28,750) Net Debt 754,495 Less: Value of unsettled forward equity (1)

 Property-Level NOI, Property-Level Cash NOI, Property-Level Cash NOI - Estimated Run Rate, and Total Cash NOI - Estimated Run Rate 
 
 Property-Level NOI, Property-Level Cash NOI, Property-Level Cash NOI - Estimated Run Rate, and Total Cash NOI - Estimated Run Rate are non-GAAP financial measures which we use to assess our operating results. We compute Property-Level NOI as net income (computed in accordance with GAAP), excluding general and administrative expenses, interest expense (or income), income tax expense, transaction costs, depreciation and amortization, gains (or losses) on sales of depreciable property, real estate impairment losses, interest income on mortgage loans receivable, loss on debt extinguishment, lease termination fees and other expense (income), net. We further adjust Property-Level NOI for non-cash revenue components of straight-line rent and amortization of lease-intangibles to derive Property-Level Cash NOI. We further adjust Property-Level Cash NOI for intraquarter acquisitions, dispositions and completed development to derive Property-Level Cash NOI - Estimated Run Rate. We further adjust Property-Level Cash NOI - Estimated Run Rate for interest income on mortgage loans receivable and intraquarter mortgage loan activity to derive Total Cash NOI - Estimated Run Rate. We believe Property-Level NOI, Property-Level Cash NOI, Property-Level Cash NOI - Estimated Run Rate, and Total Cash NOI - Estimated Run Rate provide useful and relevant information because they reflect only those income and expense items that are incurred at the property level and present such items on an unlevered basis. 
 
 Property-Level NOI, Property-Level Cash NOI, Property-Level Cash NOI - Estimated Run Rate, and Total Cash NOI - Estimated Run Rate are not measurements of financial performance under GAAP, and may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies. You should not consider our measures as alternatives to net income or cash flows from operating activities determined in accordance with GAAP.

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 
 
 Our future income, cash flows and fair value relevant to our financial instruments depend upon prevailing market interest rates. Market risk refers to the risk of loss from adverse changes in market prices and interest rates. Based upon the nature of our operations, the principal market risk to which we are exposed is the risk related to interest rate fluctuations. As of September 30, 2024, we had total indebtedness of approximately 175.0 million under the 2027 Term Loan, 200.0 million under the 2028 Term Loan, 250.0 million under the 2029 Term Loan, and 150.0 million of borrowings under our Revolver, all of which is floating rate debt with a variable interest rate. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, we had average daily outstanding borrowings on our Revolver of 105.9 million and 85.8 million, respectively. 
 Effective through the fully extended maturity dates of January 15, 2027, February 11, 2028, and January 3, 2029, we entered into interest rate derivative contracts in order to hedge our market interest risk associated with the 2027 Term Loan, 2028 Term Loan, and 2029 Term Loan, respectively. The interest rate derivative contracts convert the variable rate debt on the term loans to a fixed interest rate (as further described in Note 6 - Debt in our condensed consolidated financial statements). 
 
 Additionally, we will occasionally fund acquisitions through the use of our Revolver which bears an interest rate determined by either (i) SOFR, plus a SOFR adjustment of 0.10 , plus a margin ranging from 1.00 to 1.45 , based on our consolidated total leverage ratio, or (ii) a Base Rate (as defined in the Credit Agreement), plus a margin ranging from 0.00 to 0.45 , based on our consolidated total leverage ratio. Many factors, including governmental monetary and tax policies, domestic and international economic and political considerations, and other factors that are beyond our control contribute to our interest rate risk. Based on the results of our sensitivity analysis and daily outstanding borrowings on the Revolver during 2024, which assumes a 1 adverse change in the interest rate as of September 30, 2024, the estimated market risk exposure was approximately 0.9 million.
