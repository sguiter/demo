and uncertainties. Forward-looking statements include statements we make concerning our plans, objectives, goals, strategies, future

When used in this quarterly report, the words estimates, expects, anticipates, projects, 
 forecasts, plans, intends, believes, foresees, seeks, 
 likely, may, might, will, should, goal, target 
or intends and variations of these words or similar expressions (or the negative versions of any such words) are intended
to identify forward-looking statements. All forward-looking statements are based upon information available to us on the date of this
Quarterly Report. 

These
forward-looking statements are subject to risks, uncertainties and other factors, many of which are outside of our control, that could
cause actual results to differ materially from the results discussed in the forward-looking statements. These risks and uncertainties
are discussed in the Risk Factors section of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended January 31, 2024, filed
with the Securities and Exchange Commission on June 3, 2024, as the same may be updated from time to time. 

All
forward-looking statements attributable to us in this Quarterly Report apply only as of the date of this Quarterly Report and are expressly
qualified in their entirety by the cautionary statements included in this Quarterly Report. Should one or more of these risks or uncertainties
materialize, or should any of our assumptions prove incorrect, actual results may vary in material respects from those projected in these
forward-looking statements. We undertake no obligation to publicly update or revise forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances
after the date made or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events, except as required by law.

Recent
Developments 

On
December 18, 2022, we entered into a Share Exchange Agreement (the Exchange Agreement with Yulia Lazaridou, our then-majority
stockholder, PCI, and the PCI stockholders (collectively, the PCI Stockholders ). Pursuant to the terms of the Exchange
Agreement, the PCI Stockholders exchanged an aggregate of 50,000 shares of PCI common stock, representing 50 of the outstanding PCI
common stock, for 18,000,000 shares of our common stock. 

11 

In
addition, on December 18, 2022, in a transaction related to and a condition to the Exchange, Ms. Lazaridou and the Company entered into
that certain Resignation, Separation and Release Agreement (the Resignation Agreement ), pursuant to which (i) we redeemed
2,800,000 shares of Company common stock owned by Ms. Lazaridou (the Lazaridou Shares in exchange for a payment by us
of 540,904; and (b) Ms. Lazaridou resigned as our sole director and officer, effective as of December 21, 2022. 

In
order to fund the payment for the Lazaridou Shares, contemporaneous with the Exchange, on December 18, 2022, PCI loaned 540,904 to us.
The loan (the PCI Loan matures on June 30, 2023 and earns interest at an annual rate of 1 . 

In
addition, on December 18, 2022, Ms. Lazaridou, as sole director and majority stockholder, (i) elected Matthew Feinstein as sole director

Resignation Agreement. 

As
a result of the above-described transactions, the Company is 50 owned by the PCI Stockholders and PCI is 50 owned by the Company. 

On
December 30, 2022, we notified Financial Industry Regulatory Authority FINRA of our intent to change our corporate name
from Minaro Corp. to Pineapple Express Cannabis Company and to change our trading symbol. These corporate
actions are subject to FINRA review and clearance. 

On
January 5, 2023, the Company filed Restated Articles of Incorporation with the State of Nevada following approval of the sole director
and majority shareholder Restated Articles ). The Restated Articles (i) changed the name of the Company to Pineapple Express
Cannabis Company, (ii) added an additional authorized class of capital stock, namely ten million (10,000,000) shares of Preferred Stock,
in addition to the previously authorized seventy-five million (75,000,000) shares of Common Stock. As a result, the name of the Company
now has been changed to Pineapple Express Cannabis Company. 

On
December 30, 2022 the Company applied to the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority FINRA for approval with respect
to the change of the Company s name in the Restated Articles. The Company separately applied to FINRA to change the Company s
stock ticker trading symbol. These two corporate actions were subject to FINRA review and clearance which was received during the prior
reporting period. 

Results
of Operations 

Three
Months Ended July 31, 2024 Compared to Three Months Ended July 31, 2024 

Revenues 

For
the three months ended July 31, 2024 and 2023, the Company generated revenues of 9,872 and 0, respectively. The increase was primarily
due to the Company s management fee revenue during the quarter. 

Cost
of Goods Sold 

For
the three months ended July 31, 2024 and 2023, the cost of goods sold was 0 and 0, respectively. 

Total
Operating Expenses 

Total
operating expenses for the three months ended July 31, 2024 and 2023 were 5,852 and 19,247, respectively. The increase was primarily
due to an increase in legal fees and audit fees, partly due to the sale of the Company and the acquisition of PCI by the Company. Operating
expenses for the three months ended July 31, 2024 consisted of bank charges; depreciation expense and professional fees. Operating expenses
for the three months ended July 31, 2023 consisted of bank charges; depreciation expense; legal fees; audit fees; consulting fees; and
professional fees. 

12 

Net
Income (Loss) 

Net
income (loss) for the three months ended April 30, 2024 and 2023 was 3,616) and 179,708 respectively. The increase in net income in
2023 was primarily due to recognition of gain from the PCI subsidiary using the equity-investment method, subsequently this amount was
written off at year-end January 31, 2024 as it was deemed to be potentially uncollectible. 

Liquidity
and Capital Resources 

As
of July 31, 2024, the Company had cash of 0 and an accumulated deficit of 919,554. To date, we have financed our operations primarily
through the issuance of debt and equity sourced capital. 

The
following table sets forth a summary of our cash flows for the three months ended July 31, 2024 and 2023:

Since
inception, we have financed our cash flow requirements primarily through issuance of common stock and debt financing. As we expand our
activities, we may continue to experience net negative cash flows from operations. We anticipate obtaining additional financing to fund
operations through additional common stock offerings, to the extent available, or to obtain additional financing to the extent necessary
to augment our working capital. There can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain financing on commercially acceptable terms,
if at all. 

We
anticipate that we will incur operating losses in the next 12 months. Our lack of operating history makes predictions of future operating
results difficult to ascertain. Our prospects must be considered in light of the risks, expenses and difficulties frequently encountered
by companies in their early stage of development, particularly companies in new and rapidly evolving markets. There can be no assurance
that we will be successful in addressing such risks, and the failure to do so can have a material adverse effect. 

Critical
Accounting Policies and Estimates 

Our
management s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our unaudited consolidated
financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles GAAP ).
The preparation of our unaudited consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported
amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported
amounts of revenue and expenses during the reported period. In accordance with GAAP, we base our estimates on historical experience and
on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from these estimates under
different assumptions or conditions. 

Off-Balance
Sheet Arrangements 

We
do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial
condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources
that are material to investors.

4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 

Evaluation
of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

Disclosure
controls and procedures are controls and other procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our
reports filed or submitted under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act is recorded, processed,
summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include,
without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in company reports filed or
submitted under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Principal Financial
Officer, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 

As
required by Rules 13a-15 and 15d-15 under the Exchange Act, our Chief Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer carried out an
evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of April 30, 2023. Based upon
his evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer concluded that, as of April 30, 2023, our disclosure controls
and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) were not effective. 

We
do not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures will prevent all errors and all instances of fraud. Disclosure controls and
procedures, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the
disclosure controls and procedures are met. Further, the design of disclosure controls and procedures must reflect the fact that there
are resource constraints, and the benefits must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all disclosure
controls and procedures, no evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures can provide absolute assurance that we have detected all
our control deficiencies and instances of fraud, if any. The design of disclosure controls and procedures also is based partly on certain
assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated
goals under all potential future conditions. 

Changes
in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 

During
the three months ended April 30, 2024, there has been no change in our internal control over financial reporting that has materially
affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
