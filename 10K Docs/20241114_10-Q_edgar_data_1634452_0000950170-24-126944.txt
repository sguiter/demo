In order for the Fund not to be subject to U.S. federal excise taxes, it must distribute annually an amount at least equal to the sum of (i) of its net ordinary income (taking into account certain deferrals and elections) for the calendar year, (ii) of its capital gains in excess of capital losses for the one-year period ending on October 31 of the calendar year and (iii) any net ordinary income and capital gains in excess of capital losses for preceding years that were not distributed during such years. The Fund, at its discretion, may carry forward taxable income in excess of calendar year dividends and pay a nondeductible U.S. federal excise tax on this income. The Fund will accrue excise tax on estimated undistributed taxable income as required. As of September 30, 2024, and December 31, 2023, the Fund had excise tax The Fund may be subject to taxes imposed by countries in which the Fund invests. Such taxes are generally based on income and/or capital gains earned or repatriated.

The Fund remains subject to examination by U.S. federal and state jurisdictions, as well as international jurisdictions, and upon completion of these examinations (if undertaken by the taxing jurisdiction) tax adjustments may be necessary and retroactive to all open tax years.

. The base management fee is calculated based on a percentage of the average outstanding assets of the Fund (which equals the gross value of equity and debt instruments, including investments made utilizing leverage), excluding cash and cash equivalents, during such fiscal quarter. The average outstanding assets is calculated by taking the average of the amount of assets of the Fund at the beginning and end of each month that occurs during the calculation period. The base management fee is calculated and paid quarterly in arrears but will be accrued monthly by the Fund over the fiscal quarter for which such base management fee is paid. On March 24, 2022, the Fund entered into the second amended and restated investment advisory agreement (the Second Amended and Restated Advisory Agreement ), replacing the Amended and Restated Advisory Agreement pursuant to which effective March 24, 2022 the base management fee shall be calculated at an annual rate of . For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Fund incurred a management fee of and , respectively. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, the Fund incurred a management fee of and , respectively. As of September 30, 2024, and December 31, 2023, and , respectively, of accrued management fee remained payable. The Fund also pays the Adviser an incentive fee that provides the Adviser with a share of the income that the Adviser generates for the Fund. The incentive fee consists of an income-based incentive fee component and a capital-gains component, which are largely independent of each other, with the result that one component may be payable even if the other is not. Income-Based Incentive Fee: The income-based incentive fee is calculated and payable quarterly in arrears based on the Fund s net investment income prior to any deductions with respect to such income-based incentive fees and capital gains incentive fees Pre-incentive Fee Net Investment Income or PIFNII for the quarter, as further described below. PIFNII means interest income, dividend income and any other income (including any other fees, such as commitment, origination, structuring, diligence, managerial and consulting fees or other fees the Fund receives from portfolio companies) that the Fund accrues during the fiscal quarter, minus the Fund s operating expenses for the quarter (including the base management fee, expenses payable under the administration agreement (the Administration Agreement the Fund has entered into with State Street Bank and Trust (the Administrator ), and any interest expense and dividends paid on any issued and outstanding indebtedness or preferred stock, respectively, but excluding, for avoidance of doubt, the income-based incentive fee, as well as the capital gains incentive fee (described below), accrued under GAAP). PIFNII also includes, in the case of investments with a deferred interest feature (such as original issue discount, debt instruments with pay-in-kind interest and zero-coupon securities), accrued income that the Fund has not yet received in cash. The Adviser is not under any obligation to reimburse the Fund for any part of the income-based incentive fees it received that was based on accrued interest that the Fund never actually received. PIFNII does not include any realized capital gains, realized capital losses or unrealized capital appreciation or depreciation. Because of the structure of the income-based incentive fee, it is possible that the Fund may accrue such income-based incentive fee in a quarter where the Fund incurs a net loss. For example, if the Fund receives PIFNII in excess of a hurdle rate (as defined below) for a quarter, the Fund will accrue the applicable income-based incentive fee even if the Fund has incurred a realized and/or unrealized capital loss in that quarter. However, cash payment of the income-based incentive fee may be deferred in this situation, subject to the restrictions detailed at the end of this section. PIFNII, expressed as a rate of return on the average value of the Fund s net assets (defined as total assets, less indebtedness and before taking into account any incentive fees payable during the period) as of the first day of each month during the course of the immediately preceding calendar quarter, will be compared to various hurdle rates, with the income-based incentive fee rate of return increasing at each hurdle rate.

For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Fund incurred income-based incentive fees of and , respectively. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, the Fund incurred income-based incentive fees of and , respectively. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, , and , respectively, of accrued income-based incentive fees remained payable. The capital gains fee shall be determined and payable in arrears as of the end of each calendar year (or upon termination of this Agreement as set forth below), and will equal 20.0 of the Fund s aggregate cumulative realized capital gains, if any, from the date of the Fund s election to be regulated as a BDC through the end of each calendar year, computed net of all aggregate cumulative realized capital losses and aggregate cumulative unrealized capital depreciation, less the aggregate amount of any previously paid capital gain incentive fees, with respect to each of the investments in the Fund s portfolio. The Fund s aggregate cumulative realized capital gains will not include any unrealized appreciation. The capital gains fee is not subject to any minimum return to stockholders. If such amount is negative, then no capital gains fee will be payable for such year. In the event that the Second Amended and Restated Advisory Agreement shall terminate as of a date that is not a calendar year end, the termination date shall be treated as though it were a calendar year end for purposes of calculating and paying a capital gains fee. While the capital gains fee to be paid is determined above, GAAP requires such fee to be accrued as if the Fund were to be terminated and liquidated at period end hypothetical liquidation. There was capital gains incentive fee under GAAP recognized for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, and , respectively, of capital gains incentive fee remained payable. . The amount of capital gains incentive fee expense related to a hypothetical liquidation of the portfolio (and assuming no other changes in realized or unrealized gains and losses) would only become payable to the Adviser in the event of a complete liquidation of the Fund s portfolio as of period end and the termination of the Second Amended and Restated Advisory Agreement on such date. Also, it should be noted that the capital gains incentive fee expense fluctuates with the Fund s overall investment results. The Fund will defer cash payment of any income-based incentive fee and/or any capital gains incentive fee otherwise earned by the Adviser if during the most recent four full fiscal quarter periods ending on or prior to the date such payment is to be made, the sum of (a) the PIFNII, and (b) the realized capital gain / loss and (c) unrealized capital appreciation/ depreciation expressed as a rate of

. Any such deferred fees are carried over for payment in subsequent calculation periods to the extent such payment is payable under the Second Amended and Restated Advisory Agreement.

Under the Administration Agreement, the Administrator will be responsible for providing the Fund with clerical, bookkeeping, recordkeeping and other administrative services. The Fund will reimburse the Adviser an amount equal to its allocable portion (subject to the review of the Fund s Board) of its overhead resulting from its obligations under the Expense Reimbursement Agreement, including the allocable portion of the cost of its Chief Compliance Officer and Chief Financial Officer and their respective staffs.

The actual percentage of Operating Expenses paid by the Fund in any quarter after deducting any Expense Payment, as a percentage of the Fund s average quarterly gross assets, is referred to as the Percentage Limit. Any Expense Payment by the Adviser pursuant to the Expense Support and Conditional Reimbursement Agreement will be subject to repayment by the Fund on a quarterly basis within the three years following the fiscal quarter of the Fund in which the Operating Expenses were paid or absorbed, if the total Operating Expenses for the current quarter, including Reimbursement Payments, expressed as a percentage of the Fund s average gross assets during such quarter is less than the then-current Percentage Limit, if any, and the Percentage Limit that was in effect at the time when the Adviser reimbursed the Operating Expenses that are the subject of the repayment, subject to certain provisions of the Expense Support and Conditional Reimbursement Agreement, as described below. For purposes of the Expense Support and Conditional Reimbursement Agreement, Operating Expenses means the Fund s Total Operating Expenses (as defined below), excluding base management fees, incentive fees, distribution and stockholder servicing fees, financing fees and costs, interest expense, brokerage commissions and extraordinary expenses and Total Operating Expenses means all of the Fund s operating costs and expenses incurred, as determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles for investment companies. However, no Reimbursement Payment for any quarter will be made if: (1) the Effective Rate of Distributions Per Share (as defined below) declared by the Fund at the time of such Reimbursement Payment is less than or equal to the Effective Rate of Distributions Per Share at the time the Expense Payment was made to which such Reimbursement Payment relates, or (2) the Fund s Operating Expense Ratio at the time of such Reimbursement Payment is greater than or equal to the Operating Expense Ratio (as defined below) at the time the Expense Payment was made to which such Reimbursement Payment relates. For purposes of the Expense Support and Conditional Reimbursement Agreement, Effective Rate of Distributions Per Share means the annualized rate (based on a 365- day year) of regular cash distributions per Share exclusive of returns of capital, distribution rate reductions due to distribution and stockholder fees, and declared special dividends or special distributions, if any. The Operating Expense Ratio is calculated by dividing Operating Expenses in any quarter by the Fund s average net assets in such quarter. The specific amount of expenses paid by the Adviser, if any, will be determined at the end of each quarter. The Fund or the Adviser may terminate the Expense Support and Conditional Reimbursement Agreement at any time, with or without notice. The Expense Support and Conditional Reimbursement Agreement will automatically terminate in the event of (a) the termination of the Second Amended and Restated Advisory Agreement, or (b) the Board of the Fund making a determination to dissolve or liquidate the Fund. Upon termination of the Expense Support and Conditional Reimbursement Agreement, the Fund will be required to fund any Expense Payments, subject to the aforementioned requirements per the Expense Support and Conditional Reimbursement Agreement, that have not been reimbursed by the Fund to the Adviser. As of September 30, 2024, there was expense support provided and reimbursement payments were made. Transfer Agency Agreement On September 26, 2017, the Fund and Alliance Bernstein Investor Services, Inc.

Co-investment Activity The Fund may be prohibited under the 1940 Act from participating in certain transactions with its affiliates without prior approval of the directors who are not interested persons, and in some cases, the prior approval of the SEC. The Fund, the Adviser and certain of their affiliates have been granted exemptive relief by the SEC for the Fund to co-invest with other funds managed by the Adviser or its affiliates in a manner consistent with the Fund s investment objective, positions, policies, strategies and restrictions as well as regulatory requirements and other pertinent factors. Pursuant to such exemptive relief, the Fund generally is permitted to co-invest with certain of its affiliates if a required majority (as defined in Section 57(o) of the 1940 Act) of the Board make certain conclusions in connection with a co-investment transaction, including that (1) the terms of the transaction, including the consideration to be paid, are reasonable and fair to the Fund and its shareholders and do not involve overreaching of the Fund or its shareholders on the part of any person concerned, (2) the transaction is consistent with the interests of the Fund s shareholders and is consistent with its investment objective and strategies, (3) the investment by its affiliates would not disadvantage the Fund, and the Fund s participation would not be on a basis different from or less advantageous than that on which its affiliates are investing and (4) the proposed investment by the Fund would not benefit the Adviser or its affiliates or any affiliated person of any of them (other than the parties to the transaction), except to the extent permitted by the exemptive relief and applicable law, including the limitations set forth in Section 57(k) of the 1940 Act. As a result of exemptive relief, there could be significant overlap in the Fund s investment portfolio and the investment portfolio of other funds managed by the Adviser or its affiliates that could avail themselves of the exemptive relief and that have an investment objective similar to the Fund s.

Dividend Reinvestment Plan On September 26, 2017, the Fund adopted a dividend reinvestment plan, which was amended and restated on November 11, 2021 (the DRIP ). Pursuant to the DRIP (both before and after it was amended), stockholders receive dividends or other distributions in cash unless a stockholder elects to reinvest his or her dividends and other distributions. As a result of adopting the DRIP, if the Board authorizes, and the Fund declares, a cash dividend or distribution, stockholders who have opted into the DRIP will have their cash dividends or distributions automatically reinvested in additional Shares, rather than receiving cash.

 Forward-Looking Statements 
 This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q (this Quarterly Report contains forward-looking statements that involve substantial risks and uncertainties. Such statements involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors, and undue reliance should not be placed thereon. These forward-looking statements are not historical facts, but rather are based on current expectations, estimates and projections about the Fund, its current and prospective portfolio investments, its industry, its beliefs and opinions, and its assumptions.

 an economic downturn could impair the Fund s portfolio companies ability to continue to operate, which could lead to the loss of some or all of the Fund s investments in such portfolio companies; 

such an economic downturn could disproportionately impact the companies that the Fund intends to target for investment, potentially causing the Fund to experience a decrease in investment opportunities and diminished demand for capital from these companies; 

a contraction of available credit and/or an inability to access the equity markets could impair the Fund s lending and investment activities; 

interest rate volatility could adversely affect the Fund s results, particularly if the Fund elects to use leverage as part of its investment strategy; 

the Fund s future operating results; 

the Fund s business prospects and the prospects of the Fund s portfolio companies; 

the Fund s contractual arrangements and relationships with third parties; 

the ability of the Fund s portfolio companies to achieve their objectives;

the effect of legal, tax and regulatory changes; and 

the other risks, uncertainties and other factors the Fund identifies under Risk Factors of its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023. 

Although the Fund believes that the assumptions on which these forward-looking statements are based are reasonable, any of those assumptions could prove to be inaccurate, and as a result, the forward-looking statements based on those assumptions also could be inaccurate. In light of these and other uncertainties, the inclusion of a projection or forward-looking statement in this report should not be regarded as a representation by the Fund that the Fund s plans and objectives will be achieved. These risks and uncertainties include those described or identified in the section entitled Item 1A. Risk Factors of the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023, and elsewhere in this report. These forward-looking statements apply only as of the date of this report. Moreover, the Fund assumes no duty and does not undertake to update the forward-looking statements. The forward-looking 
 63 

statements and projections contained in this Quarterly Report are excluded from the safe harbor protection provided by Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act because the Fund is an investment company. 
 The following analysis of the Fund s financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the Fund s financial statements and the related notes thereto contained elsewhere in this Quarterly Report. 
 Overview 
 The Fund was formed on February 6, 2015 as a corporation under the laws of the State of Maryland. The Fund is structured as an externally managed, non-diversified, closed-end management investment company. The Fund was formed to invest primarily in primary-issue middle-market credit opportunities that are directly sourced and privately negotiated. The Fund commenced investment operations on November 15, 2017 Commencement ). The Fund is advised by AB Private Credit Investors LLC (the Adviser ), which is registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission SEC under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, as amended (the Advisers Act ). The Adviser is responsible for sourcing potential investments, conducting due diligence on prospective investments, analyzing investment opportunities, structuring investments and monitoring the Fund s portfolio on an ongoing basis. State Street Bank and Trust Company (the Administrator provides the administrative services necessary for the Fund to operate. 
 The Fund has elected to be treated as a BDC under the 1940 Act. The Fund has also elected to be treated and intends to qualify annually as a RIC under Subchapter M of the Code for U.S. federal income tax purposes. As a BDC and a RIC, respectively, the Fund is and will be required to comply with various regulatory requirements, such as the requirement to invest at least 70 of its assets in qualifying assets, source of income limitations, asset diversification requirements, and the requirement to distribute annually at least 90 of its taxable income and tax exempt interest. 
 The Fund is an emerging growth company, as defined in the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act JOBS Act ). For so long as the Fund remains an emerging growth company under the JOBS Act, the Fund will be subject to reduced public company reporting requirements. The Fund expects to remain an emerging growth company until the earliest of: 
 the last day of the Fund s fiscal year in which the fifth anniversary occurs of the date of the first sale of common equity securities pursuant to an effective registration statement; 

the end of the fiscal year in which the Fund s total annual gross revenues first equal or exceed 1.235 billion; 

the date on which the Fund has, during the prior three-year period, issued more than 1.0 billion in non-convertible debt; and 

the last day of a fiscal year in which the Fund (1) has an aggregate worldwide market value of shares of its common stock held by non-affiliates of 700.0 million or more, computed at the end of each fiscal year as of the last business day of the Fund s most recently completed second fiscal quarter and (2) has been an Exchange Act reporting company for at least one year (and filed at least one annual report under the Exchange Act). 

Under the JOBS Act and the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the Dodd-Frank Act ), the Fund is exempt from the provisions of Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, which would require that the Fund s independent registered public accounting firm provide an attestation report on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting, until such time as the Fund ceases to be an emerging growth company and become an accelerated filer as defined in Rule 12b-2 under the Exchange Act. This may increase the risk that material weaknesses or other deficiencies in the Fund s internal control over financial reporting go undetected. 
 Under the JOBS Act, emerging growth companies can delay adopting new or revised accounting standards until such time as those standards apply to private companies. The Fund intends to take advantage of the extended transition period. 
 The Private Offering 
 The Fund enters into separate subscription agreements (each, a Subscription Agreement, and collectively, the Subscription Agreements with investors providing for the private placement of its common stock (the Shares in reliance on exemptions from the registration requirements of the Securities Act (such offering, the Private Offering ). Each investor makes a capital commitment (a Capital Commitment to purchase Shares pursuant to a Subscription Agreement. Investors are required to make capital contributions Capital Contributions to purchase Shares each time the Fund delivers a capital call notice, which is issued based on the Fund s anticipated investment activities and capital needs, delivered at least 10 business days prior to the required funding date, provided that investors may fund such requirements sooner than the deadline as agreed between the Fund and the investor. Generally, purchases of Shares are made pro rata in accordance with each investor s Capital Commitment, in an amount not to exceed each 
 64 

investor s remaining capital commitment Remaining Commitment ), at a per Share price equal to the net asset value per Share subject to any adjustments. Pursuant to the Private Offering, the Fund s initial closing occurred on September 29, 2017. 
 The Fund may accept additional Capital Commitments quarterly Subsequent Closings from new investors as well as existing investors that wish to increase their commitment and shareholding in the Fund. These Subsequent Closings are expected to occur on a calendar-quarter end based on investor interest as well as the state of the market and the Fund s capacity to invest the additional capital within a reasonable period. Each Capital Commitment is for the life of the Fund or for a shorter period based on the investor s liquidation election, subject to the Fund s receipt of exemptive relief that would permit stockholders to liquidate their investments pursuant to transactions that are currently prohibited by the 1940 Act and would require an SEC order in order to be established. 
 Revenues 
 The Fund s investment objective is to generate current income and prioritize capital preservation through a portfolio that primarily invests in directly-sourced, privately-negotiated, secured, middle market loans. The Fund intends to primarily invest in middle market businesses based in the United States. The Fund expects that the primary use of proceeds by the companies in which the Fund invests will be for leveraged buyouts, recapitalizations, mergers and acquisitions and growth capital. 
 The Fund will seek to build its portfolio in a defensive manner that minimizes cyclical and correlated risks across individual names and sector verticals by targeting companies with strong underlying business models and durable intrinsic value. 
 The Fund will primarily hold secured loans, which encompass traditional first lien, unitranche and second lien loans, but may also invest in mezzanine, structured preferred stock and non-control equity co-investment opportunities. The Fund will seek to deliver attractive risk adjusted returns with lower volatility and low correlation relative to the public credit markets. The Adviser believes the Fund s flexibility to invest across the capital structure and liquidity spectrum will allow the Fund to optimize investor risk-adjusted returns. 
 Expenses 
 Under the Second Amended and Restated Advisory Agreement, the Fund s primary operating expenses will include the payment of fees to the Adviser, the Fund s allocable portion of overhead expenses under the Expense Reimbursement Agreement and other operating costs described below. The Fund bears all other out-of-pocket costs and expenses of the Fund s operations and transactions, including those relating to:

Generally, when interest and/or principal payments on a loan become past due, or if the Fund otherwise does not expect the borrower to be able to service its debt and other obligations, the Fund will place the loan on non-accrual status and will cease recognizing interest income on that loan for financial reporting purposes until all principal and interest have been brought current through payment or due to restructuring such that the interest income is deemed to be collectible. The Fund generally restores non-accrual loans to accrual status when past due principal and interest is paid and, in the management s judgment, is likely to remain current. As of September 30, 2024 the Fund had twenty one investments, across six issuers, that were on non-accrual status. As of December 31, 2023, the Fund had twelve investments, with three issuers that were on non-accrual status.

The federal income tax characterization of distributions declared and paid for the fiscal year will be determined at fiscal year-end based upon the Fund s investment company taxable income for the full fiscal year and distributions paid during the full year. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, all of the Fund s distributions to stockholders were attributable to ordinary income. The character of distributions for federal income tax purposes are determined in accordance with income tax regulations which may differ from GAAP. Stockholders should read any written disclosure accompanying a distribution payment carefully and should not assume that the source of any distribution is only ordinary income or gains. 
 To the extent the Fund s taxable earnings fall below the total amount of its distributions paid for that fiscal year, a portion of those distributions may be deemed a return of capital to the Fund s stockholders for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Thus, the source of a distribution to stockholders may be the original capital invested by the stockholder rather than the Fund s income or gains.

 Co-investment Exemptive Order 
 On August 6, 2018, the SEC granted the Fund relief sought in a new exemptive application that expands the co-investment exemptive relief previously granted to the Fund in October 2016 to allow the Fund to co-invest in portfolio companies with Affiliated Funds in a manner consistent with its investment objective, positions, policies, strategies and restrictions as well as regulatory 
 76 

requirements and other pertinent factors, subject to compliance with the Order. Pursuant to the Order, the Fund is permitted to co-invest with Affiliated Funds, which the new exemptive relief defines to include affiliated managed accounts, if, among other things, a required majority (as defined in Section 57(o) of the 1940 Act) of the Fund s independent directors make certain conclusions in connection with a co-investment transaction, including that (1) the terms of the transactions, including the consideration to be paid, are reasonable and fair to the Fund and the Fund s stockholders and do not involve overreaching in respect of the Fund or the Fund s stockholders on the part of any person concerned, and (2) the transaction is consistent with the interests of the Fund s stockholders and is consistent with the Fund s investment objective and strategies. The Fund intends to co-invest with Affiliated Funds, subject to the conditions included in the Order. 
 Asset Coverage 
 In accordance with the 1940 Act, the Fund has historically only been allowed to borrow amounts such that its asset coverage, as defined in the 1940 Act, is at least 200 after such borrowing, permitting the Fund to borrow up to one dollar for investment purposes for every one dollar of investor equity. Asset coverage generally refers to a company s total assets, less all liabilities and indebtedness not represented by senior securities, as defined in the 1940 Act, divided by total senior securities representing indebtedness and, if applicable, preferred stock. Senior securities for this purpose includes borrowings from banks or other lenders, debt securities and preferred stock. 
 On March 23, 2018, the SBCAA was signed into law. The SBCAA, among other things, modifies the applicable provisions of the 1940 Act to reduce the required asset coverage ratio applicable to BDCs from 200 to 150 subject to certain approval, time and disclosure requirements (including either stockholder approval or approval of a majority of the directors who are not interested persons of the BDC and who have no financial interest in the proposal). On July 5, 2018, the Board voted to approve the adoption of the reduced asset coverage ratio and separately recommended that Investors approve the reduced asset coverage requirements at the 2018 annual meeting of stockholders. On September 26, 2018, at the Fund s 2018 annual meeting of stockholders, the Fund s stockholders approved the reduction of the required minimum asset coverage ratio applicable to the Fund from 200 to 150 , which took effect on September 27, 2018. This reduction in the required minimum asset coverage ratio increases the amount of debt that the Fund is permitted to incur, permitting the Fund to borrow up to two dollars for investment purposes for every one dollar of investor equity. 
 
 As of September 30, 2024, and December 31, 2023, the Fund had total senior securities of 1,025,791,351 and 860,575,617, respectively, consisting of borrowings under the Credit Facilities, secured borrowings and the Notes, and had asset coverage ratios of 157 and 159 , respectively. 
 Critical Accounting Policies 
 Valuation of Investments 
 The Fund measures the value of its investments at fair value accordance with Accounting Standards Codification Topic 820, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosure , or ASC Topic 820, issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board, or FASB. Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. 
 Pursuant to the amended SEC Rule 2a-5 of the 1940 Act, the Board designated the Adviser as the Fund s valuation designee. In this capacity, the Adviser is responsible, among other things, for making all fair value determinations relating to the Fund s portfolio investments, subject to the Board s oversight. Investments are valued at fair value as determined in good faith by our Adviser, as valuation designee, based on input of management, the audit committee and independent valuation firms that have been engaged to assist in the valuation of each portfolio investment without a readily available market quotation under a valuation policy. The Adviser principally carries out its fair value responsibilities through its Valuation Sub-Committee. This valuation process is conducted at the end of each fiscal quarter. 
 The audit committee of the Board (the Audit Committee is also responsible for assisting the Adviser, as valuation designee in valuing investments that are not publicly traded or for which current market values are not readily available. Investments for which market quotations are readily available are valued using market quotations, which are generally obtained from independent pricing services, broker-dealers or market makers. With respect to portfolio investments for which market quotations are not readily available, the Adviser, as valuation designee and its senior investment team and independent valuation firms, is responsible for determining in good faith the fair value in accordance with the valuation policy approved by the Board. If more than one valuation method is used to measure fair value, the results are evaluated and weighted, as appropriate, considering the reasonableness of the range indicated by those results. The Fund considers a range of fair values based upon the valuation techniques utilized and selects the value within that 
 77 

range that was most representative of fair value based on current market conditions as well as other factors the Adviser s senior investment team considers relevant. 
 ASC Topic 820 specifies a hierarchy of valuation techniques based on whether the inputs to those valuation techniques are observable or unobservable. ASC Topic 820 also provides guidance regarding a fair value hierarchy, which prioritizes information used to measure fair value and the effect of fair value measurements on earnings and provides for enhanced disclosures determined by the level within the hierarchy of information used in the valuation. In accordance with ASC Topic 820, these inputs are summarized in the three levels listed below: 
 Level 1 Quoted prices in active markets for identical investments. 

Level 2 Other significant observable inputs (including quoted prices for similar investments, interest rates, prepayment speeds, credit risk, etc.). 

Level 3 Significant unobservable inputs (including the Fund s own assumptions in determining the fair value of investments at the reporting date). 

The level in the fair value hierarchy within which the fair value measurement is categorized in its entirety is determined on the basis of the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety. For this purpose, the significance of an input is assessed against the fair value measurement in its entirety. If a fair value measurement uses observable inputs that require significant adjustment based on unobservable inputs, that measurement is a Level 3 measurement. If a fair value measurement uses price data vendors or observable market price quotations, that measurement is a Level 2 measurement. Assessing the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement in its entirety requires judgment, considering factors specific to the asset or liability. 
 The determination of what constitutes observable requires significant judgment by the Fund. The Fund considers observable data to be that market data that is readily available, regularly distributed or updated, reliable and verifiable, not proprietary, and provided by independent sources that are actively involved in the relevant market. 
 Because of the inherent uncertainty of valuation for all fair value investments and interests, the Board s determination of fair value may differ from the values that would have been used had a ready market existed, or that could have been (or will be) realized in an actual sale, and such differences could be material. 
 The value of any investment on any valuation date is intended to represent the fair value of such investment on such date based upon the amount at which the investment could be exchanged between willing parties, other than in a forced liquidation sale, and reflects the Board s determination of fair value using the methodology described herein. Any valuation of an investment may not reflect the actual amount received by the Fund upon the liquidation of such investment. 
 The Fund s investments will be primarily loans made to middle-market companies. These investments are mostly considered Level 3 assets under ASC Topic 820 because there is not usually a known or accessible market or market indices for these types of debt instruments and, thus, the Adviser s senior investment team must estimate the fair value of these investment securities based on models utilizing unobservable inputs. 
 Management and Incentive Fees 
 The Fund will accrue for the base management fee and incentive fee. The accrual for the incentive fee includes the recognition of the incentive fee on unrealized capital gains, even though such incentive fee is neither earned nor payable to the Adviser until the gains are both realized and in excess of unrealized depreciation on investments. The amount of capital gains incentive fee expense related to the hypothetical liquidation of the portfolio (and assuming no other changes in realized or unrealized gains and losses) would only become payable to the Adviser in the event of a complete liquidation of the Fund s portfolio as of period end and the termination of the Second Amended and Restated Advisory Agreement on such date. Also, it should be noted that the capital gains incentive fee expense fluctuates with the Fund s overall investment results. 
 Federal Income Taxes 
 The Fund has elected to be treated, and to qualify annually, as a RIC under Subchapter M of the Code. Generally, a RIC is not subject to federal income taxes on distributed income and gains if it distributes at least 90 of its net ordinary income and net short-term capital gains in excess of its net long-term capital losses, if any, to its stockholders. The Fund intends to distribute sufficient dividends to maintain its RIC status each year and the Fund does not anticipate paying any material federal income taxes in the future. 
 78 

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 
 The Fund is subject to financial market risks, including changes in interest rates. To the extent that the Fund borrows money to make investments, the Fund s net investment income is dependent upon the difference between the rate at which the Fund borrows funds and the rate at which the Fund invests these funds. In periods of rising interest rates, the Fund s cost of funds would increase, which may reduce the Fund s net investment income. Because the Fund expects that most of its investments will bear interest at floating rates, the Fund anticipates that an increase in interest rates would have a corresponding increase in the Fund s interest income that would eventually offset any increase in the Fund s cost of funds and, thus, net investment income would not be reduced significantly. The timing of interest rate resets on the Fund s investments and the Fund s debt may differ leading to a temporary increase or decrease in net investment income. However, there can be no assurance that a significant change in market interest rates will not have an adverse effect on the Fund s net investment income. In addition, U.S. and global capital markets and credit markets have experienced a higher level of stress due to rising inflation, which has resulted in an increase in the level of volatility across such markets and a general decline in the value of the securities held by the Fund. 
 The Fund will generally invest in illiquid loans and securities including debt and equity securities of middle-market companies. Because the Fund expects that there will not be a readily available market for many of the investments in the Fund s portfolio, the Fund expects to value many of its portfolio investments at fair value as determined in good faith by the Board using a documented valuation policy and a consistently applied valuation process. Due to the inherent uncertainty of determining the fair value of investments that do not have a readily available market value, the fair value of the Fund s investments may differ significantly from the values that would have been used had a readily available market value existed for such investments, and the differences could be material. 
 In connection with rising inflation, the U.S. Federal Reserve and other central banks have increased interest rates. A prolonged increase in interest rates could results in an increase in the Fund s non-performing assets and a decrease in the value of its portfolio because the portfolio companies paying interest at such increasing floating rates may be unable to meet higher payment obligations. In periods of rising interest rates, the Fund s cost of funds would increase, which, if not matched with the rising interest rates of its performing floating-rate assets, could result in a decrease in its net investment income. Incurring additional leverage will magnify the impact of an increase to the Fund s cost of funds. A decrease in interest rates may reduce net income, because new investments may be made at lower rates despite the increased demand for the Fund s capital that the decrease in interest rates may produce. 
 Assuming that the consolidated statement of assets and liabilities as of September 30, 2024, were to remain constant and that the Fund took no actions to alter its existing interest rate sensitivity, the following table shows the annualized impact of hypothetical base rate changes in interest rates.

The above outcomes are estimates based on models that use assumptions, and such assumptions may not hold true should any of the listed scenarios occur. The table should be read in conjunction with the Forward-Looking Statements section to this quarterly report. 
 In addition, although the Fund does not currently intend to make investments that are denominated in a foreign currency, to the extent it does, the Fund will be subject to risks associated with changes in currency exchange rates. These risks include the possibility of significant fluctuations in the foreign currency markets, the imposition or modification of foreign exchange controls and potential illiquidity in the secondary market. These risks will vary depending upon the currency or currencies involved. 
 The Fund may hedge against interest rate and currency exchange rate fluctuations by using standard hedging instruments such as futures, options and forward contracts subject to the requirements of the 1940 Act. While hedging activities may insulate the Fund against adverse changes in interest rates, they may also limit the Fund s ability to participate in benefits of lower interest rates with respect to the Fund s portfolio of investments with fixed interest rates.

Item 4. C ontrols and Procedures 
 As of the end of the period covered by this report, the Fund carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of the Fund s management, including the Fund s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of the Fund s disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act). Based on that evaluation, the Fund s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that the Fund s current disclosure controls and procedures are effective in timely alerting them to material information relating to the Fund that is required to be disclosed by the Fund in the reports it files or submits under the Exchange Act. 
 There have been no changes in the Fund s internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the Fund s most recently completed fiscal quarter that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Fund s internal control over financial reporting.
