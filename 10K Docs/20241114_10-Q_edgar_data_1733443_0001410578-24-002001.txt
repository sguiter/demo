Phantom Stock Compensation Plans During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, 5 2 Studios, Inc. authorized three incentive plans (collectively the Phantom Unit Plans aimed at driving the Company s success by motivating key contributors. Each plan grants awards in the form of Phantom Units , which provide recipients with the right to receive cash payments, less applicable withholding, equivalent to the distribution rights of Series B common shares in a qualifying sale event. While these Phantom Units do not confer ownership rights, they are also entitled to dividends, if declared, equivalent to those of Series B common stock in addition to the right to cash payment contingent upon a qualifying sale event. Granted and outstanding The vesting conditions for all Phantom Units granted under the plans include a performance condition contingent upon a qualifying sale event, as defined in the respective agreements. The units may only be settled through cash payment. Cash payment to certain Phantom Units granted are subject to the occurrence of a qualifying sale event, at which time a specified percentage of the unit s right to payment becomes immediately vested, based on a years of service formula as of the qualifying sale date, while the remaining portion shall vest in two equal annual installments following the qualifying sale date anniversary, subject to continuous employment with the Company through each date. Additionally, certain Phantom units granted for which cash payment fully vest upon the qualifying sale event and shall be entitled to the cash payment at the qualifying sale event plus a sale bonus percentage, as specified in the award agreement. The awards are liability-classified as they may only be settled in cash and are therefore subject to remeasurement based on changes in the estimated fair value of the Phantom Units at each reporting date through date of settlement. The fair value of the units was determined by considering a number of objective and subjective factors including the following: the Company s operating and financial forecasts with the consideration to the valuation of comparable companies, the discount for lack of marketability of common stock, and other general and industry specific economic factors. As all Phantom Units are contingent upon the performance vesting condition of a qualifying sale, expense is only recognized once the event becomes probable, which shall be upon the occurrence of the qualifying sale event. Therefore, as the qualifying sale event is not considered probable, no expense has been recognized for these awards. As such, compensation expense or liability was recognized as of September 30, 2024 related to these awards.

 Contribution Revenues Contribution revenues is comprised of contributions received revenues under a non-reciprocal agreement with the CAS for donation proceeds received by CAS through The Chosen App to help fund the future production of the Series. Contribution revenues for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 were 5,978 thousand and 28,963 thousand, respectively. While the Second Amendment executed in October 2023 modified and revised various commercial terms, it also eliminated the obligation of CAS to continue to provide Contribution Revenue to the Company. As such, no additional Contribution Revenue was received by the Company for reporting periods subsequent to the signing of the Second Amendment. Cost of Revenues Cost of revenues primarily include the costs of products, third party expenses to fulfill merchandise sales orders, costs associated with events related to The Chosen and 5 2 Studios, Inc., and participation and residual costs owed to writers, producers, actors and other film participants. Cost of revenues for the three months ended September 30, 2024 increased 6,703 thousand, or 157 as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023 primarily due to an increase in costs of sales related to royalties of 2,949 thousand due pursuant to the CAS Transaction and an increase of 3,691 thousand primarily in connection with Chosen Con. Cost of revenues for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 increased 14,263 thousand, or 100 , as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023, primarily due to an increase in cost of sales related to increased licensed content costs of 3,898 thousand, increased royalties of 3,136 thousand due pursuant to the CAS Transaction, as well as increased costs of 3,691 thousand primarily in connection with Chosen Con. Cost of Production Services Revenues Cost of production services revenues is associated with providing production services on a work-for-hire basis, focusing on the development, production, and delivery of the remaining seasons of the Series and other projects. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, the costs related to production services revenue were 13,547 thousand and 53,630 thousand, respectively. These costs increased for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, as the Company did not perform production services on a work-for-hire basis prior the CAS Transaction becoming effective during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. Prior to the CAS Transaction, in which the Company sold The Chosen IP, the Company capitalized production costs related to the owned Series as Film costs, to be subsequently amortized based on the estimated ultimate revenues from the Series. Distribution and Marketing Distribution and marketing include costs to promote the Series and primarily includes marketing on social and digital platforms as well as costs for producing marketing and managing the exploitation of the licensed content for both domestic and international audiences. Distribution and marketing expense for the three months ended September 30, 2024 decreased 2,570 thousand, or 50 , as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023, which is primarily attributable to increased marketing costs to promote the premiere and theatrical release of Season 4 and extended worldwide distribution of the previously released Seasons offset by marketing reimbursement of 5,232 thousand from CAS for qualifying marketing costs. Distribution and marketing expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 increased 13,421 thousand, or 114 , as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023, which is primarily attributable to increased marketing costs to promote the premiere and theatrical release of Season 4 and extended worldwide distribution of the previously released Seasons offset by marketing reimbursement of 5,232 thousand from CAS for qualifying marketing costs. Beginning in July 2024, the Company will be entitled to reimbursement from CAS for certain qualifying marketing costs to market or sell CAS s products pursuant to the CAS Transaction. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 there have been reimbursements of 5,232 thousand from CAS for qualifying marketing costs.

 Amortization of Film Costs Costs of producing the Series are amortized using the individual-film-forecast method, based on the ratio of the current period s revenues to the Company s estimated ultimate revenue. Amortization of film costs for the three months ended September 30, 2024 decreased 2,608 thousand, or 100 , as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023, primarily due to no amortization of film costs taking place during the third quarter of 2024 as there was no revenue recognized from owned content. Amortization of film costs for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 increased 3,269 thousand, or 29 , as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023, primarily due to the additional amortization of film costs as a result of the release of Season 4 in the first quarter of 2024 of 11,693 thousand offset by less amortization of seasons 1, 2 and 3 of the Series of 9,106 thousand. Depreciation and Amortization Depreciation and amortization for the three months ended September 30, 2024 increased 1,360 thousand, or 62 , as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023, primarily due to the Company completing construction on a second soundstage late in the first quarter of 2024 and the Company completing construction on a third soundstage in the second quarter of 2024. Depreciation and amortization for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 increased 3,386 thousand, or 52 , as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023, primarily due to the Company completing construction on a second soundstage late in the first quarter of 2024 and the Company completing construction on a third soundstage in the second quarter of 2024. General and Administrative General and administrative expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2024 increased 920 thousand, or 14 , as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023, primarily due to 470 thousand of increased payroll related expenses mostly attributable to increased headcount. The Company also incurred additional legal, accounting and professional fees of 1,290 thousand, offset by a decrease in bad debt expenses of 1,525 thousand. General and administrative expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 increased 11,353 thousand, or 65 , as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023, primarily due to 2,771 thousand of increased technology related expenses as well as 1,634 thousand of increased payroll related expenses mostly attributable to increased headcount. The Company also incurred additional non-recurring legal, accounting, and professional fees of 6,720 thousand, primarily related to the Angel Studios, Inc. litigation and the CAS Transaction, offset by a decrease in bad debt expenses of 1,590 thousand. Gain (Loss) on Sale of Assets Gain (loss) on sale of assets for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 is primarily related to the sale of The Chosen IP as a result of the CAS Transaction. Income Taxes Income tax benefit (provision) for the three months ended September 30, 2024 decreased 1,492 thousand, or 81 as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023, primarily due to the increase in the Company s net income (loss) before benefit (provision) for income taxes of 3,276 thousand. Income tax benefit (provision) for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 increased 435 thousand, or 34 as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023, primarily due to the increase in noncontrolling interest NCI of 654 thousand, as well as the impact of non-deductible interest expense of 7,368 thousand, offset by the decrease in the Company s net income (loss) before benefit (provision) for income taxes of 11,048 thousand. The effective tax rate for the three months ended September 30, 2024 decreased 18 , as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023, primarily due to the impact from the increased net loss attributable to NCI of 236 thousand.

 The effective tax rate for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 decreased 55 , as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023, primarily due to the impact from the increased net loss attributable to NCI of 654 thousand and the non-deductible interest expense of 7,368 thousand. Liquidity and Capital Resource Comparison of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 

As of September 30, December 31, 2024 2023 Change (in thousands) Cash and cash equivalents 22,194 65,179 (42,985) Long-term debt and lease liabilities, net 235 138,028 (137,793) The Company s primary sources of liquidity are from cash flows generated from operations and financing activities. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company had cash of 22,194 thousand and 65,179 thousand, respectively. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company had long-term debt and lease liabilities, net of 235 thousand and 138,028 thousand, respectively. The decrease in cash of 42,985 thousand was primarily due to cash used in operating activities of 47,207 thousand partially offset by cash provided by financing activities of 11,684 thousand. The primary drivers of operating activities for the quarter are the production expenses for Season 5 and the marketing spend associated with the release and distribution of Season 4. The Company s long-term debt historically related to the agreement with CAS, whereby CAS provided 145,500 thousand for the Company s use in the development, production, distribution and marketing of the Series and to provide the Company with operating and working capital. As of September 30, 2024, this amount was forgiven in connection with the closing of the CAS Transaction. See the consolidated financial statements included herein and starting on page F-1 for further detail regarding the historic financing arrangement with CAS. In addition, as a result of the CAS Transaction, the Company is entitled to receive cash receipts for its production services based on the budgets for future seasons, along with production fees and milestone payments due upon the completion of each season. The Company believes its existing cash and expected cash flows from operations will be sufficient to meet our working capital, capital expenditures, and expected cash requirements from known contractual obligations for the next twelve months and beyond. Comparison of the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 Our cash flow activities were as follows for the periods presented: 

Nine months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 Change (in thousands) Net cash flows used in operating activities 47,207 17,161 30,046 Net cash flows used in investing activities 7,462 6,496 966 Net cash flows provided by (used in) financing activities 11,684 (5,843) 17,527 Operating activities Net cash flows used in operating activities was 47,207 thousand and 17,161 thousand for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The increase of net cash flows used in operating activities of 30,046 thousand was primarily driven by the decrease in net income of 37,853 thousand, exclusive of non-cash items, a decrease of 30,388 thousand in deferred revenue, driven by the production service revenue recognized from the deferred consideration from forgiveness of long-term debt in the CAS transaction, and an increase of 12,226 thousand in accounts receivable, partially offset by an increase of 14,590 thousand in accrued expenses and other accrued liabilities, the decrease of 28,508 thousand in film cost as well as the decrease of 2,640 thousand in prepaids and other current assets.

 Investing activities Net cash flows used in investing activities was 7,462 thousand and 6,496 thousand for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The increase of net cash flows used in investing activities of 966 thousand was primarily driven by the increase in acquisition of property and equipment. There were no other significant cash investing activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Financing activities The financing activities of 11,684 thousand for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 included proceeds from issuance of debt of 11,684 thousand, which was forgiven as a component consideration in the CAS transaction. The financing activities of 5,843 thousand for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 primarily included contributions from noncontrolling interest member of 5,023 thousand offset by dividend payments of 10,417 thousand and principal payments on long-term debt of 437 thousand. Critical Accounting Estimates The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reported periods. The SEC has defined a company s critical accounting policies as the ones that are most important to the portrayal of a company s financial condition and results of operations, and which require a company to make its most difficult and subjective judgments. Based on this definition, the Company has identified the critical accounting policies and judgments addressed below. Estimates are based on historical experience and on various other assumptions that the Company believes to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. The following is provided to update the Company s critical accounting estimates previously described in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. Film Costs Costs of producing the Company s owned film projects are amortized, and residual and participation costs are accrued, using the individual-film forecast method, based on the ratio of the current period s revenues to the Company s estimated remaining ultimate revenue per each episodic block. The initial estimate of ultimate revenue includes estimates of revenues through various distribution channels such as theatrical, home entertainment and other distribution platforms and are based on historical experience for past seasons. The Company regularly monitors the performance of each project, and evaluates whether impairment indicators are present (i.e., low ratings), and based upon our review, the Company revises the estimates as needed. Due to the inherent uncertainties involved in making such estimates of ultimate revenues and expenses, these estimates have differed in the past from actual results and are likely to differ to some extent in the future from actual results. In addition, in the normal course of our business, some projects are more successful or less successful than anticipated. Management regularly reviews and revises, when necessary, its ultimate revenue and cost estimates, which may result in a change in the rate of amortization of film costs and participations and residuals and/or a write-down of all or a portion of the unamortized costs of the project to its estimated fair value. An increase in the estimate of ultimate revenue will generally result in a lower amortization rate and, therefore, lesser film amortization expense, while a decrease in the estimate of ultimate revenue will generally result in a higher amortization rate and, therefore, higher film amortization expense. The amortization of film costs is on an accelerated basis, as the Company typically expects more upfront viewing. On average, over 50 of the film costs related to our produced content is expected to be amortized within one year after its month of first availability. The Company reviews factors that may impact the amortization of film costs on a monthly basis, such as prospective licensing arrangements, monitoring the popularity of the content, as well as market and consumer trends. Our estimates related to these factors require considerable management judgment.

 Revenue Recognition Production Services Revenue Revenue is recognized when control of goods or services is transferred to customers, in amounts that reflect the consideration the Company expects to be entitled to in exchange for those goods or services, based on its performance obligation. For revenue from production services, the customer controls the output throughout the production process. Revenue and the associated costs of such contracts are recognized over time on an input method, applying a cost-to-cost estimation basis. The revenue recognized applying the cost-to-cost method is calculated based upon the proportion of actual costs incurred, cumulatively relative to an estimate, of total expected cost to complete and deliver the project. The initial estimate of production costs includes estimates of project budgets that are based on historical experience for past productions as well as future expectations. The Company regularly monitors the performance of each project and revises the estimates of remaining costs to complete the project, as needed. Due to the inherent uncertainties involved in making such estimates of production costs and expenses, these initial estimates are likely to differ, to some extent, from actual results. Changes in revenue recognized as a result of adjustments to total expected costs are recognized on a prospective basis. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements As of September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023, the Company had no off-balance sheet arrangements that have, or are reasonably likely to have, a current or future effect on the Company s financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that is material to investors. Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk Quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risks have been omitted as permitted under rules applicable to smaller reporting companies. Item 4. Controls and Procedures Evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures As required by Rule 13a-15(b) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the Exchange Act ), we evaluated, under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our President and our Chief Financial Officer, the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) of the Exchange Act) as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Based on the foregoing evaluation, our President and our Chief Financial Officer concluded that, as of September 30, 2024, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective to accomplish their objectives at the reasonable assurance level that we would meet our disclosure obligations. Changes in internal control over financial reporting There have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) of the Exchange Act) that occurred during our most recently completed fiscal quarter that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
