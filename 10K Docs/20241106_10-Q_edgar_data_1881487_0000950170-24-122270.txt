 The forward-looking statements in this Quarterly Report speak only as of the date of this Quarterly Report, or such other date as specified herein. We disclaim any obligation to update these statements unless required by law, and we caution you not to place undue reliance on them. Forward-looking statements are not assurances of future performance and involve risks and uncertainties. We have based these forward-looking statements on our current expectations and assumptions about future events. While our management considers these expectations and assumptions to be reasonable, they are inherently subject to significant business, economic, competitive, regulatory and other risks, contingencies and uncertainties, most of which are difficult to predict and many of which are beyond our control. These risks, contingencies and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, the following: 
 our ability to finance, consummate, integrate and realize the benefits expected from our past or future acquisitions, including any related synergies; 

uncertainty regarding the timing, pace and extent of an economic recovery in the United States and elsewhere, which in turn will likely affect demand for crude oil and natural gas and therefore the demand for our services; 

the level of production of crude oil, natural gas and other hydrocarbons and the resultant market prices of crude oil, natural gas, natural gas liquids and other hydrocarbons; 

a future decline in domestic spending by the onshore oil and natural gas industry; 

actions by members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, Russia and other oil-producing countries with respect to oil production levels and announcements of potential changes in such levels; 

the political environment in oil and natural gas producing regions, including uncertainty or instability resulting from civil disorder, terrorism or war, such as the ongoing war between Russia and Ukraine and the war between Israel and Hamas, and the global response to such hostilities, which may negatively impact our operating results; 

changes in general economic and geopolitical conditions; 

competitive conditions in our industry; 

changes in the long-term supply of and demand for oil and natural gas; 

actions taken by our customers, competitors and third-party operators;

3 

large or multiple customer defaults, including defaults resulting from actual or potential insolvencies; 

the effects of consolidation on our customers or competitors; 

the price and availability of debt and equity financing (including changes in interest rates); 

our ability to complete growth projects on time and on budget; 

introduction of new drilling or completion techniques, or services using new technologies subject to patent or other intellectual property protections; 

operating hazards, natural disasters, weather-related delays, casualty losses and other matters beyond our control; 

acts of terrorism, war or political or civil unrest in the United States or elsewhere; 

loss or corruption of our information or a cyberattack on our computer systems; 

the price and availability of alternative fuels and energy sources; 

federal, state and local regulation of hydraulic fracturing and other oilfield service activities, as well as exploration and production activities, including public pressure on governmental bodies and regulatory agencies to regulate our industry; 

the availability of water resources, suitable proppant and chemicals in sufficient quantities for use in hydraulic fracturing fluids; 

the effects of existing and future laws and governmental regulations (or the interpretation thereof) on us and our customers; 

the severity and duration of widespread health events and related economic repercussions on the oil and gas industry and on demand for oil and gas; and 

the effects of future litigation. 

Our forward-looking statements speak only as of the date they were made and, except as required by law, we undertake no obligation to update, amend or clarify any forward-looking statements because of new information, future events or other factors. All of our forward-looking information involves risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from the results expected. Although it is not possible to identify all factors, these risks and uncertainties include the risk factors and the timing of any of the risk factors identified in Item 1A of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 (the "Annual Report").

million, consisting of cash consideration of million and our pre-existing equity investment of million. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, our operating results include revenues of million and million, respectively, and pretax losses of million and million, respectively, related to the BPC acquired operations. BPC is included in our manufacturing reportable segment. In June 2024, we acquired of the issued and outstanding capital stock of Advanced Stimulation Technologies, Inc. AST ), a pressure pumping services provider serving the Permian Basin, for total purchase consideration of million in cash. This acquisition expanded our hydraulic fracturing capabilities. For the three and six months ended June 30, 2024, our operating results include revenues of million and pretax earnings of million related to the AST acquired operations. Throughout the third quarter of 2024, we integrated AST s operations. As a result, we track all stimulation services assets as one group and it would be impracticable to separately report AST revenues or pretax earnings subsequent to June 30, 2024. AST is included in our stimulation services reportable segment. In June 2024, we acquired of the issued and outstanding common stock of NRG Manufacturing, Inc., which manufactures equipment used in the hydraulic fracturing industry, and its affiliate, AMI US Holdings, Inc., which develops commercial software used in hydraulic fracturing industry (collectively NRG ), for total purchase consideration of million in cash. This acquisition expanded our manufacturing and maintenance capabilities. R evenues and pretax earnings included in the Company's operating results related to the NRG acquired operations were immaterial for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024. NRG is included in our manufacturing reportable segment.

Goodwill 

Total purchase consideration 

We generally used the cost approach to value acquired property, plant and equipment adjusted for the age, condition and utility of the associated assets. The market approach valuation technique was used for assets that had comparable market data available. The intangible assets related to the BPC acquisition represent customer relationships and a trade name. The fair value of the customer relationships was determined using the income approach, which is predicated upon the value of the future cash flows that these customers will generate over an estimated time period. The fair value of the trade name was determined using a relief from royalty methodology. The amounts allocated to goodwill are attributable to the organized workforce and potential or expected synergies. We estimate that the goodwill acquired in the BPC acquisition will be deductible for income tax purposes. The allocations of purchase price to the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed for these acquisitions are preliminary and subject to revisions during the measurement period, up to one year from the date the acquisition closed. These determinations include the use of estimates based on information that was available at the time these unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements were prepared. We believe that the estimates used are reasonable; however, the estimates are subject to change as additional information becomes available. Prior Year Acquisitions On January 3, 2023, we acquired of the issued and outstanding membership interests of Producers Service Holdings LLC Producers ), an employee-owned pressure pumping services provider serving Appalachia and the Mid-Continent, for a total purchase consideration of million. We accounted for this acquisition as a business combination. On February 24, 2023, we acquired of the issued and outstanding membership interests in (i) Performance Proppants, LLC, (ii) Red River Land Holdings, LLC, (iii) Performance Royalty, LLC, (iv) Performance Proppants International, LLC, and (v) Sunny Point Aggregates, LLC (together, Performance Proppants for a total purchase consideration of million. We accounted for this acquisition as a business combination.

Measurement period adjustments 

Balance, September 30, 2024 

The adjustment to goodwill in our stimulation services reportable segment was to correct an immaterial error for the three months ended March 31, 2024 related to the accounting for our acquisition of U.S. Well Services, which decreased property, plant, and equipment and increased goodwill. The measurement period adjustment for the stimulation services segment included an adjustment to recognize an unfavorable purchase commitment and its related tax effects assumed in the AST acquisition. The measurement period adjustments for the manufacturing segment relate to updated values of other liabilities assumed in the acquisition of BPC. Haynesville Proppant Goodwill Impairment We perform our annual goodwill impairment test for each of our reporting units in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year. In addition to our annual impairment test, we also test goodwill for impairment between annual impairment dates whenever events or circumstances occur which could more likely than not reduce the fair value of one or more reporting units below its carrying value. In 2024, a decline in natural gas prices reduced our customers activity levels in the Haynesville Shale, which is heavily concentrated with natural gas wells. This activity downturn significantly reduced the operating results of our Haynesville Proppant reporting unit. In the second quarter of 2024, we noted that our customers activity levels were not expected to significantly recover in the short-term. The reduced operating results of our Haynesville Proppant reporting unit therefore resulted in a triggering event and, accordingly, we performed an interim quantitative impairment test in the second quarter of 2024. We did not identify a triggering event for our other reporting units. In performing the interim quantitative impairment test, we determined the fair value of our Haynesville Proppant reporting unit using a combination of the income approach and the market approach. Under the income approach, the fair value for this reporting unit was determined based on the present value of estimated future cash flows, discounted at an appropriate risk-adjusted rate. Due to the inherent uncertainties involved in making estimates and assumptions, actual results and discount rates may differ from those assumed in our forecasts. Based upon the results of our interim quantitative impairment test, we concluded that the carrying value of the Haynesville Proppant reporting unit exceeded its estimated fair value, which resulted in a goodwill impairment charge of million for the second quarter of 2024, which represented all of the goodwill recorded on the Haynesville Proppant reporting unit.

 million aggregate principal amount of its 2029 Senior Notes at par to Beal Bank and Beal Bank USA in connection with our acquisition of AST. These notes were issued as additional notes pursuant to the original indenture as amended. These new notes and the notes previously issued under the indenture will be treated as a single series of securities under the indenture and the new notes will have substantially identical terms, other than the issue date, issue price and first payment date, as the existing notes and be secured by a security interest in the same collateral. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we made principal payments of million on our 2029 Senior Notes. ABL Credit Facility As of September 30, 2024, the maximum availability under the ABL Credit Facility was limited to our eligible borrowing base of million with million of borrowings outstanding and million of letters of credit outstanding, resulting in approximately million of remaining availability. Monarch Note During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we made principal payments of million on the Monarch Note. Equify Note During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we made principal payments of million on the Equify Notes. Other Subsidiary Debt In connection with our acquisition of BPC, we assumed debt related to a revolving credit facility of million, finance lease obligations for real estate of million, and a note payable for real estate of million. Debt Compliance Both the 2029 Senior Notes and the ABL Credit Facility contain certain customary representations and warranties and affirmative and negative covenants. As of September 30, 2024, we were in compliance with these covenants and expect to be compliant for at least the next twelve months. The Alpine 2023 Term Loan originally contained a covenant commencing with the fiscal quarter ending September 30, 2024, requiring Alpine not to exceed a maximum Total Net Leverage Ratio (as defined in the Alpine Term Loan Credit Agreement) of to . This ratio is generally the consolidated total debt of Alpine divided by Alpine's adjusted EBITDA. In the second quarter of 2024, this covenant was amended to commence testing compliance with the Total Net Leverage Ratio with the fiscal quarter ending on September 30, 2025. As a result of Alpine s lower than expected operating results in 2024, Alpine is closely monitoring its forthcoming compliance obligations with this covenant. While there can be no assurance, Alpine believes that it will be able to meet, modify, or further defer this debt covenant. Restricted Assets Our Alpine 2023 Term Loan requires us to segregate collateral associated with our Alpine subsidiary, which comprises our proppant production segment, and limits our ability to use Alpine's cash or assets to satisfy our obligations or the obligations of our other subsidiaries. We also have limited ability to provide Alpine with liquidity to satisfy its obligations. See Note 12. Business Segments for certain financial information for Alpine.

 million and million, respectively, related to these contract liabilities as revenue compared with million and million in the respective periods last year. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, our off-market contract liabilities amounted to million and million, respectively. Estimated future amortization of off-market contract liabilities to revenue is million for the remainder of 2024 and million in 2025. Performance Obligations Certain of our Proppant Production contracts contain multiple performance obligations to provide a minimum quantity of proppant products to our customers in future periods. For these contracts, the transaction price is allocated to each performance obligation at estimated selling prices and we recognize revenue as we satisfy these performance obligations. As of September 30, 2024, the aggregate amount of transaction price allocated to unsatisfied performance obligations was million, and we expect to perform these obligations and recognize revenue of million for the remainder of 2024 , million in 2025 , million in 2026 , and million in 2027 . We have elected the practical expedient permitting the exclusion of disclosing the value of unsatisfied performance obligations for Stimulation Services and Manufacturing contracts as these contracts have original contract terms of one year or less or we have the right to invoice for services performed.

For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, our income tax provision included a discrete benefit of million related to the release of a portion of the valuation allowance on our net deferred tax assets. This discrete item was caused by the assumption of a million net deferred tax liability in our acquisition of AST, which made it more likely than not that we would be able to utilize a corresponding amount of our deferred tax assets. Excluding this discrete item, the difference between our effective tax rate and the federal statutory rate related to changes in the valuation allowance on our net deferred tax assets.

 million in 2024 and million in 2025 for minimum sand commitments and hydraulic fracturing equipment components. Litigation In the ordinary course of business, we are the subject of, or party to a number of pending or threatened legal actions and administrative proceedings. While many of these matters involve inherent uncertainty, we believe that, other than as described below, the amount of the liability, if any, ultimately incurred with respect to proceedings or claims will not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position as a whole or on our liquidity, capital resources or future annual results of operations. We estimate and provide for potential losses that may arise out of legal proceedings and claims to the extent that such losses are probable and can be reasonably estimated. Significant judgment is required in making these estimates and our final liabilities may ultimately be materially different from these estimates. When preparing our estimates, we consider, among other factors, the progress of each legal proceeding and claim, our experience and the experience of others in similar legal proceedings and claims, and the opinions and views of legal counsel. Legal costs related to litigation contingencies are expensed as incurred.

Prior the acquisition of BPC, we elected the fair value option to account for our original investment in BPC due to the complexities of the terms of the equity investment. The significant unobservable inputs used in the fair value measurement, which was valued using the income approach and the market approach, are forecasted results and a weighted-average cost of capital. The fair value of this asset is classified as investments in our unaudited condensed consolidated balance sheets. The gains and losses from fair value changes are classified as other income (expense), net in our unaudited condensed consolidated statements of operations for periods prior to the acquisition. The fair value of the Munger make-whole provision was estimated using a Black-Scholes model. The significant unobservable inputs used in the fair value measurement are the risk-free rate and volatility. The Munger make-whole provision is set to expire in May 2025.)

In June 2023, we arranged to sell certain surplus equipment and inventory components and to assign certain pre-orders for equipment to Flying A, at prices which we believe to be fair market value, for a total consideration of million. We received the proceeds from this transaction in June 2023. Subsequent to June 30, 2023, Flying A requested changes to the mix of the assets being sold to it by the Company without altering the total consideration, and the Company and Flying A agreed to add to the transaction agreement a most favored nation clause on pricing and a condition to closing that the Company s Audit Committee approve the final mix of assets to be transferred to Flying A. We delivered million of these components to Flying A in 2023. In January 2024, we agreed to sell million of additional equipment to Flying A under similar terms. We received the proceeds from this additional transaction in January 2024. We delivered million of product to Flying A in the nine months ended September 30, 2024.

IT EM 2. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 
 The following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be in conjunction with our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements and the related notes thereto included in this Quarterly Report, as well as our Annual Report. 
 Overview 
 We are a vertically integrated and innovation-driven energy services holding company providing hydraulic fracturing, proppant production, other completion services and other complementary products and services to leading upstream oil and natural gas companies engaged in the exploration and production ("E P") of North American unconventional oil and natural gas resources. 
 We operate in three reportable business segments: stimulation services, proppant production and manufacturing. Our stimulation services segment, which primarily relates to ProFrac LLC, owns and operates a fleet of mobile hydraulic fracturing units and other auxiliary equipment that generates revenue by providing stimulation services to our customers. Our proppant production segment, which primarily relates to Alpine, provides proppant to oilfield service providers and E P companies. Our manufacturing segment sells products such as high horsepower pumps, valves, piping, swivels, large-bore manifold systems, and fluid ends. 
 Summary Financial Results 
 Total revenue for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, was 575.3 million and 1,736.2 million, respectively, which represented an increase of 1.1 million and a decrease of 404.7 million from the same periods in 2023. 

Net loss attributable to ProFrac Holding Corp. for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, was 45.2 million and 110.1 million, respectively, which represented decreases of 26.3 million and 110.3 million from the same periods in 2023. The net losses for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 included pretax goodwill impairment charges of 6.8 million and 74.5 million, respectively. 

Cash provided by operating activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, was 290.8 million, a decrease of 220.0 million from the same period in 2023. 

Total principal amount of long-term debt was 1,205.7 million at September 30, 2024, an increase of 97.8 million from December 31, 2023. 

2024 Developments 
 In April 2024, we acquired all of the remaining equity interests of BPC. BPC is the parent company of FHE, which manufactures equipment used in the hydraulic fracturing industry. The total purchase consideration was 39.8 million, consisting of cash consideration of 14.9 million and our pre-existing investment of 24.9 million. 

In June 2024, we acquired 100 of the issued and outstanding capital stock of AST, a pressure pumping services provider serving the Permian Basin, for total purchase consideration of 174.0 million in cash. 

In June 2024, we acquired 100 of the issued and outstanding common stock of NRG for total purchase consideration of 6.0 million in cash.

Stimulation Services. Stimulation services revenues for the three months ended September 30, 2024 increased 17.6 million, or 4 , from the same period in 2023. This increase was primarily attributable to an increase in average fleets and higher fleet utilization. Additionally, the acquisition of AST contributed revenue starting in June 2024. This increase was partially offset by lower average pricing for our services and an increase in the portion of customers who provided their own proppant and chemistry. Stimulation services revenues for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 decreased 357.9 million, or 19 , from the same period in 2023. This decrease was primarily attributable to a lower number of average active fleets in 2024, lower average pricing for our services, and an increase in the portion of customers who provided their own proppant and chemistry. These decreases were partially offset by increased utilization of our active fleets in 2024. 
 Proppant Production. Proppant production revenues for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 decreased 45.6 million and 90.4 million, or 46 and 31 , respectively, from the same periods in 2023. These decreases were attributable to lower average prices for products sold and a reduction in volumes sold. Additionally, the acquisition of Performance Proppants contributed revenue starting in February 2023. Revenue recognized for the amortization of acquired off-market contracts for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 8.9 million and 36.1 million, respectively, compared to 16.4 million and 41.0 million, respectively, in the same periods in 2023. Refer to Item 8 "Financial Statements and Supplementary Data" in our Annual Report for information about our acquired contract liabilities. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, approximately 24 and 26 , respectively, of the Proppant Production segment's revenues were intercompany, compared with 29 and 31 in the same periods in 2023. 
 Manufacturing. Manufacturing revenues for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 increased by 17.7 million and 18.9 million, or 40 and 13 , respectively, from the same periods in 2023. This increase was attributable to higher intercompany demand for manufacturing products in the third quarter of 2024. Additionally, the acquisition of BPC and NRG contributed revenue starting in April 2024 and June 2024, respectively. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, approximately 80 and 77 , respectively, of the Manufacturing segment's revenues were intercompany, compared with 97 and 91 in the same periods in 2023. 
 Other. Other revenues for the three months ended September 30, 2024 increased by 2.7 million from the same period in 2023. This increase was primarily attributable to higher intercompany revenue at Flotek, which was partially offset by decreased revenue from external customers. Other revenues for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 decreased by 8.9 million from the same period in 2023. This decrease was primarily attributable to lower intercompany revenue at Flotek. Flotek recorded contract shortfall revenue of 6.7 million and 8.0 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and 23.8 million and 10.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, because ProFrac LLC did not purchase the minimum contractual commitment of chemistry products from Flotek. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, approximately 68 and 66 , respectively, of other revenues were intercompany, compared with 63 and 68 in the same periods in 2023.

Stimulation Services . Stimulation services cost of revenues for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was consistent with the same period in 2023. Stimulation services cost of revenues for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 decreased by 262.5 million, or 19 , from the same period in 2023. This decrease was primarily attributable to a decrease in average active fleets and decreased volume of proppant and chemistry in 2024. Cost of revenues for this segment included intercompany supply commitment charges of 6.7 million and 8.0 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and 23.8 million and 10.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, because ProFrac LLC did not purchase the minimum contractual commitment of chemistry products from Flotek. 
 Proppant Production . Proppant production cost of revenues for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 decreased by 11.3 million and 17.8 million, or 27 and 14 , respectively, from the same periods in 2023. This reduction was primarily attributable to lower volumes sold in 2024. Additionally, the acquisition of Performance Proppants contributed costs beginning in February 2023. 
 Manufacturing . Manufacturing cost of revenues for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 increased by 15.6 million and 19.5 million, or 40 and 17 , respectively, from the same period in 2023. This increase was primarily attributable to higher volumes of products sold to intercompany and third-party customers in 2024. Additionally, the acquisition of BPC and NRG contributed costs beginning in April 2024 and June 2024, respectively. 
 Other . Other cost of revenues for the three months ended September 30, 2024 increased by 1.6 million, or 4 , from the same period in 2023. Other cost of revenues for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 decreased by 24.0 million, or 18 , from the same period in 2023. These decreases were primarily attributable to decreased product sales and lower freight costs.

Selling, general and administrative expenses, excluding stock-based compensation for the three months ended September 30, 2024 increased 2.6 million, or 5 , from the same period in 2023. Selling, general and administrative expenses, excluding stock-based compensation for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 decreased 8.1 million, or 5 , from the same period in 2023. 
 Depreciation, Depletion, and Amortization 
 Depreciation, depletion, and amortization for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 112.7 million and 328.9 million, respectively, which was consistent with 111.5 million and 330.7 million in the same periods in 2023. 
 Acquisition and Integration Costs 
 Acquisition and integration costs primarily relate to professional fees, severance and other costs associated with our acquisition and integration activities. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, these costs were 2.0 million and 5.1 million, respectively, compared with 2.6 million and 20.1 million in the same periods in 2023. 
 Goodwill Impairment 
 In 2024, a decline in natural gas prices reduced our customers activity levels in the Haynesville basin, which is heavily concentrated with natural gas wells. This activity downturn has significantly reduced the operating results of our Haynesville Proppant reporting unit. In the second quarter of 2024, we noted that our customers activity levels were not expected to significantly recover in the short-term. The reduced operating results of our Haynesville Proppant reporting unit therefore resulted in a triggering event and, accordingly, we performed an interim quantitative impairment test in the second quarter of 2024. Based upon the results of our interim quantitative impairment test, we concluded that the carrying value of the Haynesville Proppant reporting unit exceeded its estimated fair value, which resulted in a goodwill impairment charge of 67.7 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024. This goodwill impairment charge represented all of the goodwill recorded on the Haynesville Proppant reporting unit. If overall market conditions deteriorate, or if we are unable to achieve our forecasted results, future non-cash impairment charges may result in other reporting units which could be material. 
 In 2024, we experienced a decline in our operating results for our Permian Proppant reporting unit and our Eagle Ford Proppant reporting unit. In the third quarter of 2024, we noted that our operating results for these reporting units were not expected to significantly recover in the short-term. The reduced operating results for these reporting units resulted in triggering events and, accordingly, we performed interim quantitative impairment tests in the third quarter of 2024. Based upon the results of our interim quantitative impairment tests, we concluded that the carrying values of the Permian Proppant and Eagle Ford Proppant reporting units exceeded their estimated fair values, which resulted in goodwill impairment charges of 2.4 million and 4.4 million, respectively, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, which represented all of the goodwill recorded on these reporting units.

Litigation expenses and accruals for legal contingencies generally represent legal and professional fees incurred in litigation as well as estimates for loss contingencies with regards to certain vendor disputes and litigation matters. In the periods

presented, substantially all of these costs represent litigation costs incurred in connection with certain patent infringement lawsuits with Halliburton, which were settled in September 2024. See "Note 9. Commitments and Contingencies" for a discussion of significant litigation matters. 
 Gain on insurance recoveries consists of insurance proceeds received for accidentally damaged or destroyed equipment in excess of its carrying value. 
 The transaction costs for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, represent deferred costs incurred for Alpine's initial public offering that were charged to earnings as a result of its postponement. 
 Severance charges for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 relate to the departure of certain highly-compensated employees. 
 (Gain) loss on disposal of assets, net consists of gains and losses on the sale of excess property, early equipment failures and other asset dispositions. 
 Supply commitment charges for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, represent charges related to contractual inventory purchase commitments to certain proppant suppliers. These charges were attributable to our decreased volume of purchases from these suppliers due to certain customers decreasing their activity levels. If future customer demand differs from our contracted supply, we may incur supply commitment charges in future periods. 
 The acquisition earnout adjustment for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 represents a decrease in the fair value of the contingent consideration related to our acquisition of REV in December 2022. 
 Interest Expense, Net 
 Interest expense, net of interest income, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 40.6 million and 117.8 million, respectively, which was consistent with 40.2 million and 116.1 million in the same periods in 2023. 
 Gain (Loss) on Extinguishment of Debt 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2023, we recognized a net gain of 4.1 million, which was primarily due to the forgiveness of Flotek's Paycheck Protection Program loan in the first quarter of 2023. 
 Other (Expense) Income, Net 
 For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 we recognized a loss of 0.1 million and a gain of 1.2 million, respectively, compared with a loss of 4.9 million and 22.0 million in the same periods in 2023. The 2023 loss was primarily attributable to a decrease in the fair value of our investment in BPC and the change in fair value of our Munger make-whole provision. 
 Income Taxes 
 Income taxes were a benefit of 24.9 million and an expense of 9.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Our effective tax rate for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 19.0 , compared with 20.5 in the same period in 2023. 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, our income tax provision included a discrete benefit of 25.6 million related to the release of a portion of the valuation allowance on our net deferred tax assets. This discrete item was caused by the assumption of a 25.6 million net deferred tax liability in our acquisition of AST, which made it more likely than not that we would be able to utilize a corresponding amount of our deferred tax assets. Excluding this discrete item, the difference between our effective tax rate and the federal statutory rate related to changes in the valuation allowance on our net deferred tax assets. 
 In 2023, the difference between our effective tax rate and the federal statutory rate related to changes in the valuation allowance on our net deferred tax assets and to the income that was earned within the financial statement consolidated group that is not subject to tax within the financial statement consolidated group.

Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 Sources of Liquidity 
 Our primary sources of liquidity are cash flows from operations and availability under our revolving credit facility. While Flotek is included in our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements, we do not have the ability to access or use Flotek s cash or liquidity in our operations and, accordingly, have excluded Flotek s cash and other sources of liquidity from the following discussion of our liquidity and capital resources. See "Note 10. Variable Interest Entity" in the notes to our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements for discussion of our ownership of Flotek. 
 Our Alpine 2023 Term Loan requires us to segregate collateral associated with Alpine and limits our ability to use Alpine's cash or assets to satisfy our obligations or the obligations of our other subsidiaries. We also have limited ability to provide Alpine with liquidity to satisfy its obligations. Refer to our Annual Report and "Note 4. Debt" in the notes to our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements for more information regarding the Alpine 2023 Term Loan. 
 At September 30, 2024, we had 20.5 million of cash and cash equivalents, excluding Flotek, and 88.7 million available for borrowings under our revolving credit facility, which resulted in a total liquidity position of 109.2 million. Refer to our Annual Report for more information regarding our revolving credit facility. 
 We believe that our cash and cash equivalents, cash provided by operations and the availability under our revolving credit facility will be sufficient to fund our capital expenditures and satisfy our debt obligations for at least the next 12 months. If we pursue additional acquisitions during 2024, we will likely need to raise additional debt and/or equity financing to fund them. There is no assurance we could do that on favorable terms, if at all. 
 Cash Flows 
 Cash flows provided by (used in) each type of activity were as follows: 

Nine Months Ended September 30, 

2024 

2023 

Net cash provided by (used in): 

Operating activities 

290.8 

510.8 

Investing activities 

(351.8) 

(687.4) 

Financing activities 

61.2 

164.5 

Net change in cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash 

0.2 

(12.1) 

Operating Activities. Net cash provided by operating activities was 290.8 million and 510.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Cash flows from operating activities consist of net income or loss adjusted for non-cash items and changes in net working capital. Net income or loss adjusted for non-cash items for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 resulted in a cash increase of 255.6 million compared with a cash increase of 391.3 million in the same period of 2023. This change was primarily due to lower earnings in 2024. Changes in net working capital for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 resulted in a cash increase of 35.2 million compared with a cash increase of 119.5 million in the same period of 2023. This change was primarily due to decreased cash from accounts receivable in 2024, which was partially offset by increased cash provided by inventories and accounts payable in 2024. 
 Investing Activities. Net cash used in investing activities was 351.8 million and 687.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. This change was primarily due to decreased cash used for acquisitions and capital expenditures in 2024. 
 Financing Activities. Net cash provided in financing activities was 61.2 million and 164.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Net cash provided in 2024 and 2023 was primarily attributable to borrowings to fund acquisitions and utilization of our revolving credit facility for general corporate purposes. Additionally, in 2023 we received net proceeds of 48.9 million from the issuance of Preferred Stock. 
 36 

Cash Requirements 
 Our material cash requirements have consisted of, and we anticipate will continue to consist of the following: 
 debt service obligations, including interest and principal; 

capital expenditures; 

purchase commitments; 

tax receivable agreement payments, and 

acquisitions of strategic businesses. 

Debt Service Obligations 
 As of September 30, 2024 we have 1,205.7 million in aggregate principal amount of long-term debt outstanding, with 171.9 million coming due over the next twelve months. For additional information about our long-term debt, see "Note 4. Debt" in the notes to our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements and Item 8 "Financial Statements and Supplementary Data" in our Annual Report. 
 Both the 2029 Senior Notes and the ABL Credit Facility contain certain customary representations and warranties and affirmative and negative covenants. As of September 30, 2024, we were in compliance with these covenants. 
 The Alpine 2023 Term Loan originally contained a covenant commencing with the fiscal quarter ending September 30, 2024, requiring Alpine not to exceed a maximum Total Net Leverage Ratio (as defined in the Alpine Term Loan Credit Agreement) of 2.00 to 1.00. This ratio is generally the consolidated total debt of Alpine divided by Alpine's adjusted EBITDA. In the second quarter of 2024, this covenant was amended to commence testing compliance with the Total Net Leverage Ratio with the fiscal quarter ending on September 30, 2025. As a result of Alpine s lower than expected operating results in 2024, Alpine is closely monitoring its forthcoming compliance obligation with this covenant. While there can be no assurance, Alpine believes that it will be able to meet, modify, or further defer this debt covenant. 
 Capital Expenditures 
 The nature of our capital expenditures consists of a base level of investment required to support our current operations and amounts related to growth and company initiatives. 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024 our capital expenditures were 191.8 million, consisting of maintenance capital expenditures for our hydraulic fracturing fleet, upgrades to legacy pumps, expenditures to maintain efficient operations at our sand mines, and investments in next generation technology. 
 For the full year of 2024, we estimate capital expenditures will range from 150 million to 200 million in maintenance related expenditures and an additional 100 million for growth initiatives across all segments. Currently, growth capital expenditures for 2024 are expected to be related to sand mine improvements, upgrades to our hydraulic fracturing fleet and investments in next generation technology. 
 We continually evaluate our capital expenditures and the amount that we ultimately spend will depend on a number of factors, including customer demand for new fleets and expected industry activity levels. 
 Purchase Commitments 
 As of September 30, 2024, we had purchase commitments of 5.4 million in 2024 and 55.8 million in 2025 for minimum sand commitments and hydraulic fracturing equipment components. 
 Tax Receivable Agreement 
 As of September 30, 2024 we have 71.3 million of estimated tax receivable agreement obligations, with an estimated 3.2 million coming due over the next twelve months. This obligation will generally be paid under the tax receivable agreement as the Company realizes actual cash tax savings from the tax benefits covered by the tax receivable agreement in future tax years. We do not expect a significant increase in the estimate of this liability in future periods. For additional information about our tax receivable agreement, please see Item 8 "Financial Statements and Supplementary Data" in our Annual Report. 
 37 

Commitments and Contingencies 
 Prior to September 2024, we were litigating multiple patent infringement lawsuits against Halliburton. In September 2024, we settled these lawsuits with Halliburton for a confidential amount and the financial effects of this matter have been included in our consolidated financial statements as of September 30, 2024. See Note 9. Commitments and Contingencies in the notes to our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements for further discussion. 
 Acquisitions of Strategic Businesses 
 Our growth strategy includes potential acquisitions and other strategic transactions. From time to time we enter into non-binding letters of intent as well as binding agreements to make investments or acquisitions. These arrangements may provide for purchase consideration including cash, notes payable by us, equity or some combination, the use of which could impact our liquidity needs. These letters of intent typically are subject to the completion of satisfactory due diligence, the negotiation and resolution of significant business and legal issues, the negotiation, documentation and completion of mutually satisfactory definitive agreements among the parties, the consent of our lenders, our ability to finance any cash payment at closing, and approval of our board of directors. Any binding agreements we may enter typically include customary closing conditions. We cannot guarantee that any such actual or potential transaction will be completed on acceptable terms, if at all. 
 We have historically funded our acquisitions through issuances of our equity securities and borrowings under our credit agreements. For any future acquisitions, we may utilize borrowings under our revolving credit facility and various financing sources available to us, including the issuance of equity or debt securities through public offerings or private placements, to fund these acquisitions. Our ability to complete future offerings of equity or debt securities and the timing and terms of these offerings will depend on various factors including prevailing market conditions and our financial condition. 
 38 

ITE M 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 
 At September 30, 2024, we held no derivative instruments that materially increased our exposure to market risks for interest rates, foreign currency rates, commodity prices or other market price risks. We are subject to interest rate risk on our variable-rate debt. A 1 increase in interest rates on our variable-rate debt as of September 30, 2024, would increase the annual interest payments for this debt by approximately 11.1 million. 
 ITE M 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 In accordance with Exchange Act Rule 13a-15, we carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of management, including our Executive Chairman (our principal executive officer) and our Chief Financial Officer (our principal financial officer), of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based on that evaluation, our Executive Chairman and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of September 30, 2024 to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC's rules and forms. Our disclosure controls and procedures include controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Executive Chairman and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures. 
 Limitations on Controls and Procedures 
 In designing and evaluating our disclosure controls and procedures, management recognizes that disclosure controls and procedures, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the disclosure controls and procedures are met. Additionally, in designing disclosure controls and procedures, our management was required to apply its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible disclosure controls and procedures. The design of any system of controls also is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions; over time, controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or the degree of compliance with policies or procedures may deteriorate. Because of the inherent limitations in a control system, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected. 
 Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the three months ended September 30, 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

Exhibit 95 
 
 MINE SAFETY DISCLOSURES 
 Under Section 1503(a) of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act and Item 104 of Regulation S-K, each operator of a coal or other mine is required to include certain mine safety information in its periodic reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The table below includes this mine safety information for each mine facility owned and operated by ProFrac Holding Corp., or its subsidiaries, for the quarterly period ended September 30, 2024. Due to timing and other factors, our data may not agree with the mine data retrieval system maintained by the Mine Safety and Health Administration MSHA ). The columns in the table represent the total number of, and the proposed dollar assessment for, violations, citations and orders issued by MSHA during the period upon periodic inspection of our mine facilities in accordance with the referenced sections of the Federal Mine Safety and Health Act of 1977, as amended (the Mine Act ), described as follows: 
 Section 104(a) Significant and Substantial Violations: Total number of violations of mandatory health or safety standards that could significantly and substantially contribute to the cause and effect of a coal or other mine safety or health hazard. 

Section 104(b) Orders: Total number of orders issued due to a failure to totally abate, within the time period prescribed by MSHA, a violation previously cited under section 104, which results in the issuance of an order requiring the mine operator to immediately withdraw all persons from the mine. 

Section 104(d) Citations and Orders: Total number of citations and orders issued for unwarrantable failure of the mine operator to comply with mandatory health and safety standards. The violation could significantly and substantially contribute to the cause and effect of a safety and health hazard, but the conditions do not cause imminent danger. 

Section 110(b)(2) Flagrant Violations: Total number of flagrant violations defined as a reckless or repeated failure to make reasonable efforts to eliminate a known violation of a mandatory health or safety standard that substantially and proximately caused, or reasonably could have been expected to cause, death or serious bodily injury. 

Section 107(a) Imminent Danger Orders: Total number of orders issued when an imminent danger is identified which requires all persons to be withdrawn from area(s) in the mine until the imminent danger and the conditions that caused it to cease to exist. 

Total Dollar Value of Proposed MSHA Assessments: Each issuance of a citation or order by MSHA results in the assessment of a monetary penalty. The total dollar value presented includes any contested penalties. 

Legal Actions Pending, Initiated or Resolved: Total number of cases pending legal action before the Federal Mine Safety and Health Review Commission as of the last day of the reporting period or the number of such cases initiated or resolved during the reporting period.
