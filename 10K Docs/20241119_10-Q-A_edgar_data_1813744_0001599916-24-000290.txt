Revenue

advance received. As of July 31, 2023, no advance received related to product sales. 

Revenue
from crypto miners sales, net 

During the period ended July

of the Company. Revenue for the sale of crypto miners was recognized when the miners were delivered to the customers and the customers
completed the inspection of the miners. Management assessed the Company s contracts with the third-party manufacturer and customers

As such, the company recognized crypto miner sales net of costs. For the period ended July 31, 2023, cost of goods sold for miner purchases,
netted by the gross sales was 103,483,250. As of July 31, 2023, 124,343 of advance

,
a decrease of (-15 as compared to working capital of as
of October 31, 2022. Additionally, the Company recorded cash and cash equivalents of ,
an increase of as
compared to in
the prior year period ended July 31, 2022, The Company s increased liquidity is derived from increased sales, particularly
sales of crypto miners, and the sale of common shares (see Note 10). As stated in the consolidated financial statements, the
Company, for the period ended July 31, 2023, recorded a net loss of (-34 
y-o-y) and used 5,902,536 (-4,869 y-o-y) in cash flows from operating activities. The change in net profit(loss), use of cash
from operations, and decrease in working capital is mainly related to a large increase in research and development costs expensed in
the quarter ended July 31, 2023 (see Note 8). 

Having
reviewed the above, the Company realizes that whether we shall be able to continue the positive trends demonstrated in our previous financial
statements, lies in our ability to continue to generate revenue and increase revenue going forward. Principally, the Company's consolidated
financial statements are based on going concern assumptions, which assume the realization of assets and offset of liabilities in the normal
course of business. Based on this, the Company also recognizes that it is critical for us to continue to operate and/or perform our obligation(s)
in the future and procure any required funds needed to meet the redemption of its debt during normal business operations. 

Management has evaluated the estimated
impact of COVID-19, which has become a significant factor impacting operations of businesses globally, one of which we believe we will
need to continue to monitor as to the potential effects it may have on our own business. 

The Company assessed the impact of
COVID-19 and believes there to be minimal impact of COVID-19 on the Company s crypto miner sales, which is currently the Company s
primary source of revenue. The Company will need to continue to monitor COVID-19 and the effects it may have, socially and economically,
as it is possible that such developments may in fact impact our operations going forward or more specifically, our sales results. At this
time, the Company believes that it will not affect our assumptions as a going concern. 

Based
on the Company s evaluation and considering the positive financials trends the Company has experienced for many previous quarters,
management believes that the one-time R D expense this quarter will not adversely impact the Company s ability to continue as
a going concern (see Note 8). 

The financial
statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification of recorded assets, or the amounts and classification
of liabilities that might be necessary in the event that the Company cannot continue as a going concern. 

as of July 31, 2023 and as of October 31, 2022. No bad debt allowance was provided

statements generally are identified by the words believes, project, expects, anticipates, 
 estimates, intends, strategy, plan, may, will, would, 
 will be, will continue, will likely result, and similar expressions. 

Forward-looking statements
are based on current expectations and assumptions that are subject to risks and uncertainties which may cause actual results to differ
materially from the forward-looking statements. Our ability to predict results or the actual effect of future plans or strategies is inherently
uncertain. Factors which could have a material adverse effect on our operations and future prospects on a consolidated basis include but
are not limited to: changes in economic conditions, legislative/regulatory changes, availability of capital, interest rates, competition,

Ryohei Uetaki was appointed as Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer, President, Director, Secretary, and Treasurer. 

On November 18, 2019,
Yasumasa Ichikawa was appointed as Chief Technology Officer. 

On January 25, 2020,
the Company entered into and consummated a Share Contribution Agreement with Ryohei Uetaki. Pursuant to this agreement Mr. Uetaki gifted
to the Company, at no cost, 300 shares of common stock of World Scan Project Corporation, a Japan corporation WSP Japan ),
which represented all of its issued and outstanding shares. The Company has since gained a 100 interest in the issued and outstanding
shares of WSP Japan s common stock and WSP Japan is now a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company. The Company and WSP Japan were
under common control at the time of the acquisition. 

WSP Japan was incorporated
under the laws of Japan on January 22, 2020. Currently, WSP Japan is headquartered in Tokyo, Japan. The Company s primary business
is focused on developing and manufacturing autonomous aerial vehicles including drones. 

On February 19, 2020,
Ryohei Uetaki gifted 7,000,000 shares of our Common Stock and 10,000,000 shares of our Series A Preferred Stock, which represented all
of our issued and outstanding shares of Preferred Stock at the time, to SKYPR LLC, a Delaware Limited Liability Company (referred to herein
as SKYPR LLC ). Our CEO Ryohei Uetaki owns and controls 100 of the membership interests in SKYPR LLC. 

In September, 2020,
the Company entered into subscription agreements with 41 shareholders. Pursuant to these agreements, the Company issued 647,350 shares
of common stock in total to these shareholders and received 323,675 as aggregate consideration. At the time of purchase the price paid
per share by each shareholder was the equivalent of about 0.50 USD. 

These shares were
sold pursuant to the Company s effective S-1 Registration Statement deemed effective on August 28, 2020 at 4pm EST. 

On
or about May 15, 2023, the Company announced a direct public offering to sell up to 150,000 shares of common stock, at a fixed price
of 10.00 per share. This offering became
effective May 25, 2023. Our offering will terminate upon the earliest of (i) such time as all of the common stock has been sold pursuant
to the registration statement or (ii) 365 days from the effective date of this prospectus unless extended by our Board of Directors for
an additional 90 days. We may however, at any time and for any reason terminate the offering. 

We operate through
our wholly owned subsidiary, World Scan Project Corporation, a Japanese Company. The Company is an industrial automation equipment manufacturer,
designing/developing robots, drones, Web3 infrastructure, IoT equipment and other related products. 

Our principal executive
offices are located at 2-18-23, Nishiwaseda, Shinjuku-Ku, Tokyo, 169-0051, Japan. 

Liquidity and
Capital Resources 

As
of July 31, 2023 we had cash and cash balance in the amount of 2,000,134. Currently, our cash balance is sufficient to fund our operations
without the need for additional funding. 

Revenues 

We
recorded revenues of 28,315,324 for the nine months ended July 31, 2023. We recorded revenues of 13,157,055 for the nine months
ended July 31, 2022. 

Net Income(Loss) 

We
recorded net loss of 3,747,311 for
the nine months ended July 31, 2023. We recorded a net income of 2,166,830 for the nine months ended July 31, 2022. 

Cash flow 

For
the nine months ended July 31, 2023, we had negative cash flows used in operations in the amount of 5,865,495. The decrease in operating
cash flow is attributed to the net operating loss during this this period, mainly due to R D expenses (see Note 8). For the nine months
ended July 31, 2023, we had negative cash flows from investing activities in the amount of 6,558 due to the purchase of fixed assets.
For the nine months ended July 31, 2023, we had cash flows from financing activities in the amount of 1,500,000 due to the sale of common
shares. 

Going
Concern 

The Company s
financial statements are prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles applicable to a going concern that contemplates
the realization of assets and liquidation of liabilities in the normal course of business. 

The Company
demonstrates mixed trends, compared with the previous fiscal years, in our financial statements as in below: 

As
of July 31, 2023, the Company had working capital of 8,270,245, a decrease of 1,427,432 (-15 as compared to working capital of 9,697,677
as of October 31, 2022. Additionally, the Company recorded cash and cash equivalents of 2,000,134, an increase of 335,614 as compared
to 1,664,520 in the prior year period ended July 31, 2022, The Company s increased liquidity is derived from increased sales,
particularly sales of crypto miners, and the sale of common shares (see Note 10). As
stated in the consolidated financial statements, the Company, for the period ended July 31, 2023, recorded a net loss of 3,747,311 (-34 
y-o-y) and used 5,902,536 (-4,869 y-o-y) in cash flows from operating activities. The
change in net profit(loss), use of cash from operations, and decrease in working capital is mainly related to a large increase in research
and development costs expensed in the quarter ended July 31, 2023 (see Note 8). 

Having reviewed the above, the Company
realizes that whether we shall be able to continue demonstrating the positive trends demonstrated in our previous financial statements,
lies in our ability to continue to generate revenue and increase revenue going forward. Principally, the Company's consolidated financial
statements are based on going concern assumptions, which assume the realization of assets and offset of liabilities in the normal course
of business. Based on this, the Company also recognizes that it is critical for us to continue to operate and/or perform our obligation(s)
in the future and procure any required funds needed to meet the redemption of its debt during normal business operations. 

Management has evaluated the estimated
impact of COVID-19, which has become a significant factor impacting operations of businesses globally, one of which we believe we will
need to continue to monitor as to the potential effects it may have on our own business. 

The Company assessed the impact of
COVID-19 and believes there to be minimal impact of COVID-19 on the Company s crypto miner sales, which is currently the Company s
primary source of revenue. The Company will need to continue to monitor COVID-19 and the effects it may have, socially and economically,
as it is possible that such developments may in fact impact our operations going forward or more specifically, our sales results. At this
time, the Company believes that it will not affect our assumptions as a going concern. 

Based on the
Company s evaluation and considering the positive financials trends the Company has experienced for many previous quarters, management
believes that the one-time R D expense this quarter will not adversely impact the Company s ability to continue as a going concern.

The financial
statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification of recorded assets, or the amounts and classification
of liabilities that might be necessary in the event that the Company cannot continue as a going concern.

 CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 

Management s Report on Disclosure
Controls and Procedures 

We maintain disclosure
controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed under the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the Securities
and Exchange Commission's rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our
chief executive officer and our chief financial officer (who is acting as our principal executive officer, principal financial officer
and principle accounting officer) to allow for timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 

As
of July 31, 2023, we carried out an evaluation, under the supervision of our chief executive officer, with the participation of our chief
financial officer, of the effectiveness of the design and the operation of our disclosure controls and procedures. The officers concluded
that the disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of the end of the period covered by this report due to material weaknesses
identified below. 

The matters involving
internal controls and procedures that our management considered to be material weaknesses under the standards of the Public Company Accounting
Oversight Board were: domination of management by a single individual without adequate compensating controls, lack of a majority of outside
directors on board of directors, resulting in ineffective oversight in the establishment and monitoring of required internal controls
and procedures; inadequate segregation of duties consistent with control objectives, and lack of an audit committee. These material weaknesses
were identified by our Chief Executive Officer, who also serves as our Chief Financial Officer, in connection with the above evaluation. 

Inherent limitations
on effectiveness of controls 

Internal control
over financial reporting has inherent limitations which include but is not limited to the use of independent professionals for advice
and guidance, interpretation of existing and/or changing rules and principles, segregation of management duties, scale of organization,
and personnel factors. Internal control over financial reporting is a process which involves human diligence and compliance and is subject
to lapses in judgment and breakdowns resulting from human failures. Internal control over financial reporting also can be circumvented
by collusion or improper management override. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent
or detect misstatements on a timely basis, however these inherent limitations are known features of the financial reporting process and
it is possible to design into the process safeguards to reduce, though not eliminate, this risk. Therefore, even those systems determined
to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and presentation. Projections of
any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions,
or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. 

Changes in
Internal Control over Financial Reporting 

There have been
no changes in our internal controls over financial reporting that have occurred for the fiscal quarter ended July 31, 2023, that have
materially or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal controls over financial reporting.
