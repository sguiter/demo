 to days. The Company pays depletion allowances to its wholesale distributors based on their sales to their customers. The Company estimates these depletion allowances and records such estimates in the same period the related revenue is recognized, resulting in a reduction of wholesale product revenue and the establishment of a current liability. Subsequently, wholesale distributors will bill the Company for actual depletion allowances, which may be different from the Company s estimate.

Grape and bulk sales are made under contracts with customers, which include product specification requirements, pricing, and payment terms. Payment terms under grape contracts are generally structured around the timing of the harvest of the grapes and are generally due 30 days from the time the grapes are delivered. Payment terms under bulk wine contracts are generally days from the date of shipment and may include an upfront payment upon signing of the sales agreement. The Company transfers control and recognizes revenue for grape sales when product specification has been met and title to the grapes has transferred, which is generally on the date the grapes are harvested, weighed and shipped.

 Accounts Receivable, Net 
 
 Accounts receivable are reported net of an allowance for credit losses. Credit is extended based upon an evaluation of the customer s financial condition. Accounts are charged against the allowance for credit losses as they are deemed uncollectible based on a periodic review of the accounts. In estimating an allowance for credit losses that is representative of the lifetime expected credit losses on its trade receivables, the Company utilizes historical loss data adjusted for current conditions (current balance and aging categories) and reasonable and supportable estimates of future defaults based on collection attempts and communication. The Company s accounts receivable balance is net of an allowance for credit losses of less than 0.1 million as of September 30, 2024 and million as of December 31, 2023.

 In-process goods Packaging and bottling supplies Total inventory 
 
 The Company s inventory balances are presented at the lower of cost or net realizable value. The Company reduces the carrying value of inventories that are obsolete or in excess of estimated usage to estimated net realizable value. The Company s estimates of net realizable value are based on analyses and assumptions including, but not limited to, historical usage, projected future demand, and market requirements. Reductions to the carrying value of inventories are recorded in cost of sales. If future demand and/or profitability for the Company s products are less than previously estimated, then the carrying value of the inventories may be required to be reduced, resulting in additional expense and reduced profitability. The Company s inventory write-downs may consist of reductions to bottled or bulk wine inventory. Crop insurance proceeds from farming losses may be recorded as offsets against previously recognized write-downs. 
 
 Inventory write-downs of million and million were recorded during the three-month periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Inventory write-downs of million and million were recorded during the nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively.

The Company s repurchase was funded through cash on hand, and the shares were retired. 
 
 Stock-Based Compensation 
 
 In February 2013, the Company adopted the 2013 Omnibus Incentive Plan (the 2013 Plan ), which provides for the granting of up to stock options or other common stock-based awards. In July 2022, upon the approval of the Board of Directors and the Company s stockholders, the Company adopted the 2022 Omnibus Incentive Plan (the 2022 Plan to supersede and replace the 2013 Plan. The 2022 Plan provides for the granting of up to stock options or other common stock-based awards. The terms of awards that may be granted, including vesting and performance criteria, if any, will be determined by the Board of Directors. 
 
 In December 2019, under the 2013 Plan, option grants for shares were issued. The options vest annually over and expire from the date of grant. In July 2021, stock option awards for shares were issued to certain members of management. Subject to the terms of the respective option award agreements, the options vest in equal increments in January 2022, January 2023, January 2024 and January 2025, and the options will expire from the date of grant. In March 2022, stock option awards for shares were granted to the Company s Chief Executive Officer. Such options are divided into tranches, are subject to both performance-based vesting requirements and time-based vesting requirements, and expire from the date of grant. In March 2023 and March 2024, stock option awards for and shares, respectively, were granted to certain officers and employees of the Company. Such options are divided into tranches, are subject to both performance-based vesting requirements and time-based vesting requirements, and expire from the date of grant. The performance-based vesting requirements for the grants made from 2022 through 2024 are tied to annual or cumulative Adjusted EBITDA targets, as defined within the respective underlying option award agreements. The exercise price for all respective options was either the closing price or average trading price on the date of grant. 
 
 As of September 30, 2024, the Company determined the achievement of certain targets for the aforementioned performance-based agreements were not probable based on updates to the Company s financial projections and assumptions regarding industry conditions. Consequently, the Company recognized a cumulative reversal of previously recorded stock-based compensation expenses for award tranches with performance targets that were deemed not probable of achievement. The Company has recorded the appropriate adjustments within stock-based compensation expenses for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024. 
 
 Estimates of stock-based compensation expense require a number of complex and subjective assumptions, including the selection of an option pricing model. The Company determined the grant date fair value of the awards using the Black-Scholes-Merton option-pricing valuation model. 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company granted stock options in respect of shares.

 operating segments, Wholesale net sales and Direct to Consumer net sales, which are reportable segments for financial statement reporting purposes, based upon their different distribution channels, margins, and selling strategies. Wholesale net sales include all sales through a third party where prices are given at a wholesale rate, whereas Direct to Consumer net sales include retail sales in tasting rooms, remote sites and on-site events, wine club sales, direct phone sales, Ecommerce sales, and other sales made directly to the consumer without the use of an intermediary. 
 
 The segments reflect how the Company s operations are evaluated by its CODM and the structure of its internal financial reporting. The Company evaluates performance based on the gross profit of the respective business segments. Selling expenses that can be directly attributable to the segment are allocated accordingly. However, centralized selling expenses and general and administrative expenses are not allocated between operating segments. Therefore, net income information for the respective segments is not available. Based on the nature of the Company s business, revenue generating assets are utilized across segments. Therefore, discrete financial information related to segment assets and other balance sheet data is not available and that information continues to be aggregated.

 Cybersecurity 
 
 As previously disclosed in the Company s Current Reports on Form 8-K as filed with the SEC on July 5, 2024 and July 25, 2024, the Company detected a cybersecurity incident in which an unauthorized third party gained access to certain information systems of the Company on June 30, 2024. Upon detection, the Company promptly initiated response protocols and began taking steps to contain, assess and remediate the cybersecurity incident, including launching an investigation with external cybersecurity experts. Although the Company believes that the cybersecurity incident has not had, and is not reasonably likely to have, a material impact on its overall financial condition or results of operations, its investigation of this incident is ongoing and the Company may discover other impacts or new events related to this incident may occur that could affect the Company s financial condition or results of operations. As of September 30, 2024, incurred cybersecurity expenses have been accrued and reflected within the Company s unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements. Although the Company expects a substantial portion of these expenses will ultimately be covered by its insurer, the amounts and timing have not been finalized.

 Overview of Business 
 
 The Company generates revenues from sales of wine to wholesalers and direct to consumers, sales of bulk wine and grapes, custom winemaking services, special event fees, tasting fees and other non-wine retail sales such as merchandise. 
 
 The Company s wines are primarily sold to wholesale distributors, who then sell to retailers and restaurants. The Company sells wine (through distributors and directly) to restaurants, bars, and other hospitality locations On-Premise ). The Company also sells wine (through distributors and directly) to supermarkets, grocery stores, liquor stores, and other chains, third-party Ecommerce and independent stores Off-Premise ). As permitted under federal, state and local regulations, the Company has increased its emphasis on generating revenue from direct sales to consumers, which occur through wine clubs, at the wineries tasting rooms, and through the Ecommerce channel. Direct sales to consumers are more profitable for the Company as it is able to sell its products at a price closer to retail prices rather than the wholesale price sold to distributors. From time to time, the Company may sell grapes or bulk wine because the grapes or wine do not meet the quality standards for its products, market conditions have changed resulting in reduced demand for certain products, or because the Company may have produced more of a particular varietal than it can use. When these sales occur, they may result in a loss. 
 
 Cost of sales includes grape and bulk wine costs, whether purchased or produced from the Company s controlled vineyards, crush costs, winemaking and processing costs, bottling, packaging, warehousing, and shipping and handling costs. For the Company s produced grapes, grape costs include annual farming costs, harvest costs, and depreciation of vineyard assets. For wines that age longer than one year, winemaking and processing costs continue to be incurred and capitalized to the cost of wine, which can range from three to 36 months. Reductions to the carrying value of inventories are also included in cost of sales.

Table of Contents 

As of September 30, 2024, wine inventory included approximately 0.5 million cases of bottled wine and bulk wine, both in various stages of the aging process. Cased wine is expected to be sold over the next 12 to 36 months and generally before the release date of the next vintage. 
 
 Seasonality 
 
 As discussed in the 2023 Report, the wine industry in general historically experiences seasonal fluctuations in revenues and net income. The Company typically has lower sales and net income during the first quarter and higher sales and net income during the fourth quarter due to seasonal holiday buying as well as wine club shipment timing. The Company anticipates similar trends in the future. 
 
 Climate Conditions and Extreme Weather Events 
 
 Winemaking and grape growing are subject to a variety of agricultural risks. Various diseases, pests, natural disasters, and certain climate conditions can materially and adversely affect the quality and quantity of grapes available to Crimson thereby materially and adversely affecting the supply of Crimson s products and its profitability. Given the risks presented by climate conditions and extreme weather, Crimson regularly evaluates impacts of climate conditions and weather on its business and plans to disclose any material impacts on the business. Along with various insurance policies currently in place, Crimson has made investments to improve its climate resilience and strives to effectively manage grape sourcing to help mitigate the impact of climate change and unforeseen natural disasters. Crimson continues to complete upgrades to its facilities to improve water resilience and fire mitigation measures with plans to advance these initiatives through improvements of irrigation and water systems over the next several years. 
 
 Following a series of challenging harvest cycles in 2020 and 2021 due to historical wildfires and severe weather conditions, the Company s improved yields in recent years have replenished inventory levels towards normalized expectations. The Company s inventory position coupled with better market conditions have reduced near-term pricing pressure on purchased bulk wine. Depending on the wine, the production cycle from harvest to bottled sales is anywhere from one to three years. 
 
 Inflation and Market Conditions 
 
 The Company expects profit margins to remain steady or increase if it is able to effectively manage cost of sales and operating expenses, subject to any volatility in the bulk wine markets, increased labor costs, increased commodity costs, including dry goods and packaging materials, and increased transportation costs. The Company continues to monitor the impact of inflation in an attempt to minimize its effects through pricing strategies and cost reductions. If, however, the Company s operations are impacted by significant inflationary pressures, it may not be able to completely offset increased costs through price increases on its products, negotiations with suppliers, cost reductions, or production improvements.
