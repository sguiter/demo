The Company recorded performance-based fees of million during the three-month and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024, and million during the three-month and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2023. Since the completion of the initial contract measurement term, the performance-based fee has been calculated annually based on the client investment results over the most recently completed period.

 Revenue Recognition Mutual Fund Administration 
 DHCM has an administrative and transfer agency services agreement with the Funds under which DHCM performs certain services for each Fund. These services include performance obligations, such as mutual fund administration, fund accounting, transfer agency, and other related functions. These services are performed concurrently under DHCM s agreement with the Funds. All performance obligations to provide these administrative services are satisfied over time, and the Company recognizes the related revenue as time progresses. Each Fund pays DHCM a fee for performing these services, which is calculated using an annual rate multiplied by the average daily net assets of each respective Fund share class. These fees are thereby constrained and represent variable consideration, and are excluded from revenue until the AUM on which DHCM bills the Funds are no longer subject to market fluctuations.

 As of September 30, 2024, the carrying value of the right-of-use asset, which is included in property and equipment on the consolidated balance sheets, was approximately million. As of September 30, 2024, the carrying value of the lease liability was approximately million. 
 The carrying value of the lease liability includes both principal and accrued interest on lease payments that are due in the current and future periods. Lease liability is measured at the present value of the remaining lease payments, discounted using the discount rate determined at the lease commencement date. Interest expense on lease liability is recognized in the consolidated income statements over the lease term. 
 As of September 30, 2024, the weighted average discount rate applied to the Company s lease liability was , reflective of the Company s incremental borrowing rate. The determination of the incremental borrowing rate involves judgement, including assumptions about the Company s credit risk, economic conditions, and the lease-specific circumstances such as lease term and asset class. Changes in these assumptions could have a material impact on the measurement of the Company s lease liability.

 (a) The provision for income taxes includes the impact of the operations of the Consolidated Fund, which is not subject to federal income taxes. Accordingly, a portion of the Company s earnings are not subject to corporate tax levels. 
 The Company s actual effective tax rate for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2024 could be materially different from the projected rate as of September 30, 2024. 
 The net temporary differences incurred to date will reverse in future periods as the Company generates taxable earnings. The Company believes that it is more likely than not that the results of future operations will generate sufficient taxable income to realize the net deferred tax assets recorded. The Company records a valuation allowance when it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, no valuation allowance was deemed necessary. 
 FASB ASC 740, Income Taxes , prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken, or expected to be taken, in a tax return, and also provides guidance on de-recognition, classification, interest and penalties, accounting in interim periods, disclosure, and transition. The Company recognizes tax benefits related to positions taken, or expected to be taken, on its tax returns, only if the positions are more-likely-than-not sustainable. Once this threshold has been met, the Company s measurement of its expected tax benefits is recognized in its financial statements. The Company did not record an accrual for tax-related uncertainties or unrecognized tax positions as of September 30, 2024 or December 31, 2023.

The words may, believe, expect, anticipate, target, goal, project, estimate, guidance, forecast, outlook, would, will, continue, likely, should, hope, seek, plan, intend, and variations of such words and similar expressions identify forward-looking statements. Similarly, descriptions of the Company s objectives, strategies, plans, goals, or targets are also forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements are based on the Company s expectations at the time such statements are made, speak only as of the dates they are made and are susceptible to a number of risks, uncertainties and other factors. While the Company believes that the assumptions underlying its forward-looking statements are reasonable, investors are cautioned that any of the assumptions could prove to be inaccurate and, accordingly, the Company s actual results and experiences may differ materially from the anticipated results or other expectations expressed in its forward-looking statements. 
 Factors that may cause the Company s actual results or experiences to differ materially from results discussed in forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to: (i) any reduction in the Company s AUM or AUA; (ii) withdrawal, renegotiation, or termination of investment advisory agreements; (iii) damage to the Company s reputation; (iv) failure to comply with investment guidelines or other contractual requirements; (v) challenges from the competition the Company faces in its business; (vi) challenges from industry trends towards lower fee strategies and model portfolio arrangements; (vii) adverse regulatory and legal developments; (viii) unfavorable changes in tax laws or limitations; (ix) interruptions in or failure to provide critical technological service by the Company or third parties; (x) adverse civil litigation and government investigations or proceedings; (xi) failure to adapt to or successfully incorporate technological changes, such as artificial intelligence, into the Company s business; (xii) risk of loss on the Company s investments; (xiii) lack of sufficient capital on satisfactory terms; (xiv) losses or costs not covered by insurance; (xv) a decline in the performance of the Company s products; (xvi) changes in interest rates and inflation; (xvii) changes in national and local economic and political conditions; (xviii) the continuing economic uncertainty in various parts of the world; (xix) the after-effects of the COVID-19 pandemic and the actions taken in connection therewith; (xx) political uncertainty caused by, among other things, political parties, economic nationalist sentiments, tensions surrounding the current socioeconomic landscape; and (xxi) other risks identified from time-to-time in the Company s public documents on file with the SEC. 
 
 Forward-looking statements attributable to the Company or any person acting on its behalf are expressly qualified in their entirety by the cautionary statements above, in Part I Item 1A. Risk Factors of the 2023 Form 10-K, and in the Company s public documents on file with the SEC. New risks and uncertainties arise from time to time, and factors that the Company currently deems immaterial may become material, and it is impossible for the Company to predict these events or how they may affect it. The Company undertakes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements after the date they are made, whether as a result of new information, future events or developments or otherwise, except as required by law, although it may do so from time to time. Readers are advised to review this Form 10-Q in its entirety and consult any further disclosures the Company makes on related subjects in its public announcements and SEC filings. The Company does not endorse any projections regarding future performance that may be made by third parties. 
 General 
 The Company derives its consolidated revenue and net income from investment advisory and fund administration services provided by DHCM. DHCM is a registered investment adviser under the 1940 Act, and is the investment adviser and administrator for the Funds. DHCM also provides investment advisory and related services to DHMF as well as separately managed accounts, CITs, other pooled vehicles including sub-advised funds, and model delivery programs. 
 The Company believes focusing on generating excellent, long-term investment outcomes and building enduring client partnerships will enable it to grow its intrinsic value to achieve a compelling, long-term return for its shareholders. 
 The Company accomplishes this through its shared investment principles, including: (i) valuation-disciplined active portfolio management; (ii) fundamental bottom-up research; (iii) a long-term, business owner mindset; and (iv) a client alignment philosophy that ensures clients interests come first. Client alignment is emphasized through: (i) a strategic capacity discipline 
 23 

Table of Contents 

 that protects portfolio managers abilities to generate excess returns; (ii) personal investment by the Company s portfolio managers in the strategies they manage; (iii) portfolio manager compensation being driven by long-term investment results in client portfolios; and (iv) a fee philosophy focused on a fair sharing of the economics among clients, employees, and shareholders. The Company s core cultural values of curiosity, ownership, trust, and respect create an environment where investment professionals focus on investment results and all teammates focus on the overall client experience. 
 The Company offers a variety of investment strategies designed for long-term strategic allocations from institutionally-oriented investors in key asset classes, aligning its investment team s competitive advantages with its clients needs. 
 Assets Under Management 
 DHCM s principal source of revenue is investment advisory fees earned from managing client accounts under investment advisory and sub-advisory agreements. The fees earned depend on the type of investment strategy, account size, and servicing requirements. DHCM s revenues depend largely on the total value and composition of its AUM. Accordingly, net cash flows from clients, market fluctuations, and the composition of AUM impact the Company s revenues and results of operations. The Company also has certain agreements that allow it to earn performance-based fees if investment returns exceed targeted amounts over a specified measurement period. 
 Model Delivery Programs - Assets Under Advisement 
 DHCM provides strategy-specific model portfolios to sponsors of model delivery programs. DHCM is paid for its services by the program sponsors at a pre-determined rate based on AUA in the model delivery programs. DHCM does not have discretionary investment authority over individual client accounts in the model delivery programs, and therefore, AUA is not included in the Company s AUM. 
 The Company s revenues are highly dependent on both the value and composition of AUM and AUA. The following is a summary of the Company s AUM by product and investment strategy, a roll-forward of the change in AUM, and a summary of AUA for the three-month and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023:

 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, net cash used in financing activities totaled 38.4 million, consisting of cash outflows for repurchases of DHIL s common shares of 21.7 million, the payment of quarterly dividends totaling 12.5 million, and the value of shares withheld to cover employee tax withholding obligations of 4.5 million. These cash outflows were partially offset by proceeds received under the ESPP of 0.3 million. 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2023, net cash used in financing activities totaled 27.2 million, consisting of cash outflows for repurchases of DHIL s common stock of 19.6 million, the payment of quarterly dividends totaling 13.4 million, and the value of shares withheld to cover employee tax withholding obligations of 5.0 million. These cash outflows were partially offset by net subscriptions received in the Consolidated Funds from redeemable noncontrolling interest holders of 10.4 million and proceeds received under the ESPP of 0.4 million.

 Non-GAAP Financial Measures and Reconciliation 
 As supplemental information, the Company is providing certain financial measures that are based on methodologies other than GAAP non-GAAP ). Management believes the non-GAAP financial measures below are useful measures of the Company s core business activities, are important metrics in estimating the value of an asset management business, and help facilitate comparisons to Company operating performance across periods. These non-GAAP financial measures are presented for supplemental informational purposes only, should not be used as a substitute for financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP and may be calculated differently from similarly titled non-GAAP measures used by other companies. The following schedules reconcile the differences between financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures for the three-month and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Investors are encouraged to review the related GAAP financial measures and the reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to their most directly comparable GAAP financial measures, as well as the Company s condensed consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this report.

Table of Contents 

 (1) This non-GAAP adjustment removes the compensation expense resulting from market valuation changes in the Deferred Compensation Plans liability and the related net gains/losses on investments designated as an economic hedge against the related liability. Amounts deferred under the Deferred Compensation Plans are adjusted for appreciation/depreciation of investments chosen by participants. The Company believes it is useful to offset the non-operating investment income or loss realized on the hedges against the related compensation expense and remove the net impact to help readers understand the Company s core operating results and to improve comparability from period to period. 
 (2) This non-GAAP adjustment removes the impact that the Consolidated Fund has on the Company s GAAP consolidated statements of income. Specifically, the Company adds back the operating expenses and subtracts the investment income of the Consolidated Fund. The adjustment to net operating income represents the operating expenses of the Consolidated Fund, net of the elimination of related management and administrative fees. The adjustment to net income attributable to common shareholders represents the net income of the Consolidated Fund, net of redeemable non-controlling interests. The Company believes removing the impact of the Consolidated Fund helps readers understand its core operating results and improves comparability from period to period. 
 (3) This non-GAAP adjustment represents the net gains or losses earned on the Company s non-consolidated investment portfolio that are not designated as economic hedges of the Deferred Compensation Plans liability, non-consolidated seed investments, and other investments. The Company believes adjusting for these non-operating income or loss items helps readers understand the Company s core operating results and improves comparability from period to period. 
 (4) The income tax expense impacts were calculated and resulted in the overall non-GAAP effective ta x rates of 26.4 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, 28.0 for the three months ended September 30, 2023, 27.0 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, and 28.4 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 

Critical Accounting Estimates 
 The Company s unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in accordance with GAAP requires management to make estimates, judgments, and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, expenses, and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. The Company evaluates such estimates, judgments, and assumptions on an ongoing basis, and bases its estimates, judgements, and assumptions on historical experiences, current trends, and various other factors that management believes to be reasonable under the circumstances at the time the estimate was made. By their nature, these estimates, judgments, and assumptions are subject to uncertainty, and actual results may differ materially from these estimates. 
 For a summary of the critical accounting policies important to understanding the condensed consolidated financial statements, please see Note 2, Significant Accounting Policies, in Part I - Item 1 - Financial Statements of this Form 10-Q, and Note 2, Significant Accounting Policies, in Part II - Item 8 - Financial Statements and Supplementary Data in the 2023 Form 10-K. 
 There have been no material changes to the Company s critical accounting estimates during the quarter ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the critical accounting estimates disclosed in Part II - Item 7 - Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in the 2023 Form 10-K. 

ITEM 3: Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 
 For information regarding the Company s exposure to certain market risks, see Part II - Item 7A - Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk in the 2023 Form 10-K. Except as described in Part I - Item 2 - Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations of this Form 10-Q, there have been no significant changes in the Company s market risk exposures since the Company s December 31, 2023 year end. 

ITEM 4: Controls and Procedures 
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 Management, including the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer, has conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of the Company s disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) or 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) as of the end of the period covered by this Form 10-Q (the Evaluation Date ). Based on such evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer have concluded that, as of the Evaluation Date, the Company s disclosure controls and procedures were effective to ensure that the information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act, is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods 
 36 

Table of Contents 

 specified in the SEC s rules and forms, and to ensure that the information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to the Company s management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. In designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, the Company s management recognized that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance, not absolute, of achieving the desired control objectives, and in reaching a reasonable level of assurance, the Company s management necessarily was required to apply its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures. As a result, there can be no assurance that the Company s controls and procedures will detect all errors or fraud. 
 
 Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
 There were no changes in the Company s internal controls over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) or 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) during the quarter ended September 30, 2024, that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company s internal controls over financial reporting. 

PART II: OTHER INFORMATION 

ITEM 1: Legal Proceedings 
 From time to time, the Company is party to ordinary, routine litigation that is incidental to its business. There are currently no such matters pending that the Company believes could have a material adverse effect on its consolidated financial statements. 

ITEM 1A: Risk Factors 
 There have been no material changes to the Company s risk factors from the information disclosed in Part I - Item 1A - Risk Factors of the 2023 Form 10-K. 

ITEM 2: Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds 
 
 During the quarter ended September 30, 2024, DHIL did not sell any common shares that were not registered under the Securities Act. The following table sets forth information regarding repurchases of DHIL common shares during the quarter ended September 30, 2024: 
 Period Total Number of Common Shares Purchased (a) 
 Average Price Paid Per Common Share 
 Total Number 
 of Common Shares 
 Purchased 
 as part of Publicly 
 Announced Plans or Programs (b) 
 Approximate Dollar Value of Shares that May Yet Be Purchased Under the Plans or Programs (b) 
 July 1, 2024 through July 31, 2024 308 140.75 8,077,166 August. 1, 2024 through August 31, 2024 22,367 149.17 22,367 4,740,602 September. 1, 2024 through September 30, 2024 9 149.11 9 4,739,260 Total 22,684 149.06 22,376 4,739,260 
 
 (a) The Company regularly withholds common shares for tax payments due upon the vesting of employee restricted stock. Common shares withheld to cover tax withholding obligations in connection with the vesting of employee restricted stock are treated as common share repurchases for purposes of this table. The common shares withheld are not considered repurchases of DHIL common shares under any authorized common share repurchase plan or program. During the quarter ended September 30, 2024, the Company withheld 308 DHIL common shares for employee tax withholding obligations at an average price paid per share of 140.75. 
 (b) On May 10, 2023, the Board authorized management to repurchase up to 50.0 million of DHIL common shares (the 2023 Repurchase Program ). On November 4, 2024, the Board terminated the 2023 Repurchase Program and approved a 
 37 

Table of Contents 

 new repurchase plan, authorizing management to repurchase up to 50 million DHIL common shares in the open market and in private transactions in accordance with applicable securities laws (the 2024 Repurchase Program ). The 2024 Repurchase Program will expire on November 4, 2026, or upon the earlier completion of all authorized purchases under the program. 
 In connection with the 2024 Repurchase Program, DHIL entered into a Rule 10b5-1 trading plan. The Rule 10b5-1 trading plan is intended to qualify for the safe harbor under Rule 10b5-1 of the Exchange Act. A Rule 10b5-1 trading plan allows a company to purchase its stock at times when it would not ordinarily be in the market because of its trading policies or the possession of material nonpublic information. Because repurchases under DHIL s Rule 10b5-1 trading plan are subject to specified parameters and certain price, timing, and volume restraints specified in the plan, there is no guarantee as to the exact number of common shares that will be repurchased or that there will be any repurchases at all pursuant to the plan. Purchases under the 2024 Repurchase Program may be made in the open market or through privately negotiated transactions. Purchases in the open market are intended to comply with Rule 10b-18 under the Exchange Act. 

ITEM 3: Defaults Upon Senior Securities 
 None. 

ITEM 4: Mine Safety Disclosures 
 Not applicable. 

ITEM 5: Other Information 
 During the quarter ended September 30, 2024, no director or Section 16 officer (as defined under Rule 16a-1 of the Exchange Act) or any Rule 10b5-1 trading arrangement or any non-Rule 10b5-1 trading arrangement (in each case, as defined in Item 408(a) of Regulation S-K).
