EXPLANATORY
NOTE 

Unless
otherwise indicated or the context otherwise requires, all references in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q (this Report to we, us, our, Permex, and the Company are to Permex Petroleum
Corporation., a corporation existing under the laws of the Province of British Columbia, Canada, and our wholly-owned subsidiary. 

Unless
otherwise indicated in this Report, natural gas volumes are stated at the legal pressure base of the state or geographic area in which
the reserves are located at 60 degrees Fahrenheit. Crude oil and natural gas equivalents are determined using the ratio of six Mcf of
natural gas to one barrel of crude oil, condensate or natural gas liquids. 

The
following definitions shall apply to the technical terms used in this Report. 

Terms
used to describe quantities of crude oil and natural gas: 

Bbl . 
One stock tank barrel, of 42 U.S. gallons liquid volume, used herein in reference to crude oil, condensate or NGLs. 

Boe . 
A barrel of oil equivalent and is a standard convention used to express crude oil, NGL and natural gas volumes on a comparable crude
oil equivalent basis. Gas equivalents are determined under the relative energy content method by using the ratio of 6.0 Mcf of natural
gas to 1.0 Bbl of crude oil or NGL. 

MBoe 
One thousand barrels of oil equivalent. 

MBbl . 
One thousand barrels of crude oil, condensate or NGLs. 

Mcf . 
One thousand cubic feet of natural gas. 

NGLs . 
Natural gas liquids. Hydrocarbons found in natural gas that may be extracted as liquefied petroleum gas and natural gasoline. 

Terms
used to describe our interests in wells and acreage: 

Basin . 
A large natural depression on the earth s surface in which sediments generally brought by water accumulate. 

Completion. 
The process of treating a drilled well followed by the installation of permanent equipment for the production of crude oil, NGLs, and/or
natural gas. 

Developed
acreage. Acreage consisting of leased acres spaced or assignable to productive wells. Acreage included in spacing units of
infill wells is classified as developed acreage at the time production commences from the initial well in the spacing unit. As such,
the addition of an infill well does not have any impact on a company s amount of developed acreage. 

Development
well. A well drilled within the proved area of a crude oil, NGL, or natural gas reservoir to the depth of a stratigraphic
horizon (rock layer or formation) known to be productive for the purpose of extracting proved crude oil, NGL, or natural gas reserves. 

Differential. 
The difference between a benchmark price of crude oil and natural gas, such as the NYMEX crude oil spot price, and the wellhead price
received. 

Dry
hole . A well found to be incapable of producing hydrocarbons in sufficient quantities such that proceeds from the sale of
such production exceed production expenses and taxes. 

Field . 
An area consisting of a single reservoir or multiple reservoirs all grouped on, or related to, the same individual geological structural
feature or stratigraphic condition. The field name refers to the surface area, although it may refer to both the surface and the underground
productive formations. 

Formation . 
A layer of rock which has distinct characteristics that differs from nearby rock. 

Gross
acres or Gross wells. The total acres or wells, as the case may be, in which a working interest is owned. 

Held
by operations. A provision in an oil and gas lease that extends the stated term of the lease as long as drilling operations
are ongoing on the property. 

Held
by production or HBP A provision in an oil and gas lease that extends the stated term of the lease as
long as the property produces a minimum quantity of crude oil, NGLs, and natural gas. 

3 

 Table of Contents 

Hydraulic
fracturing . The technique of improving a well s production by pumping a mixture of fluids into the formation and rupturing
the rock, creating an artificial channel. As part of this technique, sand or other material may also be injected into the formation to
keep the channel open, so that fluids or natural gases may more easily flow through the formation. 

Infill
well. A subsequent well drilled in an established spacing unit of an already established productive well in the spacing unit.
Acreage on which infill wells are drilled is considered developed commencing with the initial productive well established in the spacing
unit. As such, the addition of an infill well does not have any impact on a company s amount of developed acreage. 

Net
acres. The percentage ownership of gross acres. Net acres are deemed to exist when the sum of fractional ownership working
interests in gross acres equals one (e.g., a 10 working interest in a lease covering 640 gross acres is equivalent to 64 net acres). 

NYMEX . 
The New York Mercantile Exchange. 

Productive
well . A well that is found to be capable of producing hydrocarbons in sufficient quantities such that proceeds from the sale
of the production exceed production expenses and taxes. 

Recompletion . 
The process of treating a drilled well followed by the installation of permanent equipment for the production of crude oil, NGLs or natural
gas or, in the case of a dry hole, the reporting of abandonment to the appropriate agency. 

Reservoir . 
A porous and permeable underground formation containing a natural accumulation of producible crude oil, NGLs and/or natural gas that
is confined by impermeable rock or water barriers and is separate from other reservoirs. 

Spacing . 
The distance between wells producing from the same reservoir. Spacing is often expressed in terms of acres, e.g., 40-acre spacing, and
is often established by regulatory agencies. 

Undeveloped
acreage . Leased acreage on which wells have not been drilled or completed to a point that would permit the production of economic
quantities of crude oil, NGLs, and natural gas, regardless of whether such acreage contains proved reserves. Undeveloped acreage includes
net acres held by operations until a productive well is established in the spacing unit. 

Unit . 
The joining of all or substantially all interests in a reservoir or field, rather than a single tract, to provide for development and
operation without regard to separate property interests. Also, the area covered by a unitization agreement. 

Wellbore . 
The hole drilled by the bit that is equipped for natural gas production on a completed well. Also called well or borehole. 

Working
interest . The right granted to the lessee of a property to explore for and to produce and own crude oil, NGLs, natural gas
or other minerals. The working interest owners bear the exploration, development, and operating costs on either a cash, penalty, or carried
basis. 

Workover. 
 Operations on a producing well to restore or increase production. 

Terms
used to assign a present value to or to classify our reserves: 

Possible
reserves. The additional reserves which analysis of geoscience and engineering data suggest are less likely to be recoverable
than probable reserves. 

Pre-tax
PV-10 or PV-10. The estimated future net revenue, discounted at a rate of 10 per annum, before income taxes and with no
price or cost escalation or de-escalation in accordance with guidelines promulgated by the United States Securities and Exchange Commission
(the SEC ). 

Probable
reserves. The additional reserves which analysis of geoscience and engineering data indicate are less likely to be recovered
than proved reserves but which together with proved reserves, are as likely as not to be recovered. 

Proved
reserves . The quantities of crude oil, NGLs and natural gas, which, by analysis of geosciences and engineering data, can be
estimated with reasonable certainty to be economically producible, from a given date forward, from known reservoirs, and under existing
economic conditions, operating methods, and government regulations, prior to the time at which contracts providing the right to operate
expire, unless evidence indicates that renewal is reasonably certain, regardless of whether deterministic or probabilistic methods are
used for the estimation. The project to extract the hydrocarbons must have commenced or the operator must be reasonably certain that
it will commence the project within a reasonable time. 

Proved
undeveloped reserves or PUDs . Proved Reserves that are expected to be recovered from new wells on undrilled
acreage, or from existing wells where a relatively major expenditure is required for recompletion. Reserves on undrilled acreage are
limited to those directly offsetting development spacing areas that are reasonably certain of production when drilled, unless evidence
using reliable technology exists that establishes reasonable certainty of economic producibility at greater distances. Undrilled locations
can be classified as having proved undeveloped reserves only if a development plan has been adopted indicating that they are scheduled
to be drilled within five years, unless the specific circumstances justify a longer time. Estimates for proved undeveloped reserves are
not attributed to any acreage for which an application of fluid injection or other improved recovery technique is contemplated, unless
such techniques have been proved effective by actual projects in the same reservoir or an analogous reservoir, or by other evidence using
reliable technology establishing reasonable certainty.

SEC
Pricing means pricing calculated using oil and natural gas price parameters established by current guidelines of the SEC and
accounting rules based on the unweighted arithmetic average of oil and natural gas prices as of the first day of each of the 12 months
ended on the given date. 

CAUTIONARY
NOTICE REGARDING FORWARD LOOKING STATEMENTS 

We
desire to take advantage of the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. This Report
contains a number of forward-looking statements that reflect management s current views and expectations with respect to our business,
strategies, products, future results and events, and financial performance. All statements made in this Report other than statements
of historical fact, including statements that address operating performance, the economy, events or developments that management expects
or anticipates will or may occur in the future, including the adequacy of funds from operations, cash flows and financing, potential
strategic transactions, statements regarding future operating results and non-historical information, are forward-looking statements.
In particular, the words such as believe, expect, intend, anticipate, estimate, 
 may, will, can, plan, predict, could, future, 
 continue, variations of such words, and similar expressions identify forward-looking statements, but are not the exclusive
means of identifying such statements and their absence does not mean that the statement is not forward-looking. 

When
considering forward-looking statements, you should keep in mind the risk factors and other cautionary statements described under the
heading Risk Factors in our annual report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2023. These forward-looking
statements are based on management s current belief, based on currently available information, as to the outcome and timing of
future events. 

Forward-looking
statements may include statements about: 

our
 business strategy; 

our
 reserves; 

our
 financial strategy, liquidity and capital requirements; 

our
 realized or expected natural gas prices; 

our
 timing and amount of future production of natural gas; 

our
 future drilling plans and cost estimates; 

our
 competition and government regulations; 

our
 ability to make acquisitions; 

general
 economic conditions; 

our
 future operating results; and 

our
 future plans, objectives, expectations and intentions. 

We
caution you that these forward-looking statements are subject to all of the risks and uncertainties, most of which are difficult to predict
and many of which are beyond our control, incident to the exploration for and development, production and sale of natural gas. These
risks include, but are not limited to, commodity price volatility, lack of availability of drilling and production equipment and services,
environmental risks, drilling and other operating risks, regulatory changes, the uncertainty inherent in estimating natural gas reserves
and in projecting future rates of production, cash flow and access to capital, the timing of development expenditures, and the other
risks described under the heading Risk Factors in our annual report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended September 30,
2023. 

Reserve
engineering is a method of estimating underground accumulations of natural gas and oil that cannot be measured in an exact way. The accuracy
of any reserve estimate depends on the quality of available data, the interpretation of such data and price and cost assumptions made
by reserve engineers. In addition, the results of drilling, testing and production activities may justify revisions of previous estimates.
If significant, such revisions would change the schedule of any further production and development drilling. Accordingly, reserve estimates
may differ significantly from the quantities of natural gas and oil that are ultimately recovered. 

Should
one or more of the risks or uncertainties described in this Report occur, or should underlying assumptions prove incorrect, our actual
results and plans could differ materially from those expressed in any forward-looking statements. 

All
forward-looking statements, expressed or implied, included in this Report are expressly qualified in their entirety by this cautionary
statement. This cautionary statement should also be considered in connection with any subsequent written or oral forward-looking statements
that we or persons acting on our behalf may issue. 

Except
as otherwise required by applicable law, we disclaim any duty to update any forward-looking statements, all of which are expressly qualified
by the statements in this section, to reflect events or circumstances after the date of this Report. Notwithstanding the foregoing, any
public statements or disclosures by us following this Report that modify or impact any of the forward-looking statements contained in
this Report will be deemed to modify or supersede such statements in this Report.

 floor, 595 Howe Street, Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada, V6C 2T5. The Company is primarily engaged in the acquisition, development
and production of oil and gas properties in the United States. The Company s oil and gas interests are located in Texas and New
Mexico, USA. The Company is listed on the Canadian Securities Exchange (the CSE under the symbol OIL . On
April 16, 2024, the Company received a cease trade order (the FFCTO issued by the British Columbia Securities Commission
(the BCSC due to its failure to file the annual financial statements for fiscal 2023 and quarterly reports for fiscal
2024. The trading was halted on the CSE effective April 17, 2024. Subsequent to December 31, 2023, the Company brought all filings required
by the BCSC up to date. On September 6, 2024, the FFCTO was revoked by the BCSC, and the Company s common shares were reinstated
for trading on the CSE effective September 9, 2024. 

On
September 12, 2023, the Company s board of directors approved a reverse stock split of the Company s issued and outstanding
common stock at a 1 for 4 ratio, which was effective October 23, 2023. All issued and outstanding common stock, options, and warrants

, has a working capital deficiency of 
as of December 31, 2023 and has not yet achieved profitable operations. The Company requires equity or debt financings to fund its operation,
which it has been unable to secure in sufficient amounts to date, and there can be no assurances that it will be able to do so in the
future. The aforementioned factors raise substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern within one
year after the date that the financial statements are issued. 

The
Company also expects to raise additional funds through equity and debt financings. There is no assurance that such financing will be
available in the future. Subsequent to December 31, 2023, the Company has raised through the issuance of convertible debentures.
These debentures had a maturity date of but are currently in default due to the Company s failure to repay the
principal and accrued interest on the maturity date. The Company is currently negotiating a debt restructuring plan with the debenture
holders. Additionally, the Company has received subscription proceeds totaling . Management believes that this plan provides
an opportunity for the Company to continue as a going concern subject to its continued ability to raise funds to maintain its operations
and manage its working capital deficiency. 

In
view of these matters, continuation as a going concern is dependent upon continued operations of the Company, which in turn is dependent
upon the Company s ability to, meet its financial requirements, raise additional capital, and the success of its future operations.
The financial statements do not include any adjustments to the amount and classification of assets and liabilities that may be necessary
should the Company not continue as a going concern.

are only predictions. Actual events or results may differ materially. In evaluating these statements, you should specifically consider
various factors, including the risks outlined at the beginning of this Report under Cautionary Notice Regarding Forward-Looking

Reserve
engineering is a method of estimating underground accumulations of natural gas and oil that cannot be measured in an exact way. The accuracy
of any reserve estimate depends on the quality of available data, the interpretation of such data and price and cost assumptions made
by reserve engineers. In addition, the results of drilling, testing and production activities may justify revisions of previous estimates.
If significant, such revisions would change the schedule of any further production and development drilling. Accordingly, reserve estimates
may differ significantly from the quantities of natural gas and oil that are ultimately recovered.

Conversion
of Undeveloped Acreage 

The
Company s process for converting undeveloped acreage to developed acreage is tied to whether there is any drilling being conducted
on the acreage in question. The Company has started development and conversion of its undeveloped acreage located in Martin County, Texas.
The PPC Eoff #3 well, operated by Permex Petroleum, is the first of two permitted wells to be drilled by the Company on the 7,780 gross
acre Breedlove oilfield. Drilling of the first well commenced on September 14, 2022. Management expects to restart its drilling and development
program in the fourth quarter of 2024, subject to receipt of additional funding. 

An
aggregate of 1,609 MBO and 1,277 MMCF, of the Company s proved undeveloped reserves as of September 30, 2023, are part of a development
plan that has been adopted by management that calls for these undeveloped reserves to be drilled within the next five years, thus resulting
in the conversion of such proved undeveloped reserves to developed status within five years of initial disclosure at September 30, 2023.
Management currently anticipates spending approximately 0.5 million in capital expenditures towards developing the Company s proved
undeveloped reserves during the 2024 fiscal year, subject to the Company acquiring the necessary financing. 

Financing
of Proved and Probable Undeveloped Reserves 

The
Company currently estimates that the total cost to develop the Company s proved undeveloped reserves of 1,609.7 MBbl of oil and
1,277.1 Mcf of natural gas as of September 30, 2023 is 15,710,000. The Company expects to finance these capital costs through a combination
of current cash on hand, debt financing through a line of credit or similar debt instrument, one or more offerings of debt or equity,
and from cash generated from estimated revenues from sales of oil and natural gas produced at the Company s wells. 

The
Company currently estimates that the total cost to develop the Company s probable undeveloped reserves of 9,290.4 MBbl of oil and
10,882.8 Mcf of natural gas as of September 30, 2023 is 134,428,500. The Company expects to finance these capital costs through a combination
of joint ventures, farm-in agreements, direct participation programs, one or more offerings of equity, a debt offering or entering into
a line of credit, and from cash generated from estimated revenues from sales of oil and natural gas produced at the Company s wells.
Management does not currently anticipate any capital expenditures towards developing the Company s probable undeveloped reserves
in the next twelve months.

Operating
Results 

During
the three months ended December 31, 2023, the Company reported a net loss of 751,881 as compared to a net loss of 1,309,191 for the
three months ended December 31, 2022. The net loss for the first quarter of current fiscal year was mainly attributable to operating
expenses of 806,294 compared to operating expenses of 1,559,285 in the same quarter in the previous fiscal year, being partially offset
by revenue from oil and gas sales and royalty income of 53,115 compared to 221,942 in the fiscal 2023 quarter. 

The
Company reported oil and gas sales revenue of 47,651 in the first quarter of the current fiscal year compared with revenue of 213,754
in the same quarter during the last fiscal year. The decrease is due to reduced oil and gas production across all fields, attributed
to financial constraints affecting field operations. Net oil-equivalent production by final product sold in the current quarter averaged
10 barrels per day in the current quarter, compared to 39.38 barrels per day in the same quarter of the previous fiscal year.

 Table of Contents 

The
lease operating expense for the quarter ended December 31, 2023 were 91,435 compared with 292,679 in the quarter ended December 31,
2022. The decrease in lease operating expense is attributed to reduced production in the current quarter compared to the same quarter
in the previous fiscal year. Lease operating expenses exceeded oil and gas sales revenue mainly due to significant maintenance expenses
on the West Henshaw wells. 

The
general and administrative expenses for the three months ended December 31, 2023 were 683,683, a significant decrease from 1,215,106
in the three months ended December 31, 2022. The reduction is mainly due to the decreased property development and corporate activities
during the current quarter. Specifically, the variance in the current quarter from the same quarter in the previous fiscal year was mainly
attributable to: 

Accounting
 and audit fees of 122,746, which decreased from 319,621 in the first quarter of the previous fiscal year. The decrease was largely
 due to the delayed start of audit work. A substantial portion of the fees in the current period was related to regulatory compliance
 work associated with the proposed U.S. uplisting in November 2023. 

Consulting
 fees of 33,207 in the current quarter compared to 136,825 in the first quarter of the previous fiscal year. This decrease was primarily
 attributed to fewer fees paid to contract consultants for geological, project management, and general regulatory and corporate consulting
 work. The variance was largely due to reduced property development and corporate activities in the current quarter. 

Legal
 fees of 188,730 in the current quarter, down from 275,194 in the same quarter of the previous fiscal year. The fees were mainly
 related to the regulatory work associated with the Company s proposed uplisting to the NASDAQ in November 2023 as well as compliance
 with the disclosure requirements under the Exchange Act in the United States. 

Marketing
 and promotion expenses of 23,170 in the current quarter compared to 121,502 in the same quarter of the previous fiscal year. The
 reduction was due to the Company scaling back the marketing activities. 

Liquidity
and Capital Resources 

As
at December 31, 2023, the Company had a cash balance of 32,000, a decrease of 50,736 from the cash balance of 82,736 on September
30, 2023. During the three months ended December 31, 2023, cash used in operating activities was 155,736, primarily consisting of accounting,
insurance, salary and general office expenses. The Company received 70,000 from reclamation deposit redemption and 45,000 from a related
party loan and repaid 10,000 on a third-party loan. 

The
Company had a working capital deficiency of 3,792,894 as at December 31, 2023 compared to a working capital deficiency of 3,142,916
as at September 30, 2023. This raises substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. 

Management
has budgeted approximately 1.5 million in minimum operating expenses and 0.5 million in capital expenditures for the next 12 months,
which the Company plans to finance principally from one or more equity financings and/or a line of credit. The purpose of these funds
will be to resume full field operations, reduce the working capital deficit, as well as invest in additional oil and gas production activities
across the company s assets. This capital can be adjusted as necessary based on economic or business factors. The amount and timing
of capital expenditures will depend on several factors including, but not limited to, the speed with which we are able to bring our wells
to production, our ability to complete an equity financing or to secure a suitable line of credit, commodity prices, supply/demand considerations
and attractive rates of return. There are no guarantees that we will be able to acquire the necessary funds to meet our budgeted capital
expenditures, and any postponement of our planned development of our proved undeveloped reserves could materially affect our business,
financial condition and results of operations. 

Although
the Company has budgeted investments of additional capital in the continued development of our oil and gas operations, the Company currently
does not have any material commitments for capital expenditures. As of the date of our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the three months
ended December 31, 2023, the Company does not have sufficient working capital to meet its anticipated operating and capital requirements
over the next 12 months. Subsequent to December 31, 2023, the Company received 3.715 million in financing proceeds. The Company will
also continue to monitor the current economic and financial market conditions and evaluate their impact on the Company s liquidity
and future prospects.

Critical
Accounting Estimates 

The
preparation of financial statements in accordance with US GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the
reported amount of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amount of revenue and expenses during
the reporting period. Management evaluates these estimates and judgments on an ongoing basis and bases its estimates on experience, current
and expected future conditions, third-party evaluations and various other assumptions that management believes are reasonable under the
circumstances. We believe the following discussions of critical accounting estimates address all important accounting areas where the
nature of accounting estimates or assumptions is material due to the levels of subjectivity and judgment necessary to account for highly
uncertain matters or the susceptibility of such matters to change. 

Oil
and natural gas reserves 

Crude
oil and natural gas reserves are estimates of future production that impact certain asset and expense accounts included in the consolidated
financial statements. Proved reserves are the estimated quantities of oil and gas that geoscience and engineering data demonstrate with
reasonable certainty to be economically producible in the future under existing economic conditions, operating methods and government
regulations. Proved reserves include both developed and undeveloped volumes. Proved developed reserves represent volumes expected to
be recovered through existing wells with existing equipment and operating methods. Proved undeveloped reserves are volumes expected to
be recovered from new wells on undrilled proved acreage, or from existing wells where a relatively major expenditure is required for
recompletion. Variables impacting the Company s estimated volumes of crude oil and natural gas reserves include field performance,
available technology, commodity prices, and development, production and carbon costs. 

The
estimation of proved reserves is important to the consolidated statements of operations because the proved reserve estimate for a field
serves as the denominator in the unit-of-production calculation of the depletion of the capitalized costs for that asset. If the estimates
of proved reserves used in the unit-of-production calculations had been lower by 10 percent across all calculations, the depletion in
the first quarter of fiscal 2024 would have increased by approximately 1,000. 

Impairment 

The
Company tests long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset
may not be recoverable through the estimated undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the
assets. Individual assets are grouped for impairment purposes at the lowest level for which there are identifiable cash flows that are
largely independent of the cash flows of other groups of assets, generally on a field-by-field basis for oil and gas assets. Because
there usually is a lack of quoted market prices for long-lived assets, the fair value of impaired assets is typically determined based
on the present values of expected future cash flows using discount rates and prices believed to be consistent with those used by principal
market participants. The expected future cash flows used for impairment reviews and related fair value calculations are based on estimated
future production volumes, commodity prices, operating costs and capital decisions, considering all available evidence at the date of
review. Differing assumptions could affect the timing and the amount of an impairment in any period. 

Asset
retirement obligations 

The
Company is subject to retirement obligations for certain assets. The fair values of these obligations are recorded as liabilities on
a discounted basis, which is typically at the time the assets are installed. In the estimation of fair value, the Corporation uses assumptions
and judgments regarding such factors as the existence of a legal obligation for an asset retirement obligation, technical assessments
of the assets, estimated amounts and timing of settlements, discount rates, and inflation rates. 

A
sensitivity analysis of the ARO impact on earnings is not practicable, given the broad range of the company s long-lived
assets and the number of assumptions involved in the estimates. Favorable changes to some assumptions would have reduced estimated future
obligations, thereby lowering accretion expense and amortization costs, whereas unfavorable changes would have the opposite effect. 

Related
party transactions 

(a) 
 The
 convertible debenture loan from the CEO of the Company mentioned in Note 8 was paid off during the three months ended December 31,
 2022. 

(b) 
 The
 Company had an employment agreement with Mehran Ehsan, the former CEO of the Company, for an annual base salary of 250,000, with
 no specified term. Mr. Ehsan is also eligible on an annual basis for a cash bonus of up to 100 of annual salary, subject to the
 discretion of the board of directors. During the three months ended December 31, 2023, the Company incurred management salary of
 62,500 (2022 - 62,500), for Mr. Ehsan, with no bonuses incurred in either quarter. Further, the terms of this employment agreement
 provide that if Mr. Ehsan s employment with the Company is terminated without cause (as defined in the agreement)
 than Mr. Ehsan is entitled to a severance payment equal to three years of base salary and a bonus equal to 20 of his annual base
 salary. Mr. Ehsan resigned as President and CEO of the Company on April 29, 2024. On May 15, 2024, the Company amended the employment
 agreement to change his role to Vice President of Business Development. All other terms and conditions of the employment agreement
 remained the same. On August 30, 2024, the Company signed a separation agreement to terminate Mr. Ehsan s employment. The settlement
 includes: i) a lump sum payment of 100,000 payable upon the Company s receipt of capital investment of no less than 1,000,000
 or by October 31, 2024, whichever occurs first; ii) six equal monthly payments of 7,500 starting October 1, 2024 (with the first
 payment already made); and iii) the transfer of ownership of a Company vehicle with a fair value of 35,155. 

(c) 
 On
 May 1, 2022, the Company entered into an employment agreement with the CFO of the Company for an annual base salary of 50,000, with
 no specified term. The CFO is also eligible on an annual basis for a cash bonus of up to 100 of annual salary, subject to the discretion
 of the board of directors. The employment agreement may be terminated with a termination payment equal to two months of base salary.
 During the three months ended December 31, 2023, the Company incurred management salary of 12,500 (2022 - 12,500), to the CFO of
 the Company, with no bonuses incurred in either year.

JOBS
Act 

On
April 5, 2012, the JOBS Act was enacted. Section 107 of the JOBS Act provides that an emerging growth company can take
advantage of the extended transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act for complying with new or revised accounting
standards. In other words, an emerging growth company can delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those
standards would otherwise apply to private companies. 

We
have chosen to take advantage of the extended transition periods available to emerging growth companies under the JOBS Act for complying
with new or revised accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies provided under the JOBS Act.
As a result, our financial statements may not be comparable to those of companies that comply with public company effective dates for
complying with new or revised accounting standards. 

Subject
to certain conditions set forth in the JOBS Act, as an emerging growth company, we intend to rely on certain of these exemptions,
including, without limitation, (i) providing an auditor s attestation report on our system of internal controls over financial
reporting pursuant to Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and (ii) complying with any requirement that may be adopted by the Public
Company Accounting Oversight Board regarding mandatory audit firm rotation or a supplement to the auditor s report providing additional
information about the audit and the financial statements, known as the auditor discussion and analysis. We will remain an emerging
growth company until the earliest of (i) the last day of the fiscal year in which we have total annual gross revenues of 1.235
billion or more; (ii) the last day of our fiscal year following the fifth anniversary of the date of our initial public offering; (iii)
the date on which we have issued more than 1 billion in nonconvertible debt during the previous three years; or (iv) the date on which
we are deemed to be a large accelerated filer under the rules of the SEC.

 CONTROLS
 AND PROCEDURES. 

Evaluation
 of disclosure controls and procedures 

We
maintain disclosure controls and procedures (as such terms are defined under Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Securities Exchange
Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act )) that are designed to ensure that the information required to be disclosed in
the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified
in the SEC s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief
Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Management, under
the supervision and with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, evaluated the effectiveness of
the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures pursuant to Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(b) as of the end of the period
covered by this Report. Based on that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure
controls and procedures were not effective as of December 31, 2023. 

The
following control deficiencies constitute material weaknesses in internal control over financial reporting: 

Insufficient
 resources resulting in inadequate segregation of duties in certain accounting functions, the processing and approval of transactions,
 due to the size of the accounting department. 

Lack
 of knowledge of US GAAP and ineffective controls associated with the conversion from IFRS to US GAAP 

Ineffective
 controls over inputs used in the valuation of the Asset Retirement Obligation 

Ineffective
 controls over the depletion calculation and the preparation of the oil and gas reserve report 

Ineffective
 controls on the accounting and the valuation of complex financial instruments 

Ineffective
 review of the financial statements due to the limited financial and reporting resources 

Ineffective
 information technology general controls in the areas of user access and program change-management over certain information technology
 systems that support the Company s financial reporting processes. 

Changes
in internal controls 

There
were no changes in our internal controls over financial reporting during the three months ended December 31, 2023 that have materially
affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal controls over financial reporting. 

Limitations
on Effectiveness of Controls and Procedures 

In
designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how
well designed and operated, cannot provide absolute assurance that the objectives of the controls system are met, and no evaluation of
controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within a company have been detected.
In addition, the design of disclosure controls and procedures must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and that management
is required to apply judgment in evaluating the benefits of possible controls and procedures relative to their costs.

 The registrant s other certifying officer and I are responsible for establishing and maintaining disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e)) and internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f)) for the registrant and have: 

a)
