All statements (other than statements of historical fact) included in this Quarterly Report that address activities, events or developments that will or may occur in the future, including such matters as changes in market prices and conditions, the Trust s operations, the plans of Bitwise Investment Advisers, LLC (the Sponsor and references to the Trust s future success and other similar matters are forward-looking statements. These statements are only predictions. Actual events or results may differ materially from such statements. These statements are based upon certain assumptions and analyses the Sponsor made based on its perception of historical trends, current conditions and expected future developments, as well as other factors appropriate in the circumstances. Whether or not actual results and developments will conform to the Sponsor s expectations and predictions, however, is subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, including, but not limited to, those described in Part II, Item 1A. Risk Factors. Forward-looking statements are made based on the Sponsor s beliefs, estimates and opinions on the date the statements are made and neither the Trust nor the Sponsor is under a duty or undertakes an obligation to update forward-looking statements if these beliefs, estimates and opinions or other circumstances should change, other than as required by applicable laws. Investors are therefore cautioned against relying on forward-looking statements. Factors which could have a material adverse effect on the Trust's business, financial condition or results of operations and future prospects or which could cause actual results to differ materially from the Trust's expectations include, but are not limited to: 
 the extreme volatility of trading prices that many Crypto Assets, including Bitcoin, have experienced in recent periods and may continue to experience, which could have a material adverse effect on the value of the Shares of the Trust; 

the recentness of the development of Crypto Assets and the uncertain medium-to-long term value of the Shares due to a number of factors relating to the capabilities and development of Blockchain technologies and to the fundamental investment characteristics of Crypto Assets; 

the value of the Shares depending on the acceptance of Crypto Assets and Blockchain technology, a new and rapidly evolving industry; 

the unregulated nature and lack of transparency surrounding the operations of Blockchain technologies and crypto assets, which may adversely affect the value of Portfolio Crypto Assets and the Shares; 

the limited history of the Index; 

risks related to the COVID-19 outbreak, which could negatively impact the value of the Trust s holdings and significantly disrupt its operations; 

the possibility that the Shares may trade at a price that is at, above or below the Trust s NAV Per Share; 

regulatory changes or actions by the United States (" U.S. ") Congress or any U.S. federal or state agencies that may affect the value of the Shares or restrict the use of one or more Crypto Assets, Mining activity or the operation of their networks or the markets for the Portfolio Crypto Assets in a manner that adversely affects the value of the Shares; 

changes in the policies of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC that could adversely impact the value of the Shares; 

the possibility that the Trust or the Sponsor could be subject to regulation as a money service business or money transmitter, which could result in extraordinary expenses to the Trust or the Sponsor and also result in decreased liquidity for the Shares; 

regulatory changes or interpretations that could obligate the Trust or the Sponsor to register and comply with new regulations, resulting in potentially extraordinary, nonrecurring expenses to the Trust; 

potential delays in mail reaching the Sponsor when sent to the Trust at its registered office; 

possible requirements for the Trust to disclose information, including information relating to investors, to regulators; 

potential conflicts of interest that may arise among the Sponsor or its affiliates and the Trust; 

the potential discontinuance of the Sponsor s continued services, which could be detrimental to the Trust; 

the Custodian s possible resignation or removal by the Sponsor; and

EMERGING GROWTH COMPANY STATUS 
 The Trust is an emerging growth company as that term is used in the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act (the JOBS Act and, as such, may elect to comply with certain reduced reporting requirements. For as long as the Trust is an emerging growth company, unlike other public companies, it will not be required to: 
 provide an auditor s attestation report on management s assessment of the effectiveness of its system of internal control over financial reporting pursuant to Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002; 

comply with any new requirements adopted by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board PCAOB requiring mandatory auditor rotation or a supplement to the auditor s report in which the auditor would be required to provide additional information about the audit and the financial statements of the issuer; 

comply with any new audit rules adopted by the PCAOB after April 5, 2012, unless the Securities and Exchange Commission determines otherwise; 

provide certain disclosure regarding executive compensation required of larger public companies; or 

obtain shareholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. 

The Trust will cease to be an emerging growth company upon the earliest of (i) when it has 1.235 billion or more in total annual gross revenues during its most recently completed fiscal year; (ii) when it is deemed to be a large accelerated filer under Rule 12b-2 promulgated pursuant to the Securities Exchange Act of 1934; (iii) when it has issued more than 1.0 billion of non-convertible debt over a three-year period; or (iv) the last day of the fiscal year following the fifth anniversary of its initial public offering. 
 In addition, Section 107 of the JOBS Act also provides that an emerging growth company can take advantage of the extended transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act for complying with new or revised accounting standards. In other words, an emerging growth company can delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. The Trust has chosen not to opt out of such extended transition period, and as a result, the Trust will take advantage of such extended transition period.

Industry and Market Data

Market estimates are calculated by using independent industry publications in conjunction with our assumptions regarding the Crypto Asset industry and market.

 . The Trust s principal investment objective is to invest in a portfolio of broad-based Crypto Assets that tracks the Bitwise 10 Large Cap Crypto Index (the Index ), which is administered by Bitwise Index Services, LLC (the "Index Provider"), an affiliate of the Sponsor. The Trust rebalances monthly alongside the Index to stay current with changes. All shareholders are subject to a per annum Management Fee and are referred to as the Investor Class. Pursuant to the Agreement and Plan of Conversion executed as of May 1, 2020, the Trust converted from a Delaware Limited Liability Company to a Delaware Statutory Trust. Theorem Fund Services, LLC (the Administrator serves as the Trust s Administrator and performs certain administrative and accounting services on behalf of the Trust.

The Sponsor s Valuation Policy provides a listing of preferred exchanges. While some Crypto Assets are valued based on prices reported in the public markets, other Crypto Assets may be more thinly-traded or subject to irregular trading activity. Determinations on the value of certain Crypto Assets, and how to value such assets as to which limited prices or quotations are available, are based on the Sponsor s recommendations or instructions. Crypto Asset transactions are recorded on the trade date. Realized gains and losses from Crypto Asset transactions are determined using the identified cost method. Any change in net unrealized gain or loss is reported in the statement of operations. Commissions and other trading fees are reflected as an adjustment to cost or proceeds at the time of the transaction. The Trust intermittently receives Airdrops of new Crypto Assets. The use of Airdrops is generally to promote the launch and use of new Crypto Assets by providing a small amount of the new Crypto Assets to the private wallets or exchange accounts of holders of existing related Crypto Assets. Airdropped Crypto Assets can have substantially different Blockchain technology that has no relation to any existing Crypto Asset, and many Airdrops may be without value. The Trust will only record receipt of Airdropped Crypto Assets if when received, the Airdropped Crypto Assets have value. Crypto Assets received from Airdrops have no cost basis and the Trust recognizes other income equal to the fair value of the new Crypto Asset received.

net payable from Crypto Assets purchased and Crypto Assets or cash resided on exchanges. At December 31, 2023, the Trust had a receivable from Crypto Assets sold and Crypto Assets of approximately resided on exchanges. Several factors may affect the price of Crypto Assets, including, but not limited to: supply and demand, investors expectations with respect to the rate of inflation, interest rates, currency exchange rates, or future regulatory measures (if any) that restrict the trading of Crypto Assets or the use of Crypto Assets as a form of payment. There is no assurance that Crypto Assets will maintain their long-term value in terms of purchasing power in the future, or that acceptance of Crypto Asset payments by mainstream retail merchants and commercial businesses will continue to grow. Crypto Asset Regulation As Crypto Assets have grown in popularity and market size, various countries and jurisdictions have begun to develop regulations governing the Crypto Assets industry. To the extent that future regulatory actions or policies limit the ability to exchange Crypto Assets or utilize them for payments, the demand for Crypto Assets will be reduced. Furthermore, regulatory actions may limit the ability of end-users to convert Crypto Assets into fiat currency (e.g., U.S. dollars) or use Crypto Assets to pay for goods and services. Such regulatory actions or policies could result in a reduction of demand, and in turn, a decline in the underlying Crypto Asset unit prices. The effect of any future regulatory change on the Trust or Crypto Assets in general is impossible to predict, but such change could be substantial and adverse to the Trust and the value of the Trust s investments in Crypto Assets. Custody of Crypto Assets Coinbase Custody Trust Company, LLC (the Custodian serves as the Trust s Custodian for Crypto Assets for which qualified custody is available. The Custodian is subject to change in the sole discretion of the Sponsor. At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, Crypto Assets of and were held by the Custodian, respectively.

 control of the distributed network. Such control could have a significant adverse effect on either the ownership or value of the Crypto Asset. Transaction Authentication As of the date of these financial statements, the transfer of Crypto Assets from one party to another typically relies on an authentication process by an outside party known as a miner or validator. In exchange for compensation, the miner or validator will authenticate the transfer of the currency through the solving of a complex algorithm known as a proof of work, or will vouch for the transfer through other means, such as a proof of stake. Effective transfers of and therefore realization of Crypto Assets, and tokens are dependent on interactions from these miners or validators. In the event that there were a shortage of miners to perform this function, that shortage could have an adverse effect on either the fair value or realization of the Crypto Assets. Other Risks Management continues to evaluate the impact of current or anticipated military conflict, including between Russia and Ukraine, terrorism, sanctions; and other geopolitical events; as well as adverse developments in the economy, the capital markets and the Blockchain markets, including rising energy costs, inflation and interest rates, in the United States and globally; and catastrophic events such as fires, floods, earthquakes, tornadoes, hurricanes, and global health epidemics. Management has concluded that while it

provision for income taxes is required and liability for unrecognized tax benefits has been recorded. The Trust does not expect that its assessment related to unrecognized tax benefits will materially change over the next . However, the Trust s conclusions may be subject to review and adjustment at a later date based on factors including, but not limited to, the nexus of income among various tax jurisdictions; compliance with U.S. federal, U.S. state, and tax laws of jurisdictions in which the Trust operates in; and changes in the administrative practices and precedents of the relevant authorities. The Trust is required to analyze all open tax years. Open tax years are those years that are open for examination by the relevant income taxing authority. As of September 30, 2024, the 2023, 2022, and 2021 tax years remain open for examination. There were no examinations in progress at period end. 

per annum. The Sponsor may, in its discretion, waive, reduce, or rebate the Management Fee with respect to any Shareholder or group of Shareholders (which group may, but need not, include all Shareholders), including affiliates of the Sponsor; provided that such waiver, reduction, or rebate shall not increase the Management Fee payable in respect of any other Shareholder.

 The Trust is a Delaware Statutory Trust that issues units of fractional undivided beneficial interest in the form of shares, which represent ownership in the Trust (" Shares "). All Shareholders of investor class units received 10 Shares for each unit owned prior to the corporate action date, and all Shareholders of institutional class units received 10.12602229 Shares for each unit owned prior to the corporate action date. 
 The purpose of the Trust is to make it easier for an investor to invest in the Crypto Asset market as a whole, without having to pick specific tokens, manage a portfolio, and constantly monitor ongoing news and developments. Although the Shares are not the exact equivalent of a direct investment in Crypto Assets, they provide investors with an alternative that constitutes a relatively cost-effective, professionally managed way to participate in Crypto Asset markets. The Trust holds a Portfolio of Crypto Assets, referred to as the Portfolio Crypto Assets. 
 In furtherance of this objective, the activities of the Trust include (i) issuing Shares in exchange for subscriptions, (ii) selling or buying Portfolio Crypto Assets in connection with monthly rebalancing, (iii) selling Portfolio Crypto Assets as necessary to cover the Management Fee (as defined below) and/or any Organizational Expenses (as defined below), (iv) causing the Sponsor to sell Portfolio Crypto Assets upon any potential future termination of the Trust, and (v) engaging in all administrative and security procedures necessary to accomplish such activities in accordance with the provisions of the Trust Agreement of Bitwise 10 Crypto Index Fund (the " Trust Agreement "), and the Custodian Agreement with the Custodian (the Custodian Agreement "). 
 The Trust s principal investment objective is to invest in a Portfolio of Crypto Assets that tracks the Bitwise 10 Large Cap Crypto Index (the " Index ") as closely as possible with certain exceptions determined by the Sponsor in its sole discretion. In addition, in the event the Portfolio Crypto Assets being held by the Trust present opportunities to generate returns in excess of the Index (for example, Airdrops, Emissions, forks, or similar network events) the Sponsor may also pursue these incidental opportunities on behalf of the Trust as part of the investment objective if in its sole discretion the Sponsor deems such activities to be possible and prudent. The Trust believes that it has met its principal investment objective. As of September 30, 2024, there was a correlation of 99.99 between the Portfolio Crypto Assets and the assets included in the Index. The Trust is aware that the market price of the Trust s shares may deviate from the net asset value NAV of the shares, and the market price may at times be significantly above or below the shares NAV. The NAV of the Trust is calculated by summing the assets and liabilities and the NAV Per Share is calculated by dividing the total NAV by the shares outstanding. However, the Trust believes that any such deviation does not affect the Trust s principal investment objective, as the Trust does not maintain or promote any business objectives related to the market trading price of its shares. Furthermore, under Regulation M, the Trust as issuer of the Shares is not permitted to take any actions that would seek to reconcile the NAV of the Shares and the market price of the Shares, and the Trust would not undertake business objectives that it was legally restricted from achieving. 
 The Trust and the Sponsor have entered into a limited, non-exclusive, revocable license agreement with Bitwise Index Services, LLC (the Index Provider ), an affiliate of the Trust that is controlled by the same parent entity as the Sponsor, at no cost to the Trust or the Sponsor allowing the Trust to use the Index as the benchmark index for the Trust (the License Agreement ). 
 The Shares may also trade at a substantial premium over, or a substantial discount to, the NAV Per Share as a result of price volatility, trading volume and closings of the exchanges on which the Sponsor purchases Portfolio Crypto Assets on behalf of the Trust due to fraud, failure, security breaches or otherwise. As a result of the foregoing, the price of the Shares as quoted on OTCQX has varied significantly from the value of the Trust s Portfolio Crypto Assets Per Share since the Shares were approved for quotation on December 9, 2020. 
 The following charts show the percentage of Premium/(Discount) of the Shares as quoted on OTCQX and the Trust s NAV and a comparison of the NAV of the Trust vs the market price as quoted on OTCQX for the period December 10, 2020 to September 30, 2024. 
 15 

From December 10, 2020 to September 30, 2024, the Shares of BITW traded at an average discount of 16.57 , based on closing prices at 4:00 pm ET, and estimated, unaudited, NAV Per Share. During that same period, the highest premium was 649.38 on December 16, 2020, and the lowest premium was 0.27 on August 4, 2021. During that same period, the highest discount was 67.80 on December 28, 2022, and the lowest discount was 0.09 on September 24, 2021. Given the lack of an ongoing redemption program and the holding period under Rule 144, there is no arbitrage mechanism to keep the Shares closely linked to the value of the Trust s underlying holdings that may continue to have an adverse impact on investments in the Shares. 
 The following chart shows a comparison of the cumulative returns of the Index compared to the NAV of the Trust since inception to the period ended September 30, 2024.

Comparison of the three-month periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 
 The following provides a discussion of the material items that impacted the Trust s financial condition during the applicable period: 
 Management fees 
 The Sponsor charges the Trust a Management Fee payable monthly, in arrears, in an amount equal to 2.5 per annum (1/12th of 2.5 per month) of the net asset value of the Trust s assets at the end of each month. Management fees for the three months ended 
 17 

September 30, 2024 were 5,869,017 compared to management fees for the three months ended September 30, 2023 of 2,927,022. These changes were due to an increase in the Trust s net asset value due to an increase in the value of the Portfolio Crypto Assets held by the Trust as a result of the fair market value of the Assets (see Schedules of Investments below). 
 Net realized gain (loss) from Crypto Assets 
 Net realized gain from Crypto Assets for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was 2,628,714 compared to net realized loss from Crypto Assets for the three months ended September 30, 2023 of 4,074,541. These changes were due to fluctuations in the value of the Portfolio Crypto Assets. 
 For the three-month period ended September 30, 2024, the Trust recorded net realized gains from sales of Bitcoin and Ethereum of approximately 2,662,860 and 1,616,962, respectively, among the gains and losses realized in smaller amounts from the sale of other Portfolio Crypto Assets. These sales were made as a result of rebalancing activity and sales of Portfolio Crypto Assets to raise money to pay the management fee. 
 For the three-month period ended September 30, 2023, the Trust recorded net realized gains from sales of Ethereum and net realized losses from the sales of Bitcoin of approximately 2,011,208 and 1,896,151, respectively, among the gains and losses realized in smaller amounts from the sale of other Portfolio Crypto Assets. These sales were made as a result of rebalancing activity and sales of Portfolio Crypto Assets to raise money to pay the management fee. 
 Net change in unrealized appreciation (depreciation) from Crypto Assets 
 Net change in unrealized depreciation from Crypto Assets for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was 11,640,352 compared to net change in unrealized depreciation from Crypto Assets for three months ended September 30, 2023 of 63,235,155. The primary factor for the change was related to a decrease in the fair value of the Portfolio Crypto Assets held by the Trust (see Schedules of Investments below). 
 For the three-month period ended September 30, 2024 the Trust recorded net unrealized depreciation from Crypto Assets of Ethereum and net unrealized appreciation of Bitcoin of approximately 52,844,634 and 34,989,433, respectively, among the unrealized gains and losses in smaller amounts of other Portfolio Crypto Assets. 
 For the three-month period ended September 30, 2023 the Trust recorded net unrealized depreciation from Crypto Assets of Bitcoin and Ethereum of approximately 37,209,814 and 20,275,467, respectively, among the unrealized gains and losses in smaller amounts of other Portfolio Crypto Assets. 
 Net increase (decrease) in net assets resulting from operations 
 For the three-month period ended September 30, 2024, the Trust recorded a net decrease in net assets resulting from operations of 14,880,653, compared to a net decrease in net assets resulting from operations of 70,236,718 for the three-month period ended September 30, 2023. The primary factor that impacted 2024 net decrease in net assets resulting from operations compared to 2023 net decrease in net assets resulting from operations was a decrease in net realized loss and change in unrealized gain on investments with a net loss of 11,640,352 in 2024 compared to a net loss of 63,235,155 in 2023. The primary factor for the change was an increase in the value of the Portfolio Crypto Assets held by the Trust as a result of the fair market value of the Assets (see Schedules of Investments below). 
 
 Comparison of the nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 
 The following provides a discussion of the material items that impacted the Trust s financial condition during the applicable period: 
 Management fees 
 The Sponsor charges the Trust a Management Fee payable monthly, in arrears, in an amount equal to 2.5 per annum (1/12th of 2.5 per month) of the net asset value of the Trust s assets at the end of each month. Management fees for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 were 17,877,678 compared to management fees for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 of 8,951,566. These changes were due to an increase in the Trust s net asset value due to an increase in the value of the Portfolio Crypto Assets held by the Trust as a result of the fair market value of the Assets (see Schedules of Investments below). 
 Net realized gain (loss) from Crypto Assets 
 Net realized gain from Crypto Assets for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 3,649,449 compared to net realized loss from Crypto Assets for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 of 6,234,107. These changes were due to fluctuations in the value of the Portfolio Crypto Assets. 
 For the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024, the Trust recorded net realized gains from sales of Bitcoin and Ethereum of 7,170,856 and 4,555,266, respectively, among the gains and losses realized in smaller amounts from the sale of other Portfolio 
 18 

Crypto Assets. These sales were made as a result of rebalancing activity and sales of Portfolio Crypto Assets to raise money to pay the management fee. 
 For the nine-month period ended September 30, 2023, the Trust recorded net realized losses from sales of Bitcoin and Solana of 2,826,800 and 1,859,900, respectively, among the gains and losses realized in smaller amounts from the sale of other Portfolio Crypto Assets. These sales were made as a result of rebalancing activity and sales of Portfolio Crypto Assets to raise money to pay the management fee. 
 Net change in unrealized appreciation (depreciation) from Crypto Assets 
 Net change in unrealized appreciation from Crypto Assets for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 247,154,609 compared to net change in unrealized appreciation from Crypto Assets for nine months ended September 30, 2023 of 159,787,148. The primary factor for the change was related to an increase in the fair value of the Portfolio Crypto Assets held by the Trust (see Schedules of Investments below). 
 For the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024 the Trust recorded net unrealized appreciation from Crypto Assets of Bitcoin and Ethereum of 227,455,583 and 16,698,007, respectively, among the unrealized gains and losses in smaller amounts of other Portfolio Crypto Assets. 
 For the nine-month period ended September 30, 2023 the Trust recorded net unrealized appreciation from Crypto Assets of Bitcoin and Ethereum of 126,270,500 and 32,795,900, respectively, among the unrealized gains and losses in smaller amounts of other Portfolio Crypto Assets. 
 Net increase (decrease) in net assets resulting from operations 
 For the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024, the Trust recorded a net increase in net assets resulting from operations of 232,926,331, compared to a net increase in net assets resulting from operations of 144,667,708 for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2023. The primary factor that impacted 2024 net increase in net assets resulting from operations compared to 2023 net increase in net assets resulting from operations was a decrease in net realized loss and an increase in the change in unrealized gain on investments with a net gain of 250,804,058 in 2024 compared to a net gain of 153,533,041 in 2023. The primary factor for the change was an increase in the value of the Portfolio Crypto Assets held by the Trust as a result of the fair market value of the Assets (see Schedules of Investments below). 
 Management Fee 
 The Sponsor charges the Trust a Management Fee payable monthly, in arrears, in an amount equal to 2.5 per annum (1/12th of 2.5 per month) of the net asset value of the Trust s assets at the end of each month. 
 The Sponsor is responsible for paying for all ordinary administrative and overhead expenses of managing the Trust, including payment of rent, custody charges or flat rate fees for holding the Trust s assets charged by the Custodian and customary fees and expenses of the Trustee, Administrator and Auditor (including costs incurred for appraisal or valuation expenses associated with the preparation of the Trust s financial statements, tax returns and other similar reports and excluding indemnification and extraordinary costs). The Sponsor also pays for all expenses associated with the operation of the Trust, including for example, fees associated with quotation of the Shares on the OTCQX, registration with the SEC, and fees associated with retaining and maintaining the Transfer Agent. Trading commissions or trading fees paid to trading venues (also known as exchanges) or intermediaries (such as trading technology or Crypto Asset brokerage firms) that assist in trade execution for accessing Crypto Asset liquidity are charged to the Trust and may either be included in the cost of the Crypto Assets acquired by or disposed of by the Trust or may appear as explicit costs in addition to the price of the Crypto Asset. Trading fees and commissions are charged to the Trust and may appear in the financial statements as Transaction and other fees in the Financial Statements Statement of Operations in the Expenses category or may be included in the cost of the Crypto Assets acquired by the Trust. 
 There is no ceiling to the Trust s expenses that the Sponsor will pay. However, the Sponsor retains the right to cause the Trust to pay indemnification and extraordinary expenses, and these Trust expenses are not covered by the Management Fee. The Trust may incur certain extraordinary expenses including, but not limited to, any non-customary costs and expenses including extraordinary costs of the Administrator and Auditor, costs of any litigation or investigation involving Trust activities, and workout and restructuring and indemnification expenses. 
 Shareholder Subscriptions 
 
 As of November 18, 2021, the Sponsor to the Trust has closed the acceptance of all subscriptions to the Bitwise 10 Crypto Index Fund, pursuant to its rights under Sections 5 and 6 of the Trust Agreement. At this time, the Sponsor has no plans to reopen 
 19 

subscriptions to the Bitwise 10 Crypto Index Fund. There were no shareholder subscriptions during the quarter ended September 30, 2024. 
 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 The Trust generally holds only a very small cash balance, and is otherwise fully invested in order to maintain its investment objective of tracking the Index. When selling Portfolio Crypto Assets to pay the Management Fee, the Sponsor endeavors to sell an exact amount of Portfolio Crypto Assets needed in order to pay such expenses in order to minimize the Trust s holdings of assets other than Portfolio Crypto Assets. As a consequence, the Sponsor expects the Trust will typically have a very small cash balance at each reporting period. Cash may also be held in the Trust after a subscription from Shareholder is funded (or sent to the Trust s bank account) but not yet invested in Portfolio Crypto Assets, or after a redemption from a redeeming Shareholder has been processed (e.g., by raising cash through the sale of Portfolio Crypto Assets) but not yet paid to the redeeming Shareholder. 
 As described under the heading Management Fee above, in exchange for the Management Fee, the Sponsor is responsible for payment of almost all of the expenses incurred by the Trust. As a result, the only material ordinary expense of the Trust during the periods covered by this Registration Statement was the Management Fee. The Trust is not aware of any trends, demands, conditions or events that are reasonably likely to result in material changes to its liquidity needs. See Part I, Item 2 under the heading Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Management Fee for additional discussion of the Trust s fees and expenses. 
 Value of Portfolio Crypto Assets 
 As described in the Risk Factors set out in our Form 10-K filed with the SEC on March 1, 2024, the prices of the various Portfolio Crypto Assets held by the Trust are subject to extreme volatility. This volatility had a significant impact on the value of the Portfolio Crypto Assets for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023 and the year ended December 31, 2023. 
 As shown below in the Schedules of Investments, the increase in total investments in Crypto Assets from January 1, 2024 to September 30, 2024 was due primarily to an increase in the value of the Portfolio Crypto Assets and to a lesser extent, by the sale of various Portfolio Crypto Assets to pay the Management Fee. 
 Shareholder Subscriptions and Redemptions 
 During the period from January 1, 2024 to September 30, 2024, there were no subscriptions or redemptions of Shares. There were 20,241,947 Shares outstanding as of September 30, 2024.

 Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 
 The Trust is not a party to any off-balance sheet arrangements. 
 Significant Accounting Policies and Estimates 
 
 Basis of Presentation 
 
 The financial statements are expressed in U.S. dollars and have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America U.S. GAAP ). The Trust is an investment company and follows the specialized accounting and reporting guidance in the Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB Accounting Standards Codification ASC or Codification Topic 946, Financial Services Investment Companies. 
 
 Transactions of Crypto Assets have been accounted for analogizing to existing accounting standards that management believes are appropriate to the circumstances. 
 
 Pursuant to the Statement of Cash Flows Topic of the Codification, the Trust qualifies for an exemption from the requirement to provide a statement of cash flows and has elected not to provide a statement of cash flows. 
 
 Use of Estimates 
 
 The preparation of financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of income and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. There were no material estimates involving a significant level of estimation uncertainty that had or are reasonably likely to have had a material impact on the Trust s financial condition used in the preparation of the financial statements. In addition, please refer to Note 2 to the Financial Statements included in this Quarterly Report for further discussion of the Trust s accounting policies. 
 
 Cash 
 
 Cash represents cash deposits held at financial institutions and Crypto Asset exchanges. Cash in a bank deposit account, at times, may exceed U.S. federally insured limits. The Trust has not experienced any losses in such accounts and does not believe it is exposed to any significant credit risk on such bank deposits.

Investments and Valuation 
 
 Calculation of Valuation 
 
 The process that the Sponsor developed for identifying a principal market (the " Principal Market "), as described in FASB ASC 820-10, which outlines the application of fair value accounting, was to begin by identifying publicly available, well established and reputable Crypto Asset exchanges selected by the Sponsor and its affiliates in their sole discretion, including, but not limited to, Binance, Bitfinex, Bitflyer, Bitstamp, Bullish, Coinbase, Crypto.com, Gate.io, Gemini, HitBTC, Huobi, itBit, Kraken, KuCoin, LMAX, MEXC Global, OKX and Poloniex, and then calculating, on each valuation period, the highest volume exchange during the 60 minutes prior to 4:00 pm ET for each asset (the " Principal Market Price "). In evaluating the markets that could be considered principal markets, the Trust considered whether or not the specific markets were accessible to the Trust, either directly or through an intermediary, at the end of each period. 
 
 The following provides an overview of the Principal Market and the Principal Market Prices for Portfolio Crypto Assets that comprised the majority of the Trust s assets for the six month period ended September 30, 2024.

Valuation during the periods presented 
 
 During the periods presented, the trust carried its investments at fair value in accordance with FASB ASC Topic 820, Fair Value Measurement. Fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability (i.e., the exit price in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. Fair value investments are not adjusted for transaction costs. The Trust utilized this method for purposes of calculating the Trust s NAV. 
 
 In determining fair value, the Trust uses a single, principal market valuation approach. A fair value hierarchy for inputs is used in measuring fair value that maximizes the use of observable inputs and minimizes the use of unobservable inputs by requiring that the most observable inputs are to be used when available. The fair value hierarchy is categorized into three levels based on the inputs as follows: 
 
 Level 1 Valuations based on unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the Trust has the ability to access. 
 
 Level 2 Valuations based on quoted prices in markets that are not active or for which all significant inputs are observable, either directly or indirectly. These inputs may include (a) quoted prices for similar assets in active markets, (b) quoted prices for identical or similar assets in markets that are not active, (c) inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset, or (d) inputs derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data by correlation or other means. 
 
 Level 3 Valuations based on inputs that are unobservable and significant to the overall fair value measurement. 
 
 The availability of valuation techniques and observable inputs can vary from investment to investment and are affected by a wide variety of factors, including the type of investment, whether the investment is new and not yet established in the marketplace, the liquidity of markets, and other characteristics particular to the transaction. 
 
 In certain cases, the inputs used to measure fair value may fall into different levels of the fair value hierarchy. In such cases, the level in the fair value hierarchy which the fair value measurement falls in its entirety is determined based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement.

During the period, all of the Trust s assets were considered Level 1 valuations, because the valuations were based on quoted prices in markets that are active or for which all significant inputs are observable, either directly or indirectly. These inputs may include (a) quoted prices for similar assets in active markets, (b) quoted prices for identical or similar assets in markets that are not active, (c) inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset, or (d) inputs derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data by correlation or other means. 

The Trust generally records receipt of a new Crypto Asset created due to a Hard Fork at the time the Hard Fork is effective. The Trust s methodology for determining effectiveness of the fork is when two or more recognized exchanges quote prices for the forked coin. Some exchanges and custodians do not honor Hard Forks or may honor Hard Forks in the future. In such cases, the Trust will record receipt of the new Crypto Asset at the time two or more recognized exchanges begin quoting prices for the asset. Although the Trust records the asset into its books and records at the time the fork is effective, as described above, the Trust s custodian may take an extended period of time to make the forked asset available for transfer, and it may never make the forked asset available for transfer, which could lead to either the Trust holding the asset longer than it would otherwise hold the asset (if it was freely transferrable), or a complete write-down in the value of the forked asset. The Trust does not allocate any of the original Crypto Asset s cost to the new Crypto Asset and recognizes unrealized gains equal to the fair value of the new Crypto Asset received. During the period ended September 30, 2024, there were no hard forks recognized or not recognized. 
 
 There were no Hard Forks during the period that were not initially recognized but were subsequently recognized. 
 
 Crypto Asset transactions are recorded on the trade date. Realized gains and losses from Crypto Asset transactions are determined using the identified cost method. Any change in net unrealized gain or loss is reported in the statement of operations. Commissions and other trading fees are reflected as an adjustment to cost or proceeds at the time of the transaction. 
 
 The Trust intermittently receives Airdrops of new Crypto Assets. The use of Airdrops is generally to promote the launch and use of new Crypto Assets by providing a small amount of the new Crypto Assets to the private wallets or exchange accounts of holders of existing related Crypto Assets. Airdropped Crypto Assets can have substantially different Blockchain technology that has no relation to any existing Crypto Asset, and many Airdrops may be without value. The Trust will only record receipt of Airdropped Crypto Assets if when received, the Airdropped Crypto Assets have value. Crypto Assets received from Airdrops have no cost basis and the Trust recognizes other income equal to the fair value of the new Crypto Asset received. 
 
 During the three months ended June 30, 2023, the Trust was eligible for a Flare (FLR) airdrop. The airdrop was based on the Trust s XRP holding in its custody vault as of December 12, 2020. The Trust elected to participate in the airdrop and on April 17th, 2023, Other income resulting from the airdrop was booked into the Trust's assets. At the time of the airdrop, the result was a positive NAV increase of 0.013 bps, less than 0.00 NAV increase and 68,436 net asset increase to the Trust. On April 18th, 2023, the Trust sold the FLR and raised USD resulting in a minor loss to the Trust. The USD was used to purchase other assets in the Trust s portfolio, since FLR wasn t part of the Index of the Trust. The impact of this airdrop can be seen within the Statement of Operations under Other income and Net realized gain (loss) from Crypto Assets. 
 
 There were no Airdrops recognized or not recognized during the period ended September 30, 2024, the fiscal year ended December 31, 2022, or the fiscal year ended December 31, 2021. 
 
 Income Taxes 
 
 The Trust is classified as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes. The Trust does not record a provision for U.S. federal, U.S. state or local income taxes because the Shareholders report their share of the Trust s income or loss on their income tax returns. 
 28 

The Trust files an income tax return in the U.S. federal jurisdiction and may file income tax returns in various U.S. states and foreign jurisdictions. 
 
 The Trust is required to determine whether its tax positions are more likely than not to be sustained on examination by the applicable taxing authority, based on the technical merits of the position. Tax positions not deemed to meet a more likely than not threshold would be recorded as a tax expense in the current year. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Trust has determined that no provision for income taxes is required and no liability for unrecognized tax benefits has been recorded. The Trust does not expect that its assessment related to unrecognized tax benefits will materially change over the next 12 months. However, the Trust s conclusions may be subject to review and adjustment at a later date based on factors including, but not limited to, the nexus of income among various tax jurisdictions; compliance with U.S. federal, U.S. state, and tax laws of jurisdictions in which the Trust operates in; and changes in the administrative practices and precedents of the relevant authorities. The Trust is required to analyze all open tax years. Open tax years are those years that are open for examination by the relevant income taxing authority. As of September 30, 2024, the 2023, 2022, and 2021 tax years remain open for examination. There were no examinations in progress at period end. 
 
 Financial Instruments with Off-Balance-Sheet Risk 
 
 Crypto Assets 
 
 Crypto Assets are loosely regulated and there is no central marketplace for currency exchange. Supply is determined by a computer code, not by a central bank, and prices have been extremely volatile. Crypto Asset exchanges have been closed due to fraud, failure or security breaches. Any of the Trust s assets that reside on an exchange that shuts down may be lost. At September 30, 2024, the Trust had a 400,000 net payable from Crypto Assets purchased and no Crypto Assets or cash resided on exchanges. At December 31, 2023, the Trust had a 2,770,000 receivable from Crypto Assets sold and Crypto Assets of approximately 1,270,260 resided on exchanges. 
 
 Several factors may affect the price of Crypto Assets, including, but not limited to: supply and demand, investors expectations with respect to the rate of inflation, interest rates, currency exchange rates or future regulatory measures (if any) that restrict the trading of Crypto Assets or the use of Crypto Assets as a form of payment. There is no assurance that Crypto Assets will maintain their long-term value in terms of purchasing power in the future, or that acceptance of Crypto Asset payments by mainstream retail merchants and commercial businesses will continue to grow. 
 
 Crypto Asset Regulation 
 
 As Crypto Assets have grown in popularity and market size, various countries and jurisdictions have begun to develop regulations governing the Crypto Assets industry. To the extent that future regulatory actions or policies limit the ability to exchange Crypto Assets or utilize them for payments, the demand for Crypto Assets will be reduced. Furthermore, regulatory actions may limit the ability of end-users to convert Crypto Assets into fiat currency (e.g., U.S. dollars) or use Crypto Assets to pay for goods and services. Such regulatory actions or policies would result in a reduction of demand, and in turn, a decline in the underlying Crypto Asset unit prices. The effect of any future regulatory change on the Trust or Crypto Assets in general is impossible to predict, but such change could be substantial and adverse to the Trust and the value of the Trust s investments in Crypto Assets. 
 
 Custody of Crypto Assets 
 
 The Custodian serves as the Trust s Custodian for Crypto Assets for which qualified custody is available. The Custodian is subject to change in the sole discretion of the Sponsor. At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, Crypto Assets of approximately 936,381,800 and 698,528,691 were held by the Custodian, respectively. 
 
 Crypto Asset Trading is Volatile and Speculative 
 
 Crypto Assets represent a speculative investment and involve a high degree of risk. Prices of Crypto Assets have fluctuated widely for a variety of reasons including uncertainties in government regulation and may continue to experience significant price fluctuations. If Crypto Asset markets continue to be subject to sharp fluctuations, Shareholders may experience losses as the value of the Trust s investments decline. Even if Shareholders are able to hold their Shares in the Trust for the long-term, their Shares may never generate a profit, since Crypto Asset markets have historically experienced extended periods of flat or declining prices, in addition to sharp fluctuations. 
 
 Over-the-Counter Transactions 
 
 29 

Some of the markets in which the Trust may execute its transactions are over-the-counter or interdealer markets. The participants in such markets are typically not subject to credit evaluation and regulatory oversight as are members of exchange-based markets. This exposes the Trust to the risk that a counterparty will not settle a transaction in accordance with its terms and conditions because of a dispute over the terms of the contract (whether or not bona fide) or because of a credit or liquidity problem, thus causing the Trust to suffer a loss. Such counterparty risk is accentuated for Crypto Assets where the Trust has concentrated its transactions with a single or small group of counterparties. The Trust is not restricted from dealing with any particular counterparty or from concentrating any or all of its transactions with one counterparty. Moreover, the Trust has no internal credit function that evaluates the creditworthiness of its counterparties. The ability of the Trust to transact business with any one or number of counterparties, the lack of any meaningful and independent evaluation of such counterparty s financial capabilities and the absence of a regulated market to facilitate settlement may increase the potential for losses by the Trust. 
 
 No FDIC or SIPC Protection 
 
 The Trust is not a banking institution or otherwise a member of the FDIC or the SIPC. Accordingly, deposits or assets held by the Trust are not subject to the protections enjoyed by depositors with FDIC or SIPC member institutions. The Trust s Crypto Asset Custodian does however carry bespoke insurance policies related to the Crypto Assets over which it provides custody. 
 The Trust must adapt to technological change in order to secure and safeguard client accounts. While management believes they have developed an appropriate proprietary security system reasonably designed to safeguard the Trust s Crypto Assets from theft, loss, destruction or other issues relating to hackers and technological attack, such assessment is based upon known technology and threats. To the extent that the Trust is unable to identify and mitigate or stop new security threats, the Trust s Crypto Assets may be subject to theft, loss, destruction or other attack, which could have a negative impact on the performance of the Trust or result in loss of the Trust s Crypto Assets. 
 
 Risks Associated with a Crypto Assets Majority Control 
 
 Since Crypto Assets are virtual and transactions in such currencies reside on distributed networks, governance of the underlying distributed network could be adversely altered should any individual or group obtain 51 control of the distributed network. Such control could have a significant adverse effect on either the ownership or value of the Crypto Asset. 
 
 Transaction Authentication 
 
 As of the date of these financial statements, the transfer of Crypto Assets from one party to another typically relies on an authentication process by an outside party known as a Miner or Validator. In exchange for compensation, the Miner or Validator will authenticate the transfer of the currency through the solving of a complex algorithm known as a proof of work, or will vouch for the transfer through other means, such as a proof of stake. Effective transfers of and therefore realization of Crypto Assets and tokens are dependent on interactions from these Miners or Validators. In the event that there were a shortage of Miners or Validators to perform this function, that shortage could have an adverse effect on either the fair value or realization of the Crypto Assets. 
 Other Risks 
 Management continues to evaluate the impact of current or anticipated military conflict, including between Russia and Ukraine, terrorism, sanctions and other geopolitical events as well as adverse developments in the economy, the capital markets and the Blockchain markets, including rising energy costs, inflation and interest rates, in the United States and globally, and catastrophic events such as fires, floods, earthquakes, tornadoes, hurricanes and global health epidemics, and has concluded that while it is reasonably possible that these events could have a negative effect on the financial performance and operations of the Trust, the specific impact is not readily determinable as of the date of the financial statements. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty. 
 30 

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk 
 
 The Trust Agreement does not authorize the Trustee to borrow for payment of the Trust s ordinary expenses. The Trust does not engage in transactions in foreign currencies which could expose the Trust or holders of Shares to any foreign currency related market risk. The Trust does not invest in derivative financial instruments and has no foreign operations or long-term debt instruments. 
 
 Item 4. Controls and Procedures 
 
 Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 
 The Trust maintains disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in its Exchange Act reports is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to the Principal Executive Officer and Principal Financial and Accounting Officer of the Sponsor performing functions equivalent to those a principal executive officer and principal financial and accounting officer of the Trust would perform if the Trust had any officers, and to the Board of Directors of the Sponsor, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 
 
 Under the supervision and with the participation of the Principal Executive Officer and the Principal Financial and Accounting Officer of the Sponsor, the Sponsor conducted an evaluation of the Trusts disclosure controls and procedures, as defined under Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(e). Based on this evaluation, the Principal Executive Officer and the Principal Financial and Accounting Officer of the Sponsor concluded that the Trust s disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of the end of the period covered by this report. 
 
 There are inherent limitations to the effectiveness of any system of disclosure controls and procedures, including the possibility of human error and the circumvention or overriding of the controls and procedures. 
 
 Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
 
 There was no change in the Trust s internal controls over financial reporting that occurred during the Trust s most recently completed fiscal quarter that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, these internal controls.

PART II OTHER INFORMATION: 
 Item 1. Legal Proceedings 
 None. 
 
 Item 1A. Risk Factors 
 The following risk factor is being provided to supplement and update the risk factors set forth in Part I, Item 1A, Risk Factors of our 2023 Annual Report. 
 A determination that any of the Portfolio Crypto Assets are a security may adversely affect the value of the Portfolio Crypto Assets and the value of the Shares, and result in potentially extraordinary, nonrecurring expenses to, or termination of, the Trust. 
 The SEC has stated that certain Crypto Assets may be considered securities under the federal securities laws. For example, on December 22, 2020, the SEC instituted proceedings to enjoin Ripple Labs Inc., the creator of XRP, on the basis that the offer and sale of XRP was an unregistered, ongoing offering of securities in violation of Sections 5(a) and 5(c) of the Securities Act. If any of the Portfolio Crypto Assets are determined to be a security under federal or state securities laws by the SEC or any other agency, or in a proceeding in a court of law or otherwise, it may have material adverse consequences for the Portfolio Crypto Assets, the Sponsor, the Trust, and the Shares. It may, for example, become more difficult for the Portfolio Crypto Assets to be traded, cleared and custodied as compared to other Crypto Assets that are not considered to be securities, which could in turn negatively affect the liquidity and general acceptance of the Portfolio Crypto Assets and cause users to migrate to other Crypto Assets. Further, if other Crypto Assets are determined to be securities under federal or state securities laws by the SEC or any other agency, or in a proceeding in a court of law or otherwise, it may have material adverse consequences for the Portfolio Crypto Assets due to negative publicity or a decline in the general acceptance of Crypto Assets. As such, any determination that the Portfolio Crypto Assets or any other Crypto Asset is a security under federal or state securities laws may adversely affect the value of the Portfolio Crypto Assets and, as a result, the value of the Shares. 
 While the Committee engages in a limited risk-based assessment of Crypto Assets when determining which Crypto Assets to include in the Index, such assessment does not preclude legal or regulatory action based on the presence of a security. Such risk-based assessment includes an evaluation of: 1) public information to determine if the SEC, any other US regulatory agency or any court has made any statements regarding the Crypto Asset, 2) public information regarding how the Crypto Asset markets view the Crypto Asset, including whether the Crypto Asset has been listed on entities such as Coinbase or other US exchanges that would have had access to a reasonable amount of information when making their determinations to list the Crypto Asset, 3) public information to undertake reasonable diligence into the structure and technology of the Crypto Asset, including reviewing the Crypto Asset s whitepaper if available and speaking with the sponsor of the Crypto Asset, and 4) any other information gained from reputable sources that may impact the Committee s view of the Crypto Asset. The Committee does not engage in legal analysis of any Crypto Assets or perform any analysis of Crypto Assets based upon any legal standards. 
 Since the Trust s principal investment objective is to invest in a portfolio of Crypto Assets that tracks the Index as closely as possible, the Trust relies on the Index Methodology when the Trust determines which Crypto Assets it should invest in. The Trust, in the Sponsor s sole discretion, may choose to immediately liquidate its position in any Portfolio Crypto Asset that it determines may be at undue risk of being in violation of U.S. federal securities laws or based on consideration of new public information available regarding the asset. The Sponsor makes its determination using the same process as the Committee, as set forth in Item 1. Business-Eligibility of Crypto Assets. Assets will lose eligibility and be removed from the Index at the next monthly reconstitution event if they violate any of the listed Eligibility Requirements for 30-consecutive days. Under extraordinary circumstances, assets may lose eligibility and be removed on a same-day basis by a unanimous vote of the quorum of members of the Committee. Such emergency removals will take place at 4:00 pm ET following the conclusion of the meeting and public posting of that notice on the Sponsor s website.
