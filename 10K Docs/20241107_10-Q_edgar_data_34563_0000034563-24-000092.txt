 Three Months Ended September 30, 2024 Compared to Three Months Ended September 30, 2023 
 Net Sales 
 Net sales in the three months ended September 30, 2024 increased 3.2 million, or 3.9 , to 85.1 million from 81.9 million in the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in net sales for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily due to higher pricing compared to the prior period. 
 The following table presents the effect of changes in unit sales, and unit pricing and product mix in the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in the prior fiscal year (in millions): 
 Three Months Ended September 30, 2024 vs. 2023 
 Effect of change in unit sales (9.8) Effect of pricing and product mix changes 13.0 Total (decrease) increase in net sales 3.2 
 Unit sales decreased 10.5 , and average unit price increased by 16.1 in the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the same period in the prior fiscal year, resulting in an increase in our net sales of 3.9 . Average unit price increased during the three months ended September 30, 2024 primarily due to price increases. There were no new product category introductions which had a material impact on our net sales in the three months ended September 30, 2024 or 2023. 
 Gross Profit 
 Gross profit increased to 37.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 30.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. Gross margin increased to 43.9 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 from 37.6 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in gross profit was primarily due to improved pricing compared to the same period in the prior fiscal year. 
 Operating Expenses 
 In the three months ended September 30, 2024, operating expenses increased 7.3 million to 40.1 million, or 47.2 of net sales, from 32.9 million, or 40.1 of net sales in the prior year period. For the three months ended September 30, 2024, there was a 1.7 million loss on disposal of assets compared to a 6.8 million gain on disposal of assets for three months ended September 30, 2023 as there were no branch sales during the three months ended September 30, 2024. Operating expenses as a percentage of sales excluding net losses (gains) on disposal of assets was 45.2 and 48.4 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023, respectively. There was a 0.4 million increase in selling expenses which was offset by 1.6 million decrease in general and administrative expenses. The increase in selling expenses during the three months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily due to compensation related cost. The decrease in general 
 19 

and administrative expenses during the three months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily due to a decrease in severance costs offset by an increase in insurance related costs. 
 Total Other Expense 
 Interest expense in the three months ended September 30, 2024 decreased 0.4 million to 1.8 million from 2.2 million in the prior year period. The decrease is primarily related to lower supplier interest expense. 
 Other, net was a loss of 0.2 million loss in the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 2.9 million gain in the prior year period. The 3.1 million change was primarily a result of mark-to-market net losses on coffee-related derivative instruments not designated as accounting hedges in the current period compared to mark-to-market net gains in the prior year period. 
 Income Taxes 
 In the three months ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023, we recorded income tax expense of 133 thousand and an income tax benefit of 132 thousand, respectively. See Note 15 , Income Taxes , of the Notes to Unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. 
 
 Non-GAAP Financial Measures 
 In addition to net loss determined in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles GAAP ), we use the following non-GAAP financial measures in assessing our operating performance: 
 EBITDA is defined as net loss excluding the impact of: 
 income tax expense (benefit); 
 interest expense; and 
 depreciation and amortization expense. 
 EBITDA Margin is defined as EBITDA expressed as a percentage of net sales. 
 Adjusted EBITDA is defined as net loss excluding the impact of: 
 income tax expense (benefit); 
 interest expense; 
 depreciation and amortization expense; 
 401(k) and share-based compensation expense; 
 net losses (gains) on disposal of assets; and 
 severance costs. 
 Adjusted EBITDA Margin is defined as Adjusted EBITDA expressed as a percentage of net sales. 
 For purposes of calculating EBITDA and EBITDA Margin, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin, we have excluded the impact of interest expense resulting from non-cash pretax pension and postretirement benefits. For purposes of calculating Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin, beginning with the period ended June 30, 2024 and any period thereafter, we are also excluding the impact of the loss related to sale of business, as this item is not reflective of our ongoing operating results. 
 We believe these non-GAAP financial measures provide a useful measure of the Company s operating results, a meaningful comparison with historical results and with the results of other companies, and insight into the Company s ongoing operating performance. Further, management utilizes these measures, in addition to GAAP measures, when evaluating and comparing the Company s operating performance against internal financial forecasts and budgets. 
 We believe that EBITDA facilitates operating performance comparisons from period to period by isolating the effects of certain items that vary from period to period without any correlation to core operating performance or that vary widely among similar companies. These potential differences may be caused by variations in capital structures (affecting interest expense), tax positions (such as the impact on periods or companies of changes in effective tax rates or net operating losses) and the age and book depreciation of facilities and equipment (affecting relative depreciation expense). We also present EBITDA and EBITDA Margin because (i) we believe that these measures are frequently used by securities analysts, investors and other interested parties to evaluate companies in our industry, (ii) we believe that investors will find these measures useful in assessing our ability to service or incur indebtedness, and (iii) we use these measures internally as benchmarks to compare our performance to that of our competitors. 
 EBITDA, EBITDA Margin, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin, as defined by us, may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies. We do not intend for non-GAAP financial measures to 
 20 

be considered in isolation or as a substitute for other measures prepared in accordance with GAAP.

 Our Business 
 We are a leading coffee roaster, wholesaler, equipment servicer and distributor of coffee, tea and other allied products manufactured under our owned brands, as well as under private labels on behalf of certain customers. We were founded in 1912, incorporated in California in 1923, and reincorporated in Delaware in 2004. Our principal office is located in Fort Worth, Texas. We operate in one business segment. 
 We serve a wide variety of customers, from small independent restaurants and foodservice operators to large institutional buyers like restaurants, department and convenience store retailers, hotels, casinos, healthcare facilities, and gourmet coffee houses, as well as grocery chains with private brand and consumer-branded coffee and tea products, and foodservice distributors. Through our sustainability, stewardship, environmental efforts, and leadership we are not only committed to serving the finest products available, considering the cost needs of the customer, but also focus on their sustainable cultivation, manufacture and distribution whenever possible. 
 Our product categories consist of a robust line of roast and ground coffee, including organic, Direct Trade, Project D.I.R.E.C.T. , Fair Trade Certified and other sustainably-produced offerings; frozen liquid coffee; flavored and unflavored iced and hot teas; including organic and Rainforest Alliance Certified culinary products including premium spices, pancake and biscuit mixes, gravy and sauce mixes, soup bases, dressings, syrups and sauces, and coffee-related products such as coffee filters, cups, sugar and creamers; and other beverages including cappuccino, cocoa, granitas, and other blender-based beverages and concentrated and ready-to-drink cold brew and iced coffee. We offer a comprehensive approach to our customers by providing not only a breadth of high-quality products, but also value added services such as market insight, beverage planning, and equipment placement and service. 
 We operate a production facility in Portland, Oregon. We distribute our products from our Portland, Oregon production facility, as well as separate distribution centers in Northlake, Illinois; Moonachie, New Jersey; and Rialto, California. Our products reach our customers primarily through our nationwide DSD network of 241 delivery routes and 101 branch warehouses as of September 30, 2024. DSD sales are primarily made off-truck to our customers at their places of business. We operate a large fleet of trucks and other vehicles to distribute and deliver our products through our DSD network, and we rely on 3PL service providers for our long-haul distribution.

Liquidity, Capital Resources and Financial Condition 
 The following table summarizes our debt obligations: 
 September 30, 2024 June 30, 2024 (In thousands) Debt Origination Date Maturity Principal Borrowing Amount Carrying Value Weighted Average Interest Rate (1) 
 Carrying Value Weighted Average Interest Rate (1) 
 Revolver Various 4/26/2027 N/A 23,300 7.06 23,300 7.05 
 
 The revolver under the Credit Facility has a commitment of up to 75.0 million and a maturity date of April 26, 2027. Availability under the revolver is calculated as the lesser of (a) 75.0 million or (b) the amount equal to the sum of (i) 85 of eligible accounts receivable (less a dilution reserve), plus (ii) the lesser of: (a) 80 of eligible raw material inventory, eligible in-transit inventory and eligible finished goods inventory (collectively, Eligible Inventory ), and (b) 85 of the net orderly liquidation value of Eligible Inventory, minus (c) applicable reserve. The Term Loan under the Term Credit Facility was fully paid down on June 30, 2023. 
 The Credit Facility contains customary affirmative and negative covenants and restrictions typical for a financing of this type. Non-compliance with one or more of the covenants and restrictions could result in the full or partial principal balance of the Credit Facility becoming immediately due and payable and termination of the commitments. As of and through September 30, 2024, we were in compliance with all of the covenants under the Credit Facility. 
 The Credit Facility provides us with increased flexibility to proactively manage our liquidity and working capital, while maintaining compliance with our debt financial covenants, and preserving financial liquidity to mitigate the impact of the uncertain business environment and continue to execute on key strategic initiatives. 
 At September 30, 2024, the Company had outstanding borrowings on the Revolver Credit Facility of 23.3 million and had utilized 4.4 million of the letters of credit sublimit. 
 Liquidity 
 We generally finance our operations through cash flows from operations and borrowings under our Credit Facility described above. In light of our financial position, operating performance and current economic conditions, including the state of the global capital markets, there can be no assurance as to whether or when we will be able to raise capital by issuing securities. We believe that the Credit Facility, to the extent available, in addition to our cash flows from operations, collectively, will be sufficient to fund our working capital and capital expenditure requirements for the next 12 months and beyond. 
 At September 30, 2024, we had 3.3 million of unrestricted cash and cash equivalents and 1.9 million in restricted cash. Further changes in commodity prices and the number of coffee-related derivative instruments held could have a significant impact on cash deposit requirements under our broker and counterparty agreements and may adversely affect our liquidity. At September 30, 2024, we had 27.1 million available on our Revolver Credit Facility. 
 Cash Flows 
 The significant captions and amounts from our consolidated statements of cash flows are summarized below: 
 Three Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 Consolidated Statements of cash flows data (in thousands) Net cash provided by (used in) operating activities 2,493 (7,137) Net cash (used in) provided by investing activities (3,304) 5,747 Net cash (used in) provided by financing activities (56) 184 Net decrease in cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash (867) (1,206) 
 Operating Activities 
 Net cash provided by operating activities during the three months ended September 30, 2024 was 2.5 million as compared to net cash used in operating activities of 7.1 million in the three months ended September 30, 2023, a decrease in cash used by operations of 9.6 million. The change was driven by a increase in accounts payable partially offset by a decrease in accounts receivables and inventory. 
 Investing Activities 
 Net cash used in investing activities during the three months ended September 30, 2024 was 3.3 million as compared to net cash provided by investing activities of 5.7 million in the three months ended September 30, 2023. The net change in 
 22 

investing activities was primarily due to an decrease of 9.2 million related to less proceeds from the sale of property, plant and equipment in the current period compared to the prior year period. 
 Financing Activities 
 Net cash used in financing activities during the three months ended September 30, 2024 was 0.1 million as compared to net cash provided by financing activities of 0.2 million in the three months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease of 0.3 million was primarily due to net borrowing proceeds of 0.3 million under the Credit Facility in the prior year period. 
 Capital Expenditures 
 For the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, our capital expenditures paid were 3.3 million and 3.5 million, respectively. In fiscal 2025, we anticipate paying between 9.0 million to 11.0 million in capital expenditures. We expect to finance these expenditures through cash flows from operations and borrowings under our Credit Facility. 
 Depreciation and amortization expenses were 2.9 million and 2.9 million in the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. 
 Purchase Commitments 
 As of September 30, 2024, the Company had committed to purchase green coffee inventory totaling 35.2 million under fixed-price contracts, and 10.9 million in inventory and other purchases under non-cancelable purchase orders. 
 Contractual Obligations 
 As of September 30, 2024, the Company had operating and finance lease payment commitments totaling 34.4 million. 
 Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 
 We prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance with GAAP. In applying many of these accounting principles, we need to make assumptions, estimates or judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses in our consolidated financial statements. We base our estimates and judgments on historical experience and other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances. These assumptions, estimates or judgments, however, are both subjective and subject to change, and actual results may differ from our assumptions and estimates. If actual amounts are ultimately different from our estimates, the revisions are included in our results of operations for the period in which the actual amounts become known. For a summary of our significant accounting policies, see Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part I, Item 1 of our 2024 Form 10-K. For a summary of our critical accounting estimates, please see "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Critical Accounting Estimates" in our 2024 Form 10-K.

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 
 Interest Rate Risk 
 At September 30, 2024, we had outstanding borrowings on our Revolver Credit Facility of 23.3 million and had utilized 4.4 million of the letters of credit sublimit. The weighted average interest rate on our Revolver Credit Facility was 7.06 . 
 The following table demonstrates the impact of interest rate changes on our annual interest expense on outstanding borrowings subject to interest rate variability under these Credit Facility based on the weighted average interest rate on the outstanding borrowings as of September 30, 2024: 
 (In thousands) Principal Interest Rate Annual Interest Expense 150 basis points 23,300 5.56 1,295 100 basis points 23,300 6.06 1,412 Unchanged 23,300 7.06 1,644 +100 basis points 23,300 8.06 1,878 +150 basis points 23,300 8.56 1,994 
 Commodity Price Risk 
 We are exposed to commodity price risk arising from changes in the market price of green coffee. We value green coffee inventory on the FIFO basis. In the normal course of business we hold a large green coffee inventory and enter into forward commodity purchase agreements with suppliers. We are subject to price risk resulting from the volatility of green coffee prices. Due to competition and market conditions, volatile price increases cannot always be passed on to our customers. See Note 4 , Derivative Instruments, of the Notes to the Unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussions of our derivative instruments. 
 The following table summarizes the potential impact as of September 30, 2024 to net gain (loss) and AOCI from a hypothetical 10 change in coffee commodity prices. The information provided below relates only to the coffee-related derivative instruments and does not include, when applicable, the corresponding changes in the underlying hedged items:
