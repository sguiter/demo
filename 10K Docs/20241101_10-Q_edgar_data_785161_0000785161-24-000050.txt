 NOTE TO READERS 
 As used in this report, the terms Encompass Health, we, us, our, and the Company refer to Encompass Health Corporation and its consolidated subsidiaries, unless otherwise stated or indicated by context. This drafting style is suggested by the Securities and Exchange Commission and is not meant to imply that Encompass Health Corporation, the publicly traded parent company, owns or operates any specific asset, business, or property. The hospitals, operations, and businesses described in this filing are primarily owned and operated by subsidiaries of the parent company. In addition, we use the term Encompass Health Corporation to refer to Encompass Health Corporation alone wherever a distinction between Encompass Health Corporation and its subsidiaries is required or aids in the understanding of this filing.

CAUTIONARY STATEMENT REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS 
 This quarterly report contains historical information, as well as forward-looking statements that involve known and unknown risks and relate to, among other things, future events, changes to Medicare reimbursement and other healthcare laws and regulations from time to time, our business strategy, labor cost trends, our dividend and stock repurchase strategies, our financial plans, our growth plans, our future financial performance, our projected business results, or our projected capital expenditures. In some cases, the reader can identify forward-looking statements by terminology such as may, will, should, could, expects, plans, anticipates, believes, estimates, predicts, targets, potential, or continue or the negative of these terms or other comparable terminology. Such forward-looking statements are necessarily estimates based upon current information and involve a number of risks and uncertainties, many of which are beyond our control. Any forward-looking statement is based on information current as of the date of this report and speaks only as of the date on which such statement is made. Actual events or results may differ materially from the results anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of a variety of factors. While it is impossible to identify all such factors, the factors described below could cause, and in the case of the COVID-19 pandemic has already caused, actual results to differ materially from those estimated by us. 
 Each of the factors discussed in Item 1A, Risk Factors , of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, as well as uncertainties and factors discussed elsewhere in this Form 10-Q, including in the Executive Overview Key Challenges section of Part I, Item 2, Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations , in our other filings from time to time with the SEC, or in materials incorporated therein by reference. 
 We are highly concentrated in our primary line of business, particularly with respect to Medicare regulations and reimbursement. 
 Reductions or delays in, or suspension of, reimbursement for our services by governmental or private payors, including our inability to obtain and retain favorable arrangements with third-party payors, could decrease our revenues and adversely affect other operating results. 
 Restrictive interpretations of the regulations governing the claims that are reimbursable by Medicare could decrease our revenues and adversely affect other operating results. 
 Reimbursement claims are subject to various audits and such audits may lead to assertions that we have been overpaid or have submitted improper claims, and these assertions have in the past and will in the future require us to incur additional costs to respond to requests for records and defend the validity of payments and to refund any amounts determined to have been overpaid. 
 The use by governmental agencies and contractors of statistical sampling and extrapolation may substantially expand claims of overpayment or noncompliance. 
 Substantive and procedural deficiencies in the administrative appeals process associated with denied Medicare reimbursement claims, including from various Medicare audit programs, have in the past and could in the future delay or reduce our reimbursement for services previously provided, including through recoupment from other claims due to us from Medicare. 
 Efforts to reduce payments to healthcare providers undertaken by third-party payors and conveners could adversely affect our revenues or profitability. 
 Changes in our payor mix or the acuity of our patients could reduce our revenues or profitability. 
 Changes in the rules and regulations of the healthcare industry at the federal, state, and local levels, including those contemplated now and in the future as part of healthcare reform and deficit reduction (such as the Inpatient Rehabilitation Facility Review Choice Demonstration, the re-basing of payment systems, the introduction of site neutral payments or case-mix weightings across post-acute settings, and other payment system reforms) could decrease revenues and increase the costs of complying with the rules and regulations and have done so in the past from time to time. 
 Alternative payment models and value-based purchasing initiatives could decrease our patient volumes and reimbursement rate or increase costs associated with our operations. 
 Compliance with the extensive and frequently changing laws and regulations applicable to healthcare providers, including those related to patient care, coding and billing, data privacy and security, consumer protection, anti-trust, and employment practices, requires substantial time, effort and expense, and if we fail to comply, we could incur 
 ii 

penalties and significant costs of investigating and defending asserted claims, whether meritorious or not, or be required to make significant changes to our operations. 
 Our inability to maintain proper local, state and federal licensing, including compliance with the Medicare conditions of participation and provider enrollment requirements could decrease our revenues. 
 Incidents affecting the proper operation, availability, or security of our or our payors , vendors or partners information systems, including the patient information stored there, or business continuity could cause substantial losses and adversely affect our operations and governmental mandates to increase use of electronic records and interoperability exacerbate that risk. 
 Any adverse outcome of various lawsuits, claims, and legal or regulatory proceedings, including disclosed and undisclosed qui tam suits, could be difficult to predict and could adversely affect our financial results or condition or our operations, and we could experience increased costs of defending and insuring against alleged professional liability and other claims. 
 Our inability to successfully complete and integrate de novo developments, acquisitions, investments, and joint ventures consistent with our growth strategy, including realization of anticipated revenues, cost savings, productivity improvements arising from the related operations and avoidance of unanticipated difficulties, costs or liabilities that could arise from acquisitions or integrations could adversely affect our financial results or condition. 
 Our inability to attract and retain nurses, therapists, and other healthcare professionals in a highly competitive environment with often severe staffing shortages and potential union activity could increase staffing costs and adversely affect other financial and operating results and has done so in the past. 
 Competitive pressures in the healthcare industry, including from large acute-care hospitals that would typically serve as referral sources for us, and our response to those pressures could adversely affect our revenues or other financial results. 
 Medicare quality reporting requirements could adversely affect our operating costs or Medicare reimbursement. 
 Our inability to provide a consistently high quality of care, including as represented in metrics published by Medicare, could decrease our revenues. 
 Our inability to maintain or develop relationships with patient referral sources, including our joint venture hospitals, or managed care payors could decrease our revenues. 
 Acute-care hospitals that participate in joint ventures with us may experience, and in the past some have experienced, operational or financial challenges that, in turn, affect our joint venture inpatient rehabilitation hospitals. 
 A pandemic, epidemic, or other widespread outbreak of an infectious disease or other public health crisis, and governmental responses to those events, could decrease our patient volumes, pricing, and revenues, lead to staffing and supply shortages and associated cost increases, otherwise interrupt operations, or lead to increased litigation risk and, in the case of the COVID-19 pandemic, has already done so in many instances. 
 Regional, particularly Texas or Florida, or global socio-political, weather, or other catastrophic events have previously severely disrupted, and could again in the future disrupt, our business, including indirectly by affecting the patient population and referral sources in our markets. 
 Regulatory and other efforts to promote a transition to a lower-carbon economy may result in significant operational and financial challenges for us. 
 Our inability to maintain infectious disease prevention and control efforts that are required and effectively minimize the spread among patients and employees could decrease our patient volumes and revenues, lead to staffing shortages or otherwise interrupt operations, or lead to increased litigation risk. 
 Our debt and the associated restrictive covenants could have negative consequences for our business and limit our ability to execute aspects of our business plan successfully. 
 The price of our common stock could adversely affect our willingness and ability to repurchase shares. 
 We may be unable or unwilling to continue to declare and pay dividends on our common stock. 
 iii 

General conditions in the economy and capital markets, including inflation, any disruption, instability, or uncertainty related to armed conflict or an act of terrorism, a governmental impasse over approval of the United States federal budget or an increase to the debt ceiling, an international trade war, or a sovereign debt crisis could adversely affect our financial results or condition, including access to the capital markets. 
 The cautionary statements referred to in this section also should be considered in connection with any subsequent written or oral forward-looking statements that may be issued by us or persons acting on our behalf. We undertake no duty to update these forward-looking statements, even though our situation may change in the future. Furthermore, we cannot guarantee future results, events, levels of activity, performance, or achievements.

 The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements of Encompass Health Corporation and Subsidiaries should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes contained in Encompass Health s Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission on February 28, 2024 (the 2023 Form 10 K ). The unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the rules and regulations of the SEC applicable to interim financial information. Certain information and note disclosures included in financial statements prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America have been omitted in these interim statements, as allowed by such SEC rules and regulations. The condensed consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2023 has been derived from audited financial statements, but it does not include all disclosures required by GAAP. However, we believe the disclosures are adequate to make the information presented not misleading. Certain prior year amounts may have been reclassified for comparative purposes to conform to the current-year financial statement presentation. 
 The unaudited results of operations for the interim periods shown in these financial statements are not necessarily indicative of operating results for the entire year. In our opinion, the accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements recognize all adjustments of a normal recurring nature considered necessary to fairly state the financial position, results of operations, and cash flows for each interim period presented.

Our ownership percentages in these entities range from to as of September 30, 2024.

 Executive Overview 
 Our Business 
 We are the nation s largest owner and operator of inpatient rehabilitation hospitals in terms of patients treated, revenues, and number of hospitals. We provide specialized rehabilitative treatment on an inpatient basis. We operate hospitals in 38 states and Puerto Rico, with concentrations in Florida and Texas. As of September 30, 2024, we operate 165 inpatient rehabilitation hospitals. For additional information about our business, see Item 1, Business , and Item 1A, Risk Factors , of the 2023 Form 10 K. 
 2024 Overview 
 During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, Net operating revenues increased 11.9 and 11.6 , respectively, over the same periods of 2023 due primarily to volume growth. See Results of Operations section of this Item for additional volume information. 
 In our continued development and expansion efforts during 2024, we:

For additional information see the Liquidity and Capital Resources section of this Item. 
 Business Outlook 
 We remain highly optimistic regarding the intermediate and long-term prospects of our business. Demographic trends, such as population aging, should continue to increase long-term demand for the services we provide. While we treat patients of all ages, most of our patients are 65 and older, and the number of Medicare enrollees is expected to grow approximately 3 per year for the foreseeable future, reaching approximately 73 million people over the age of 65 by 2030. More specifically, the average age of our Medicare patients is approximately 77, and the population group ranging in ages from 75 to 79 is expected to grow at approximately 5 per year through 2026. We believe the demand for the services we provide will continue to increase as the U.S. population ages. We believe these factors align with our strengths in, and focus on, inpatient rehabilitation services. 
 We are committed to delivering high-quality, cost-effective patient care. As the nation s largest owner and operator of inpatient rehabilitation hospitals in terms of patients treated, revenues, and number of hospitals, we believe we differentiate ourselves from our competitors based on, among other things, the quality of our clinical outcomes, our cost-effectiveness, our financial strength, and our extensive application of technology. We also believe our competitive strengths discussed in Item 1, Business , Competitive Strengths, of the 2023 Form 10 K, give us the ability to adapt and succeed in a healthcare industry facing regulatory uncertainty around attempts to improve outcomes and reduce costs. 
 
 16 

The healthcare industry faces the prospect of ongoing efforts to transform the healthcare system to coordinated care delivery and payment models. The nature, timing and extent of that transformation remains uncertain, as the development and implementation of new care delivery and payment systems will require significant time and resources. Our goal is to position the Company in a prudent manner to be responsive to industry shifts. We have invested in our core business and created an infrastructure that enables us to provide high-quality care on a cost-effective basis. We have been disciplined in creating a capital structure that is flexible with no significant debt maturities in 2024. We continue to have a strong, well-capitalized balance sheet, including a substantial portfolio of owned real estate, and ample availability under our revolving credit facility, which along with the cash flows generated from operations should, we believe, provide sufficient support for our ability to adapt to changes in reimbursement, sustain our business model, and grow through de novo hospitals and bed additions. See also Item 1, Business , Competitive Strengths and Strategy and 2024 Strategic Priorities of the 2023 Form 10 K. 
 Key Challenges 
 Healthcare is a highly regulated industry facing many well-publicized regulatory and reimbursement challenges. Medicare reimbursement for inpatient rehabilitation facilities IRFs has recently undergone significant changes. The future of many aspects of healthcare regulation generally and Medicare reimbursement specifically remains uncertain. Successful healthcare providers are those able to adapt to changes in the regulatory and operating environments, build strategic relationships across the healthcare continuum, and consistently provide high-quality, cost-effective care. We believe we have the necessary capabilities change agility, strategic relationships, quality of patient outcomes, cost effectiveness, and ability to capitalize on growth opportunities to adapt to and succeed in a dynamic, highly regulated industry, and we have a proven track record of doing so. For a detailed discussion of the challenges we face, see Item 7, Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations , Executive Overview Key Challenges of the 2023 Form 10 K. 
 As we continue to execute our business plan, the following are some of the key challenges we face. 
 Operating in a Highly Regulated Industry . We are required to comply with extensive and complex laws and regulations at the federal, state, and local government levels. More specifically, because Medicare comprises a significant portion of our Net operating revenues , failure to comply with the laws and regulations governing the Medicare program and related matters, including anti-kickback and anti-fraud requirements, could materially and adversely affect us. These rules and regulations have affected, or could in the future affect, our business activities by having an impact on the reimbursement we receive for services provided or the costs of compliance, mandating new documentation standards, requiring additional licensure or certification, regulating our relationships with physicians and other referral sources, regulating the use of our properties, and limiting our ability to enter new markets or add new capacity to existing hospitals. See Item 1, Business , Regulation, Item 1A, Risk Factors , Reimbursement Risks and Other Regulatory Risks of the 2023 Form 10 K for detailed discussions of the most important regulations we face and our programs intended to ensure we comply with those regulations. 
 Changes in Medicare Reimbursement and Regulatory Requirements for Operating IRFs . On July 31, 2024, the Centers for Medicare Medicaid Services CMS released its notice of final rulemaking for fiscal year 2025 for IRFs (the 2025 Final Rule under the inpatient rehabilitation facility prospective payment system. The 2025 Final Rule will implement a net 3.0 market basket increase (market basket update of 3.5 reduced by a productivity adjustment of 0.5 effective for discharges between October 1, 2024 and September 30, 2025. The 2025 Final Rule also includes changes that impact our hospital-by-hospital base rate for Medicare reimbursement. Such changes include, but are not limited to, revisions to the wage index, updates to outlier payments, and updates to the case-mix group relative weights and average lengths of stay values. Based on our analysis that utilizes the acuity of our patients annualized over a twelve-month period ended June 30, 2024, our experience with outlier payments over this same time frame, and other factors, we believe the 2025 Final Rule will result in a net increase to our Medicare payment rates of approximately 3.3 effective October 1, 2024. 
 Beginning August 21, 2023, IRFs located in Alabama began participation in CMS s five-year review choice demonstration RCD ), under which Medicare reimbursement claims are assessed for compliance with applicable coverage and clinical documentation requirements. On March 1, 2024, CMS announced the expansion of RCD, effective June 17, 2024, to include IRFs located in Pennsylvania and billing to a certain Medicare Administrative Contractor MAC ). We do not bill to this MAC, so we are not subject to RCD in Pennsylvania at this time. CMS plans to expand RCD further to Texas and California, but the timing for doing so is not known. We operate 47 inpatient rehabilitation hospitals (representing approximately 29 of our IRF Medicare claims) in the four RCD states. CMS has also announced it will expand RCD to include additional IRFs, but the timing and sequence for such expansion is not known. 
 
 17 

Under RCD, participating IRFs have an initial choice between pre-claim or post-payment review of 100 of Medicare claims submitted to demonstrate compliance with applicable requirements during the first six-month review period or cycle. We elected the pre-claim review option for our IRFs in Alabama for the first cycle. Under the pre-claim review choice, services can begin prior to the submission of the review request and continue while the decision is being made. The pre-claim review request with required documentation must be submitted, reviewed, and approved before the final claim is paid. If a certain percentage of the claims reviewed are found to be valid, the IRF may then opt out of the 100 review. For the first cycle ending in February 2024, that validation percentage was 80 or greater. The validation percentages for cycles two and three are 85 or greater and 90 or greater, respectively. In opting out, the IRF may elect spot prepayment reviews of samples consisting of 5 of total claims or selective post-payment review of a statistically valid random sample. Our claim validation rate for cycle one exceeded 80 at our IRFs in Alabama. For cycle two, which began on May 1, 2024, we elected not to opt out, so our IRFs in Alabama remain subject to the 100 pre-claim review. We cannot predict the impact, if any, RCD may have on the collectability of our Medicare claims over its five-year term and ultimately our financial position, results of operations, and cash flows. 
 Maintaining Strong Volume Growth . Various factors, including competition and increasing regulatory and administrative burdens, may impact our ability to maintain and grow our hospital volumes. In any particular market, we may encounter competition from local or national entities with longer operating histories or other competitive advantages, such as acute-care hospitals who provide post-acute services similar to ours or other post-acute providers with relationships with referring acute-care hospitals or physicians. Aggressive payment review practices by Medicare contractors, aggressive enforcement of regulatory policies by government agencies, and restrictive or burdensome rules, regulations or statutes governing admissions practices may lead us to not accept patients who would be appropriate for and would benefit from the services we provide. In addition, from time to time, we must get regulatory approval to expand our services and locations in states with certificate of need laws. This approval may be withheld or take longer than expected. In the case of new-store volume growth, the addition of hospitals to our portfolio also may be difficult and take longer than expected. 
 Recruiting and Retaining High-Quality Personnel . Recruiting and retaining qualified personnel, including management, for our inpatient hospitals remain a high priority for us. We attempt to maintain a comprehensive compensation and benefits package that allows us to remain competitive in this challenging staffing environment while remaining consistent with our goal of providing high-quality, cost-effective care. Additionally, our operations have been affected and may in the future be affected by staffing shortages. In recent years, staffing shortages and competition have resulted in increased labor costs, including significant sign-on and shift bonuses, and increased use of contract labor. See Item 1A, Risk Factors , of the 2023 Form 10 K for further discussion of competition for staffing, shortages of qualified personnel, and other factors that may increase our labor costs and constrain our ability to take new patients. 
 We remain confident in the prospects of our business based on the increasing demands for the services we provide to an aging population. This confidence is further supported by our strong financial foundation and the substantial investments we have made in our business. We have a proven track record of working through difficult situations, and we believe in our ability to overcome current and future challenges.

 FTEs included in the above table represent our employees who participate in or support the operations of our hospitals and include FTEs related to contract labor. 
 We actively manage the productive portion of our Salaries and benefits utilizing certain metrics, including employees per occupied bed, or EPOB. This metric is determined by dividing the number of full-time equivalents, including full-time equivalents from the utilization of contract labor, by the number of occupied beds during each period. 
 In the discussion that follows, we use same-store comparisons to explain the changes in certain performance metrics within our financial statements. We calculate same-store comparisons based on hospitals open throughout both the full current periods and prior periods presented. These comparisons include the financial results of market consolidation transactions and capacity expansions (including the addition of satellite and remote hospitals) in existing markets, as it is difficult to determine, with precision, the incremental impact of these transactions on our results of operations. 
 Net Operating Revenues 
 Our consolidated Net operating revenues increased during the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period of 2023 primarily due to increased volumes. Discharge growth included a 6.8 increase in same-store discharges. Discharge growth from new stores during the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period of 2023 resulted from our joint ventures in Columbus, Georgia (September 2023), Atlanta, Georgia (May 2024), and Louisville, Kentucky (June 2024), as well as our wholly owned hospitals in Prosper, Texas (November 2023), Fitchburg, Wisconsin (November 2023), Kissimmee, Florida (May 2024), and Johnston, Rhode Island (July 2024). Growth in net patient revenue per discharge during the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period of 2023 primarily resulted from increase in reimbursement rates and lower revenue reserves related to bad debt partially offset by the change in patient mix. Revenue reserves related to bad debt as a percentage of Net operating revenues decreased during the three months ended September 30, 2024 to 1.9 from 2.2 during the three months ended September 30, 2023 primarily due to strong collections of previously reviewed claims and lower claims review audit activity. 
 
 21 

Growth in revenues and discharges during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 were impacted primarily by the same factors as discussed above for the third quarter of 2024. Discharge growth included a 5.7 increase in same-store discharges. Discharge growth from new stores during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period of 2023 also resulted from our joint ventures in Knoxville, Tennessee (March 2023), Owasso, Oklahoma (March 2023), and Bowie, Maryland (June 2023), as well as our wholly owned hospital in Clermont, Florida (April 2023). Growth in net patient revenue per discharge during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period of 2023 primarily resulted from an increase in reimbursement rates partially offset by the change in patient mix. 
 The increase in outpatient and other revenue during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 included an increase of 7.9 million and 25.1 million, respectively, in provider tax revenues (offset by an increase of 4.5 million and 11.8 million, respectively, in provider tax expenses included in Other operating expenses ). 
 Salaries and Benefits 
 Salaries and benefits increased during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same periods of 2023 primarily due to salary and benefit cost increases for our employees and increased patient volumes, including an increase in the number of full-time equivalents as a result of our development activities. Salaries and benefits decreased as a percent of Net operating revenues during the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period of 2023 primarily due to higher volumes. Salaries and benefits decreased as a percent of Net operating revenues during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period of 2023 primarily due to higher volumes and decreases in both contract labor and sign-on and shift bonuses. In order to meet our clinical staffing needs, we have continued to utilize third-party agencies and to pay sign-on and shift bonuses to our employees. While the costs associated with these actions have declined compared to the prior year period, future costs will be affected by labor market conditions and other factors. 
 Other Operating Expenses 
 Other operating expenses increased in terms of dollars during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same periods of 2023 primarily due to increased provider taxes and higher costs resulting from our development activities. Other operating expenses decreased as a percent of Net operating revenues during the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period of 2023 primarily due to higher volumes. 
 Other operating expenses during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 included a 10.4 million impairment charge related to the closure of our joint venture inpatient rehabilitation hospital in Eau Claire, Wisconsin. In January 2024, we received notice that our joint venture partner intended to close its acute-care hospital in which our joint venture inpatient rehabilitation hospital was located. We closed that joint venture hospital in February 2024 and incurred a one-time impairment charge of 10.4 million. The impact to Net income attributable to Encompass Health during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 resulting from the impairment was 1.8 million after reductions for Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests of 7.3 million and the Provision for income tax expense of 1.3 million. 
 General and Administrative Expenses 
 General and administrative expenses increased in terms of dollars during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same periods of 2023 primarily due to mark-to-market adjustments on our non-qualified deferred compensation plan and higher salaries, benefits, and software expenses partially offset by lower incentive compensation costs. General and administrative expenses decreased as a percent of Net operating revenues during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same periods of 2023 primarily due to higher volumes and lower incentive compensation costs. 
 Depreciation and Amortization 
 Depreciation and amortization increased during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same periods of 2023 due to our capital investments. Depreciation and amortization during the nine months ended September 30, 2023 included 6.1 million related to the accelerated amortization of the remaining carrying value of certificate of need CON assets in South Carolina. In May 2023, the governor of South Carolina signed into law S.164, which repealed the requirement of certain healthcare providers to obtain and/or maintain a CON. 
 See Executive Overview section of this item for information related to our development activity. We expect Depreciation and amortization to increase going forward as a result of our recent and ongoing capital investments. 
 
 22 

Income from Continuing Operations Before Income Tax Expense 
 Our pre-tax income from continuing operations increased during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same periods of 2023 primarily due to the increase in Net operating revenues as discussed above. 
 Provision for Income Tax Expense 
 Our Provision for income tax expense increased during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same periods of 2023 primarily due to higher Income from continuing operations before income tax expense. 
 We currently estimate our cash payments for income taxes to be approximately 155 million to 165 million, net of refunds, for 2024. These payments are expected to primarily result from federal and state income tax expenses based on estimates of taxable income for 2024. 
 In certain jurisdictions, we do not expect to generate sufficient income to use all of the available state net operating losses and foreign tax credits prior to their expiration. This determination is based on our evaluation of all available evidence in these jurisdictions including results of operations during the preceding three years, our forecast of future earnings, and prudent tax planning strategies. It is possible we may be required to increase or decrease our valuation allowance at some future time if our forecast of future earnings varies from actual results on a consolidated basis or in the applicable tax jurisdiction, if the timing of future tax deductions differs from our expectations, or pursuant to changes in state and foreign tax laws and rates. 
 See Note 7, Income Taxes , to the condensed consolidated financial statements included in Part I, Item 1, Financial Statements (Unaudited) , of this report and Note 16, Income Taxes , to the consolidated financial statements accompanying the 2023 Form 10 K. 
 Net Income Attributable to Noncontrolling Interests 
 The increase in Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests during the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period of 2023 resulted from increased profitability from certain existing joint venture hospitals. The increase in Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period of 2023 resulted from increased profitability from certain existing joint venture hospitals partially offset by the impact from the impairment related to the closure of our joint venture hospital in Eau Claire, Wisconsin in February 2024, as discussed above. 
 
 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 Our primary sources of liquidity are cash on hand, cash flows from operations, and borrowings under our revolving credit facility. 
 The objectives of our capital structure strategy are to ensure we maintain adequate liquidity and flexibility. Pursuing and achieving those objectives allow us to support the execution of our operating and strategic plans and weather temporary disruptions in the capital markets and general business environment. Maintaining adequate liquidity is a function of our unrestricted Cash and cash equivalents and our available borrowing capacity. Maintaining flexibility in our capital structure is a function of, among other things, the amount of debt maturities in any given year, the options for debt prepayments without onerous penalties, and limiting restrictive terms and maintenance covenants in our debt agreements. 
 Consistent with these objectives, on July 15, 2024, we redeemed 150 million of the outstanding principal balance of our 5.75 Senior Notes due 2025 (the 2025 Notes using cash on hand. Pursuant to the terms of the 2025 Notes, this optional redemption was made at a price of par. As a result of this redemption, we recorded a 0.4 million Loss on early extinguishment of debt during the three months ended September 30, 2024. 
 On October 22, 2024, we issued notice for redemption of 100 million of the outstanding principal balance of our 2025 Notes. The associated redemption date will be November 21, 2024, and the redemption price will be 100.0 of par, plus accrued and unpaid interest pursuant to the terms of the 2025 Notes. We plan to use cash on hand to fund the redemption. As a result of this redemption, we expect to record an approximate 0.2 million Loss on early extinguishment of debt in the fourth quarter of 2024.

We have been disciplined in creating a capital structure that is flexible with no significant debt maturities in 2024. We continue to have a strong, well-capitalized balance sheet, including a substantial portfolio of owned real estate, and we have significant availability under our revolving credit facility. We continue to generate strong cash flows from operations, and we have significant flexibility with how we choose to invest our cash and return capital to shareholders. 
 For additional information, see Note 3, Long-term Debt , to the accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements included in Part I, Item 1, Financial Statements (Unaudited) , of this report, and Note 10, Long-term Debt, to the consolidated financial statements accompanying the 2023 Form 10 K. 
 Current Liquidity 
 As of September 30, 2024, we had 147.8 million in Cash and cash equivalents . This amount excludes 51.1 million in Restricted cash and 131.0 million of restricted marketable securities 40.6 million included in Other current assets and 90.4 million included in Other long-term assets in our condensed consolidated balance sheet). Our restricted assets pertain primarily to obligations associated with our captive insurance company, as well as obligations we have under agreements with joint venture partners. See Note 5, Cash and Marketable Securities , to the consolidated financial statements accompanying the 2023 Form 10 K. 
 In addition to Cash and cash equivalents , as of September 30, 2024, we had approximately 964 million available to us under our revolving credit facility. Our credit agreement governs the substantial majority of our senior secured borrowing capacity and contains a leverage ratio and an interest coverage ratio as financial covenants. Our leverage ratio is defined in our credit agreement as the ratio of consolidated total debt (less cash on hand) to Adjusted EBITDA for the trailing four quarters. In calculating the leverage ratio under our credit agreement, we are permitted to use pro forma Adjusted EBITDA, the calculation of which includes historical income statement items and pro forma adjustments, subject to certain limitations, resulting from (1) dispositions and repayments or incurrence of debt and (2) investments, acquisitions, mergers, amalgamations, consolidations and other operational changes to the extent such items or effects are not yet reflected in our trailing four-quarter financial statements. Our interest coverage ratio is defined in our credit agreement as the ratio of Adjusted EBITDA to consolidated interest expense, excluding the amortization of financing fees, for the trailing four quarters. As of September 30, 2024, the maximum leverage ratio requirement per our credit agreement was 4.75x and the minimum interest coverage ratio requirement was 3.0x, and we were in compliance with these covenants. Based on Adjusted EBITDA for the trailing four quarters and the interest rate in effect under our credit agreement during the three-month period ended September 30, 2024, if we had drawn on the first day and maintained the maximum amount of outstanding draws under our revolving credit facility for that entire period, we would still be in compliance with the maximum leverage ratio and minimum interest coverage ratio requirements. 
 Effective July 1, 2024, we expanded our existing joint venture with Piedmont Healthcare Piedmont ), which we control, by contributing the assets and operations of our previously wholly-owned 70-bed hospital in Augusta, Georgia. Piedmont contributed approximately 90 million on July 1, 2024, which indirectly resulted in Piedmont obtaining a 50 ownership interest in the hospital. For additional information, see Note 1, Basis of Presentation, Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Affiliates, to the accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements included in Part I, Item 1, Financial Statements (Unaudited) , of this report. 
 We do not face near-term refinancing risk, as the amounts outstanding under our credit agreement do not mature until 2027 , and except for approximately 200 million of our 2025 Notes, our bonds all mature in 2028 and beyond. See Note 3, Long-term Debt , to the accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements, for additional information related to our debt. Also, see the Contractual Obligations section below for information related to our contractual obligations as of September 30, 2024.

Sources and Uses of Cash 
 The following table shows the cash flows provided by or used in operating, investing, and financing activities (in millions): 
 Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 Net cash provided by operating activities 724.0 649.8 Net cash used in investing activities (449.6) (394.7) Net cash used in financing activities (179.7) (167.3) Increase in cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash 94.7 87.8 
 Operating activities . The increase in Net cash provided by operating activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period of 2023 primarily resulted fr om an increase in Net income which was driven by growth in Net operating revenues . 
 Investing activities . The in crease in Net cash used in investing activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period of 2023 primarily resulted from increased Purchases of property, equipment, and intangible assets . 
 Financing activities . The increase in Net cash used in financing activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compa red to the same period of 2023 primarily resulted from higher net debt payments and Repurchases of common stock, including fees and expenses partially offset by higher Contributions from noncontrolling interests of consolidated affiliates . Net debt payments during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 included the redemption of 150 million of the outstanding principal balance of our 2025 Notes using cash on hand. See Note 3, Long-term Debt , to the accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements, for additional information related to our debt. Contributions from noncontrolling interests of consolidated affiliates during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 included approximately 90 million from Piedmont discussed above.

 Our capital expenditures include costs associated with our hospital renovation program, de novo projects, capacity expansions, technology initiatives, and building and equipment upgrades and purchases. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we made capital expenditures of approximately 444 million for property, equipment, and intangible assets. During 2024, we expect to spend approximately 595 million to 625 million for capital expenditures using cash on hand and borrowings under our revolving credit facility. Approximately 185 million to 195 million of this budgeted amount is considered nondiscretionary expenditures, which we may refer to in other filings as maintenance expenditures. Actual amounts spent will be dependent upon the timing of development projects. 
 Authorizations for Returning Capital to Stakeholders 
 In October 2023, February 2024, and May 2024, our board of directors declared cash dividends of 0.15 per share that were paid in January 2024, April 2024, and July 2024, respectively. On July 24, 2024, our board of directors approved an increase in our quarterly dividend and declared a cash dividend of 0.17 per share, that was paid on October 15, 2024 to stockholders of record on October 1, 2024. On October 17, 2024, our board of directors declared a cash dividend of 0.17 per share, payable on January 15, 2025 to stockholders of record on January 2, 2025. We expect quarterly dividends to be paid in January, April, July, and October. However, the actual declaration of any future cash dividends, and the setting of record and payment dates as well as the per share amounts, will be at the discretion of our board of directors after consideration of various factors, including our capital position and alternative uses of funds. Cash dividends are expected to be funded using cash flows from operations, cash on hand, and availability under our revolving credit facility. 
 The terms of our credit agreement allow us to declare and pay cash dividends on our common stock so long as: (1) we are not in default under our credit agreement, and (2) either (a) our senior secured leverage ratio (as defined in our credit agreement) remains less than or equal to 2x and our leverage ratio (as defined in our credit agreement) remains less than or equal to 4.50x or (b) our leverage ratio remains in compliance with the leverage ratio covenant and there is capacity under the Available Amount as defined in the credit agreement. The terms of our Notes indenture allow us to declare and pay cash dividends on our common stock so long as (1) we are not in default, (2) the consolidated coverage ratio (as defined in the indenture) exceeds 2x or we are otherwise allowed under the indenture to incur debt, and (3) we have capacity under the indenture s restricted payments covenant to declare and pay dividends. See Note 3, Long-term Debt , to the accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements included in Part I, Item 1, Financial Statements (Unaudited) , of this report, and Note 10, Long-term Debt , to the consolidated financial statements accompanying the 2023 Form 10 K. 
 On July 24, 2018, our board approved resetting the aggregate common stock repurchase authorization to 250 million. On July 24, 2024, our board of directors approved resetting the aggregate common stock repurchase authorization to 500 million. As of September 30, 2024, approximately 498 million remained under this authorization. The repurchase authorization does not require the repurchase of a specific number of shares, has an indefinite term, and is subject to termination at any time by our board of directors. Subject to certain terms and conditions, including a maximum price per share and compliance with federal and state securities and other laws, the repurchases may be made from time to time in open market transactions, privately negotiated transactions, or other transactions, including trades under a plan established in accordance with Rule 10b5-1 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we repurchased 0.3 million shares of our common stock in the open market for 23.6 million under this repurchase authorization using cash on hand. Future repurchases under this authorization generally are expected to be funded using a combination of cash on hand and availability under our 1 billion revolving credit facility.

Supplemental Guarantor Financial Information 
 Our indebtedness under our credit agreement and the 5.75 Senior Notes due 2025, 4.50 Senior Notes due 2028, 4.75 Senior Notes due 2030, and 4.625 Senior Notes due 2031, (collectively, the Senior Notes are guaranteed by certain consolidated subsidiaries. These guarantees are full and unconditional and joint and several, subject to certain customary conditions for release. The Senior Notes are guaranteed on a senior, unsecured basis by all of our existing and future subsidiaries that guarantee borrowings under our credit agreement and other capital markets debt. The other subsidiaries of Encompass Health do not guarantee the Senior Notes (such subsidiaries are referred to as the non-guarantor subsidiaries ). 
 Summarized financial information is presented below for Encompass Health, the parent company, and the subsidiary guarantors on a combined basis after elimination of intercompany transactions and balances among Encompass Health and the subsidiary guarantors and does not include investments in and equity in the earnings of non-guarantor subsidiaries.

 2,593.1 2,944.2 
 Adjusted EBITDA 
 Management believes Adjusted EBITDA as defined in our credit agreement is a measure of our ability to service our debt and our ability to make capital expenditures. We reconcile Adjusted EBITDA to Net cash provided by operating activities and to Net income . 
 
 27 

We use Adjusted EBITDA on a consolidated basis as a liquidity measure. We believe this financial measure on a consolidated basis is important in analyzing our liquidity because it is the key component of certain material covenants contained within our credit agreement, which is discussed in more detail in Note 10, Long-term Debt , to the consolidated financial statements accompanying the 2023 Form 10 K. These covenants are material terms of the credit agreement. Noncompliance with these financial covenants under our credit agreement our interest coverage ratio and our leverage ratio could result in our lenders requiring us to immediately repay all amounts borrowed. If we anticipated a potential covenant violation, we would seek relief from our lenders, which would have some cost to us, and such relief might be on terms less favorable to us than those in our existing credit agreement. In addition, if we cannot satisfy these financial covenants, we would be prohibited under our credit agreement from engaging in certain activities, such as incurring additional indebtedness, paying common stock dividends, making certain payments, and acquiring and disposing of assets. Consequently, Adjusted EBITDA is critical to our assessment of our liquidity. 
 In general terms, the credit agreement definition of Adjusted EBITDA, therein referred to as Adjusted Consolidated EBITDA, allows us to add back to consolidated Net income interest expense, income taxes, and depreciation and amortization and then add back to consolidated Net income (1) all unusual or nonrecurring items reducing consolidated Net income (of which only up to 10 million in a year may be cash expenditures), (2) any losses from discontinued operations, (3) non-ordinary course fees, costs and expenses incurred with respect to any litigation or settlement, (4) share-based compensation expense, (5) costs and expenses associated with changes in the fair value of marketable securities, (6) costs and expenses associated with the issuance or prepayment of debt, and acquisitions, and (7) any restructuring charges and certain pro forma cost savings and synergies related to transactions and initiatives, which in the aggregate are not in excess of 25 of Adjusted Consolidated EBITDA. We also subtract from consolidated Net income all unusual or nonrecurring items to the extent they increase consolidated Net income . 
 Under the credit agreement, the Adjusted EBITDA calculation does not require us to deduct net income attributable to noncontrolling interests or gains on fair value adjustments of hedging and equity instruments, disposal of assets, and development activities. It also does not allow us to add back losses on fair value adjustments of hedging instruments or unusual or nonrecurring cash expenditures in excess of 10 million. These items and amounts, in addition to the items falling within the credit agreement s unusual or nonrecurring classification, may occur in future periods, but can vary significantly from period to period and may not directly relate to, or be indicative of, our ongoing liquidity or operating performance. Accordingly, the Adjusted EBITDA calculation presented here includes adjustments for them. 
 Adjusted EBITDA is not a measure of financial performance under generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America, and the items excluded from Adjusted EBITDA are significant components in understanding and assessing financial performance. Therefore, Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered a substitute for Net income or cash flows from operating, investing, or financing activities. Because Adjusted EBITDA is not a measurement determined in accordance with GAAP and is thus susceptible to varying calculations, Adjusted EBITDA, as presented, may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies. Revenues and expenses are measured in accordance with the policies and procedures described in Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies , to the consolidated financial statements accompanying the 2023 Form 10 K.

PART II. OTHER INFORMATION 
 
 Item 1. Legal Proceedings 
 We provide services in the highly regulated healthcare industry. Furthermore, operating inpatient rehabilitation hospitals requires significant staffing and involves intensive therapy for individuals suffering from significant physical or cognitive disabilities or injuries. In the ordinary course of our business, we are subject to regulatory and other governmental audits and investigations and are party to various legal actions, proceedings, and claims, including employment and personal injury claims. These matters could potentially subject us to sanctions, damages, recoupments, fines, and other penalties. Some of these matters have been material to us in the past, and others in the future may, either individually or in the aggregate, be material and adverse to our business, financial position, results of operations, and liquidity . 
 Additionally , the False Claims Act (the FCA allows private citizens, called relators, to institute civil proceedings on behalf of the United States alleging violations of the FCA. These lawsuits, also known as qui tam actions, are common in the healthcare industry and can involve significant monetary damages, fines, attorneys fees and the award of bounties to the relators who successfully prosecute or bring these suits to the government. It is possible that qui tam lawsuits have been filed against us, which suits remain under seal, or that we are unaware of such filings or prevented by existing law or court order from discussing or disclosing the filing of such suits. Therefore, from time to time, we may be party to one or more undisclosed qui tam cases brought pursuant to the FCA. 
 Information relating to certain legal proceedings in which we are involved is included in Note 9, Contingencies and Other Commitments , to the condensed consolidated financial statements contained in Part I, Item 1, Financial Statements (Unaudited) , of this report and should be read in conjunction with the related disclosure previously reported in our Annual Report on Form 10 K for the year ended December 31, 2023 (the 2023 Form 10 K ). 
 
 Item 1A. Risk Factors 
 There have been no material changes from the risk factors disclosed in Part I, Item 1A, Risk Factors , of the 2023 Form 10-K. However, certain information in those risk factors has been updated by the discussion in the Executive Overview Key Challenges section of Part I, Item 2, Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations , of this report, which section is incorporated by reference herein.

 (1) Except as noted in the following sentence, the number of shares reported in this column includes the shares purchased under the plan or program as reported in the third column of this table and the shares tendered by employees as payments of the tax liabilities incident to the vesting of previously awarded shares of restricted stock and the exercise price and tax liability incident to the net settlement of an option exercise. In July, 760 shares were purchased pursuant to our Directors Deferred Stock Investment Plan. This plan is a nonqualified deferral plan allowing non-employee directors to make advance elections to defer a fixed percentage of their director fees. The plan administrator acquires the shares in the open market which are then held in a rabbi trust. The plan also provides that dividends paid on the shares held for the accounts of the directors will be reinvested in shares of our common stock which will also be held in the trust. The directors rights to all shares in the trust are nonforfeitable, but the shares are only released to the directors after departure from our board. 
 (2) On October 28, 2013, we announced our board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to 200 million of our common stock. The common stock repurchase authorization of an aggregate of 250 million in value, approved by our board on July 24, 2018, was in effect for the period reported in this table. On July 24, 2024, our board approved resetting the aggregate common stock repurchase authorization to 500 million. The repurchase authorization does not require the repurchase of a specific number of shares, has an indefinite term, and is subject to termination at any time by our board of directors. Subject to certain terms and conditions, including a maximum price per share and compliance with federal and state securities and other laws, the repurchases may be made from time to time in open market transactions, privately negotiated transactions, or other transactions, including trades under a plan established in accordance with Rule 10b5-1 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.
