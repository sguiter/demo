The Company entered into a sublease of its former corporate office space in December 2022. As a result of the sublease, future lease payments will be offset by annually from July 2023 through August 2029. 
 
 Litigation 
 The Company is a defendant in Mullins v. Southern Financial Life Insurance Co., a class action filed in February 2006, in Pike County Circuit Court in the Commonwealth of Kentucky on behalf of Kentucky consumers that purchased certain credit life and disability insurance coverage between 1997-2007. The action alleges violations of the Kentucky Consumer Protection Act KCPA and certain insurance statutes, common law fraud and breach of contract and the covenant of good faith and fair dealing. The plaintiffs seek compensatory and punitive damages, attorneys fees and interest. 
 
 Two classes were certified in June 2010: Subclass A includes class members who suffered a disability during the coverage period but allegedly received less than full disability benefits; Subclass B includes all class members whose loan termination date extended beyond the termination date of the credit disability coverage period. 
 
 In a series of orders issued in October 2022 on competing motions for partial summary judgment, the court found in favor of the plaintiffs as to the Subclass A breach of contract claim (the Subclass A Order) and, as to Subclass B, found that the Company was unjustly enriched to the extent the premium it collected exceeded the proportion of the premium for which the Company provided benefits coverage (the Subclass B Order). The court found in favor of the Company as to the plaintiffs claims for common law fraud and violation of Kentucky s insurance statutes and ordered the plaintiffs Motion for Sanctions for Spoliation of Evidence held in abeyance. The Company has appealed the Subclass A Order and Subclass B Order and all interlocutory orders made final by entry of the Subclass A Order and Subclass B Order. 
 
 In December 2022, the court dismissed the plaintiffs KCPA claims as to both Subclass A Order and Subclass B Order. The court also dismissed the plaintiffs breach of covenant of good faith and fair dealing claim as to Subclass B Order but declined to dismiss such claim as to Subclass A Order pending resolution of the Company s appeal. The trial, previously scheduled for December 2023, has been remanded while the matter is on appeal. 
 
 In May 2024, the Commonwealth of Kentucky Court of Appeals disagreed with the court s interpretation of the policies at issue and entered an order (the Court of Appeals Order) affirming in part, reversing in part, and remanding the Subclass A Order and Subclass B Order. In June 2024, the Company filed a Motion for Discretionary Review of the Court of Appeals Order in the Supreme Court of the Commonwealth of Kentucky. 
 
 The Company considers such litigation customary in the insurance industry. In management s opinion, based on information available at this time, the ultimate resolution of such litigation, which it is vigorously defending, should not be materially adverse to the financial position of the Company. It should be noted that large punitive damage awards, bearing little relation to actual damages sustained by plaintiffs, have been awarded in certain states against other companies in the credit insurance business. At this time, the Company cannot estimate a range of loss that is reasonably possible. 
 
 The Company and its subsidiaries are parties to other legal proceedings in the ordinary course of business. Although the Company s legal and financial liability with respect to such proceedings cannot be estimated with certainty, the Company does not believe that these proceedings, either individually or in the aggregate, are likely to have a material adverse effect on

Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 

Our Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations is presented in this section as follows: 
 
 Overview 
 Results of Operations 
 Non-GAAP Measures and Reconciliations 
 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 
 
 OVERVIEW 
 
 Tiptree allocates capital to select small and middle market companies with the mission of building long-term value. Established in 2007, we have a significant track record investing in the insurance sector and across a variety of other industries, including mortgage, specialty finance and shipping. Our largest operating subsidiary, Fortegra, is a leading provider of specialty insurance products and related services. We also generate earnings from a diverse group of select investments that we refer to as Tiptree Capital, which includes our Mortgage segment and other, non-insurance businesses and assets. We evaluate performance primarily by the comparison of stockholders long-term total return on capital, as measured by growth in stock price plus dividends paid, in addition to Adjusted Net Income. 
 
 Our year-to-date 2024 highlights include: 
 
 Overall: 
 Tiptree reported net income of 33.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 7.1 million in the prior year period, driven by growth in insurance operations. Return on average equity was 10.3 , compared to 2.4 in 2023. 
 Adjusted net income of 72.8 million increased from 48.1 million in 2023, driven by growth in insurance operations. Adjusted return on average equity was 22.1 , as compared to 16.2 in 2023. 
 
 Insurance: 
 Gross written premiums and premium equivalents were 2.2 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, an increase of 192.6 million, or 9.5 , from the prior year period as a result of growth in E S insurance lines in the U.S. and Europe. 
 Net written premiums were 1.1 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, an increase of 14.7 , driven by growth in gross written premiums and increased retention on Fortegra s whole account quota share reinsurance arrangement from 30 to 40 , effective April 1, 2023. 
 Total revenues were 1.5 billion, an increase of 329.8 million, or 28.4 , from 2023, driven by premium growth in specialty E S and admitted insurance lines in the U.S. and Europe. 
 Combined ratio of 90.2 , driven by consistent underwriting performance and the scalability of Fortegra s operating platform. 
 Income before taxes of 135.3 million as compared to 85.6 million in 2023. Return on average equity was 25.1 in 2024 as compared to 22.9 in 2023, with the increases driven by growth in underwriting and fee revenues. 
 Adjusted net income (before NCI) was 114.5 million, an increase of 31.4 million, or 37.8 , from 2023. Adjusted return on average equity was 28.8 , as compared to 30.3 in 2023. 
 Fortegra s total stockholders equity was 606.4 million as of September 30, 2024, compared to 452.6 million as of December 31, 2023, with the increase driven by comprehensive income during the current year period and the aggregate capital contribution from Tiptree, Warburg, and Fortegra independent directors of 40.0 million. 
 
 Tiptree Capital: 
 Mortgage income before taxes was 1.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to loss of 0.9 million in 2023, with the increase driven by higher origination volumes and loan servicing fees.

Key Trends: 
 Our results of operations are affected by a variety of factors including, but not limited to, general economic conditions and GDP growth, market liquidity and volatility, consumer confidence, U.S. demographics, employment and wage growth, business confidence and investment, inflation, interest rates and spreads, the impact of the regulatory environment, and the other factors set forth in Part I, Item 1A in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023. Generally, our businesses are positively affected by a healthy U.S. consumer, stable to gradually rising interest rates, stable markets and business conditions, and global growth and trade flows. Conversely, rising unemployment, volatile markets, rapidly rising interest rates, inflation, changing regulatory requirements and slowing business conditions can have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition. 
 
 Insurance results primarily depend on pricing, underwriting, risk retention and the accuracy of reserves, reinsurance arrangements, returns on invested assets, and policy and contract renewals and run-off. Factors affecting these items, including conditions in financial markets, the global economy and the markets in which we operate, fluctuations in exchange rates, interest rates and inflation, including the current period of inflationary pressures, may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition. Fortegra designs, markets and underwrites specialty property and casualty insurance products for select target markets or niches. The business has historically generated significant fee-based revenues by incorporating value-add coverages and services. Underwriting risk is mitigated through a combination of reinsurance and sliding scale commission structures with agents, distribution partners and/or third-party reinsurers. To mitigate counterparty risk, Fortegra ensures its reinsurance receivables are placed with highly rated and appropriately capitalized counterparties or with our distribution partners captive insurance vehicles which are collateralized with highly liquid investments, cash or letters of credit. While Fortegra s insurance operations have historically maintained a relatively stable combined ratio, initiatives to change the business mix along with these economic factors could generate different results than the business has historically experienced. In particular, inflation can have an impact on replacement costs associated with claims from our customers to the extent we are unable to pass the higher costs of claims through higher premiums. In addition, fluctuations of the U.S. dollar relative to other currencies, including the British pound and Euro, would have an impact on book value between periods. 
 
 Fortegra s investment portfolio includes fixed maturity securities, loans, credit investment funds, and equity securities. Many of those investments are held at fair value. From 2021 to 2023, the U.S. fixed income markets experienced a significant rise in interest rates. Rising interest rates have and could continue to impact the value of Fortegra s fixed maturity securities, with any unrealized losses recorded in equity, and if realized, could impact our results of operations. Offsetting the impact of a rising interest rate environment, new investments in fixed rate instruments from both maturities and portfolio growth have and could continue to result in higher net interest income on investments. The weighted average duration of our fixed income available for sale securities is less than three years. While our asset and liability mix is relatively matched, should we need to liquidate any of these investments before maturity to pay claims, any realized losses could materially negatively impact our results of operations. Changes in fair value for loans, credit investment funds, and equity securities in Fortegra s investment portfolio are reported as unrealized gains or losses in revenues and can be impacted by changes in interest rates, credit risk, currency risk, or market risk, including specific company or industry factors. In addition, our equity holdings are relatively concentrated. General equity market trends, along with company and industry specific factors, can impact the fair value which can result in unrealized gains and losses affecting our results. 
 
 Elevated 10-year treasury yields, and the tapering of the Federal Reserve s purchases of mortgage-backed securities, has resulted in substantial increases in mortgage interest rates. Low mortgage interest rates driven by the Federal Reserve intervention in mortgage markets, and rising home prices in certain markets, provided tailwinds to the mortgage markets in 2020 and 2021, which benefited our mortgage operations and margins. The substantial rise in rates resulted in a sharp reversal of those trends, with volumes and margins declining significantly. Only partially offsetting the declines in mortgage originations is an increase in the fair value of our mortgage servicing portfolio as rising rates slow prepayment speeds, with a resulting increase in servicing income. Continued elevated mortgage rates could have a negative impact on our mortgage operations, and is likely to be only partially mitigated by the improvement in mortgage servicing revenues. A sustained period of negative profitability in the mortgage industry could also impact the availability of funding sources for our mortgage business. 
 
 Rising interest rates can also impact the cost of floating interest rate debt obligations, while declining rates can decrease the cost of debt. Our secured revolving and term credit agreements, preferred trust securities and asset based revolving financing are all floating rate obligations. 

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 
 The following is a summary of our condensed consolidated financial results for the three months ended September 30, 2024 
 48 

and 2023. In addition to GAAP results, management uses the Non-GAAP measures Adjusted net income, Adjusted return on average equity and book value per share as measurements of operating performance. Management believes these measures provide supplemental information useful to investors as they are frequently used by the financial community to analyze financial performance and comparison among companies. 
 
 Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted Return on Average Equity. Adjusted net income is defined as income before taxes, less provision (benefit) for income taxes, and excluding the after-tax impact of various expenses that we consider to be unique and non-recurring in nature, including merger and acquisition related expenses, stock-based compensation, net realized and unrealized gains (losses) and intangibles amortization associated with purchase accounting. The calculation of adjusted net income excludes net realized and unrealized gains (losses) that relate to investments or assets rather than business operations. Adjusted return on average equity represents adjusted net income expressed on an annualized basis as a percentage of average beginning and ending stockholders equity during the period. Management uses Adjusted net income and adjusted return on average equity as part of its capital allocation process and to assess comparative returns on invested capital. We believe adjusted net income provides additional clarity on the results of the Company s underlying business operations as a whole for the periods presented by excluding distortions created by the unpredictability and volatility of realized and unrealized gains (losses). We also believe adjusted net income provides useful supplemental information to investors as it is frequently used by the financial community to analyze financial performance between periods and for comparison among companies. 
 
 Adjusted net income and adjusted return on average equity are not measurements of financial performance or liquidity under GAAP and should not be considered as an alternative or substitute for GAAP net income. See Non-GAAP Reconciliations for a reconciliation of these measures to their GAAP equivalents.

 Revenues 
 
 For the three months ended September 30, 2024, revenues were 494.4 million, which increased 77.8 million, or 18.7 , compared to the prior year period. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, revenues were 1,539.3 million, which increased 336.6 million, or 28.0 , compared to the prior year period. The changes for both periods were primarily driven by growth in earned premiums, net, higher investment income, net realized and unrealized gains, and an increase in other income, including interest income on cash equivalents, compared to the prior year period. 
 
 The table below provides a break down between net realized and unrealized gains and losses from Invesque and other securities which impacted our consolidated results on a pre-tax basis. Many investments are carried at fair value and marked to market through unrealized gains and losses. As a result, we expect earnings related to these investments to be relatively volatile between periods. Fixed income securities are primarily marked to market through AOCI in stockholders equity and do not impact net realized and unrealized gains and losses until they are sold.

Net Income (Loss) Attributable to common stockholders 
 
 For the three months ended September 30, 2024, the net income attributable to common stockholders was 11.9 million, compared to 2.2 million in the prior year period, driven by growth in Fortegra s underwriting and fee income. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the net income attributable to common stockholders was 33.8 million, which increased 26.7 million, compared to the prior year period, driven by growth in Fortegra s underwriting and fee income. 
 
 Adjusted net income Adjusted return on average equity - Non-GAAP 
 
 Adjusted net income for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was 27.9 million, an increase of 10.0 million, or 55.9 , from the three months ended September 30, 2023, driven by growth in our insurance and mortgage operations. For the three months ended September 30, 2024, adjusted return on average equity was 24.8 , as compared to 17.9 for the three months ended September 30, 2023, driven by the increase in adjusted net income. 
 
 Adjusted net income for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 72.8 million, an increase of 24.8 million, or 51.5 , from the nine months ended September 30, 2023, driven by growth in our insurance and mortgage operations. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, adjusted return on average equity was 22.1 , as compared to 16.2 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, driven by the increase in adjusted net income. 
 
 Book Value per share - Non-GAAP 
 
 Total stockholders equity was 656.2 million as of September 30, 2024 compared to 543.6 million as of September 30, 2023, with the increase driven by comprehensive income over the trailing four quarters, partially offset by net changes in non-controlling interests and preferred dividends paid at Fortegra. In the nine months ended September 30, 2024, Tiptree returned 6.6 million to stockholders through dividends paid. 
 
 Book value per share for the period ended September 30, 2024 was 12.56, an increase from book value per share of 10.78 as of September 30, 2023, driven by comprehensive income per share, partially offset by dividends paid of 0.23 per share, net changes in non-controlling interests and preferred dividends paid at Fortegra. 

Results by Segment 
 We classify our business into two reportable segments, Insurance and Mortgage, with the remainder of our operations aggregated into Tiptree Capital - Other. Corporate activities include holding company interest expense, corporate employee compensation and benefits, and other expenses, including public company expenses.

Insurance 
 
 Our principal operating subsidiary, Fortegra, is a specialty insurance underwriter and service provider, which focuses on niche lines and fee-oriented services. The combination of specialty insurance underwriting, service contract products, and related service solutions delivered through a vertically integrated business model creates a blend of traditional underwriting revenues, investment income and unregulated fee revenues. The business is an agent-driven model, distributing products through independent insurance agents, consumer finance companies, online retailers, auto dealers, and regional big box retailers to deliver products that complement the consumer transaction. 
 
 As of September 30, 2024, Fortegra was owned approximately 79.3 by Tiptree, 17.7 by Warburg and 3.0 by management and directors of Fortegra, before giving effect to the exercise of outstanding warrants and management options, and the conversion of outstanding preferred stock. The following tables and discussion present the Insurance segment results, including non-controlling interests, for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. 
 
 Components of our Results of Operations 
 
 Revenues 
 
 Earned Premiums, net represents the earned portion of gross written and assumed premiums, less the earned portion that is ceded to third-party reinsurers under reinsurance agreements. Fortegra s insurance policies generally have a term of six months to seven years depending on the underlying product and premiums are earned pro rata over the term of the policy. At the end of each reporting period, premiums written but not earned are classified as unearned premiums and are earned in subsequent periods over the remaining term of the policy. 
 
 Service and Administrative Fees represent the earned portion of gross written premiums and premium equivalents, which is generated from non-insurance products including warranty service contracts, motor club contracts and other services offered as part of Fortegra s vertically integrated product offerings. Such fees are typically positively correlated with transaction volume and are recognized as revenue when realized and earned. At the end of each reporting period, gross written premiums and premium equivalents written for service contracts not earned are classified as deferred revenue, which are earned in subsequent periods over the remaining term of the policy. 
 
 51 

Ceding Commissions and Other Revenue consists of commissions earned on policies written on behalf of third-party insurance companies with no exposure to the insured risk and certain fees earned in conjunction with underwriting policies. Other revenue also includes the interest income earned on cash equivalents and premium finance product offerings. 
 
 Net Investment Income represents earned investment income on our portfolio of invested assets. Our invested assets are primarily comprised of fixed maturity securities, and may also include cash and cash equivalents and equity securities. The principal factors that influence net investment income are the size of our investment portfolio, the yield on that portfolio and expense due to external investment managers. The insurance investment portfolio includes investments held in statutory insurance companies and in unregulated entities. The portfolios held in statutory insurance companies are subject to different regulatory considerations, including with respect to types of assets, concentration limits, affiliate transactions and the use of leverage. 
 
 Net Realized and Unrealized Gains (Losses) on investments are a function of the difference between the amount received by us on the sale of a security and the security s cost-basis, as well as any other-than-temporary impairments and allowances for credit losses which are recognized in earnings. In addition, equity securities and certain other investments are carried at fair value with unrealized gains and losses included in this line. Fortegra s investment strategy is designed to achieve attractive risk-adjusted returns across select asset classes, sectors and geographies while maintaining adequate liquidity to meet claims payment obligations. As such, volatility from realized and unrealized gains and losses may impact period-over-period performance. Unrealized gains and losses on equity securities and loans held at fair value impact current period net income, while unrealized gains and losses on AFS securities impact AOCI. 
 
 Expenses 
 
 Net Losses and Loss Adjustment Expenses represent actual insurance claims paid, changes in unpaid claim reserves, net of amounts ceded and the costs of administering claims for insurance lines. Incurred claims are impacted by loss frequency, which is a measure of the number of claims per unit of insured exposure, and loss severity, which is based on the average size of claims. Factors affecting loss frequency and loss severity include the volume of underwritten contracts, changes in claims reporting patterns, claims settlement patterns, judicial decisions, economic conditions, morbidity patterns and the attitudes of claimants towards settlements, and original pricing of the product for purposes of the loss ratio in relation to loss emergence over time. Losses and loss adjustment expenses are based on an actuarial analysis of the estimated losses, including losses incurred during the period and changes in estimates from prior periods. 
 
 Member Benefit Claims represent the costs of services and replacement devices incurred in warranty and motor club service contracts. Member benefit claims represent claims paid on behalf of contract holders directly to third-party providers for roadside assistance and for the repair or replacement of covered products. Claims can also be paid directly to contract holders as a reimbursement payment, provided supporting documentation of loss is submitted to the Company. Claims are recognized as expense when incurred. 
 
 Commission Expenses reflect commissions paid to retail agents, third party administrators and managing general underwriters, net of ceding commissions received on business ceded under certain reinsurance contracts. Commission expenses are deferred and amortized to expense in proportion to the premium earned over the policy life. Commission expense is incurred on most product lines. The majority of commissions are retrospective commissions paid to agents, distributors and retailers selling the Company s products, including credit insurance policies, warranty service contracts and motor club memberships. When claims increase, in most cases distribution partners bear the risk through a reduction in their retrospective commissions. Commission rates are, in many cases, set by state regulators, such as in credit and collateral protection programs and are also impacted by market conditions and the retention levels of distribution partners. 
 
 Operating and Other Expenses represent the general and administrative expenses of insurance operations including employee compensation and benefits and other expenses, including, technology costs, office rent, and professional services fees, such as legal, accounting and actuarial services. 
 
 Interest Expense consists primarily of interest expense on corporate revolving debt, notes, preferred trust securities due June 15, 2037 (Preferred Trust Securities) and asset based debt for premium finance and warranty service contract financing, which is non-recourse to Fortegra. 
 
 Depreciation Expense is primarily associated with furniture, fixtures and equipment. Amortization Expense is primarily associated with purchase accounting amortization including values associated with acquired customer relationships, trade names and internally developed software and technology. 
 
 Key Performance Metrics 
 
 We discuss certain key performance metrics, described below, which provide useful information about our business and the operational factors underlying its financial performance. 
 52 

Gross written premiums and premium equivalents represent total gross written premiums from insurance policies and warranty service contracts issued, as well as premium finance volumes during a reporting period. They represent the volume of insurance policies written or assumed and warranty service contracts issued during a specific period of time without reduction for policy acquisition costs, reinsurance costs or other deductions. Gross written premiums is a volume measure commonly used in the insurance industry to compare sales performance by period. Premium equivalents are used to compare sales performance of warranty service and administrative contract volumes to gross written premiums. Similar to how management considers gross written premiums to be a relevant measure of volume, regardless of the impact of reinsurance on net earned premiums, management considers premium equivalents to be a relevant measure of contract volume, regardless of whether the Company retains the full obligation. Investors also use these measures to compare sales growth among comparable companies, while management uses these measures to evaluate the relative performance of various sales channels. 
 
 Combined Ratio, Loss Ratio, Acquisition Ratio, Underwriting Ratio and Operating Expense Ratio 
 
 Combined ratio is an operating measure, which equals the sum of the underwriting ratio and the operating expense ratio. Loss ratio is the ratio of the GAAP line items net losses and loss adjustment expenses and member benefit claims to earned premiums, net, service and administrative fees (excluding ceding fees), and other revenue (excluding cash and cash equivalent interest income). Acquisition ratio is the ratio of the GAAP line items commission expense (less ceding fees and ceding commissions) to earned premiums, net, service and administrative fees (excluding ceding fees), and other revenue (excluding cash and cash equivalent interest income). Underwriting ratio is the combination of the loss ratio and the acquisition ratio. Operating expense ratio is the ratio of the GAAP line items employee compensation and benefits and other expenses to earned premiums, net, service and administrative fees (excluding ceding fees) and other revenue (excluding cash and cash equivalent interest income). 
 
 A combined ratio under 100 generally indicates an underwriting profit. A combined ratio over 100 generally indicates an underwriting loss. These ratios are commonly used in the insurance industry as a measure of underwriting profitability, excluding earnings on the insurance portfolio. Investors commonly use these measures to compare underwriting performance among companies separate from the performance of the investment portfolio. Management uses these measures to compare the profitability of various products we underwrite as well as profitability among our various agents and sales channels. 
 
 Return on average equity is expressed as the ratio of net income to average stockholders equity during the period. Management uses this ratio as a measure of the on-going performance of the totality of the Company s operations. 
 
 Non-GAAP Financial Measures 
 
 Underwriting and Fee Revenues and Underwriting and Fee Margin - In order to better explain to investors the underwriting performance of the Company s programs and the respective retentions between the Company and its agents and reinsurance partners, we use the non-GAAP metrics underwriting and fee revenues and underwriting and fee margin. We generally manage our exposure to the risks we underwrite using both reinsurance (e.g., quota share and excess of loss) and sliding scale commission agreements with our agents (e.g., commissions paid are adjusted based on the actual underlying losses incurred), which mitigates our risk. Generally, when losses are incurred, the risk which is retained by our agents and reinsurers is reflected in a reduction in commissions paid. 
 
 Underwriting and fee revenues represents earned premiums, net, service and administrative fees (excluding ceding fees) and other income (excluding cash and cash equivalent interest income). We reconcile underwriting and fee revenues as total revenues excluding net investment income, net realized gains (losses) and net unrealized gains (losses), ceding fees, ceding commissions and cash and cash equivalent interest income as reported in other income. 
 
 Underwriting and fee margin represents income before taxes excluding net investment income, net realized gains (losses), net unrealized gains (losses), cash and cash equivalent interest income, employee compensation and benefits, other expenses, interest expense and depreciation and amortization. We deliver our products and services on a vertically integrated basis to our agents. As such, underwriting and fee margin exclude general and administrative expenses, interest income, depreciation and amortization and other corporate expenses, including income taxes, as these corporate expenses support our vertically integrated delivery model and are not specifically supporting any individual business line. 
 
 Adjusted net income represents income before taxes, less provision (benefit) for income taxes, and excluding the after-tax impact of various expenses that we consider to be unique and non-recurring in nature, including merger and acquisition related expenses, stock-based compensation, net realized and unrealized gains (losses), and intangibles amortization associated with purchase accounting. 
 
 53 

Adjusted return on average equity represents adjusted net income expressed on an annualized basis as a percentage of average beginning and ending stockholders equity during the period.

 Revenues - Three Months Ended September 30, 2024 compared to 2023 
 
 For the three months ended September 30, 2024, total revenues increased 18.2 , to 481.0 million, as compared to 406.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. Earned premiums, net of 359.5 million increased 68.2 million, or 23.4 , driven by growth in E S and specialty admitted insurance lines. Earned premiums assumed from other insurance companies were 129.5 million, or 36.0 of the total, compared to 78.6 million, or 27.0 of the total, in the prior year period. Included in the current period were earned premiums associated with the book-roll transaction with one of Fortegra s MGA partners that was assumed in December 2023. As it expands to new geographies and expands product offerings, the Company works to obtain necessary licenses and intends to write this business directly upon obtaining necessary licenses. The Company views direct written and assumed business as having similar characteristics. Service and administrative fees of 95.4 million decreased by 4.8 driven primarily by a decline in vehicle service contract revenues in Europe. Ceding commissions of 3.7 million increased by 1.3 million, or 52.3 . Other revenues increased by 2.0 million, or 22.1 , driven by growth in interest income on cash equivalents and premium finance product offerings. 
 54 

For the three months ended September 30, 2024, 22.9 of revenues were derived from fees that were not solely dependent upon the underwriting performance of Fortegra s insurance products, resulting in more diversified earnings. For the three months ended September 30, 2024, 81.2 of fee-based revenues were generated in non-regulated service companies, with the remainder in regulated insurance companies. 
 
 For the three months ended September 30, 2024, net investment income was 9.1 million as compared to 5.4 million in the prior year period, an increase of 3.7 million driven by increased yields on investments. Net realized and unrealized gains were 2.2 million, an improvement of 3.8 million, as compared to net realized and unrealized losses of 1.6 million in the prior year period, primarily driven by the change in fair value of certain equity and other investments carried at fair value. Unrealized gains on AFS securities impacting OCI for the three months ended September 30, 2024 were 21.7 million, driven by the decrease in interest rates (interest rate yields and bonds prices are inversely related) and corresponding impact to the fair value of investments. 
 
 Expenses - Three Months Ended September 30, 2024 compared to 2023 
 
 For the three months ended September 30, 2024, net losses and loss adjustment expenses were 175.9 million, member benefit claims were 27.5 million and commission expense was 154.0 million, as compared to 125.1 million, 28.8 million, and 153.7 million, respectively, for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in net losses and loss adjustment expenses of 50.8 million, or 40.6 , was driven by growth in U.S. and European insurance lines and the shift in business mix toward commercial lines, which tend to have higher loss ratios and lower commission and expense ratios. In addition, the Company experienced unfavorable prior year development of 1.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, driven by higher-than-expected claims in our commercial lines of business. The decrease in member benefit claims of 1.3 million, or 4.6 , was driven by declines in auto and consumer goods claim frequencies. Commission expenses increased by 0.3 million, or 0.2 , driven by growth in earned premiums, partially offset by impacts from sliding scale commission structures. 
 
 For the three months ended September 30, 2024, employee compensation and benefits were 37.9 million and other expenses were 26.3 million, as compared to 31.0 million and 20.3 million, respectively, for the three months ended September 30, 2023. Employee compensation and benefits increased by 6.9 million, or 22.3 , driven by investments in human capital associated with growth in E S, admitted and services lines. Other expenses increased by 6.0 million, or 29.8 , driven by a change in fair value of the Fortegra Additional Warrant liability of 0.9 million, and increased marketing and information technology expenses. 
 
 For the three months ended September 30, 2024, interest expense was 7.2 million as compared to 6.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in interest expense of 0.9 million, or 14.6 , was primarily driven by increased borrowings on Fortegra s corporate revolver and asset based debt for premium finance lines. 
 
 For the three months ended September 30, 2024, depreciation and amortization expense was 5.0 million, including 3.9 million of intangible amortization related to purchase accounting associated with acquisitions at Fortegra from 2019 to 2023, as compared to 5.8 million, including 4.9 million of intangible amortization from purchase accounting in 2023.

 (1) The total gross written premiums and premium equivalents of 776.8 million and 686.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, were comprised of gross written premiums of 573.0 million and 522.1 million, plus assumed premiums of 108.0 million and 75.8 million, plus gross service and administrative fee additions of 95.8 million and 88.7 million, respectively. See Note (7) Reinsurance Recoverable and Prepaid Reinsurance Premiums and Note (13) Revenue from Contracts with Customers within the respective periods for more information. 
 
 (2) The premium equivalents metric excludes amounts received from failure to perform vehicle service contracts held in off-balance sheet trusts and premium finance volumes as it was determined to be unlikely these amounts will be recognized as revenue. The three months ended September 30, 2023 has been conformed resulting in a reduction of premium equivalents of 148.0 million. This change only impacted the premium equivalents metric and did not impact the Company s condensed consolidated financial statements. 
 
 Total gross written premiums and premium equivalents for the three months ended September 30, 2024 were 776.8 million, representing an increase of 90.3 million, or 13.2 . The increase was driven by a combination of factors including expanding Fortegra s distribution partner network and growing E S insurance lines. 
 
 For the three months ended September 30, 2024, Insurance increased by 83.2 million, or 13.9 , driven by growth in commercial E S lines, partially offset by a decline in personal credit and auto lines. For the three months ended September 30, 2024, Services increased by 7.1 million, or 8.0 , driven by growth in auto and consumer goods service contracts. 
 
 The growth in gross written premiums and premium equivalents, combined with higher retention in select products as of September 30, 2024, has resulted in an increase of 117.1 million, or 5.1 , in unearned premiums and deferred revenue on the condensed consolidated balance sheets as compared to September 30, 2023. As of September 30, 2024, unearned premiums and deferred revenues were 2.4 billion, as compared to 2.3 billion as of September 30, 2023.

 Net written premiums for the three months ended September 30, 2024 were 389.3 million, representing an increase of 55.4 million, or 16.6 , consistent with growth in gross written premiums, and as a result of increased retention on Fortegra s whole account quota share reinsurance arrangement. For the three months ended September 30, 2024, Net written premiums 
 56 

from commercial lines increased by 72.8 million, or 26.7 , driven by growth in E S and specialty admitted business. For the three months ended September 30, 2024, net written premiums from personal lines decreased by 17.4 million, or 28.6 , driven by declines in personal credit and auto insurance lines. Net written premiums from property and short-tail lines represented 152.0 million, or 39.1 , of the total net written premiums for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 73.9 million, or 22.1 , for the prior year period. Property and short-tail net written premiums were diversified by geographic location, exposure and risk type with substantial reinsurance protection. As of September 30, 2024, the net loss to the Company in a 1-in-250 year catastrophe event represented approximately 2.4 of Fortegra s stockholders equity. This reported loss includes the impact of incurred losses based on the estimated frequency and severity of potential events, reinstatements premiums, reinsurance recoveries and taxes. 
 
 Combined Ratio 
 
 The combined ratio was 90.2 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, reflecting the consistent underwriting performance and scalability of the Company s operating platform. The underwriting ratio was 76.2 , a decrease of 0.2 percentage points from the prior year period, which consists of a loss ratio of 45.1 , compared to 39.8 in the prior year period, and an acquisition ratio of 31.1 , compared to 36.6 in the prior year period. The increase in loss ratio was driven by changes in business mix towards commercial lines and increases in repair and labor costs on vehicle service contracts compared to prior year period, which was more than offset by the decline in acquisition ratio as a result of swing rate commission structures. The operating expense ratio increased 0.2 percentage points to 14.0 , as compared to 13.8 in the prior year period.

Included in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 were earned premiums associated with the book-roll transaction with one of Fortegra s MGA partners that was assumed in December 2023. As it expands to new geographies and expands product offerings, the Company works to obtain necessary licenses and intends to write this business directly upon obtaining necessary licenses. The Company views direct written and assumed business as having similar characteristics. Service and administrative fees of 311.7 million increased by 7.4 driven by growth in warranty and consumer goods service contract revenues. Ceding commissions of 11.5 million increased by 0.8 million, or 7.1 . Other revenues increased by 8.0 million, or 34.0 , driven by growth in interest income on cash equivalents and premium finance product offerings. 
 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, 23.8 of revenues were derived from fees that were not solely dependent upon the underwriting performance of Fortegra s insurance products, resulting in more diversified earnings. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, 79.8 of fee-based revenues were generated in non-regulated service companies, with the remainder in regulated insurance companies.

Expenses - Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 compared to 2023 
 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, net losses and loss adjustment expenses were 556.6 million, member benefit claims were 88.5 million and commission expense was 484.2 million, as compared to 354.5 million, 88.9 million, and 442.9 million respectively, for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in net losses and loss adjustment expenses of 202.1 million, or 57.0 , was driven by growth in U.S. and European Insurance lines and the shift in business mix toward commercial lines, which tend to have a higher loss ratios and lower commission ratios. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company experienced unfavorable prior year development of 0.6 million primarily as a result of higher-than-expected claims in its commercial lines of business. In the nine months ended September 30, 2023, the Company experienced unfavorable prior year development of 0.9 million primarily driven by higher-than-expected claim severity from business written by a small group of producers of our personal and commercial lines of business. The decrease in member benefit claims of 0.4 million, or 0.4 , was driven by declines in auto and consumer goods claim frequencies. Commission expense increased by 41.3 million, or 9.3 , in line with the growth in earned premiums, net and service and administrative fees, partially offset by impacts from sliding scale commission structures.

Tiptree Capital 
 
 Tiptree Capital consists of our Mortgage segment, which includes the operating results of Reliance, our mortgage business, and Tiptree Capital - Other, which consists of our other non-insurance operating businesses and investments. 
 
 Mortgage 
 
 Through our Mortgage operating subsidiary, Reliance, we originate, sell, securitize and service one-to-four-family, residential mortgage loans, comprised of conforming mortgage loans, Federal Housing Administration FHA ), Veterans Administration VA ), United States Department of Agriculture USDA ), and to a lesser extent, non-agency jumbo prime. 
 
 We are an approved seller/servicer for Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. We are also an approved issuer and servicer for Ginnie Mae. We originate residential mortgage loans through our retail distribution channel (directly to consumers) in 39 states and the District of Columbia as of September 30, 2024. 
 
 Components of our Results of Operations 
 
 Revenues 
 
 Net Realized and Unrealized Gains (Losses) include gains on sale of mortgage loans and the fair value adjustment in mortgage servicing rights. Gains on the sale of mortgage loans represent the difference between the selling price and carrying value of loans sold and are recognized upon settlement. Such gains also include the changes in fair value of loans held for sale and loan-related hedges and derivatives. We transfer the risk of loss or default to the loan purchaser, however, in some cases we are required to indemnify purchasers for losses related to non-compliance with borrowers creditworthiness and collateral requirements. Because of this, we recognize gains on sale net of required indemnification and premium recapture reserves. The fair value adjustment on mortgage servicing rights represents fair value adjustments considering estimated prepayments and other factors associated with changes in interest rates, plus actual run-off in the servicing portfolio. We report these adjustments separate from servicing income and servicing expense. 
 
 Other Revenue includes loan origination fees, interest income, and mortgage servicing income. Loan origination fees are earned as mortgage loans are funded. Servicing fees are earned over the life of the loan. Interest income includes interest earned on loans held for sale and interest income on bank balances and short-term investments. 
 
 Expenses 
 
 Employee Compensation and Benefits includes salaries, commissions, benefits, bonuses, other incentive compensation and related taxes for employees. Commissions expense for sales staff generally varies with loan origination volumes. 
 
 Interest Expense represents borrowing costs under warehouse and other credit facilities used primarily to fund loan originations. Amortization of deferred financing costs, including commitment fees, is included in interest expense. 
 
 Depreciation is mainly associated with furniture, fixtures and equipment. Amortization is primarily associated with a trade name and internally developed software. 
 
 Other Expenses include loan origination expenses, namely, leads, appraisals, credit reporting and licensing fees, general and administrative expenses, including office rent, insurance, legal, consulting and payroll processing expenses, and servicing expense.

Provision for Income Taxes 
 
 The total income tax expense of 16.3 million and 12.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, is reflected as a component of net income (loss). For the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the Company s effective tax rate was equal to 44.4 and 58.0 , respectively, with both significantly higher than the U.S. statutory income tax rate of 21.0 , primarily due to the impact of outside basis deferred taxes on Tiptree s investment in Fortegra. 
 
 The total income tax expense of 48.8 million and 29.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, is reflected as a component of net income (loss).

NON-GAAP MEASURES AND RECONCILIATIONS 
 
 Non-GAAP Reconciliations 
 
 In addition to GAAP results, management uses the non-GAAP financial measures underwriting and fee revenues and underwriting and fee margin in order to better explain to investors the underwriting performance and the respective retentions between the Company and its agents and reinsurance partners. We also use the non-GAAP financial measures adjusted net income and adjusted return on average equity as measures of operating performance and as part of our resource and capital allocation process, to assess comparative returns on invested capital. Management believes these measures provide supplemental information useful to investors as they are frequently used by the financial community to analyze financial performance and to compare relative performance among comparable companies. Adjusted net income, adjusted return on average equity, underwriting and fee revenues and underwriting and fee margin are not measurements of financial performance or liquidity under GAAP and should not be considered as an alternative or substitute for earned premiums, net income or any other measure derived in accordance with GAAP. 
 
 Underwriting and Fee Revenues and Underwriting and Fee Margin Non-GAAP (Insurance only) 
 
 Underwriting and Fee Revenues Non-GAAP We define underwriting and fee revenues as earned premiums, net, service and administrative fees (excluding ceding fees) and other income (excluding cash and cash equivalent interest income). We reconcile underwriting and fee revenues as total revenues excluding net investment income, net realized gains (losses) and net unrealized gains (losses), ceding fees, ceding commissions and cash and cash equivalent interest income as reported in other income. Underwriting and fee revenues represents revenues generated by our underwriting and fee-based operations and allows us to evaluate our underwriting performance without regard to investment income. We use this metric as we believe it gives our management and other users of our financial information useful insight into our underlying business performance. Underwriting and fee revenues should not be viewed as a substitute for total revenues calculated in accordance with GAAP, and other companies may define underwriting and fee revenues differently.

 (2) Cash and cash equivalent interest income was included in other revenue on the statement of operations. 
 (3) Underwriting and fee revenues exclude ceding fees, ceding commissions and cash and cash equivalent interest income from other revenue. 
 
 Underwriting and Fee Margin Non-GAAP We define underwriting and fee margin as income before taxes, excluding net investment income, net realized gains (losses), net unrealized gains (losses), cash and cash equivalent interest income, employee compensation and benefits, other expenses, interest expense and depreciation and amortization. Underwriting and fee margin represents the underwriting performance of our underwriting and fee-based programs. As such, underwriting and fee margin excludes general administrative expenses, interest expense, depreciation and amortization and other corporate expenses as those expenses support the vertically integrated business model and not any individual component of our business mix. We use this metric as we believe it gives our management and other users of our financial information useful insight into the specific performance of our underlying underwriting and fee programs. Underwriting and fee income should not be viewed as a substitute for income before taxes calculated in accordance with GAAP, and other companies may define underwriting and fee margin differently.

 (1) Cash and cash equivalent interest income was included in other revenue on the statement of operations. 
 (2) Underwriting and fee margin exclude cash and cash equivalent interest income. 
 
 Adjusted Net Income Non-GAAP 
 
 We define adjusted net income as income before taxes, less provision (benefit) for income taxes, and excluding the after-tax impact of various expenses that we consider to be unique and non-recurring in nature, including merger and acquisition related expenses, stock-based compensation, net realized and unrealized gains (losses) and intangibles amortization associated with purchase accounting, all of which is reduced for non-controlling interests. The calculation of adjusted net income excludes net realized and unrealized gains (losses) that relate to investments or assets rather than business operations. Adjusted net income should not be viewed as a substitute for income before taxes calculated in accordance with GAAP, and other companies may define adjusted net income differently. Adjusted net income (before NCI) is presented before the impacts of non-controlling interests. 
 
 We present adjustments for amortization associated with acquired intangible assets. The intangible assets were recorded as part of purchase accounting in connection with Tiptree s acquisition of Fortegra Financial in 2014, and additional services businesses from 2019 to 2023. The intangible assets acquired contribute to overall revenue generation, and the respective purchase accounting adjustments will continue to occur in future periods until such intangible assets are fully amortized in accordance with the respective amortization periods required by GAAP. 
 
 Adjusted Return on Average Equity Non-GAAP 
 
 We define adjusted return on average equity as adjusted net income expressed on an annualized basis as a percentage of average beginning and ending stockholders equity during the period. See Adjusted Net Income Non-GAAP above. Adjusted return on average equity should not be viewed as a substitute for return on average equity calculated in accordance with GAAP, and other companies may define adjusted return on average equity differently.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES 
 
 Our principal sources of liquidity are unrestricted cash, cash equivalents and other liquid investments and distributions from operating subsidiaries, including income from our investment portfolio and sales of assets and investments. We intend to use our cash resources to continue to fund our operations and grow our businesses. We may seek additional sources of cash to fund acquisitions or investments. These additional sources of cash may take the form of debt or equity and may be at the parent, subsidiary or asset level. We are a holding company, and our liquidity needs are primarily for compensation, professional fees, office rent and insurance costs. 
 
 71 

Our subsidiaries ability to generate sufficient net income and cash flows to make cash distributions will be subject to numerous business and other factors, including restrictions contained in agreements for the strategic investment by Warburg in Fortegra, our subsidiaries financing agreements, regulatory restrictions, availability of sufficient funds at such subsidiaries, general economic and business conditions, tax considerations, strategic plans, financial results and other factors such as target capital ratios and ratio levels anticipated by rating agencies to maintain or improve current ratings. We expect our cash and cash equivalents and distributions from operating subsidiaries, our subsidiaries access to financing, and sales of investments to be adequate to fund our operations for at least the next 12 months, as well as the long term. 
 
 As of September 30, 2024, cash and cash equivalents, excluding restricted cash, were 396.2 million, compared to 468.7 million as of December 31, 2023, a decrease of 72.5 million, primarily driven by the increase in investments, repayment of corporate debt, partially offset by cash flow from operations at our insurance business. 
 
 Our insurance business uses borrowings to fund long-term growth and for operational working capital purposes. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, a total of 100.0 million and 130.0 million, respectively, was outstanding under the revolving line of credit in our insurance business. The maximum borrowing capacity under the agreements as of September 30, 2024 and 2023 was 200.0 million. 
 
 Our mortgage business relies on short term uncommitted sources of financing as a part of their normal course of operations. To date, we have been able to obtain and renew uncommitted warehouse credit facilities. If we were not able to obtain financing, then we may need to draw on other sources of liquidity to fund our mortgage business. See Note (10) Debt, net in the notes to our condensed consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding our insurance and mortgage borrowings. 
 
 We believe that cash flow from operations will provide sufficient capital to continue to grow the business and fund interest on the outstanding debt, capital expenditures and other general corporate needs over the next several years. As we continue to expand our business, including by any acquisitions we may make, we may, in the future, require additional working capital for increased costs.
