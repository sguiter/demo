Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements 
 Certain statements contained in this Form 10-Q may be considered forward-looking statements as that term is defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. The forward-looking statements contained herein are subject to known and unknown risks, uncertainties, assumptions and other factors that may cause our actual results, performance or achievements to be materially different from those expressed or implied by any such forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, statements that refer to projections, forecasts or other characterizations of future events or circumstances, including any underlying assumptions. The words anticipate, believe, continue, could, estimate, expect, intends, may, might, plan, possible, potential, predict, project, should, would and similar expressions may identify forward-looking statements, but the absence of these words does not mean that a statement is not forward looking. Forward-looking statements may include, for example, statements about: our future financial performance; our plans for expansion and acquisitions; and changes in our strategy, future operations, financial position, estimated revenues, income or loss, projected costs, prospects, plans and objectives of management. 
 These forward-looking statements are based on current information available, and current expectations, forecasts and assumptions, and involve a number of judgments, risks and uncertainties. Accordingly, forward-looking statements should not be relied upon as representing the Company s views as of any subsequent date, and we do not undertake any obligation to update forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances after the date they were made, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, except as may be required under applicable securities laws. As a result of a number of known and unknown risks and uncertainties, actual results or performance may be materially different from those expressed or implied by these forward-looking statements. 
 Some factors that could cause actual results to differ include, but are not limited to: 
 supply chain disruptions, inflationary pressures resulting from supply chain disruptions or a tightening labor market; 

negative impacts on customer payment policies and adverse banking and governmental regulations, resulting in a potential reduction to the fair value of our assets; 

the performance and financial viability of key suppliers, contractors, customers and financing sources; 

economic, industry, business and political conditions including their effects on governmental policy and government actions that disrupt our supply chain or sales channels; 

fluctuations in interest rates; 

the demand and market price for our equipment and product support; 

collective bargaining agreements and our relationship with our union-represented employees;	 

our success in identifying acquisition targets and integrating acquisitions; 

our success in expanding into and doing business in additional markets; 

our ability to raise capital at favorable terms; 

the competitive environment for our products and services; 

our ability to continue to innovate and develop new business lines; 

our ability to attract and retain key personnel, including, but not limited to, skilled technicians; 

our ability to maintain our listing on the New York Stock Exchange NYSE 

the impact of cyber or other security threats or other disruptions to our businesses; 

our ability to realize the anticipated benefits of acquisitions or divestitures, rental fleet and other organic investments or internal reorganizations; 

federal, state and local government budget uncertainty, especially as it relates to infrastructure projects and taxation; 

currency risks and other risks associated with international operations; and 

other risks and uncertainties identified in the section entitled Risk Factors in our annual report on Form 10-K and other filings with the United States ("U.S.") Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC ). 

2 

For a discussion identifying additional important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated in the forward-looking statements, see our filings with the SEC including, but not limited to, Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and Risk Factors in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, and in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. The foregoing list of factors is not exclusive and undue reliance should not be placed upon any forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date made.

The Company believes that the disaggregation of revenues from contracts with customers as summarized above, together with the discussion below, depicts how the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of our revenues and cash flows are affected by economic factors. See Note 16, Segments, for further information. Leases revenues (Topic 842) Rental revenues: Owned equipment rentals represent revenues from renting equipment. The Company accounts for these rental contracts as operating leases. The Company recognizes revenues from equipment rentals in the period earned, regardless of the timing of billing to customers. A rental contract includes rates for daily, weekly, or monthly use, and rental revenues are earned on a daily basis as rental contracts remain outstanding. Because the rental contracts can extend across multiple reporting periods, the Company records unbilled rental revenues and deferred rental revenues at the end of each reporting period. Unbilled rental revenues are included as a component of "Accounts receivable, net" on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. Rental equipment may also be purchased outright Rental equipment sales by our customers. Rental revenues and revenues attributable to rental equipment sales are recognized in "Rental revenues" and "Rental equipment sales" on the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations, respectively. Revenues from contracts with customers (Topic 606) Accounting for the different types of revenues pursuant to Topic 606 is discussed below. The Company s revenues under Topic 606 are primarily recognized at a point in time rather than over time. New and used equipment sales: With the exception of bill-and-hold arrangements and project-based revenues, the Company s revenues from the sale of new and used equipment are recognized at the time of delivery to, or pick-up by, the customer, which is when the customer obtains control of the promised good(s). Under bill-and-hold arrangements, revenues are recognized when all configuration work is complete and the equipment has been set aside for final shipment, at which point the Company has determined control has been transferred. The bill-and-hold arrangements primarily apply to sales when physical shipment of heavy equipment to the customer is prohibited by law (e.g., frost laws) or requested by the customer due to their inability to arrange freight simultaneous to the satisfaction of the performance obligations. The customer equipment sold under a bill-and-hold arrangement is physically separated from Company inventory and that equipment cannot be used by the Company or sold to another customer. Revenues recognized from bill-and-hold agreements totaled million and million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and million and million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The Company does not offer material rights of return. Project-based revenues, as referred to herein, are contracts with customers where the Company provides design and build solutions related to automated equipment installation and warehouse management systems integration. These revenues are recognized as the performance obligations are satisfied over time using the cost-to-cost input method, based on contract costs incurred to date to total estimated contract costs. The Company recognizes deferred revenue with respect to project-based services. The Company recognized million and million in project-based revenues for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 respectively, and million and million in project-based revenues for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Parts sales: Revenues from the sale of parts are recognized at the time of pick-up by the customer for over-the-counter sales transactions and at the time such services are completed for parts associated with periodic maintenance services. For parts that are shipped to a customer, the Company has elected to use a practical expedient of Topic 606 and treat such shipping activities as fulfillment costs, thereby recognizing revenues at the time of shipment, which is when the customer obtains control. Service revenues: The Company records service revenues primarily from guaranteed maintenance contracts and periodic services with customers. The Company recognizes periodic maintenance service revenues at the time such services are completed. The Company recognizes guaranteed maintenance contract revenues over time based on an estimated rate at which the services are provided over the life of the contract, typically three to . Revenues recognized from guaranteed maintenance contracts totaled million and million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and million and million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The Company also records service revenues from warranty contracts whereby the Company performs service on behalf of an Original Equipment Manufacturer OEM or third-party warranty provider.

amount has been accrued on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. Legal Proceedings During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, various claims and lawsuits, incidental to the ordinary course of our business, were pending against the Company. In the opinion of management, after consultation with legal counsel, resolution of these matters, net of expected insurance proceeds, is not expected to have a material effect on the Company s condensed consolidated financial statements. Contractual Obligations The Company does not believe there are any off-balance sheet arrangements that have, or are reasonably likely to have, a material effect on the Company.

For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, the income tax expense was primarily attributable to the Company, after considering updated information, including the filing of the fiscal 2023 federal income tax return, recording a valuation allowance against a portion of the deferred tax asset relating to U.S. disallowed interest expense carryforwards created by the provisions of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2018 ("TCJA"). During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, the income tax benefit was primarily attributable to the release of the valuation allowance on certain U.S. federal and state deferred tax assets. We regularly assess the need for a valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets. In making that assessment, we consider both positive and negative evidence related to the likelihood of realization of the deferred tax assets as well as the nature of the deferred tax attribute to determine, based on the weight of available evidence, whether it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. We will continue to monitor the need for a valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets on a quarterly basis. The effective tax rate for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was and , respectively. The effective income tax rate in both periods is primarily the result of the discrete items noted above.

Employee Stock Purchase Plan (ESPP) On June 8, 2023 the Company filed a Form S-8 to register common stock shares, the total shares reserved for the ESPP. The Company then opened enrollment for the first offering period that started July 1, 2023 and continued through December 31, 2023. There are two six-month offering periods each year starting January 1 and July 1, with the purchase date on the last business day of each offering period. Under the ESPP, eligible employees (as defined in the ESPP) can purchase the Company s common stock through accumulated payroll deductions. Eligible employees may purchase the Company s common stock at of the lower of the fair market value of the Company s common stock on the first or last business day of each six-month offering period. Eligible employees may contribute up to of their eligible compensation. Under the ESPP, a participant may not accrue rights to purchase more than worth of the Company s common stock for each calendar year in which such right is outstanding. Employees who elect to participate in the ESPP commence payroll withholdings that accumulate through the end of the respective period. In accordance with the guidance in Topic 718-50 Compensation Stock Compensation , the ability to purchase shares of the Company s common stock for of the lower of the price on the first or last day of the offering period (i.e. the purchase date) represents an option and, therefore, the ESPP is a compensatory plan. Accordingly, stock-based compensation expense is determined based on the option s grant-date fair value and is recognized over the withholding period. The stock-based compensation expense related to the ESPP recognized during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023.was not material. ESPP employee payroll contributions accrued as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 totaled million and million, respectively, and are included within "Accrued expenses" in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. Cash withheld via employee payroll deductions is presented in financing activities within "Other financing activities" in the Condensed Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows.

Derivative Financial Instruments In the normal course of business, we are exposed to market risks associated with changes in foreign currency exchange rates, commodity prices and interest rates. To manage a portion of these inherent risks, we may purchase certain types of derivative financial instruments based on management's judgment of the trade-off between risk, opportunity, and cost. We do not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes. The impact of hedge ineffectiveness for those derivatives where hedge accounting is applied was not significant in any of the periods presented. The Company has determined the fair value of all our derivative contracts are based on Level 2 inputs such as quoted market prices for similar instruments from third parties and inputs other than quoted prices that are observable (forward curves, implied volatility, counterparty credit risks). The Company reviews counterparty credit risks at regular intervals and has not experienced any significant credit loss as a result of counterparty nonperformance in the past. Interest Rate Cap We entered into an interest rate cap to protect cash flows from the risks associated with interest payments from interest rate increases on variable rate debt. The interest rate cap is a derivative instrument designated as a cash flow hedge under Topic 815 Derivatives and Hedging . The premiums are recognized in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations when paid from the effective date through the termination date. All changes in the fair value of the interest rate cap are deferred in AOCI and subsequently recognized in earnings in the period when the derivative contract settles. The unrealized impact on earnings on the interest rate cap for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, are disclosed in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive (Loss) Income. Fuel Purchase Contracts From time to time, we enter into fixed price swap contracts to purchase gasoline and diesel fuel to protect cash flows from the risks associated with fluctuations in fuel prices on a portion of anticipated future purchases. The fixed price swap contracts to purchase gasoline and diesel fuel are derivative instruments not designated as hedging instruments under Topic 815.

 Business Description 
 We own and operate one of the largest integrated equipment dealership platforms in North America. Through our branch network, we sell, rent, and provide parts and service support for several categories of specialized equipment, including lift trucks and other material handling equipment, heavy and compact earthmoving equipment, crushing and screening equipment, environmental processing equipment, cranes and aerial work platforms, paving and asphalt equipment, other construction equipment and allied products. We engage in five principal business activities in these equipment categories: 
 (i) new and used equipment sales; 

(ii) parts sales; 

(iii) repair and maintenance services; 

(iv) equipment rentals and 

(v) rental equipment sales. 

We have operated as an equipment dealership for 40 years and have developed a branch network that includes over 85 total locations in Michigan, Illinois, Indiana, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Massachusetts, Maine, Connecticut, New Hampshire, Vermont, Rhode Island, New York, Virginia, Nevada and Florida and the Canadian provinces of Ontario and Quebec. We offer our customers end-to-end solutions for their equipment needs by providing sales, parts, service and rental offerings. Additionally, we provide warehouse design and build services related to automated equipment installation and warehouse management system integration solutions within our Material Handling segment. 
 Within our territories, we are primarily the exclusive distributor of new equipment and replacement parts on behalf of our OEM partners. We and our regional subsidiaries enjoy long-standing relationships with leading material handling and construction equipment OEMs including Hyster-Yale, Volvo, JCB, CNH, Develon, McCloskey, and Kubota, among many others, as well as master dealer rights throughout North America for environmental processing equipment with Doppstadt and Backers, among others. We are consistently recognized by OEMs as a top dealership partner and have been identified as an internationally recognized Hyster-Yale dealer and multi-year recipient of the Volvo Dealer of the Year award. More recently, given the Company s successful history with electrified forklifts, battery charging, and power generation as well as our material handling customer base, where customers typically employ large fleets of commercial over-the-road vehicles in their day-to-day operations, we are pursuing a strategy focused on the distribution and powering of commercial electric vehicles in the over-the-road vehicle segment. While our electromobility e-mobility business, and the industry in general, is in its early stages of development, we believe that our first-mover advantage and expertise in this emerging market represents an exciting future growth opportunity. 
 We are committed to providing our customers with a best-in-class equipment dealership experience. Our customers are principally focused on equipment reliability and uptime, and our teams of skilled technicians and commitment to service are key to establishing and maintaining long-term customer relationships, representing a critical competitive advantage for the Company. Parts and service are also our most predictable and profitable businesses, with the dealership model structured to drive aftermarket parts and service revenues. Through our new and used equipment sales and our sale of lightly used rental fleet, we populate our exclusive territories with serviceable equipment. As the field population ages, we capitalize on aftermarket parts and service sales through the equipment maintenance cycle. 
 25 

Growth Strategy 
 Our growth strategy is multifaceted and primarily predicated on making strategic acquisitions that expand our geographic reach, broaden our capabilities and service offerings, and diversify our customer and supplier bases. We believe these acquisitions, both immediately and over the long term, will be accretive to our financial performance. Recent examples of strategic acquisitions were the Ault and Burris acquisitions that closed in late 2023. 
 In addition to strategic acquisitions, we intend to leverage our platform, deep roster of existing customers, and decades of equipment dealership experience to grow organically by establishing new relationships with equipment OEMs that are synergistic to our existing business. Recent examples of this facet of our growth strategy are evidenced by our new relationship with Case Power and Equipment in Western Pennsylvania, which launched in late 2023, and the ongoing development of our e-mobility offerings and partnerships in the class 3 through 8 commercial electric vehicle markets. 
 Business Segments 
 For a detailed description of our business segments, refer to Note 16, Segments. 
 Financial Statement Overview 
 Our revenues are primarily derived from the sale or rental of equipment and product support (e.g., parts and service) activities, and consist of: 
 New equipment sales. We sell new heavy construction, material handling and environmental processing equipment and are a leading regional distributor for nationally recognized equipment manufacturers. Our new equipment sales operation is a primary source of new customers for our rental, parts and service business. The majority of our new equipment sales are predicated on exclusive distribution agreements we have with best-in-class OEMs. The sale of new equipment to customers, while profitable from a gross margin perspective, acts as a means of generating equipment field population and activity for our higher-margin aftermarket revenue streams, specifically service and parts. We also sell tangential products and services related to our material handling equipment offerings which include, but are not limited to, automated equipment installation and warehouse management systems integration. 
 Used equipment sales. We sell used equipment which is typically equipment that has been taken in on trade from a customer that is purchasing new equipment, equipment coming off a third-party lease arrangement where we purchase the equipment from the finance company, or used equipment that is sourced for our customers in the open market by our used equipment specialists. Used equipment sales in our territories, like new equipment sales, generate parts and service business for the Company. 
 Parts sales. We sell replacement parts to customers and supply parts to our own rental fleet. Our in-house parts inventory is extensive such that we are able to provide timely service support to our customers. The majority of our parts inventory is made up of OEM replacement parts for those OEMs with which we have exclusive agreements to sell new equipment. 
 Service revenues. We provide maintenance and repair services for customer-owned equipment and maintain our own rental fleet. In addition to repair and maintenance on an as needed or scheduled basis, we provide ongoing preventative maintenance services and warranty repairs for our customers. We have committed substantial resources to training our technical service employees and have a full-scale service infrastructure that we believe differentiates us from our competitors. Approximately 44 of our employees are skilled service technicians. 
 Rental revenues. We rent heavy construction, compact, aerial, material handling, and a variety of other types of equipment to our customers on a daily, weekly, and monthly basis. Our rental fleet, which is well-maintained, has an original acquisition cost (which we define as the cost originally paid to manufacturers plus any capitalized costs) of 592.2 million as of September 30, 2024. The original acquisition cost of our rental fleet excludes 6.8 million of assets associated with our guaranteed purchase obligations, which are assets that are not in our day-to-day operational control. In addition to being a core business, our rental business also creates cross-selling opportunities for us in our sales and product support activities.

Rental equipment sales. We also sell rental equipment from our rental fleet. Rental equipment sales may occur at various stages in an equipment s lifecycle, depending on customer demand and original purchase intentions of the equipment. Rental equipment purchased directly into the rental fleet tends to be rented for the majority of its useful life before being sold (defined earlier as rent-to-rent equipment), and rental equipment purchased as new inventory then later transferred into the rental fleet tends to be rented until a retail opportunity presents itself (defined earlier as rent-to-sell equipment). In our Material Handling segment, our rental equipment sales are primarily of rent-to-rent equipment and in our Construction Equipment segment, our rental equipment sales are primarily of rent-to-sell equipment. Selling lightly used construction equipment from our rental fleet allows us to meet customer demand for specific model years of equipment at various price points versus only offering brand new equipment to the market. Customers often have options to purchase equipment after or before rental agreements have matured. Rental equipment sales, like new and used equipment sales, generate customer-owned equipment field population within our territories that ultimately yield high-margin parts and service revenues for us. 
 Principal Costs and Expenses 
 Our cost of revenues are primarily related to the costs associated with the sale or rental of equipment and product support activities, which include direct labor costs for our skilled technicians. Our operating expenses consist principally of selling, general and administrative expenses, which primarily include personnel costs associated with our sales and administrative staff and expenses associated with the deployment of our service vehicle fleet and occupancy expenses. In addition, we have interest expense related to our floor plan payables, finance leases, line of credit, and senior secured second lien notes. These principal costs and expenses are described further below: 
 New equipment sales. Cost of new equipment sold consists of the total acquisition costs of the new equipment we purchase from third parties. 
 Used equipment sales. Cost of used equipment sold consists of the net book value, or cost, of used equipment we purchase from third parties or the trade-in value of used equipment that we obtain from customers in new equipment sales transactions. 
 Parts sales. Cost of parts sales represents the average cost of parts used in the maintenance and repair of customer-owned equipment we service or parts sold directly to customers for their owned equipment (e.g., over-the-counter parts sales). 
 Services revenues. Cost of service revenues primarily represents the labor costs attributable to services provided for the maintenance and repair of customer-owned equipment. Training, paid time off, and other non-billable costs of maintaining our expert technicians are recorded in this line item in addition to the costs of direct customer-billable labor. 
 Rental revenues. Rental expense represents the costs associated with rental equipment, including, among other things, the cost of repairing and maintaining our rental equipment and other miscellaneous costs of owning rental equipment. Other rental expenses consist primarily of equipment support activities that we provide our customers in connection with renting equipment, such as freight services and damage waiver policies. 
 Rental depreciation. Depreciation of rental equipment represents the depreciation costs attributable to rental equipment. Estimated useful lives vary based upon type of equipment. See Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, of the consolidated financial statements in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 for information on our rental equipment depreciation methods. 
 Rental equipment sales. Cost of previously rented equipment sold consists of the net book value (e.g., net of accumulated depreciation) of rental equipment sold from our rental fleet. 
 Operating expenses. These costs are comprised of three main components: personnel, operational, and occupancy costs. Personnel costs are comprised of hourly and salaried wages for administrative employees, including incentive compensation and employee benefits, such as medical benefits. Operational costs include marketing activities, costs associated with deploying and leasing our service vehicle fleet, insurance, IT, office and shop supplies, general corporate costs, depreciation on non-sales and rental related assets, and intangible amortization. Occupancy costs are comprised of all expenses related to our facility infrastructure, including rent, utilities, property taxes, and building insurance. 
 Other expense, net. This section of the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations is mostly comprised of interest expense and other miscellaneous items that result in income or expense. Interest expense is driven by our Floor Plan Facilities, ABL Facility, Notes, and finance lease arrangements.

The above table contains a non-GAAP financial measure. A non-GAAP financial measure is defined as a numerical measure of a company s financial performance that excludes or includes amounts so as to be different than the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP in the condensed consolidated statements of operations, balance sheets or statements of cash flows of the company. The non-GAAP financial measure used by the Company is organic revenues and growth rates associated with organic revenues. We define organic revenue growth as revenue growth excluding the impact of acquisitions that do not appear fully in both periods in the current and prior years. We believe organic revenue growth is a meaningful metric to investors as it provides a more consistent comparison of our revenues to prior periods as well as to industry peers. 
 Pursuant to the requirements of Regulation G, we have provided a reconciliation of organic revenues to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure in the table above and in subsequent tables, where applicable, in management's discussion and analysis of our individual business segments. This measure is supplemental to, and should be used in conjunction with, the most comparable GAAP measure. Management uses this non-GAAP financial measure to monitor and evaluate financial results and trends. 
 Revenues: Consolidated revenues decreased by 17.4 million, or 3.7 , to 448.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the same period last year. Organic revenues for the three months ended September 30, 2024 decreased 8.4 compared to the same period last year. Uncertainty related to the outcome of the upcoming U.S. presidential election and a continued high interest rate environment have softened current demand for new and used equipment in our markets, however we believe the core long-term fundamentals in the markets we serve remain solid. With overall demand for new equipment depressed in nearly all of our markets, organic new and used equipment sales decreased by 45.5 million, or 17.9 , to 208.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, partially offset by increased organic rental equipment sales of 5.1 million. While new equipment sales suffered on lower overall market volumes, demand for aftermarket products and services remained strong as organic parts sales increased by 1.8 million, or 2.6 , to 71.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the same period last year, and organic service revenues increased 3.4 million, or 5.6 , making for a total aftermarket revenues increase of 5.2 million organically, or 4.0 . Rental revenues for the quarter reached 50.1 million organically, or a decrease of 7.2 primarily due to reduced fleet on rent during the quarter. 
 In the nine months ended September 30, 2024, organic new and used equipment revenues decreased 8.4 against a strong comparative nine months ended September 30, 2023 when supply of new equipment was in the phase of meeting high levels of pent-up demand that existed post-pandemic. This dynamic was most prominent in our Master Distribution segment, which sells equipment to sub-dealers, as segment revenues for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 were down 18.5 million from the prior year same period. While new and used equipment revenues stagnated on weaker demand versus the same period last year, our product support departments (parts and service) grew 4.2 organically for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. Our rental business remained steady for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as rental revenues grew 0.4 organically from increased fleet on rent when compared to the same period last year. Rental equipment sales organically increased 9.6 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the same period last year, as we look to sell rental equipment to help bolster field population for our aftermarket departments, especially as growth in rental rates and fleet utilization moderate.

The consolidated gross profit margin for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was 27.8 , an 80 basis point increase from the same period in 2023. The overall increase in the quarter can be attributed to a relatively greater sales mix of our higher margin aftermarket business lines. New and used equipment sales margins decreased 30 basis points to 16.1 , as margin compression was observed in both our Material Handling and Construction Equipment segments. With inventory availability normalizing, new and used equipment sales margins have also normalized modestly from higher pricing levels experienced in the prior year. The impact of pricing normalization also affected the sales of our rental equipment, which led to a 410 basis point gross margin decrease when comparing the year-over-year periods. Parts gross margins decreased by 90 basis points from the same period in 2023 but remained within our range of expectation. Service gross margins improved in the third quarter when compared to the same period last year, increasing 300 basis points, primarily due to an improved rate realization on service labor. We realized a 200 basis point decrease in rental revenues gross margin for the three months ended September 30, 2024, largely a result of replenishing our rental fleet and the related increase in depreciation expense. 
 The consolidated gross profit margin for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 27.4 , a 20 basis point decrease from 27.6 for the same period in 2023. New and used equipment sales margins decreased 150 basis points to 15.9 , a reflection of a comparably softened pricing environment. On sales of our rental equipment, gross margin was similarly compressed on a softened pricing environment, posting a 180 basis point decrease when comparing the year-over-year periods. Parts gross margins remained consistent year to date when compared to the same time last year, improving 20 basis points, and service gross margins improved by 150 basis points. The improvement in year-to-date service gross margins was largely attributable to improved customer margins for shop and preventative maintenance work, as well as improved margins in our warranty and fleet accounts with our OEMs. We realized a 190 basis point decrease in rental revenues gross margin for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, largely a result of an increase in depreciation expense associated with a replenished fleet. 
 Operating expenses: Consolidated operating expenses increased by 5.6 million to 117.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period last year. The increase is primarily driven by the full period impact from our 2023 acquisitions. Rising employee benefit costs, such as medical and pension, largely account for the remainder of the increase. Aside from those increases, the Company has been able to reduce various operating costs to combat top line revenue reductions for the three months ended September 30, 2024. 
 Consolidated operating expenses increased by 29.0 million to 361.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period last year. The increase is primarily driven by the full period impact from our 2023 acquisitions. Rising costs of employment, attributed to a higher average headcount and higher average wages and benefits, largely account for the remainder of the increase. A higher branch count in the 2024 time period relative to 2023 also contributed to increased operating expenses as well, with associated one-time costs, such as grand openings and initial stocking costs, and ongoing facility costs, such as rent and utilities. Further, during the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024 there were non-cash adjustments to contingent consideration made for earn-outs on previous acquisitions, which influenced the year-to-date costs by an incremental 0.7 million. 
 Other expense, net: Consolidated other expense, net for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was 22.9 million compared to 13.8 million for the same period in 2023. The increase is primarily due to an increased amount of interest expense, namely a result of the refinance of our Senior Secured Second Lien Notes during the second quarter of 2024. 
 Consolidated other expense, net for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 63.0 million compared to 38.3 million for the same period in 2023. The increase is primarily due to the loss on extinguishment of debt of 6.7 million, and an increased amount of interest expense due to increased effective interest rates, higher inventory and rental fleet levels, and more debt from financed acquisitions as compared to same period last year. 
 30 

Income tax provision (benefit): The Company recorded income tax expense of 11.6 million and a benefit of 7.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively and income tax expense of 4.7 million and benefit of 6.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The income tax expense for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily a result of a valuation allowance recorded against a portion of the deferred tax asset relating to the U.S. disallowed interest expense carryforwards created by the provisions of the TCJA and the benefit in 2023 was due to the release of the valuation allowance on certain U.S. federal and state deferred tax assets during the third quarter.

Revenues: Material Handling segment revenues increased by 0.3 million to 168.9 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the same period last year, all on an organic basis. New and used equipment sales are relatively flat year over year as we continue to work through a notable equipment sales backlog, while managing a depressed demand environment in the equipment spot market. Product support revenues, made up of the combined parts and service departments, improved by 3.5 , with service revenues increasing 4.5 in the third quarter over the same period in the prior year, reflecting our ability to pass along inflationary-based pricing increases to our customers to support their fleets in a period of flat demand. Rental revenues decreased from 19.6 million to 19.3 million, or 1.5 , for the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the same period last year, despite the Material Handling segment holding a larger average fleet size when comparing the two periods. Rental equipment sales increased 1.2 million organically, or 75.0 , on low volume as we have strategically targeted and disposed of underperforming rental units or rental units that have reached the end of their useful life in our fleet. 
 Material Handling segment revenues increased by 16.3 million, or 3.2 , to 518.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the same period last year. Organically, the segment revenues increased by 14.5 million, or 2.9 , year to date over the same period in the prior year. Organic new and used equipment sales increased 1.3 while working through a notable equipment sales backlog during the year. On an organic basis, product support revenues, made up of the combined parts and service departments increased by 2.7 , with improved productivity measures and rates when compared to the same period last year. Rental revenues increased 3.7 on an organic basis for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the same period last year primarily related to a higher nominal level of fleet on rent and moderately increased rates. Rental equipment sales increased 4.2 million organically, or 107.7 , on low volume as we have strategically sold underperforming rental units or disposed of rental equipment that reached the end of its useful life in our fleet.

Material Handling gross profit margin for the three months ended September 30, 2024 decreased 110 basis points to 33.6 compared to the same period in 2023. New and used equipment gross margins decreased as a result of heightened competitive pressures from greater availability of equipment in the marketplace relative to the prior year. Parts gross margins decreased 200 basis points on higher restocking fees. The 220 basis point service margin increase for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the prior year same period can be attributed to margin improvements in customer-billed service work, whereas OEM-billed warranty and fleet service margins decreased in the quarter. Rental revenues gross margins have declined 440 basis points primarily due to replenishing and increasing the size of our rental fleet and the associated increase in depreciation expense. Rental equipment sales margins decreased on low volume of sales and pricing pressures from greater availability of equipment in the marketplace relative to the prior year. 
 32 

Material Handling gross profit for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 decreased 90 basis points to 33.3 compared to the same period in 2023. New and used equipment gross margins compressed slightly due to sales mix variances, with reduced sales coming from Peaklogix, our higher margin warehousing solutions platform, and increased pressure on used equipment pricing. Parts gross margins have remained relatively consistent year over year and in line with expectations. The 210 basis point service margin increase for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the prior year same period can be attributed to margin improvements in major service categories, customer and OEM warranty and fleet work, on better pricing and technician productivity measures. Rental revenues gross margins have declined 490 basis points primarily due to replenishing and increasing the size of our rental fleet and the associated increase in depreciation expense. Rental equipment sales margins decreased on low volume of sales and pricing pressures from greater availability of equipment in the marketplace relative to the prior year. 
 Operating expenses: Material Handling operating expenses decreased by 7.2 million to 49.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the same period last year, primarily due to a year-to-date cumulative change in the allocation of intercompany expenses for shared service functions from Other income to General and administrative expenses during the third quarter of 2023. 
 Material Handling operating expenses increased by 3.5 million to 149.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the same period last year, mainly due to the full period impact from the M G acquisition in March 2023 and personnel-related cost increases in wages and benefits. 
 Other (expense) income, net: Material Handling other (expense) income, net increased by 9.5 million to 6.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the same period last year. The increase is mainly related to the aforementioned cumulative change in intercompany expense allocation for shared service functions and increased interest expense due to higher effective interest rates, inventory, and rental fleet levels. 
 Material Handling other expense, net increased by 4.3 million to 17.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the same period last year. The increase is mainly related to increased interest expense due to higher effective interest rates, inventory, and rental fleet levels.

Revenues: Construction Equipment segment revenues decreased by 19.7 million to 262.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the same period last year. Organic segment revenues decreased 14.7 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 over the same period in the prior year, amid a softer demand backdrop. New and used equipment sales decreased organically by 44.5 million, or 29.5 , while rental equipment sales increased for the three months ended September 30, 2024 by 3.9 million. Market demand for equipment from medium and small contractors has declined as interest rates have stayed elevated and new project funding has become more challenging. Further, heightened new equipment availability and dealer stock levels throughout the industry have resulted in an increased competitive environment compared to a year ago making holding market share in certain regions and product categories more difficult. Despite a challenging environment for equipment sales, product support revenues, consisting of parts and service revenues, increased 4.1 organically as we have been able to increase skilled technician headcount and improve rate realization on service labor. Rental revenues decreased 10.9 , on an organic basis for the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the same period last year on reduced utilization. 
 Construction Equipment segment revenues increased by 16.2 million to 812.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the same period last year, primarily related to the full-period impact from the Burris and Ault acquisitions made in the fourth quarter of 2023. Organic segment revenues decreased 5.0 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 over the same period in the prior year. New and used equipment sales decreased organically by 54.9 million, or 13.3 , while rental equipment sales increased for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 by 4.5 million. As has been the experience the last several quarters, the industry continues to struggle with high interest rates and uncertainty surrounding the U.S. presidential election causing hesitancy amongst new equipment buyers, resulting in lower sales volumes from fewer market opportunities. Product support revenues increased 5.9 organically due to higher technician headcount and improved rates on service labor. Rental revenues decreased 2.2 on an organic basis for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period last year as rental demand is moderating.

Construction Equipment gross profit increased by 130 basis points to 23.6 in the three months ended September 30, 2024 from 22.3 in the same period in 2023. New and used equipment sales margins decreased 90 basis points to 11.9 , primarily related to greater equipment supply on the market coupled with declining used equipment pricing when compared to the same period last year. Parts sales margins for the three months ended September 30, 2024 decreased modestly when compared to the same time last year, but remain in line with expectations. Service gross margins increased by 480 basis points year over year with improved productivity and rate realization on service labor. Rental revenues gross margin for the three months ended September 30, 2024 decreased by 50 basis points from a year ago, but remained within our expected range. Finally, gross margins on rental equipment sales experienced a reduction when compared to the same time last year amid industry-wide pricing pressures on used equipment. 
 35 

Construction Equipment gross profit increased by 20 basis points to 23.4 in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from 23.2 in the same period in 2023. New and used equipment sales margins decreased 160 basis points to 12.6 , primarily related to greater equipment supply in the market resulting in tighter sales margins this year when compared to the same period last year, and pricing pressures on used equipment. Parts sales margins for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 increased 120 basis points when compared to the same time last year. The 2023 acquisition of Ault has improved the parts sales margins during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as parts for specialized aggregate and mining equipment command a premium compared to traditional construction equipment parts. Service gross margins increased by 100 basis points year over year mainly from improved rate realization. Rental revenues gross margin for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 were relatively flat from a year ago, consistent with expectations. Gross margins on rental equipment sales for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 were reduced from a year ago amid the aforementioned pricing pressures on used equipment. 
 Operating expenses: Construction Equipment operating expenses increased by 0.2 million to 60.0 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the same period in 2023. The overall increase is mainly due to the full-period impact from the Burris and Ault acquisitions made in the fourth quarter of 2023, but is also influenced by relatively higher personnel and facility-related expenses. Organic operating expenses remained flat between the comparative three month periods. Additionally, and similar to the Material Handling segment, a year-to-date cumulative change in the allocation of intercompany expenses for shared service functions from Other income to General and administrative expenses was made during the third quarter of 2023, partially offsetting the aforementioned increases from acquisitions. 
 Construction Equipment operating expenses increased by 22.8 million to 182.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the same period in 2023. The increase is mainly due to the full-period impact from the Burris and Ault acquisitions made in the fourth quarter of 2023 but is also influenced primarily by higher wage levels, rising benefit costs, and increased marketing, and facility-related expenses. Notably, with the change to the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations classification of the allocation of intercompany expenses for shared service functions made in the third quarter of 2023, the comparative year-to-date values align consistently between one another. 
 Other expense, net: Construction Equipment other expense, net increased by 10.5 million to 12.7 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the same period in 2023. The variance was mainly due to increased floor plan interest expense related to a combination of higher effective interest rates on higher levels of new inventory that were no longer within the subsidized period of our OEMs, higher effective interest rates on operating debt borrowings, increased debt from financed acquisitions within the segment, and the aforementioned cumulative change in shared service function intercompany segment allocations. 
 Construction Equipment other expense, net increased by 11.7 million to 33.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the same period in 2023. The variance was driven by the same aforementioned factors driving increased interest costs for the three months ended September 30, 2024.

Revenues: Master Distribution segment revenues for the three months ended September 30, 2024 were 18.2 million, an increase of 0.1 million from the prior year same period. The Master Distribution segment has two primary sales channels for which it sells equipment: (1) through its dealer channel whereby contractual relationships are established with sub-dealers that hold stock inventory and ultimately sell to end users and (2) through direct sale relationships whereby end customers source specific types of equipment directly. Despite direct sales increasing, we had similar sales totals during the three months ended September 30, 2024 when compared to the third quarter of 2023 as the dealer channel continued to display constrained demand dynamics, demonstrating a reluctance to restock product as many dealers manage through inventory overstock. Parts sales were slightly down as end-market dynamics negatively influenced aftermarket sales as well. 
 Master Distribution segment revenues for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 were 47.7 million, a decrease of 18.5 million from the prior year same period. As dealer channel sales depend on sub-dealer stocking levels, in 2023 the supply of new equipment was in the initial phase of meeting high levels of pent-up post-pandemic demand and our Master Distribution sub-dealers fulfilled stocking needs. This dealer stocking dynamic led to higher than typical sales volume for our Master Distribution segment for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, but particularly within the first six months of 2023. With the dealer channel full and a challenging equipment demand environment due in part to an elevated interest rate environment, volumes and revenues have suffered comparably in 2024. Conversely, and despite being a smaller portion of the total sales mix, the Master Distribution segment's direct sale business, primarily consisting of compost turning and bulk commercial food waste processing machinery, has improved as we sell to environmentally conscious customer end users throughout North America. Parts sales were slightly down based on mix, as we sold multiple large component parts in the nine months ended September 30, 2023 when compared to the same period this year.

For the three months ended September 30, 2024, gross profit margin on new and used equipment sales were 26.1 , up 500 basis points from prior year, but overall in line with expectations considering product mix. Parts gross profit margin was 68.2 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, up 1,220 basis points compared to the same period last year, above expectations for a single quarter result due to a parts obsolescence reserve adjustment made during the quarter. 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, gross profit margin on new and used equipment sales were 25.5 , flat from prior year and in line with expectations. Parts gross profit margin was 52.1 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, up 20 basis points compared to the same period last year, in line with expectations. 
 Operating expenses: Master Distribution segment operating expenses were 3.9 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, a decrease of 0.3 million to the prior year. The decrease from the prior year is primarily related to the recording of non-cash adjustments for contingent consideration associated with earn-outs during the three months ended September 30, 2023, which did nor reoccur in 2024. Operating expenses otherwise remained relatively flat during the quarter. 
 Master Distribution segment operating expenses were 13.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, an increase of 1.6 million primarily related to non-cash adjustments for contingent consideration earn-outs associated with the acquisition of Ecoverse in November 2022. Personnel costs, such as wages and benefits, and sales-related expenses represented the remainder of the increase in operating expenses of the Master Distribution segment year over year. 
 Other expense, net: Master Distribution other expense, net was 1.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, an increase over prior year partially attributed to higher interest costs on larger inventory balances, but primarily related to exchange rate fluctuations. 
 Master Distribution other expense, net was 3.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, an increase over prior year attributed to higher interest costs on larger inventory balances and the impact of exchange rate fluctuations.

Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 The nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 Cash Flows 
 Cash Flow from Operating Activities. Cash flows from operating activities include net income adjusted for non-cash items and the effects of changes in working capital. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, operating activities resulted in net cash provided by operations of 22.1 million. Our reported net loss of 51.5 million, when adjusted for non-cash income and expense items, primarily depreciation and amortization, the gain on sale of rental equipment, inventory obsolescence and bad debt reserves, loss on debt extinguishment, deferred income taxes, and stock-based compensation, provided net cash inflows of 56.2 million. Changes in working capital included 152.2 million of inventory purchased (of which 105.6 million was transferred into our rental fleet for replenishment), and a 26.5 million decrease in accounts receivable. Cash flows from operating activities were favorably impacted by 92.5 million due to proceeds from the sale of rent-to-sell equipment, 8.4 million in net inflows related to manufacturer floor plans, and by a 4.3 million net change in prepaid expenses and other assets and leases, deferred revenue, and other liabilities and unfavorably impacted by a 13.6 million decrease in accounts payable, accrued expenses, customer deposits, and other current liabilities. 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2023, operating activities resulted in net cash used in operations of 23.1 million. Our reported net income of 10.8 million, when adjusted for non-cash income and expense items, such as depreciation and amortization, inventory obsolescence and bad debt reserves, and stock-based compensation, provided net cash inflows of 91.5 million. Changes in working capital included 247.4 million of inventory purchased (of which 143.0 million has been transferred into our rental fleet for replenishment and growth purposes), and a 32.7 million increase in accounts receivable. Cash flows from operating activities were favorably impacted by 87.0 million due to proceeds from the sale of rent-to-sell equipment, 97.9 million in net inflows related to manufacturer floor plans and unfavorably impacted by a 6.9 million decrease in accounts payable, accrued expenses, customer deposits, and other current liabilities and by a 12.5 million net change in prepaid expenses and other assets and leases, deferred revenue, and other liabilities. 
 Cash Flow from Investing Activities . For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, our cash used in investing activities was 48.0 million. This was mainly due to 59.2 million purchases of rental equipment, non-rental property and equipment, and other investing activities partially offset by 8.9 million proceeds from the sale of rent-to-rent equipment and 2.3 million proceeds from the sale of non-rental property and equipment. 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2023, our cash used in investing activities was 56.9 million. This was mainly due to 61.4 million purchases of rental equipment, non-rental property and equipment, and other investing activities as well as acquisition activity partially offset by 3.7 million proceeds from the sale of rent-to-rent equipment and 0.8 million proceeds from the sale of non-rental property and equipment. 
 Cash Flow from Financing Activities. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, cash provided by financing activities was 9.7 million. This cash inflow was mainly due to the 353.5 million of net proceeds from our line of credit, long-term borrowings, and finance lease obligations, which funded the 319.4 extinguishment of our Senior Secured Second Lien Notes due April 2026 and the increase in net working capital previously noted. These cash inflows also were partially offset by payments of 8.1 million for preferred and common stock dividends, net payments of 9.3 million related to non-manufacturer floor plans, 2.0 million for common stock repurchases, and 3.1 million related to other financing activities. 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2023, cash provided by financing activities was 78.2 million. The favorable impact was mainly due to 81.5 million of net proceeds under our line of credit, long-term debt, and finance lease obligations, which funded the increase in net working capital and rental fleet as previously noted and net proceeds of 9.8 million related to non-manufacturer floor plans. This was partially offset by payments of 7.9 million for preferred and common stock dividends and 5.2 million related to other financing activities. 
 Sources of Liquidity 
 Our principal sources of liquidity have been from cash provided by our service, parts and rental related operations and the sales of new, used, and rental fleet equipment, proceeds from the issuance of debt, and borrowings available under our line of credit and floor plans. The Company reported 14.6 million in cash as of September 30, 2024. For more information on our available borrowings under the revolving line of credit, senior secured second lien notes, and floor plans, please refer to Note 8, Floor Plans and Note 9, Long-term Debt. We consider the undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries to be indefinitely reinvested as we do not anticipate the need to repatriate funds to the U.S. to satisfy domestic liquidity needs. 
 39 

Cash Requirements Related to Operations 
 Our principal uses of cash have been to fund operating activities and working capital, including but not limited to new and used equipment inventories, purchases of rental fleet equipment and personal property, payments due under line of credit and floor plans, acquisitions, debt service requirements, stock repurchases, and preferred stock and common stock dividends. In the future, we may pursue additional strategic acquisitions and seek to open new start-up locations. We anticipate that the uses described above encompass the principal demands on our cash and availability under our line of credit and floor plans in the future. 
 The amount of our future capital expenditures will depend on a number of factors including general economic conditions and growth prospects. Our gross rental fleet capital expenditures for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 151.2 million, including 105.6 million of transfers from new and used inventory to rental fleet. This gross rental fleet capital expenditure was offset by sales proceeds of rental equipment of 101.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as our business model is to sell lightly used inventory to customers from our rental fleet to increase field population in our geographies. In response to changing economic conditions, we have the flexibility to modify our capital expenditures, especially as it relates to rental fleet. 
 To service our debt, we will require a significant amount of cash. Our ability to pay interest and principal on our indebtedness, will depend upon our future operating performance and the availability of borrowings under the line of credit and/or other debt and equity financing alternatives available to us, which will be affected by prevailing economic conditions and conditions in the global credit and capital markets, as well as financial, business and other factors, some of which are beyond our control. Based on our current level of operations and given the current state of the capital markets, we believe our cash flows from operations, available cash, and available borrowings under the line of credit will be adequate to meet our future liquidity needs for the foreseeable future. As of September 30, 2024, we had 360.8 million of available borrowings under the ABL Facility and Floor Plan Facilities. 
 Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 
 In the preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America U.S. GAAP ), we are required to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, expenses, and the related disclosures. Our management reviews these estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis. While we believe the estimates and judgments we use in preparing our consolidated financial statements are reasonable and appropriate, they are subject to future events and uncertainties regarding their outcome; therefore, actual results may materially differ from these estimates. If actual amounts are ultimately different from our estimates, the revisions are included in our results of operations for the period in which the actual amounts first become known. See Note 2 to our condensed consolidated financial statements for a summary of our significant accounting policies. 
 Additionally, see Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements contained in the Company s 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K for a summary of our significant accounting policies. 
 Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitat ive Disclosures About Market Risk 
 Our exposure to market risks primarily consist of interest rate risk associated with our variable and fixed rate debt, prices of certain commodities, and foreign currency exchange rate risks. From time to time, we employ financial instruments to manage the Company's exposure to changes in interest rates, diesel and unleaded fuel, and foreign currencies. See Note 14, Fair Value of Financial Instruments, for more information. 
 Interest rate risk: Our earnings may be affected by changes in interest rates on the ABL Facility and Floor Plan Facilities. The interest rates applicable to any loans under the ABL Facility are based, at the option of the borrowers, on (i) a floating rate based on the SOFR (for loans denominated in U.S. dollars) or Canadian Dollar Offered Rate (for loans denominated in Canadian dollars) plus an initial margin of 1.75 or (ii) CBFR (for loans denominated in U.S. dollars) or the Canadian Prime Rate (for loans denominated in Canadian dollars) less an initial margin of 0.75 , in each case, where margin is adjusted under the ABL Facility based on the quarterly average excess availability under the ABL Facility. The interest rates applicable to any loans under various Floor Plan Facilities ("Floor Plan Rates") are based on a wide range of benchmark rates (including SOFR, Prime, Bloomberg Short-Term Bank Yield Index, and the Canadian Bankers' Acceptance Rate) plus an applicable margin. As of September 30, 2024 the lowest Floor Plan Rate was SOFR plus an initial margin of 2.75 , and the highest was SOFR plus a margin of 5.1145 per annum. 
 At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we had 200.6 million and 317.5 million, respectively, outstanding borrowings under the ABL Facility. At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we had 396.4 million and 397.5 million, respectively, outstanding borrowings under the Floor Plan Facilities. As of September 30, 2024, based upon the amount of our variable rate debt outstanding, each one percentage point increase in the interest rates applicable to our variable rate debt, when including the hedge impact of our interest rate cap, would reduce our annual pre-tax earnings by 2.4 million. The amount of variable rate indebtedness outstanding may fluctuate significantly. See Note 8, Floor Plans, and Note 9, Long-Term Debt, in our condensed consolidated financial statements for additional information concerning the terms of our variable rate debt. 
 40 

We have a fixed rate on the Notes of 500.0 million which are due in 2029. We do not have any exposure to changing interest rates as of September 30, 2024 on the fixed rate Notes. For additional information concerning the terms of our fixed rate debt, see Note 9, Long-Term Debt. 
 Commodity price risk: The market prices of diesel and unleaded fuels are unpredictable and can fluctuate significantly. Because of the volume of fuel we purchase each year, a significant increase in the price of fuel could adversely affect our business and reduce our operating margins. To manage a portion of this risk, we enter into fixed price swap contracts to purchase gasoline and diesel fuel related to forecasted fuel purchases. For the purchases of unleaded and diesel fuel that we expect to purchase at market prices in the next 12 months, each 0.10 per gallon increase in the price of diesel and unleaded fuel, holding other variables constant, would not have a material impact on our pre-tax income when including the fixed price swap contracts. 
 Foreign currency exchange rate risk: Due to our international operations, a portion of our revenues, cost of revenues, and operating expenses are subject to foreign currency exchange rate risk. Changes in the exchange rate of the U.S. dollar versus the Canadian dollar and European currencies affect the translated value and relative level of revenues and net income that we report from one period to the next. Based upon balances and exchange rates as of September 30, 2024, holding other variables constant, we believe that a hypothetical 10 increase or decrease in all applicable foreign exchange rates would not have a material impact on our results of operations or cash flows. 
 Item 4. Contr ols and Procedures. 
 Management s Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 Our management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Exchange Act) as of September 30, 2024. Based on this evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that, as of September 30, 2024, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective. 
 Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) of the Exchange Act) during the quarter ended September 30, 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

If a quorum shall not be present or represented by proxy at any meeting of the stockholders of the Corporation, the chairperson of the meeting may adjourn the meeting from time to time in the manner provided in Section 2.6 until a quorum shall attend. The stockholders present at a duly convened meeting may continue to transact business until adjournment, notwithstanding the withdrawal of enough stockholders to leave less than a quorum. Shares of its own stock belonging to the Corporation or to another corporation, if a majority of the voting power of the shares entitled to vote in the election of directors of such other corporation is held, directly or indirectly, by the Corporation, shall neither be entitled to vote nor be counted for quorum purposes; provided, however, that the foregoing shall not limit the right of the Corporation or any such other corporation to vote shares held by it in a fiduciary capacity. 
 
 Section 2.5. Voting of Shares . (a) Voting Lists . The Secretary of the Corporation (the Secretary shall prepare, or shall cause the officer or agent who has charge of the stock ledger of the Corporation to prepare, no later than the tenth day before each meeting of stockholders, a complete list of the stockholders of record entitled to vote at such meeting; provided, however, that if the record date for determining the stockholders entitled to vote is less than 10 days before the meeting date, the list shall reflect the stockholders entitled to vote as of the tenth day before the meeting date, arranged in alphabetical order and showing the address and the number of shares registered in the name of each stockholder. Nothing contained in this Section 2.5(a) shall require the Corporation to include electronic mail addresses or other electronic contact information on such list. Such list shall be open to the examination of any stockholder, for any purpose germane to the meeting, during ordinary business hours for a period of 10 days ending on the day before the meeting date: (i) on a reasonably accessible electronic network, provided that the information required to gain access to such list is provided with the notice of the meeting, or (ii) during ordinary business hours, at the principal place of business of the Corporation. In the event that the Corporation determines to make the list available on an electronic network, the Corporation may take reasonable steps to ensure that such information is available only to stockholders of the Corporation. The stock ledger shall be the only evidence as to who are the stockholders entitled to examine the list required by this Section 2.5(a) or to vote in person or by proxy at any meeting of stockholders. 
 
 (b) Manner of Voting . At any stockholders meeting, every stockholder entitled to vote may vote in person or by proxy. If authorized by the Board, the voting by stockholders or proxy holders at any meeting conducted by remote communication may be effected by a ballot submitted by electronic transmission (as defined in Section 9.3), provided that any such electronic transmission must either set forth or be submitted with information from which the Corporation can determine that the electronic transmission was authorized by the stockholder or proxy holder.

Proxies need not be filed with the Secretary until the meeting is called to order, but shall be filed with the Secretary before being voted. Without limiting the manner in which a stockholder may authorize another person or persons to act for such stockholder as proxy, either of the following shall constitute a valid means by which a stockholder may grant such authority. No stockholder shall have cumulative voting rights. 
 (i) A stockholder may execute a writing authorizing another person or persons to act for such stockholder as proxy. Execution may be accomplished by the stockholder or such stockholder s authorized officer, director, employee or agent signing such writing or causing such person s signature to be affixed to such writing by any reasonable means, including, but not limited to, by facsimile signature. 

(ii) A stockholder may authorize another person or persons to act for such stockholder as proxy by transmitting or authorizing the transmission of an electronic transmission to the person who will be the holder of the proxy or to a proxy solicitation firm, proxy support service organization or like agent duly authorized by the person who will be the holder of the proxy to receive such transmission, provided that any such electronic transmission must either set forth or be submitted with information from which it can be determined that the electronic transmission was authorized by the stockholder.

All other matters presented to the stockholders at a meeting at which a quorum is present shall be determined by the vote of a majority of the votes cast by the stockholders present in person or represented by proxy at the meeting and entitled to vote thereon, unless the matter is one upon which, by applicable law, the Certificate of Incorporation, these Bylaws or applicable stock exchange rules, a different vote is required, in which case such provision shall govern and control the decision of such matter. 
 
 (e) Inspectors of Election . The Board may, and shall if required by law, in advance of any meeting of stockholders, appoint one or more persons as inspectors of election, who may be employees of the Corporation or otherwise serve the Corporation in other capacities, to act at such meeting of stockholders or any adjournment thereof and to make a written report thereof. The Board may appoint one or more persons as alternate inspectors to replace any inspector who fails to act.

No person who is a candidate for an office at an election may serve as an inspector at such election. Each report of an inspector shall be in writing and signed by the inspector or by a majority of them if there is more than one inspector acting at such meeting. If there is more than one inspector, the report of a majority shall be the report of the inspectors. 
 
 Section 2.6. Adjournments .

 (b) A restriction imposed by the Corporation on the transfer or on the registration of shares of the Corporation or on the amount of shares of the Corporation that may be owned by any person or group of persons, even if otherwise lawful, is ineffective against a person without actual knowledge of such restriction unless: (i) the shares are certificated and such restriction is noted conspicuously on the certificate; or (ii) the shares are uncertificated and such restriction was contained in a notice, offering circular or prospectus sent by the Corporation to the registered owner of such shares within a reasonable time prior to or after the issuance or transfer of such shares.

 ARTICLE VIII 
 INDEMNIFICATION 
 
 Section 8.1. Right to Indemnification . To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, as the same exists or may hereafter be amended, the Corporation shall indemnify and hold harmless each person who was or is made a party or is threatened to be made a party to or is otherwise involved in any threatened, pending or completed action, suit or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative (hereinafter a proceeding ), by reason of the fact that he or she is or was a director or officer of the Corporation or, while a director or officer of the Corporation, is or was serving at the request of the Corporation as a director, officer, employee or agent of another corporation or of a partnership, joint venture, trust, other enterprise or nonprofit entity, including service with respect to an employee benefit plan (hereinafter an Indemnitee ), whether the basis of such proceeding is alleged action in an official capacity as a director, officer, employee or agent, or in any other capacity while serving as a director, officer, employee or agent, against all liability and loss suffered and expenses (including, without limitation, attorneys fees, judgments, fines, ERISA excise taxes and penalties and amounts paid in settlement) reasonably incurred by such Indemnitee in connection with such proceeding; provided, however, that, except as provided in Section 8.3 with respect to proceedings to enforce rights to indemnification, the Corporation shall indemnify an Indemnitee in connection with a proceeding (or part thereof) initiated by such Indemnitee only if such proceeding (or part thereof) was authorized by the Board. 
 
 Section 8.2. Right to Advancement of Expenses . In addition to the right to indemnification conferred in Section 8.1, an Indemnitee shall also have the right to be paid by the Corporation to the fullest extent not prohibited by applicable law the expenses (including, without limitation, attorneys fees) incurred in defending or otherwise participating in any such proceeding in advance of its final disposition (hereinafter an advancement of expenses ); provided, however, that, if the DGCL requires, an advancement of expenses incurred by an Indemnitee in his or her capacity as a director or officer of the Corporation (and not in any other capacity in which service was or is rendered by such Indemnitee, including, without limitation, service to an employee benefit plan) shall be made only upon the Corporation s receipt of an undertaking (hereinafter an undertaking ), by or on behalf of such Indemnitee, to repay all amounts so advanced if it shall ultimately be determined that such Indemnitee is not entitled to be indemnified under this Article VIII or otherwise. 
 Section 8.3. Right of Indemnitee to Bring Suit . If a claim under Section 8.1 or Section 8.2 is not paid in full by the Corporation within 60 days after a written claim therefor has been received by the Corporation, except in the case of a claim for an advancement of expenses, in which case the applicable period shall be 20 days, the Indemnitee may at any time thereafter bring suit against the Corporation to recover the unpaid amount of the claim. If successful in whole or in part in any such suit, or in a suit brought by the Corporation to recover an advancement of expenses pursuant to the terms of an undertaking, the Indemnitee shall also be entitled to be paid the expense of prosecuting or defending such suit. In (a) any suit brought by the Indemnitee to enforce a right to indemnification hereunder (but not in a suit brought by an Indemnitee to enforce a right to an advancement of expenses) it shall be a defense that, and (b) any suit brought by the Corporation to recover an advancement of expenses pursuant to the terms of an undertaking, the Corporation shall be entitled to recover such expenses upon a final judicial decision from which there is no further right to appeal (hereinafter a final adjudication that, the Indemnitee has not met any applicable standard for indemnification set forth in the DGCL. Neither the failure of the Corporation (including its directors who are not parties to such action, a committee of such directors, independent legal counsel, or its stockholders) to have made a determination prior to the commencement of such suit that indemnification of the Indemnitee is proper in the circumstances because the Indemnitee has met the applicable standard of conduct set forth in the DGCL, nor an actual determination by the Corporation (including a determination by its directors who are not parties to such action, a committee of such directors, independent legal counsel, or its stockholders) that the Indemnitee has not met such applicable standard of conduct, shall create a presumption that the Indemnitee has not met the applicable standard of conduct or, in the case of such a suit brought by the Indemnitee, shall be a defense to such suit. In any suit brought by the Indemnitee to enforce a right to indemnification or to an advancement of expenses hereunder, or by the Corporation 

to recover an advancement of expenses pursuant to the terms of an undertaking, the burden of proving that the Indemnitee is not entitled to be indemnified, or to such advancement of expenses, under this Article VIII or otherwise shall be on the Corporation. 
 
 Section 8.4. Non-Exclusivity of Rights . The rights provided to any Indemnitee pursuant to this Article VIII shall not be exclusive of any other right, which such Indemnitee may have or hereafter acquire under applicable law, the Certificate of Incorporation, these Bylaws, an agreement, a vote of stockholders or disinterested directors, or otherwise. 
 
 Section 8.5. Insurance . The Corporation may maintain insurance, at its expense, to protect itself and/or any director, officer, employee or agent of the Corporation or another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise against any expense, liability or loss, whether or not the Corporation would have the power to indemnify such person against such expense, liability or loss under the DGCL. 
 
 Section 8.6. Indemnification of Other Persons . This Article VIII shall not limit the right of the Corporation to the extent and in the manner authorized or permitted by law to indemnify and to advance expenses to persons other than Indemnitees. Without limiting the foregoing, the Corporation may, to the extent authorized from time to time by the Board, grant rights to indemnification and to the advancement of expenses to any employee or agent of the Corporation and to any other person who is or was serving at the request of the Corporation as a director, officer, employee or agent of another corporation or of a partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise, including service with respect to an employee benefit plan, to the fullest extent of the provisions of this Article VIII with respect to the indemnification and advancement of expenses of Indemnitees under this Article VIII. 
 
 Section 8.7. Amendments . Any repeal or amendment of this Article VIII by the Board or the stockholders of the Corporation or by changes in applicable law, or the adoption of any other provision of these Bylaws inconsistent with this Article VIII, will, to the extent permitted by applicable law, be prospective only (except to the extent such amendment or change in applicable law permits the Corporation to provide broader indemnification rights to Indemnitees on a retroactive basis than permitted prior thereto), and will not in any way diminish or adversely affect any right or protection existing hereunder in respect of any act or omission occurring prior to such repeal or amendment or adoption of such inconsistent provision; provided however, that amendments or repeals of this Article VIII by stockholders shall require the affirmative vote of the stockholders holding at least 66.7 of the voting power of all outstanding shares of capital stock of the Corporation. 
 
 Section 8.8. Certain Definitions . For purposes of this Article VIII, (a) references to other enterprise shall include any employee benefit plan; (b) references to fines shall include any excise taxes assessed on a person with respect to an employee benefit plan; (c) references to serving at the request of the Corporation shall include any service that imposes duties on, or involves services by, a person with respect to any employee benefit plan, its participants, or beneficiaries; and (d) a person who acted in good faith and in a manner such person reasonably believed to be in the interest of the participants and beneficiaries of an employee benefit plan shall be deemed to have acted in a manner not opposed to the best interest of the Corporation for purposes of Section 145 of the DGCL. 
 Section 8.9. Contract Rights . The rights provided to Indemnitees pursuant to this Article VIII shall be contract rights and such rights shall continue as to an Indemnitee who has ceased to be a director, officer, agent or employee and shall inure to the benefit of the Indemnitee s heirs, executors and administrators. 
 
 Section 8.10. Severability . If any provision or provisions of this Article VIII shall be held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable for any reason whatsoever: (a) the validity, legality and enforceability of the remaining provisions of this Article VIII shall not in any way be affected or impaired thereby; and (b) to the fullest extent possible, the provisions of this Article VIII (including, without limitation, each such portion of this Article VIII containing any such provision held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable) shall be construed so as to give effect to the intent manifested by the provision held invalid, illegal or unenforceable. 
 
 ARTICLE IX 
 MISCELLANEOUS 

Section 9.1. Place of Meetings . If the place of any meeting of stockholders, the Board or committee of the Board for which notice is required under these Bylaws is not designated in the notice of such meeting, such meeting shall be held at the principal business office of the Corporation; provided, however, if the Board has, in its sole discretion, determined that a meeting shall not be held at any place, but instead shall be held by means of remote communication pursuant to Section 9.5 hereof, then such meeting shall not be held at any place. 
 
 Section 9.2. Fixing Record Dates . (a) In order that the Corporation may determine the stockholders entitled to notice of any meeting of stockholders or any adjournment thereof, the Board may fix a record date, which shall not precede the date upon which the resolution fixing the record date is adopted by the Board, and which record date shall not be more than 60 nor less than 10 days before the date of such meeting. If the Board so fixes a date, such date shall also be the record date for determining the stockholders entitled to vote at such meeting unless the Board determines, at the time it fixes such record date, that a later date on or before the date of the meeting shall be the date for making such determination. If no record date is fixed by the Board, the record date for determining stockholders entitled to notice of and to vote at a meeting of stockholders shall be at the close of business on the business day next preceding the day on which notice is given, or, if notice is waived, at the close of business on the business day next preceding the day on which the meeting is held. A determination of stockholders of record entitled to notice of or to vote at a meeting of stockholders shall apply to any adjournment of the meeting; provided, however, that the Board may fix a new record date for the adjourned meeting, and in such case shall also fix as the record date for stockholders entitled to notice of such adjourned meeting the same or an earlier date as that fixed for determination of stockholders entitled to vote in accordance with the foregoing provisions of this Section 9.2(a) at the adjourned meeting. 
 
 (b) In order that the Corporation may determine the stockholders entitled to receive payment of any dividend or other distribution or allotment of any rights or the stockholders entitled to exercise any rights in respect of any change, conversion or exchange of stock, or for the purpose of any other lawful action, the Board may fix a record date, which record date shall not precede the date upon which the resolution fixing the record date is adopted, and which record date shall be not more than 60 days prior to such action. If no record date is fixed, the record date for determining stockholders for any such purpose shall be at the close of business on the day on which the Board adopts the resolution relating thereto. 
 
 Section 9.3. Means of Giving Notice . (a) Notice to Directors . Whenever under applicable law, the Certificate of Incorporation or these Bylaws notice is required to be given to any director, such notice shall be given either (i) in writing and sent by mail, or by a nationally recognized delivery service, (ii) by means of facsimile telecommunication or other form of electronic transmission, or (iii) by oral notice given personally or by telephone. A notice to a director will be deemed given as follows: (i) if given by hand delivery, orally, or by telephone, when actually received by the director, (ii) if sent through the United States mail, when deposited in the United States mail, with postage and fees thereon prepaid, addressed to the director at the director s address appearing on the records of the Corporation, (iii) if sent for next day delivery by a nationally recognized overnight delivery service, when deposited with such service, with fees thereon prepaid, addressed to the director at the director s address appearing on the records of the Corporation, (iv) if sent by facsimile telecommunication, when sent to the facsimile transmission number for such director appearing on the records of the Corporation, (v) if sent by electronic mail, when sent to the electronic mail address for such director appearing on the records of the Corporation, or (vi) if sent by any other form of electronic transmission, when sent to the address, location or number (as applicable) for such director appearing on the records of the Corporation. 
 
 (b) Notice to Stockholders . Any notice to stockholders by the Corporation shall be deemed given (a) if such notice is mailed, when such notice is deposited in the United States mail, postage prepaid, directed to the stockholder at such stockholder s address as it appears on the records of the Corporation, or (b) if such notice is delivered by courier service, the earlier of when the notice is received or left at such stockholder s address as it appears on the records of the Corporation. Without limiting the manner by which notice otherwise may be given effectively to stockholders, any notice to stockholders may be given by electronic transmission in the manner provided in Section 232 of the DGCL. 
 
 (c) For purposes of these Bylaws, Electronic transmission means any form of communication, not directly involving the physical transmission of paper, including the use of, or participation in, one or more electronic networks or databases (including one or more distributed electronic networks or databases), that creates a record that may be 

retained, retrieved and reviewed by a recipient thereof, and that may be directly reproduced in paper form by such a recipient through an automated process. 
 
 (d) Notice to Stockholders Sharing Same Address . Without limiting the manner by which notice otherwise may be given effectively by the Corporation to stockholders, any notice to stockholders given by the Corporation under any provision of the DGCL, the Certificate of Incorporation or these Bylaws shall be effective if given by a single written notice to stockholders who share an address if consented to by the stockholders at that address to whom such notice is given. A stockholder may revoke such stockholder s consent by delivering written notice of such revocation to the Corporation. Any stockholder who fails to object in writing to the Corporation within 60 days of having been given written notice by the Corporation of its intention to send such a single written notice shall be deemed to have consented to receiving such single written notice. 
 
 (e) Exceptions to Notice Requirements . Whenever notice is required to be given, under the DGCL, the Certificate of Incorporation or these Bylaws, to any person with whom communication is unlawful, the giving of such notice to such person shall not be required and there shall be no duty to apply to any governmental authority or agency for a license or permit to give such notice to such person. Any action or meeting that shall be taken or held without notice to any such person with whom communication is unlawful shall have the same force and effect as if such notice had been duly given. In the event that the action taken by the Corporation is such as to require the filing of a certificate with the Secretary of State of Delaware, the certificate shall state, if such is the fact and if notice is required, that notice was given to all persons entitled to receive notice except such persons with whom communication is unlawful. Whenever notice is required to be given by the Corporation, under any provision of the DGCL, the Certificate of Incorporation or these Bylaws, to any stockholder to whom (1) notice of two consecutive annual meetings of stockholders and all notices of stockholder meetings or of the taking of action by written consent of stockholders without a meeting to such stockholder during the period between such two consecutive annual meetings, or (2) all, and at least two payments (if sent by first-class mail) of dividends or interest on securities during a 12-month period, have been mailed addressed to such stockholder at such stockholder s address as shown on the records of the Corporation and have been returned undeliverable, the giving of such notice to such stockholder shall not be required. Any action or meeting that shall be taken or held without notice to such stockholder shall have the same force and effect as if such notice had been duly given. If any such stockholder shall deliver to the Corporation a written notice setting forth such stockholder s then current address, the requirement that notice be given to such stockholder shall be reinstated. In the event that the action taken by the Corporation is such as to require the filing of a certificate with the Secretary of State of Delaware, the certificate need not state that notice was not given to persons to whom notice was not required to be given pursuant to Section 230(b) of the DGCL. The exception in subsection (1) above to the requirement that notice be given shall not be applicable to any notice returned as undeliverable if the notice was given by electronic transmission in accordance with Section 230(c) of the DGCL. 
 
 Section 9.4. Waiver of Notice . Whenever any notice is required to be given under applicable law, the Certificate of Incorporation, or these Bylaws, a written waiver of such notice, signed by the person or persons entitled to said notice, or a waiver by electronic transmission by the person entitled to said notice, whether before or after the time stated therein, shall be deemed equivalent to such required notice. All such waivers shall be kept with the books of the Corporation. Attendance at a meeting shall constitute a waiver of notice of such meeting, except when the person attends for the express purpose of objecting at the beginning of the meeting to the transaction of any business on the ground that the meeting was not lawfully called or convened. Neither the business to be transacted at, nor the purpose of, any regular or special meeting of the stockholders, directors or members of a committee of directors need be specified in any written waiver of notice or any waiver by electronic transmission unless so required by the Certificate of Incorporation or the Bylaws. 
 
 Section 9.5. Meeting Attendance via Remote Communication Equipment. 
 
 (a) Stockholder Meetings . If authorized by the Board in its sole discretion, and subject to such guidelines and procedures as the Board may adopt, stockholders entitled to vote at such meeting and proxy holders not physically present at a meeting of stockholders may, by means of remote communication: 
 
 (i) participate in a meeting of stockholders; and 

(ii) be deemed present in person and vote at a meeting of stockholders, whether such meeting is to be held at a designated place or solely by means of remote communication, provided that (A) the Corporation shall implement reasonable measures to verify that each person deemed present and permitted to vote at the meeting by means of remote communication is a stockholder or proxy holder, (B) the Corporation shall implement reasonable measures to provide such stockholders and proxy holders a reasonable opportunity to participate in the meeting and, if entitled to vote, to vote on matters submitted to the applicable stockholders, including an opportunity to read or hear the proceedings of the meeting substantially concurrently with such proceedings, and (C) if any stockholder or proxy holder votes or takes other action at the meeting by means of remote communication, a record of such votes or other action shall be maintained by the Corporation. 
 
 (b) Board Meetings . Unless otherwise restricted by applicable law, the Certificate of Incorporation or these Bylaws, members of the Board or any committee thereof may participate in a meeting of the Board or any committee thereof by means of conference telephone or other communications equipment by means of which all persons participating in the meeting can hear each other. Such participation in a meeting shall constitute presence in person at the meeting, except where a person participates in the meeting for the express purpose of objecting at the beginning of the meeting to the transaction of any business on the ground that the meeting was not lawfully called or convened. 
 
 Section 9.6. Dividends . The Board may from time to time declare, and the Corporation may pay, dividends (payable in cash, property or shares of the Corporation s capital stock) on the Corporation s outstanding shares of capital stock, subject to applicable law and the Certificate of Incorporation. 
 Section 9.7. Reserves . The Board may set apart out of the funds of the Corporation available for dividends a reserve or reserves for any proper purpose and may abolish any such reserve. 
 
 Section 9.8. Contracts and Negotiable Instruments .

Such authority may be general or confined to specific instances as the Board may determine. The Chairperson of the Board, the Chief Executive Officer, the President, the Chief Financial Officer, the Treasurer or any Vice President may execute and deliver any contract, bond, deed, lease, mortgage or other instrument in the name and on behalf of the Corporation. Subject to any restrictions imposed by the Board, the Chairperson of the Board, the Chief Executive Officer, the President, the Chief Financial Officer, the Treasurer or any Vice President may delegate powers to execute and deliver any contract, bond, deed, lease, mortgage or other instrument in the name and on behalf of the Corporation to other officers or employees of the Corporation under such person s supervision and authority, it being understood, however, that any such delegation of power shall not relieve such officer of responsibility with respect to the exercise of such delegated power. 
 
 Section 9.9. Fiscal Year . The fiscal year of the Corporation shall be fixed by the Board. 
 
 Section 9.10. Seal . The Board may adopt a corporate seal, which shall be in such form as the Board determines. The seal may be used by causing it or a facsimile thereof to be impressed, affixed or otherwise reproduced. 
 
 Section 9.11. Books and Records . The books and records of the Corporation may be kept within or outside the State of Delaware at such place or places as may from time to time be designated by the Board. 
 
 Section 9.12. Resignation . Any director, committee member or officer may resign by giving notice thereof in writing or by electronic transmission to the Board, the Chairperson of the Board, the Chief Executive Officer, the President or the Secretary. The resignation shall take effect at the time it is delivered unless the resignation specifies a later effective date or an effective date determined upon the happening of an event or events. Unless otherwise specified therein, the acceptance of such resignation shall not be necessary to make it effective. 
 
 Section 9.13. Surety Bonds . Such officers, employees and agents of the Corporation (if any) as the Chairperson of the Board, Chief Executive Officer, President or the Board may direct, from time to time, shall be bonded for the faithful performance of their duties and for the restoration to the Corporation, in case of their death, resignation, retirement, disqualification or removal from office, of all books, papers, vouchers, money and other property of whatever kind in their possession or under their control belonging to the Corporation, in such amounts and by such 

surety companies as the Chairperson of the Board, Chief Executive Officer, President or the Board may determine. The premiums on such bonds shall be paid by the Corporation and the bonds so furnished shall be in the custody of the Secretary. 
 
 Section 9.14. Securities of Other Corporations . Powers of attorney, proxies, waivers of notice of meeting, consents in writing and other instruments relating to securities owned by the Corporation may be executed in the name of and on behalf of the Corporation by the Chairperson of the Board, Chief Executive Officer, President, any Vice President, Secretary or any officers authorized by the Board. Any such officer, may, in the name of and on behalf of the Corporation, take all such action as any such officer may deem advisable to vote in person or by proxy at any meeting of security holders of any corporation in which the Corporation may own securities, or to consent in writing, in the name of the Corporation as such holder, to any action by such corporation, and at any such meeting or with respect to any such consent shall possess and may exercise any and all rights and power incident to the ownership of such securities and which, as the owner thereof, the Corporation might have exercised and possessed. The Board may from time to time confer like powers upon any other person or persons. 
 
 Section 9.15. Amendments . The Board shall have the power to adopt, amend, alter or repeal the Bylaws. The affirmative vote of a majority of the Board shall be required to adopt, amend, alter or repeal the Bylaws. The Bylaws also may be adopted, amended, altered or repealed by the stockholders; provided, however, that in addition to any vote of the holders of any class or series of capital stock of the Corporation required by applicable law or the Certificate of Incorporation, the affirmative vote of the holders of at least a majority of the voting power (except as otherwise provided in Section 8.7) of all outstanding shares of capital stock of the Corporation entitled to vote generally in the election of directors, voting together as a single class, shall be required for the stockholders to adopt, amend, alter or repeal the Bylaws.
