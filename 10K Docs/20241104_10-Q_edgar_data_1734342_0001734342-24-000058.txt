 Upon successfully completing the Public Offering, the Company initiated the Securities Repositioning aimed at improving yields, increasing liquidity and de-risking the securities portfolio. As part of this strategy, in the third quarter of 2024, the Company: (i) transferred at their fair value (which was below their amortized cost basis) all of the debt securities previously classified as held to maturity and carried at amortized cost to the debt securities available for sale category; (ii) sold all of the Company s investments in subordinated debt securities, included in corporate debt securities, which resulted in a pre-tax loss on sale of approximately million in the third quarter of 2024; and (iii) decided to sell all other corporate debt securities. In addition, as a result of its decision to sell all debt securities available for sale (including those previously classified as held to maturity) which had accumulated unrealized losses and met the criteria for inclusion in the Securities Repositioning, the Company recorded a pre-tax impairment loss totaling approximately million on debt securities available for sale, and resulted in a write down of their previous amortized cost to their estimated fair value as of September 30, 2024. The Company completed the Securities Repositioning in October 2024, which resulted in an additional pre-tax loss on sale of approximately million as a result of the subsequent decline in fair market value of the securities. 
 
 As of September 30, 2024, securities sold and securities purchased which were pending settlement at that date totaled approximately million and million, respectively, and are included in other assets and other liabilities, respectively, on the Company s consolidated balance sheet. These balances were settled in October 2024. 
 
 U.S. Government Sponsored Enterprise Debt Securities and U.S. Government Agency Debt Securities 
 
 At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company held certain debt securities issued or guaranteed by the U.S. government and U.S. government-sponsored entities and agencies. The Company evaluates these securities for credit losses by reviewing current market conditions, the extent and nature of changes in fair value, credit ratings, default and delinquency rates and current analysts evaluations. The Company believes the decline in fair value on these debt securities below their amortized cost basis is attributable to changes in interest rates and investment securities markets, generally, and not credit quality. As a result, the Company did t record an Allowance for Credit Losses, or ACL, on these securities as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. Additionally, the Company does not intend to sell these debt securities (except those securities included in the Securities Repositioning as of September 30, 2024), and it considers it is more likely than not that it will not be required to sell the securities before their anticipated recovery.

 The Company evaluates all debt securities held to maturity quarterly to determine if any securities in an unrealized loss position require an ACL. The Company considers that all debt securities held to maturity issued or sponsored by the U.S. government are considered to be risk-free as they have the backing of the government. The Company did have debt securities held to maturity as of September 30, 2024. As of December 31, 2023, the Company believed there were no current expected credit losses on these securities and, therefore, did not record an ACL on any of its debt securities held to maturity as of that date. The Company monitors the credit quality of held to maturity securities through the use of credit ratings. Credit ratings are monitored by the Company on at least a quarterly basis. As of December 31, 2023, all debt securities held to maturity held by the Company were rated investment grade or higher.

The provision for credit losses on loans in the three and nine month periods ended September 30, 2024 was offset by net charge-offs. 
 
 In the third quarter of 2024, the provision for credit losses on loans included million to cover charge-offs, million due to loan composition and million due to general credit quality and macroeconomic factor updates. 
 
 In the first nine months of 2024, the provision for credit losses on loans included million to cover charge-offs, million in new specific reserves for non-performing loans and million due to loan composition and volume changes. These provision requirements were partially offset by a release of million due to credit quality and macroeconomic factor updates and a million release due to the Houston loan portfolio classification as held-for-sale.

 Loans Held for Sale, at Lower of Cost or Fair Value 
 
 For loans held for sale that are carried at the lower of cost or fair value, the fair value is generally based on quoted market prices of similar loans less estimated cost to sell and is considered to be Level 3. 
 Collateral Dependent Loans Measured For Expected Credit Losses 
 
 The carrying amount of collateral dependent loans is typically based on the fair value of the underlying collateral. The Company primarily uses third party appraisals to assist in measuring expected credit losses on collateral dependent loans. The Company also uses third party appraisal reviewers for loans with an outstanding balance of million and above. These appraisals generally use the market or income approach valuation technique and use market observable data to formulate an opinion of the fair value of the loan s collateral. However, the appraiser uses professional judgment in determining the fair value of the collateral or properties and may also adjust these values for changes in market conditions subsequent to the appraisal date. When current appraisals are not available for certain loans, the Company uses judgment on market conditions to adjust the most current appraisal. The sales prices may reflect prices of sales contracts not closed and the amount of time required to sell out the real estate project may be derived from current appraisals of similar projects. As a consequence, the fair value of the collateral is considered a Level 3 valuation. 
 
 OREO 
 
 The Company values other real estate owned, OREO, at the lower of cost or fair value of the property, less cost to sell. The fair value of the property is generally based upon recent appraisal values of the property, less cost to sell. The Company primarily uses third party appraisals to assist in measuring the valuation of OREO. Period revaluations are classified as level 3 as the assumptions used may not be observable. The Company had other repossessed assets with a carrying value of million, which were sold in the three and six month periods ended June 30, 2023. The Company recognized a loss on sale of million which is included in the result of operations for those periods. As of December 31, 2023, the Company had an OREO property with a carrying value of million. In the three and nine month periods ended September 30, 2024, the Company recorded valuation expense of million on this OREO property, as result of the fair value adjustment. As of September 30, 2024, the carrying value of the OREO property was million.

 As of September 30, 2024, potential dilutive instruments consisted of unvested shares of restricted stock and restricted stock units RSUs totaling (restricted stock, RSUs and performance share units totaling as of September 30, 2023). In the three and nine month periods ended September 30, 2024, potential dilutive instruments were excluded from the diluted earnings per share computation because the Company reported a net loss and their inclusion would have an anti-dilutive effect in per share earnings in those periods. In the three and nine month periods ended September 30, 2023, potential dilutive instruments were included in the diluted earnings per share computation because, when the unamortized deferred compensation cost related to these shares was divided by the average market price per share in those periods, fewer shares would have been purchased than restricted shares assumed issued. Therefore, in those periods, such awards resulted in higher diluted weighted average shares outstanding than basic weighted average shares outstanding, and had a dilutive effect on per share earnings.

 Public Offering and Securities Repositioning 
 
 On September 27, 2024, the Company completed a public offering of 8,684,210 shares of its Class A voting common stock, at a price to the public of 19.00 per share, which included 784,210 shares issued upon the exercise in full by the underwriters of their option to purchase additional shares of common stock (the Public Offering ). The total gross proceeds from the offering were approximately 165 million, with net proceeds of approximately 155.8 million after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses payable by the Company. The Company intends to use the net proceeds of the Public Offering for general corporate purposes and to support its continued organic growth, which may include, among other things, working capital, investments in the Bank, resolution of non-performing loans, and potential balance sheet optimization strategies. 
 Upon successfully completing the Public Offering, the Company initiated the previously announced repositioning of the Company s securities portfolio (the Securities Repositioning ). The Securities Repositioning consisted of the following actions: (i) transfer at their fair value (which was below their amortized cost) of all of the Company s debt securities previously classified as held to maturity and carried at amortized cost to the available for sale category; (ii) sale of all corporate notes and subordinated debt, and (iii) sale of all other debt securities classified as available for sale (including those previously classified as held to maturity) with book yields of less than 2.75 . As a result of the Securities Repositioning, the Company recorded a pre-tax loss of approximately 68.5 million 53.1 million after-tax) in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024. The Company completed the Securities Repositioning in October 2024, which resulted in an additional pre-tax loss on sale of approximately 8.3 million as a result of the subsequent decline in the fair value of the securities.

Sale of Houston Banking Operations 
 
 On April 16, 2024, the Bank entered into a Purchase and Assumption Agreement (the Purchase Agreement with MidFirst Bank MidFirst pursuant to which MidFirst will purchase certain assets and assume certain liabilities (the Houston Sale Transaction of the banking operations and six branches in the Houston, Texas metropolitan statistical area (collectively, the Branches ).

On July 30, 2024, regulatory approval for the Houston Sale Transaction was received. The Houston Sale Transaction is expected to close on November 8, 2024, subject to the satisfaction of customary closing conditions. 
 
 The purchase price for the purchased assets will be computed as the sum of: (a) 13.0 million (the Deposit Premium ), provided that, if the balance of non-interest checking deposits included in deposits or the total balance of deposits (excluding insured cash sweep deposits) decrease by more than 15 between March 13, 2024 and the closing date, then the Deposit Premium shall be equal to the sum of (i) 9.50 of the average daily balance of non-interest checking deposits included in deposits, (ii) 1.85 of the average daily balance of deposits other than non-interest checking deposits, insured cash sweep deposits and time deposits included in deposits, (iii) 0.25 of the average daily balance of insured cash sweep deposits included in Deposits, and (iv) 0.50 of the average daily balance of time deposits included in deposits, with the average daily balance in each case being for the 30-day period ending on the fifth business day prior to closing, provided further, that the Deposit Premium shall in no event be lower than 9.25 million, (b) the aggregate amount of cash on hand as of the closing date, (c) the aggregate net book value of all assets being assumed (excluding cash on hand, real property and accrued interest with respect to the loans to be acquired), (d) the appraised value of the real property to be acquired, and (e) accrued interest with respect to the loans to be acquired.

Other Actions

 We officially opened new banking centers in downtown Ft. Lauderdale, FL and Miami, FL. We also officially opened our new regional headquarters office for Broward County, located in Plantation, FL. More recently, we signed a letter of intent for a second banking center in Miami Beach, following the signed agreement we previously announced for the first Miami Beach banking center. We also signed a letter of intent for our second Tampa regional location. Both are expected to open by mid-2025. Lastly, we expect to open a new regional headquarter office for Palm Beach County, located in West Palm Beach, Fl., in the first quarter of 2025. 
 
 We continued with our strategy of building brand recognition across our markets. We announced a strategic partnership becoming the Official Bank of Fort Lauderdale United FC .

 We believe these strategic actions will support our ongoing efforts in becoming the bank of choice in the markets we serve.

Primary Factors Used to Evaluate Our Business 
 
 Results of Operations. In addition to net income or loss, the primary factors we use to evaluate and manage our results of operations include net interest income, noninterest income and expenses, and indicators of financial performance including return on assets ROA and return on equity ROE ). We also use certain non-GAAP financial measures in the internal evaluation and management of our businesses. 
 
 Net Interest Income. Net interest income represents interest income less interest expense. We generate interest income from interest, dividends and fees received on interest-earning assets, including loans and investment securities we own. We incur interest expense from interest paid on interest-bearing liabilities, including interest-bearing deposits, and borrowings such as advances from the Federal Home Loan Bank of Atlanta FHLB and other borrowings such as repurchase agreements, notes, debentures and other funding sources we may have from time to time. Net interest income typically is the most significant contributor to our revenues and net income. To evaluate net interest income, we measure and monitor: (i) yields on our loans and other interest-earning assets; (ii) the costs of our deposits and other funding sources; (iii) our net interest spread; (iv) our net interest margin, or NIM; and (v) our provisions for credit losses. Net interest spread is the difference between rates earned on interest-earning assets and rates paid on interest-bearing liabilities. NIM is calculated by dividing net interest income for the period by average interest-earning assets during that same period. Because noninterest-bearing sources of funds, such as noninterest-bearing deposits and stockholders equity, also fund interest-earning assets, NIM includes the benefit of these noninterest-bearing sources of funds. Non-refundable loan origination fees, net of direct costs of originating loans, as well as premiums or discounts paid on loan purchases, are deferred and recognized over the life of the related loan as an adjustment to interest income in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles GAAP ). 
 
 Changes in market interest rates and the interest we earn on interest-earning assets, or which we pay on interest-bearing liabilities, as well as the volumes and the types of interest-earning assets, interest-bearing and noninterest-bearing liabilities and stockholders equity, usually have the largest impact on periodic changes in our net interest spread, NIM and net interest income. We measure net interest income before and after the provision for credit losses. 
 
 Noninterest Income. Noninterest income consists of, among other revenue streams: (i) service fees on deposit accounts; (ii) income from brokerage, advisory and fiduciary activities; (iii) benefits from and changes in cash surrender value of bank-owned life insurance, or BOLI, policies; (iv) card and trade finance servicing fees; (v) securities gains or losses; (vi) net gains and losses on early extinguishment of FHLB advances which we may execute from time to time as part of asset/liability management activities; (vii) income from derivative transaction with customers; (viii) derivative gains or losses; (ix) gains or losses on the sale of properties; and (x) other noninterest income which includes mortgage banking revenue. 
 
 Our income from service fees on deposit accounts is affected primarily by the volume, growth and mix of deposits we hold and volume of transactions initiated by customers (i.e. wire transfers). These are affected by prevailing market pricing of deposit services, interest rates, our marketing efforts and other factors. 
 
 Our income from brokerage, advisory and fiduciary activities consists of brokerage commissions related to our customers trading volume, fiduciary and investment advisory fees generally based on a percentage of the average value of assets under management and custody AUM ), and account administrative services and ancillary fees during the contractual period. 
 
 Income from changes in the cash surrender value of our BOLI policies represents the amounts that may be realized under the contracts with the insurance carriers, which are nontaxable. In the fourth quarter of 2023, the Company restructured certain of its BOLI contracts, by surrendering existing lower-yielding policies and reinvesting the proceeds in higher-yielding policies. This transaction is expected to increase income from this source prospectively. 
 
 60 

Interchange fees, other fees and revenue sharing are recognized when earned. Trade finance servicing fees, which primarily include commissions on letters of credit, are generally recognized over the service period on a straight line basis. Card servicing fees include credit and debit card interchange fees and other fees. We have also entered into referral arrangements with recognized U.S.-based card issuers, which permit us to serve our customers and earn referral fees and share interchange revenue without exposure to credit risk. 
 
 Our gains and losses on sales of securities are derived from sales from our securities portfolio and are primarily dependent on changes in U.S. Treasury interest rates and asset liability management activities. Generally, as U.S. Treasury rates increase, our securities portfolio decreases in market value, and as U.S. Treasury rates decrease, our securities portfolio increases in value. We also recognize unrealized gains or losses on changes in the valuation of marketable equity securities not held for trading. 
 
 Our fee income generated on customer interest rate swaps and other loan level derivatives is primarily dependent on the volume of transactions completed with customers and are included in noninterest income. 
 
 Derivatives unrealized net gains and derivatives unrealized net losses are primarily derived from changes in market value of uncovered interest rate caps with clients. 
 
 Other noninterest income includes mortgage banking income generated through our subsidiary, Amerant Mortgage, and consists of gain on sale of loans, gain on loans market valuation, other fees and smaller sources of income. Mortgage banking income was 2.8 million and 0.5 million in the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and 5.8 million and 3.9 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Other income in the nine months ended September 30, 2024, includes 0.5 million of proceeds from BOLI death benefits. 
 
 Noninterest Expense. Noninterest expenses generally increase as our business grows and whenever necessary to implement or enhance policies and procedures for regulatory compliance, and other purposes. 
 
 Noninterest expense consists of: (i) salaries and employee benefits; (ii) occupancy and equipment expenses; (iii) professional and other services fees; (iv) loan-level derivative expenses; (v) FDIC deposit and business insurance assessments and premiums; (vi) telecommunication and data processing expenses; (vii) depreciation and amortization; (viii) advertising and marketing expenses; (ix) other real estate and repossessed assets, net; (x) contract termination costs; (xi) losses on sale of assets, and (xii) other operating expenses. 
 
 Salaries and employee benefits include compensation (including severance expenses which we generally consider non-routine), employee benefits and employer tax expenses for our personnel. Salaries and employee benefits are partially offset by costs directly related to the origination of loans, which are deferred and amortized over the life of the related loans as adjustments to interest income in accordance with GAAP. 
 
 Occupancy expense consists of lease expense on our leased properties, including right-of-use or ROU asset impairment charges, and other occupancy-related expenses. Equipment expense includes furniture, fixtures and equipment related expenses. Rental income associated with subleasing portions of the Company s headquarters building and the subleasing of the New York office space, primarily, is included as a reduction to rent expense under lease agreements under occupancy and equipment cost. 
 
 Professional and other services fees include the cost of outsourced services, including technology infrastructure and banking processing services from our new technology provider, and other professional consulting fees associated with our transition to a new core banking platform, legal, accounting and related consulting fees, card processing fees, director s fees, regulatory agency fees, such as OCC examination fees, and other fees related to our business operations.

Primary Factors Used to Evaluate Our Financial Condition 
 The primary factors we use to evaluate and manage our financial condition include asset quality, capital and liquidity. 
 Asset Quality. We manage the diversification and quality of our assets based upon factors that include the level, distribution and risks in each category of assets. Problem assets may be categorized as classified, delinquent, nonaccrual, nonperforming and restructured assets. We also manage the adequacy of our allowance for credit losses, or the allowance, the diversification and quality of loan and investment portfolios, the extent of counterparty risks, credit risk concentrations and other factors. 
 
 Capital. Financial institution regulators have established minimum capital ratios for banks and bank holding companies. We manage capital based upon factors that include: (i) the level and quality of capital and our overall financial condition; (ii) the trend and volume of problem assets; (iii) the adequacy of reserves; (iv) the level and quality of earnings; (v) the risk exposures in our balance sheet under various scenarios, including stressed conditions; (vi) the Tier 1 capital ratio, the total capital ratio, the Tier 1 leverage ratio, and the CET1 capital ratio; (vii) the tangible common equity ratio; and (viii) other factors, including market conditions. 
 Liquidity. Our deposit base consists primarily of personal and commercial accounts maintained by individuals and businesses in our primary markets and select international core depositors. The Company is focused on relationship-driven core deposits. The Company may also use third party providers of domestic sources of deposits as part of its balance sheet management strategies. We define core deposits as total deposits excluding all time deposits. This definition of core deposits differs from the Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council s (the FFIEC Uniform Bank Performance Report (the UBPR definition of core deposits, which exclude brokered time deposits and retail time deposits of more than 250,000. See Core Deposits discussion for more details. 
 We manage liquidity based upon factors that include the amount of core deposit relationships as a percentage of total deposits, the level of diversification of our funding sources, the allocation and amount of our deposits among deposit types, the short-term funding sources used to fund assets, the amount of non-deposit funding used to fund assets, the availability of unused funding sources, off-balance sheet obligations, the amount of cash and liquid securities we hold, the availability of assets readily convertible into cash without undue loss, the characteristics and maturities of our assets when compared to the characteristics of our liabilities and other factors. 
 Seasonality . Our loan production, generally, is subject to seasonality, with the lowest volume typically in the first quarter of each year.

 __________________ 
 (1) In the three and nine month periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, potential dilutive instruments consisted of unvested shares of restricted stock, restricted stock units and performance share units. See Note 13 to our unaudited interim consolidated financial statements in this Form 10-Q for details on the dilutive effects of the issuance of restricted stock, restricted stock units and performance share units on earnings per share. 
 
 Three Months Ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 
 In the three months ended September 30, 2024, net loss attributable to the Company was 48.2 million, or 1.43 loss per diluted share, compared to net income of 22.1 million, or 0.66 per diluted share, in the same quarter of 2023. The decrease of 70.3 million, or 317.8 , in the three months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily driven by (i) losses on securities resulting from the Securities Repositioning initiated in the period, included in noninterest (loss) income (ii) higher noninterest expense and (iii) provision for credit losses. These results were partially offset mainly by higher net interest margin and an income tax benefit driven by the net loss in the period. 
 
 In the three months ended September 30, 2023, net income excludes a loss of 0.4 million attributable to a non-controlling interest in Amerant Mortgage. There was no non-controlling interest as of and for the three months ended September 30, 2024.

Net interest income was 81.0 million in the three months ended September 30, 2024, an increase of 2.4 million, or 3.1 , from 78.6 million in the three months ended September 30, 2023. This was primarily driven by higher yields and higher average balances of interest-earning assets. The increase was partially offset by higher average balances in deposits mainly in money market accounts and time deposits as well as higher average balances of other interest-bearing liabilities; and (i) a decrease in the average balances of debt securities held to maturity. 
 
 Noninterest income was a loss of 47.7 million in the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to income of 21.9 million in the three months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease was mainly driven by: (i) higher securities losses as a result of the Securities Repositioning initiated during the third quarter of 2024 and; (ii) the absence of the 7.0 million net gain on the early extinguishment of FHLB advances recorded in the three months ended September 30, 2023. These decreases were partially offset by: (i) higher loan-level derivative income; (ii) higher other noninterest income; (iii) higher additional income stemming from BOLI policies following the restructuring completed in the fourth quarter of 2023; and (iv) higher cards and trade servicing fees. See Noninterest Income for more details. 
 
 Noninterest expense was 76.2 million in the three months ended September 30, 2024, an increase of 11.8 million, or 18.3 , compared to 64.4 million in the same period in 2023. This increase was mainly due to: (i) higher professional and other service fees; (ii) an increase in OREO expenses due to a 5.7 million valuation expense recorded during the quarter; (iii) higher salary and employee benefits; (iv) higher loan-level derivative expenses; (v) higher advertising expenses; and (vi) higher FDIC and insurance expenses. These increases were partially offset by: (i) the absence of a valuation expense of 5.6 million in the third quarter of 2023 related to the fair value adjustment of a New York-based CRE loan held for sale; (ii) lower occupancy and equipment expenses; (iii) lower other operating expenses; (iv) lower telecommunication and data processing expenses; and (v) lower depreciation and amortization expense. See Noninterest Expense for more details. 
 
 In the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, noninterest expense included total non-routine items of 5.7 million and 6.3 million, respectively. There were no restructuring costs in the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 0.7 million in the same period in 2023. Other non-routine items in noninterest expense in the three months ended September 30, 2024, include 5.7 million related to an OREO valuation expense. See Our Company - Primary Factors Used to Evaluate Our Business for detailed information on non-routine items in noninterest expense. 
 
 In the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the Company incurred noninterest expenses of 3.9 million and 3.0 million, respectively, related to Amerant Mortgage which consists of salaries and employee benefits expense, mortgage lending costs and professional and other services fees. Amerant Mortgage had 81 full time equivalent employees FTEs at September 30, 2024 compared to 98 at September 30, 2023. 
 
 Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 
 In the nine months ended September 30, 2024, there was a net loss of 32.6 million, or 0.97 loss per diluted share, compared to net income of 49.6 million, or 1.47 per diluted share, in the same period of 2023. The decrease of 82.2 million or 165.8 , was primarily due to: (i) losses on securities resulting from the Securities Repositioning initiated in the most recent period, included in lower noninterest (loss) income; (ii) higher noninterest expense; (iii) higher provision for credit losses, and (iv) lower net interest income. This was partially offset by an income tax benefit driven by the net loss in the period. 
 
 In the nine months ended September 30, 2023, net income excludes a loss of 0.9 million, attributable to a noncontrolling interest in Amerant Mortgage. There was no non-controlling interest as of and for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. See the 2023 Form 10-K for more information on changes in non-controlling interest in Amerant Mortgage in 2023. 
 68 

Net interest income was 238.3 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2024, a decrease of 6.5 million, or 2.6 , from 244.8 million in the same period in 2023. This was primarily driven by: (i) higher cost and average balances of interest-bearing liabilities mainly in time deposits and money market accounts and lower average balances of debt securities held to maturity. The decrease in net interest income was partially offset by higher average balances and yields on the total interest earning assets. See Net Interest Income for more details. 
 
 Noninterest income was a loss of 13.8 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 67.9 million in the same period of 2023, mainly due to: (i) higher securities losses as a result of the Securities Repositioning initiated during the third quarter of 2024; (ii) lower gains on the early extinguishment of advances from the FHLB in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period last year; and (iii) lower deposits and service fees. These decreases were partially offset by: (i) higher loan-level derivative income; (ii) higher additional income stemming from BOLI policies following the restructuring completed in the fourth quarter of 2023; (iii) higher other noninterest income; (iv) higher cards and trade servicing fees; and (v) higher brokerage, advisory and fiduciary fees. See Noninterest Income for more details. 
 
 Noninterest expense was 216.1 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2024, an increase of 14.5 million, or 7.2 , compared to 201.7 million in the same period in 2023, mainly due to: (i) higher professional and other service fees; (ii) an increase in OREO expenses due to a 5.7 million valuation expense recorded during the quarter; (iii) higher salary and employee benefits; (iv) higher advertising expenses; (v) higher loan-level derivative expenses; (vi) higher occupancy and equipment expenses; and (vii) higher FDIC assessments and insurance expenses. This increase was partially offset by: (i) a decrease in losses on loans held for sale due to lower valuation allowance in the first nine months of 2024 compared to 2023; (ii) lower telecommunication and data processing expenses; (iii) the absence of contract termination costs in the first nine months of 2024; (iv) lower depreciation and amortization expense; and (v) lower other operating expenses. See Noninterest Expense for more details. 
 
 In the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, noninterest expense included total non-routine items of 11.2 million and 23.1 million, respectively.

Net Interest Income 
 Three Months Ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 
 Net interest income in the three months ended September 30, 2024,was 81.0 million, an increase of 2.4 million, or 3.1 , from 78.6 million in the three months ended September 30, 2023. This was primarily driven by: (i) an increase of 21 basis points in the yield on total interest earning assets; and (ii) an increase of 261.2 million, or 24.8 , and 242.7 million or 3.44 , in the average balances of debt securities available for sale and the loan portfolio, respectively, during the period. These increases were partially offset primarily by (i) higher average balances of deposits mainly in money market accounts and time deposits; and (ii) a decrease of 26.2 million, or 11.3 , in the average balances of debt securities held to maturity. Net interest margin was 3.49 in the three months ended September 30, 2024, a decrease of 8 basis points from 3.57 in the three months ended September 30, 2023. See discussions further below for more details. 
 During the third quarter of 2024 we had higher average balance of loans and debt securities available for sale compared to the same period last year. Our asset-sensitive position enabled us to partially offset, via repricing of variable-rate loans, and new loan originations at higher market rates, the incremental cost of deposits and borrowings we recorded during the third quarter of 2024. Additionally, we continued investing in higher-yielding, fixed rate, debt securities available for sale, and maintaining a high average balance in funds at the Federal Reserve. See discussions further below for more details. Lastly, during the third quarter of 2024, the Company initiated the Securities Repositioning, which included transferring all debt securities previously classified as held to maturity to the available for sale category. See Our Company for more details on the Securities Repositioning strategy.

Interest income on loans in the three months ended September 30, 2024 was 129.8 million, an increase of 9.5 million, or 7.9 , compared to 120.2 million in the same period last year, primarily due to a 31 basis points increase in average yields, mainly attributable to higher market rates. The increase in the average balance of loans includes: (i) originations of single-family residential, and (ii) originations of commercial loans. The increase in interest income on loans was partially offset by the increase in the average balance of non-performing loans in the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023. See -Average Balance Sheet, Interest and Yield/Rate Analysis for detailed information. 
 Interest income on debt securities available for sale was 14.3 million in the three months ended September 30, 2024, an increase of 3.3 million, or 30.7 , compared to 10.9 million in the same period of 2023. This was mainly due to an increase of 261.2 million, or 24.8 in the average balance of these securities as well as an increase of 20 basis points in average yields, primarily driven by higher market rates. In the three months ended September 30, 2024, the average balance of accumulated net unrealized loss included in the carrying value of these securities was 89.4 million compared to 119.8 million in the same period last year.

 As of September 30, 2024, floating rate investments represent 14.3 of our total investment portfolio compared to 15.4 at September 30, 2023. In addition, the expected overall duration decreased to 4.9 years at September 30, 2024 from 5.3 years at September 30, 2023 due to lower expected market rates, and the effect of the Securities Repositioning previously discussed. 
 
 Interest Expense 
 Interest expense was 70.6 million in the three months ended September 30, 2024, an increase of 9.8 million, or 16.2 , compared to 60.8 million in the same period of 2023. This was primarily due to: (i) higher average cost of total deposits mainly in money market accounts and time deposits as well as advances from FHLB.

 Interest bearing checking and savings accounts . Interest expense on checking and savings accounts increased 4.5 million, or 16.1 in the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period one year ago, mainly due to an increase of 34 basis points in the average costs on these deposits. In addition, there was an increase of 397.4 million, or 34.7 , in the average balance of money market accounts in the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023. This increase in money market accounts was partially offset by decreases in the average balances of interest bearing demand deposits and savings accounts in the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023. 
 74 

Interest expense on advances from the FHLB increased 0.6 million, or 7.6 , in the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period of 2023, primarily driven by an increase of 62.9 million, or 7.9 , in the average balance on this funding source compared to the same period in 2023.

The decrease in net interest income was partially offset by an increase of 34 basis points in the yield on total interest earning assets. In addition, there were increases of 223.1 million, or 21.2 , 96.1 million, or 1.4 , and 35.0 million, or 10.2 , in the average balance of debt securities available for sale, loans, and interest earning deposits with banks, respectively.

 As of September 30, 2024, the Company s net deferred tax assets were 41.1 million, a decrease of 14.5 million, or 26.1 , compared to 55.6 million as of December 31, 2023. This result was mainly driven by: (i) a decrease of 19.6 million in unrealized holding losses on debt securities available for sale in the current period, and (ii) the realization of the tax benefit in the first nine months of 2024 related to the valuation allowance on loans held for sale recorded in the fourth quarter of 2023 of 35.5 million.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures 
 The Company supplements its financial results that are determined in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) with non-GAAP financial measures, such as pre-provision net revenue (PPNR) , core pre-provision net revenue (Core PPNR) , core noninterest income and core noninterest expenses , tangible stockholders equity (book value) per common share , tangible common equity ratio, adjusted for net unrealized accumulated losses on debt securities held to maturity , and tangible stockholders' equity (book value) per common share, adjusted for net unrealized accumulated losses on debt securities held to maturity . This supplemental information is not required by or is not presented in accordance with GAAP. The Company refers to these financial measures and ratios as non-GAAP financial measures and they should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the GAAP measures presented herein. 
 
 We use certain non-GAAP financial measures, including those mentioned above, both to explain our results to shareholders and the investment community and in the internal evaluation and management of our businesses. Our management believes that these non-GAAP financial measures and the information they provide are useful to investors since these measures permit investors to view our performance using the same tools that our management uses to evaluate our past performance and prospects for future performance, especially in light of the additional costs we have incurred in connection with the Company s restructuring activities that began in 2018 and continued in 2024, and including the effect of non-routine items such as the sale of loans and securities (including the Securities Repositioning initiated at the end of the third quarter of 2024) and other repossessed assets, the valuation of securities, derivatives, loans held for sale and other real estate owned and repossessed assets, the early repayment of FHLB advances, impairment of investments, and other non-routine actions intended to improve customer service and operating performance, as well as certain non-routine items recorded in 2024 in connection with the Houston Sale Transaction. While we believe that these non-GAAP financial measures are useful in evaluating our performance, this information should be considered as supplemental and not as a substitute for or superior to the related financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP. Additionally, these non-GAAP financial measures may differ from similar measures presented by other companies.

 Assets. Total assets were 10.35 billion as of September 30, 2024, an increase of 636.8 million, or 6.6 , compared to 9.72 billion at December 31, 2023. This result was primarily driven by increases of: (i) 350.0 million, or 108.7 , in cash and cash equivalents; (ii) 312.7 million, or 4.4 , in total loans held for investment, net of the ACL, and loans held for sale, and (iii) 45.6 million, or 3.0 , in total securities, mainly debt securities available for sale. The increases were partially offset by decreases of: (i) 226.6 million, or 100.0 , in debt securities held for maturity as a result of the Company s Securities Repositioning, (ii) 18.3 million, or 15.5 , in operating lease right-of-use assets; and (iii) 34.1 million, or 13.3 , in accrued interest receivable and other assets primarily driven by collection of a receivable from an insurance carrier for 62.5 million in connection with the restructuring of the Company s BOLI policies completed in the fourth quarter of 2023.

 Cash and Cash Equivalents. Cash and cash equivalents increased to 671.8 million at September 30, 2024 from 321.9 million at December 31, 2023, primarily as a result of an increase in interest earning cash balances. 
 At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, cash balances held at the Federal Reserve Bank were 613 million and 246 million, respectively. In addition, at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company s cash and cash equivalents included restricted cash of 10.1 million and 25.8 million, respectively, which was held primarily to cover margin calls on derivative transactions with certain brokers.

 Cash and cash equivalents provided by operating activities were 4.7 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2024, mainly driven by: (i) a non-cash adjustment of 68.7 million in connection with losses on securities; (ii) a non-cash adjustment of 50.6 million for the provision for credit losses; and (iii) other non-cash adjustments totaling 4.2 million. This was partially offset by: (i) a net decrease in operating assets and liabilities of 46.8 million; (ii) net originations of mortgage loans held for sale at fair value of 39.3 million, and (iii) the net loss of 32.6 million.

These disbursements were partially offset by: (i) proceeds of sale of loans carried at the lower of cost or fair value and held for investment totaling 469.9 million; (ii) 62.7 million collected from insurance carriers during the first nine months of 2024 in connection with the restructuring of BOLI completed in 2023; (iii) maturities, sales, calls and paydowns of investment securities totaling 271.2 million and; (iv) BOLI death benefits received of 1.2 million.

Loan Quality 
 Allocation of Allowance for Credit Losses 
 In the following table, we present the allocation of the ACL by loan segment at the end of the periods presented. The amounts shown in this table should not be interpreted as an indication that charge-offs in future periods will occur in these amounts or percentages. These amounts represent our best estimates of expected credit losses to be collected throughout the life of the loans, at the reported dates, derived from historical events, current conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts at the dates reported. Our allowance for credit losses is established using estimates and judgments, which consider the views of our regulators in their periodic examinations. Re-evaluation of the ACL estimate in future periods, in light of changes in composition and characteristics of the loan portfolio, changes in the reasonable and supportable forecast and other factors then prevailing may result in material changes in the amount of the ACL and credit loss expense in those future periods. We also show the percentage of each loan class, which includes loans in nonaccrual status.

The ACL was determined utilizing a reasonable and supportable forecast period. The ACL was determined using a weighted-average of various macroeconomic scenarios provided by a third-party, and incorporated qualitative components. There have been no material changes in our policies and methodology to estimate the ACL in the nine months ended September 30, 2024.

Securities 
 The following table sets forth the book value and percentage of each category of securities at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. The book value for debt securities classified as available for sale and equity securities with readily determinable fair value not held for trading represents fair value. The book value for debt securities classified as held to maturity represents amortized cost less ACL if required. The Company determined that an ACL on its debt securities available for sale at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 was not required. In the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company reclassified all its debt securities held to maturity to the available for sale category. As a result, there are no debt securities held to maturity as of September 30, 2024. The Company determined that an ACL on its debt securities held to maturity as of December 31, 2023 was not required.

 __________________ 
 (1) As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 corporate debt includes 10.7 million and 10.5 million, respectively, of debt securities issued by foreign corporate entities. The securities issuers were from Canada in two different sectors at September 30, 2024, and at December 31, 2023. The Company limits exposure to foreign investments based on cross border exposure by country, risk appetite and policy. All foreign investments are denominated in U.S. Dollars. 
 (2) As of September 30, 2024, as a result of the Company s Securities Repositioning strategy, the Company sold its debt securities issued by domestic corporate entities including subordinated debt securities issued by financial institutions. 
 (3) During the third quarter of 2024, the Company executed the Securities Repositioning and transferred all its debt securities held to maturity to the available for sale category. 
 (4) In 2023, the Company purchased an investment in an open-end fund incorporated in the U.S with an original cost of 2.5 million. The Fund's objective is to provide a high level of current income consistent with the preservation of capital and investments deemed to be qualified under the Community Reinvestment Act. 
 (5) Includes investments in FHLB and Federal Reserve Bank stock. Amounts correspond to original cost at the date presented. Original cost approximates fair value because of the nature of these investments. 
 101 

As of September 30, 2024, total securities increased 45.6 million, or 3.0 , to 1.54 billion compared to 1.50 billion at December 31, 2023. The increase in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was mainly driven by purchases of debt securities held for sale and FHLB stock totaling 288.1 million. This increase was partially offset by: (i) maturities, sales, calls and pay downs, totaling 271.2 million, and (ii) net pre-tax unrealized holding losses, on debt securities available for sale of 78.2 million primarily attributable to changes in market interest rates during the period. 
 Upon successfully completing the Public Offering, the Company initiated the Securities Repositioning aimed at improving yields, increasing liquidity and de-risking the securities portfolio. As part of this strategy, in the third quarter of 2024, the Company: (i) transferred at their fair value (which was below their amortized cost basis) all of the debt securities previously classified as held to maturity and carried at amortized cost to the debt securities available for sale category; (ii) sold all of the Company s investments in subordinated debt securities, included in corporate debt securities, which resulted in a pre-tax loss on sale of approximately 6.7 million in the third quarter of 2024; and (iii) decided to sell all other corporate debt securities. In addition, as a result of its decision to sell all debt securities available for sale (including those previously classified as held to maturity) which had accumulated unrealized losses and met the criteria for inclusion in the Securities Repositioning, the Company recorded a pre-tax impairment loss totaling approximately 61.8 million on debt securities available for sale which resulted in a write down of their previous amortized cost to their estimated fair value as of September 30, 2024. The Company completed the Securities Repositioning in October 2024, which resulted in an additional pre-tax loss on sale of approximately 8.1 million as a result of the subsequent decline in fair market value of the securities. 
 Debt securities available for sale had net unrealized holding losses of 26.5 million and net unrealized holding gains of 7.7 million at September 30, 2024, compared to December 31, 2023 when net unrealized holding losses were 100.3 million and net unrealized holding gains were 3.2 million. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company recorded pre-tax unrealized holding gains of 78.2 million which are included in accumulated other comprehensive income for the period. This includes 68.7 million of pre-tax reclassification adjustment for net losses included in the net loss for period due to the pre-tax impairment loss of approximately 61.8 million, and the loss on sale on debt securities available for sale of approximately 6.7 million, as a result of the Securities Repositioning.The Company wrote down the previous amortized cost on these securities to their estimated fair value as of September 30, 2024. 
 Except for the debt securities available for sale that met the criteria for inclusion in the Securities Repositioning, the Company does not intend to sell these debt securities and it is more likely than not that it will not be required to sell the securities before their anticipated recovery. The Company believes these securities are not credit-impaired because the change in fair value is attributable to changes in interest rates and investment securities markets, generally, and not credit quality. As a result, the Company did not record an ACL on these securities as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. 
 As a result of the Securities Repositioning in the third quarter of 2024, which included transferring all debt securities previously classified as held to maturity to the available for sale category, the Company does not have any debt securities classified as held to maturity at September 30, 2024.

The following tables set forth the book value, scheduled maturities and weighted average yields for our securities portfolio at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. Similar to the table above, the book value for securities available for sale and equity securities with readily determinable fair value not held for trading is equal to fair market value and the book value for debt securities held to maturity is equal to amortized cost less an ACL if required.

 The investment portfolio s weighted expected average effective duration decreased to 4.9 years at September 30, 2024 compared to 5.0 years at December 31, 2023, due to expected lower rates and the effect of the Securities Repositioning, previously discussed. 

Liabilities 
 Total liabilities were 9.45 billion at September 30, 2024, an increase of 470.0 million, or 5.2 , compared to 9.0 billion at December 31, 2023. This was primarily driven by an increase of (i) 270.0 million, or 41.9 , in advances from the FHLB; (ii) 216.1 million, or 2.7 , in total deposits, mainly due to an increase in savings and money market deposits; and 0.8 million, or 0.5 , in accounts payable, accrued liabilities and other liabilities. These increases were partially offset by a decrease of 17.3 million, or 14.0 , in operating lease liabilities. See Capital Resources and Liquidity Management and Deposits for more details on the changes in advances from the FHLB and total deposits. Total accounts payable, accrued liabilities and other liabilities as of September 30, 2024 include approximately 12.9 million in connection with the Houston Sale Transaction. See Our Company- Business Developments for additional information. 
 104 

Deposits 
 We continue with our efforts in growing our deposits. Our efforts include the additions of new team members to our business development teams across South Florida and Tampa, and the opening of new banking centers in various locations in Florida in the first nine months of 2024. Total deposits as of September 30, 2024 include deposits held for sale of approximately 590.7 million in connection with the Houston Sale Transaction. See Our Company- Business Developments for additional information. 
 
 Total deposits were 8.11 billion at September 30, 2024, an increase of 216.1 million, or 2.7 , compared to December 31, 2023. The increase in deposits in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was mainly due to an increase of: (i) 225.5 million, or 14.0 , in savings and money market deposits; (ii) 106.5 million, or 4.6 , in time deposits; and (iii) 55.1 million, or 3.9 , in noninterest bearing demand deposits. These increases were partially offset by a decrease of 171.0 million, or 6.7 in interest bearing deposits. 
 
 The 106.5 million, or 4.6 , net increase in time deposits includes an increase of 124.4 million, or 7.9 in customer CDs. This was partially offset by a decrease of 17.9 million, or 2.5 in brokered time deposits. 
 
 The 171.0 million, or 6.7 decrease in interest-bearing demand deposits was primarily due to decreases in higher-cost municipal deposits, as well as international personal deposit accounts during the period. 
 
 As of September 30, 2024 total brokered deposits were 701.8 million, a decrease of 35.1 million, or 4.8 , compared to 736.9 million at December 31, 2023.

 (1) Includes brokered deposits of 701.8 million and 736.9 million at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. 
 (2) Based upon the diligence we customarily perform to "know our customers" for anti-money laundering, OFAC and sanctions purposes, we believe that the U.S. economic embargo on certain Venezuelan persons will not adversely affect our Venezuelan customer relationships, generally. 
 (3) Our other foreign deposits do not include deposits from Venezuelan resident customers. 
 105 

Our domestic deposits increased 123.3 million, or 2.3 , in the nine months ended September 30, 2024, primarily driven by increases of: (i) 236.1 million in savings and money market accounts; (ii) 29.0 million in domestic noninterest bearing accounts; and (iii) 43.8 million in domestic customer time deposits. These increases were partially offset by decreases of: (i) 173.8 million in domestic interest bearing accounts; and (ii) 11.8 million in domestic brokered time deposits. 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, total foreign deposits increased 92.8 million, or 3.8 , primarily driven by an increase of 16.3 million, or 0.9 , in deposits from customers domiciled in Venezuela, mostly in time deposits and noninterest bearing deposits. There was also an increase of 76.5 million, or 12.9 , in deposits from countries other than Venezuela. 

Core Deposits 
 Our core deposits were 5.71 billion and 5.60 billion as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. Core deposits represented 70.4 and 70.9 of our total deposits at those dates, respectively. The increase of 109.6 million, or 2.0 , in core deposits in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was mainly driven by increase in savings and money market deposits. We define core deposits as total deposits excluding all time deposits. 
 
 Brokered Deposits 
 We utilize brokered deposits primarily as an asset/liability management tool. As of September 30, 2024, we had 701.8 million in brokered deposits, which represented 8.7 of our total deposits at that date (9.3 as of December 31, 2023). As of September 30, 2024, brokered deposits decreased 35.1 million, or 4.8 , compared to 736.9 million as of December 31, 2023, mainly due to maturities of brokered time deposits, partially offset by new issuances during the period. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, brokered deposits included time deposits of 701.6 million and 719.5 million, respectively. We had no significant brokered interest bearing demand and money market deposits as of September 30, 2024. 17.4 million as of December 31, 2023). The Company has not historically sold brokered CDs in individual denominations over 100,000. 
 
 Large Fund Providers 
 Large fund providers consist of third party relationships with balances over 20 million. At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, our large fund providers included 15 and 19 deposit relationships, respectively, with total balances of 783.7 million and 1.1 billion, respectively. The decrease in balances from large fund providers in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was mainly driven by the decrease in higher-cost municipal deposits as the Company continues its focus on depository relationships. 
 
 106 

Large Time Deposits by Maturity 
 The following table sets forth the maturities of our time deposits with individual balances equal to or greater than 100,000 as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023:

Short-Term Borrowings 
 In addition to deposits, we use short-term borrowings from time to time, such as advances from the FHLB and borrowings from other banks, as a source of funds to meet the daily liquidity needs of our customers and fund growth in earning assets. Short-term borrowings have maturities of 12 months or less as of the reported period-end. 
 There were no outstanding short-term borrowings as of September 30, 2024. Short-term borrowings outstanding at December 31, 2023 matured in January 2024. There were no other short-term borrowings outstanding in the nine months ended September 30, 2024. All of our outstanding short-term borrowings at December 31, 2023 corresponded to advances from the FHLB. There were no other borrowings or repurchase agreements outstanding at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. 
 The following table sets forth information about the outstanding amounts of our short-term borrowings at the close of, and for the year ended December 31, 2023.

 __________________ 
 
 (1) In the three and nine month periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, potential dilutive instruments consisted of unvested shares of restricted stock, restricted stock units and performance share units. S ee Note 13 to our unaudited interim consolidated financial statements in this Form 10-Q for details on the dilutive effects of the issuance of restricted stock, restricted stock units and performance share units on earnings per share for the three and nine month periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. 
 
 During the three and nine month periods ended September 30, 2024, basic and diluted earnings per share decreased compared to the same period one year ago, primarily driven by the net loss recorded in the current periods compared to the net income earned in the comparable periods. 

Capital Resources and Liquidity Management 
 Capital Resources 
 Stockholders equity is influenced primarily by earnings, dividends, if any, and changes in accumulated other comprehensive income or loss (AOCI/AOCL) caused primarily by fluctuations in unrealized holding gains or losses, net of taxes, on debt securities available for sale and derivative instruments. AOCI or AOCL are not included in stockholders equity for purposes of determining our capital for bank regulatory purposes. 
 Total stockholders equity was 902.9 million as of September 30, 2024, an increase of 166.8 million, or 22.7 , compared to 736.1 million as of December 31, 2023. This increase was primarily driven by: (i) net proceeds of 155.8 million from the issuance of common stock in a public offering completed in the period, discussed below, and (ii) a decrease in AOCL due to reclassification into net loss of net accumulated unrealized losses previously included in AOCL on debt securities available for sale as a result of the Securities Repositioning. The increase was offset by: (i) a net loss of 32.6 million in the first nine months of 2024; (ii) 9.0 million of dividends declared and paid by the Company in the first nine months of 2024, and (iii) an aggregate of 7.6 million of Class A common stock repurchased in the first nine months of 2024. 
 108 

Common Stock Transactions 
 In the three and nine month periods ended September 30, 2024, the Company repurchased an aggregate of 143,674 shares of Class A common stock at a weighted average price of 21.59 per share, and 344,326 shares of Class A common stock at a weighted average price of 21.94 per share, respectively, under the 2023 Class A Common Stock Repurchase Program. The aggregate purchase price for these transactions was 3.1 million and 7.6 million in the three and nine month periods ended September 30, 2024, respectively, including transaction costs. 
 
 Public Offering 
 
 On September 27, 2024, the Company completed a public offering of 8,684,210 shares of its Class A voting common stock, at a price to the public of 19.00 per share, which included 784,210 shares issued upon the exercise in full by the underwriters of their option to purchase additional shares of common stock. The total gross proceeds from the offering were approximately 165 million, with net proceeds of approximately 155.8 million after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses payable by the Company. The Company intends to use the net proceeds of the Public Offering for general corporate purposes and to support its continued organic growth, which may include, among other things, working capital, investments in the Bank, resolution of non-performing loans, and potential balance sheet optimization strategies. 
 
 Dividends 
 Set forth below are the details of dividends declared and paid by the Company for the first nine months ended September 30, 2024: 
 
 Declaration Date Record Date Payment Date Dividend Per Share Dividend Amount 07/24/2024 08/15/2024 08/30/2024 0.09 3.0 million 04/24/2024 05/15/2024 05/30/2024 0.09 3.0 million 01/17/2024 02/14/2024 02/29/2024 0.09 3.0 million 
 Liquidity Management 
 We manage our liquidity based on several factors that include the amount of core deposit relationships as a percentage of total deposits, the level of diversification of our funding sources, the allocation and amount of our deposits among deposit types, the short-term funding sources used to fund assets, the amount of non-deposit funding used to fund assets, the availability of unused funding sources, off-balance sheet obligations, the amount of cash and liquid securities we hold, the availability of assets readily convertible into cash without undue loss, the characteristics and maturities of our assets when compared to the characteristics of our liabilities and other factors. 
 Liquidity risk management is a relevant element of our asset/liability management. Our contingency funding plan is constantly monitored by our Assets and Liabilities Committee and serves as the basis to identify our liquidity needs. The contingency funding plan models several liquidity stress scenarios to evaluate different potential liquidity outflows or funding gaps resulting from economic disruptions and volatility in the financial markets, among other factors. 
 
 Customer deposits have been our principal source of funding, supplemented by our investment securities portfolio, our short-term and long-term borrowings as well as loan repayments and amortizations. The Company s liquidity position includes cash and cash equivalents of 671.8 million at September 30, 2024, compared to 321.9 million at December 31, 2023. 
 109 

At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company had 915.0 million and 645.0 million, respectively, of outstanding advances from the FHLB. At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we had an additional 1.9 billion and 2.1 billion, respectively, of remaining credit availability with the FHLB, and 1.6 billion, and 1.9 billion, respectively, of FHLB borrowing capacity. This additional borrowing capacity is determined by the FHLB. In the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company repaid 1.1 billion in advances from the FHLB, and borrowed 1.4 billion from this source. In the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company had no significant gains or losses on the repayments of the advances from the FHLB. These repayments are part of the Company s asset/liability management strategies. 
 There were no other borrowings as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. 
 
 We also have available uncommitted federal funds lines with several banks. We had no outstanding borrowings under uncommitted federal funds lines with banks at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. 
 Holding Company 
 
 We are a corporation separate and apart from the Bank and, therefore, must provide for our own liquidity. Historically, our main source of funding has been dividends declared and paid to us by the Bank. The Company is the obligor and guarantor on our junior subordinated debt and the guarantor of the Senior Notes and Subordinated Notes. As previously discussed, On September 27, 2024, the Company completed a public offering of its common stock, which resulted in net proceeds to the Company of 155.8 million recorded in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024. Following the completion of this offering, the Company contributed cash totaling 90 million to its Bank subsidiary also recorded in the same periods of 2024. 
 The Company held cash and cash equivalents mainly at the Bank of 106.4 million as of September 30, 2024 and 46.8 million as of December 31, 2023, in funds available to service its Senior Notes, Subordinated Notes and junior subordinated debt and for general corporate purposes, as a separate stand-alone entity. 
 Subsidiary Dividends 
 There are statutory and regulatory limitations that affect the ability of the Bank to pay dividends to the Company. These limitations exclude the effects of AOCI/AOCL. Management believes that these limitations will not affect the Company s ability to meet its ongoing short-term cash obligations. See Supervision and Regulation in the 2023 Form 10-K. 
 In December 2023, the Board of Directors of the Bank approved the payment of a cash dividend of 20 million by the Bank to the Company. The Company received this dividend from the Bank in the first quarter of 2024. 
 Based on our current outlook, we believe that net income, advances from the FHLB, available other borrowings and any dividends paid to us by the Bank will be sufficient to fund liquidity requirements for the foreseeable future.

Contractual Obligations 
 In the normal course of business, we and our subsidiaries enter into various contractual obligations that may require future cash payments. Significant commitments for future cash obligations include capital expenditures related to operating leases, certain binding agreements we have entered into for services including outsourcing of technology services, advertising and other services, and other borrowing arrangements which are not material to our liquidity needs. We currently anticipate that our available funds, credit facilities, and cash flows from operations will be sufficient to meet our operational cash needs for the foreseeable future. Other than the changes discussed herein, there have been no material changes to the contractual obligations previously disclosed in the 2023 Form 10-K. 
 
 In the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company borrowed 1.4 billion in advances from the FHLB and repaid 1.1 billion of these borrowings. 
 In the nine months ended September 30, 2024, total time deposits increased 106.5 million, or 4.6 . See Deposits for additional information.

ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 
 We believe interest rate and price risks are the most significant market risks impacting us. We monitor and evaluate these risks using sensitivity analyses to measure the effects on earnings, equity and the available for sale portfolio mark-to-market exposure, of changes in market interest rates. Exposures are managed to a set of limits previously approved by our Board of Directors and monitored by management. See discussions below for material changes in our market risk exposure as compared to those discussed in our 2023 Form 10-K, Part II, Item 7A, Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk . 
 
 Earnings Sensitivity 
 The following table shows the sensitivity of our net interest income as a function of modeled interest rate changes: 
 Change in earnings (1) 
 September 30, December 31, (in thousands, except percentages) 2024 2023 Change in Interest Rates (Basis points) Increase of 200 26,678 7.4 20,487 6.1 Increase of 100 20,741 5.8 15,618 4.7 Decrease of 50 (7,139) (2.0) (3,923) (1.2) Decrease of 100 (14,745) (4.1) (10,273) (3.1) Decrease of 200 (33,978) (9.4) (21,290) (6.3) 
 __________________ 
 (1) Represents the change in net interest income, and the percentage that change represents of the base scenario net interest income. The base scenario assumes (i) flat interest rates over the next 12 months, (ii) that total financial instrument balances are kept constant over time and (iii) that interest rate shocks are instant and parallel to the yield curve, for the various interest rates and indices that affect our net interest income. 
 113 

Net interest income in the base scenario increased to approximately 361.0 million in the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 336.0 million as of December 31, 2023. This increase is mainly due to (i) the growth in the size of the balance sheet as total assets increased 636.8 million, or 6.6 , in the first nine months of 2024 compared to December 31, 2023; and (ii) loan production at higher rates. This was partially offset by the higher cost of total deposits and borrowings. 
 
 The Company periodically reviews the scenarios used for earnings sensitivity to reflect market conditions. 
 
 Economic Value of Equity (EVE) Analysis 
 
 The following table shows the sensitivity of our EVE as a function of interest rate changes as of the periods presented: 
 Change in equity (1) 
 September 30, December 31, 2024 2023 Change in Interest Rates (Basis points) Increase of 200 (12.35) (4.66) Increase of 100 (3.63) (0.38) Decrease of 50 2.27 3.61 Decrease of 100 3.29 1.83 Decrease of 200 2.74 2.73 
 __________________ 
 (1) Represents the percentage of equity change in a static balance sheet analysis assuming interest rate shocks are instant and parallel to the yield curves for the various interest rates and indices that affect our net interest income. 

During the periods reported, the modeled effects on the EVE remained within established Company risk limits. 
 
 Available for Sale Portfolio mark-to-market exposure 
 
 The Company measures the potential change in the market price of its investment portfolio, and the resulting potential change on its equity for different interest rate scenarios. This table shows the result of this test as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023: 
 
 Change in market value (1) 
 September 30, December 31, (in thousands) 2024 2023 Change in Interest Rates (Basis points) Increase of 200 (160,834) (112,010) Increase of 100 (79,879) (54,182) Decrease of 50 37,962 34,956 Decrease of 100 
 74,035 55,312 Decrease of 200 
 134,936 112,809 
 __________________ 
 (1) Represents the amounts by which the investment portfolio mark-to-market would change assuming rate shocks that are instant and parallel to the yield curves for the various interest rates and indices that affect our net interest income. 
 
 114 

The estimated average effective duration of our investment portfolio decreased to 4.9 years at September 30, 2024 compared to 5.0 years at December 31, 2023, due to expected lower rates and the effect of the Securities Repositioning, previously discussed. Additionally, the floating rate portfolio increased to 14.3 at September 30, 2024 from 13.3 at December 31, 2023.

ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 
 Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 The Company maintains a set of disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the Company in reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act, is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer CEO and Chief Financial Officer CFO ), as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures. The CEO and the CFO, with assistance from other members of management, have evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of September 30, 2024, and, based on their evaluation, have concluded that the disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of such date. 
 
 Limitations on Effectiveness of Controls and Procedures 
 In designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance of achieving the desired control objectives. In addition, the design of disclosure controls and procedures must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and that management is required to apply judgment in evaluating the benefits of possible controls and procedures relative to their costs. 
 
 Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 
 There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting identified in connection with the evaluation required by Rule 13a-15(d) and 15d-15(d) of the Exchange Act that occurred during the period covered by this Form 10-Q that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 

116 

PART II. OTHER INFORMATION 

ITEM 1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS 
 In the normal course of business, we become involved in litigation and other legal proceedings arising from the banking, financial, and other activities we conduct. Based on the information presently available, and after consultation with legal counsel, management believes that the ultimate outcome in such litigation and legal proceedings, in the aggregate, will not have a material adverse effect on our business, our financial condition, or the results of our operations. Where appropriate, reserves for these various matters of litigation and/or other legal proceedings are established, under FASB ASC Topic 450, Contingencies, based in part upon management s judgment and the advice of legal counsel. 
 
 ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS 
 For detailed information about certain risk factors that could materially affect our business, financial condition or future results see "Risk Factors" in Part I, Item 1A of the 2023 Form 10-K and the Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2024. Set forth below are material changes to our existing risk factors previously disclosed in the 2023 Form 10-K and the Form 10-Q for the quarters ended March 31, 2024 . Other than the risk factor set forth below, there have been no material changes to the risk factors previously disclosed in the 2023 Form 10-K and the Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2024. 
 
 Our principal shareholders and management own a significant percentage of our shares of voting common stock and will be able to exert significant control over matters subject to shareholder approval. 
 
 As of September 30, 2024, our executive officers, directors and each of our greater than 5 holders of our common stock beneficially owned outstanding shares of Class A voting and non-voting common stock representing, in the aggregate, approximately 29 of the outstanding shares of our Class A voting and non-voting common stock (without giving effect to the broad family holdings of the Capriles, Marturet, and Vollmer families, which will bring the percentage to an aggregate of approximately 51 ). As a result, these shareholders, if they act individually or together, may exert a significant degree of influence over our management and affairs and over matters requiring shareholder approval, including the election of directors and approval of significant corporate transactions, such as mergers, the sale of substantially all of our assets and other extraordinary corporate matters. 
 
 Furthermore, the interests of these shareholders may not always coincide with the interests of other shareholders, including you and, accordingly, they could cause us to enter into transactions or agreements which we might not otherwise consider or prevent us from adopting actions that we might otherwise implement.
