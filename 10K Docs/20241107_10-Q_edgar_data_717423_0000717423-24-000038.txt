 key geographic segments: the United States (U.S.) and Canada. Additionally, revenue from sales to customers is generated from primary revenue streams: crude oil and condensate, natural gas liquids (NGL), and natural gas. 
 For operated oil and natural gas production where the non-operated working interest owner does not take in kind its proportionate interest in the produced commodity, the Company acts as an agent for the working interest owner and recognizes revenue only for its own share of the commingled production. The exception to this is the reporting of the noncontrolling interest (NCI) in MP Gulf of Mexico, LLC (MP GOM) as prescribed by GAAP. 
 U.S. - In the U.S., the Company primarily produces oil and natural gas from fields in the Eagle Ford Shale area of South Texas and in the Gulf of Mexico. Revenue is generally recognized when oil and natural gas are transferred to the customer at the delivery point. Revenue recognized is largely index-based with price adjustments for floating market differentials. 
 Canada - In Canada, contracts include long-term floating commodity index priced and natural gas physical forward sales fixed-price contracts. For the offshore business in Canada, contracts are based on index prices and revenue is recognized at the time of vessel load based on the volumes on the bill of lading and point of custody transfer. The Company also purchases natural gas in Canada to meet certain sales commitments. 
 Disaggregation of Revenue 
 The Company reviews performance based on key geographical segments and between onshore and offshore sources of revenue within these geographies.

Payment terms for the Company s sales vary across contracts and geographical regions, with the majority of the cash receipts required within 30 days of billing.

 The Company has not entered into any revenue contracts that have financing components as of September 30, 2024. 
 The Company does not employ sales incentive strategies such as commissions or bonuses for obtaining sales contracts. For the periods presented, the Company did not identify any assets to be recognized associated with the costs to obtain a contract with a customer. 
 Performance Obligations 
 The Company recognizes oil and natural gas revenue when it satisfies a performance obligation by transferring control over a commodity to a customer. Judgment is required to determine whether some customers simultaneously receive and consume the benefit of commodities. As a result of this assessment for the Company,

These impacts were partially offset by no tax applied to the pre-tax income of the noncontrolling interest in MP GOM. 
 The Company s tax returns in multiple jurisdictions are subject to audit by taxing authorities. These audits often take years to complete and settle. Although the Company believes that recorded liabilities for unsettled issues

 Commodity Price Risks 
 During the third quarter of 2024, the Company entered into natural gas swap contracts that will be effective in 2025. Under the swaps contracts, which mature monthly, the Company pays the average monthly price in effect and receives the fixed contract price on a notional amount of sales volume, thereby fixing the price for the commodity sold. During the third quarter of 2023, the Company did t have any crude oil or natural gas derivative contracts.

 Fair Values Recurring 
 The Company carries certain assets and liabilities at fair value in its Consolidated Balance Sheets. The fair value hierarchy is based on the quality of inputs used to measure fair value, with Level 1 being the highest quality and Level 3 being the lowest quality. Level 1 inputs are quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. Level 2 inputs are observable inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1. Level 3 inputs are unobservable inputs which reflect assumptions about pricing by market participants. 
 Nonqualified employee savings plan 
 The fair value of commodity (Henry Hub natural gas) swaps was based on active market quotes for Henry Hub (HH) natural gas. The before tax income effect of changes in the fair value of natural gas derivative contracts is recorded in (Loss) on derivative instruments in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. 
 As of December 31, 2023, there were outstanding commodity WTI crude oil or HH natural gas swaps and collars contracts subject to fair value measurement, r were there any commodity swaps and collars liabilities. 
 The nonqualified employee savings plan is an unfunded savings plan through which participants seek a return via phantom investments in equity securities and/or mutual funds. The fair value of this liability was based on quoted prices for these equity securities and mutual funds. The income effect of changes in the fair value of the nonqualified employee savings plan is recorded in Selling and general expenses in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. 
 In 2019, the Company acquired strategic deepwater Gulf of Mexico assets from LLOG Exploration Offshore L.L.C. and LLOG Bluewater Holdings, L.L.C. (LLOG). Under the terms of the transaction, in addition to the consideration paid, Murphy had an obligation to pay additional contingent consideration of up to million in the event that certain revenue thresholds were exceeded between 2019 and 2022; and million following first oil from certain development projects. The revenue threshold was not exceeded for 2019 or 2020; however, the threshold was met in 2021 and 2022. 
 In 2018, the Company, through a subsidiary, acquired Gulf of Mexico producing assets from Petrobras America Inc. (PAI), a subsidiary of Petr leo Brasileiro S.A. Under the terms of the transaction, in addition to the consideration paid, Murphy had an obligation to pay additional contingent consideration of up to million if certain price and production thresholds were exceeded beginning in 2019 through 2025; and million carry for PAI development costs in the St. Malo field if certain enhanced oil recovery projects were undertaken. The price and production thresholds were not exceeded for 2019 and 2020; however, the thresholds were met in 2021 and 2022. As of December 31, 2021, Murphy had completely funded the carried interest. 
 As of the end of the second quarter of 2023, the Company had remaining liabilities relating to prior acquisitions from PAI and LLOG. During the nine months ended September 30, 2023, the Company paid a total of million in contingent consideration payments.

 There continues to be an increase in regulatory oversight of the oil and gas industry at the federal level, with a focus on climate change and GHG emissions (including methane emissions). For example, federal methane regulations currently pending or enacted that would, among other things, require increased leak detection monitoring and repairs, stringent restrictions on venting and flaring, a new third-party monitoring program, and new fees on methane emissions from petroleum and natural gas facilities. In addition, there have been a number of executive orders issued that address climate change, including creation of climate-related task forces, directives to federal agencies to procure carbon-free electricity, and a goal of a carbon pollution-free power sector by 2035 and a net-zero emissions U.S. economy by 2050. Executive orders have also been issued related to oil and gas activities on federal lands, infrastructure and environmental justice. In addition, an international climate agreement (the Paris Agreement) was agreed to at the 2015 United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change in Paris, France. The Paris Agreement entered into force in November 2016. Although the U.S. officially withdrew from the Paris Agreement on November 4, 2020, the U.S. has since rejoined the Paris Agreement, which became effective for the U.S. on February 19, 2021.

This MD A includes forward-looking statements that involve certain risks and uncertainties. See Forward-Looking Statements at the end of this section. 
 Overview 
 Murphy Oil Corporation is a global oil and gas exploration and production company, with both onshore and offshore operations and properties. The Company produces crude oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids primarily in the U.S. and Canada and explores for crude oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids in targeted areas worldwide. Our production in the U.S. is primarily from offshore fields in the Gulf of Mexico and onshore in the Eagle Ford Shale area of South Texas. In Canada, we produce from the onshore fields Tupper Montney and Kaybob Duvernay, in British Columbia and Alberta, and we produce from the Hibernia and Terra Nova fields, located offshore Newfoundland in the Jeanne d Arc Basin. 
 Significant Company financial and operational highlights during the third quarter of 2024 were as follows: 
 Produced 191,273 barrels of oil equivalent per day (including NCI) 
 Maintained quarterly dividend of 0.30 per share or 1.20 per share annualized 
 Repurchased 194.1 million 196.2 million including excise taxes and fees) of common stock, or 5,374,191 shares, at an average price of 36.12 per share 
 Subsequent to the third quarter of 2024: 
 Issued 600.0 million of 6.000 senior notes due 2032, and used proceeds to tender an aggregate 521.1 million of senior notes due 2027, 2028 and 2029 
 Entered into new five-year, 1.2 billion senior unsecured credit facility, representing a 50 percent increase from previous facility size 

Murphy Oil Corporation s net income from continuing operations, including noncontrolling interest, for the three months ended September 30, 2024, was 151.7 million, a decrease of 126.5 million compared to the same period in 2023. Lower net income from continuing operations was driven primarily by lower revenues from production 192.7 million), higher lease operating expenses 29.5 million), and lower other income 12.7 million), and was partially offset by lower income tax expense 76.0 million), lower transportation, gathering and processing expenses 14.1 million), and lower depreciation, depreciation, depletion and amortization expenses 13.9 million). Lower revenues were primarily driven by lower oil production in the U.S., combined with lower oil prices. Higher lease operating expenses relate primarily to workover projects in the Gulf of Mexico. Lower other income represents unrealized foreign exchange losses. Lower income tax expense in the current period is driven primarily by lower operating income, in addition to an income tax deduction for prior years Australia exploration spend. Lower transportation, gathering and processing expenses and lower depreciation, depletion and amortization expenses were both driven by lower production in the U.S. 
 For the three months ended September 30, 2024 total hydrocarbon production was 191,273 barrels of oil equivalent per day, a decrease of 8 compared to the third quarter of 2023. The decrease was principally due to lower production in the U.S., primarily in the Gulf of Mexico, due to workover activities and downtime, and in the Eagle Ford Shale, due primarily to the timing of new wells. Decreases in the U.S. were offset by increases in Canada at both Terra Nova, which restarted production in late 2023.

 Overview (Continued) 

 Murphy Oil Corporation s net income from continuing operations, including noncontrolling interest, for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 424.1 million, a decrease of 160.6 million compared to the same period of 2023. Lower net income from continuing operations was largely driven by lower revenues from production 196.7 million), higher lease operating expenses 129.2 million), and higher impairment of assets 34.5 million). These were partially offset by lower income tax expense 102.0 million), lower exploration expenses 34.1 million), higher other income 32.8 million), lower interest expense on long-term debt 26.4 million), and lower transportation, gathering and processing expenses 17.8 million). Lower revenues from production were primarily driven by downtime in the Gulf of Mexico and Eagle Ford Shale and lower natural gas prices, partially offset by higher year-to-date oil prices, higher production in Canada due to the restart of production at Terra Nova in late 2023, and well performance, combined with lower royalty rates at Tupper Montney. Higher lease operating expenses were primarily due to workovers in the Gulf of Mexico and higher production activity in Canada at Terra Nova, partially offset by lower production handling (PHA) fees in the Gulf of Mexico. Impairment charges related to the Calliope field were recorded in the first quarter of 2024. The decrease in income tax expense primarily relates to lower income tax expenses driven by lower overall income, in addition to an income tax deduction for prior years Australia exploration spend. Exploration expense in the current period was primarily due to dry hole expense recorded for multiple wells in the Gulf of Mexico, including Sebastian #1 (Mississippi Canyon 387) and Orange #1 (Mississippi Canyon 216), additional costs related to the Oso #1 (Atwater Valley 138) well, and for previously suspended exploration costs related to an expired lease at Hoffe Park #1 (Mississippi Canyon 166). Higher other income related to unrealized foreign exchange gains and interest income on several outstanding joint interest receivables. Lower interest expense was due to lower debt levels and lower transportation, gathering and processing expenses related to lower production in the U.S. 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 total hydrocarbon production was 185,286 barrels of oil equivalent per day, a decrease of 4 compared to the same period in 2023. The decrease was principally due to lower production in the U.S., primarily in the Gulf of Mexico due to downtime for workovers, and in the Eagle Ford Shale, due to timing of new wells. Decreases in the U.S. were partially offset by increases in Canada at both Tupper Montney, due to new wells online, and Terra Nova, which restarted production in late 2023.

 Revenues from production for the three months ended September 30, 2024 decreased 192.7 million compared to the same period in 2023. Revenue was lower in the Gulf of Mexico, mostly driven by downtime at the Samurai field, as well as hurricane related downtime. Additionally, Eagle Ford Shale revenues decreased due to the natural decline of wells and fewer wells brought online. These decreases were partially offset by new production at Terra Nova in Canada, which restarted production in late 2023. Lower pricing across all products also contributed to the decrease during the period. 
 Revenues from production for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 decreased 196.7 million compared to the same period in 2023. Lower revenue was driven primarily by workover activities, downtime and timing of new wells in the Gulf of Mexico, fewer new wells brought online in the Eagle Ford Shale, and lower realized natural gas prices in Tupper Montney. These effects were partially offset by production restarting at Terra Nova in late 2023, and higher oil prices. 
 Natural gas is purchased and subsequently sold to third parties in order to provide operational flexibility and cost mitigation for transportation commitments. Sales of purchased natural gas is included in Total revenues and other income and cost to purchase natural gas is included in Costs and Expenses in the summarized income statements for E P continuing operations on page 26 .

 For the three months ended September 30, 2024 lease operating expenses increased by 29.5 million and TGP expenses decreased by 14.0 million compared to the same period in 2023. Higher lease operating expenses were due to workover activity in the Gulf of Mexico and higher production at Terra Nova and were partially offset by lower PHA fees in the Gulf of Mexico. Lower TGP expenses during the quarter were a result of lower production volumes in the Gulf of Mexico. 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, lease operating expenses increased by 129.2 million and TGP expenses decreased by 17.8 million compared to the same period in 2023. Higher lease operating expenses were primarily due to workovers in the Gulf of Mexico, primarily at the Neidermeyer field, and higher production at Terra Nova, and were partially offset by lower PHA fees in the Gulf of Mexico. Lower TGP expenses resulted primarily from lower production volumes in the Gulf of Mexico.

 Results of Operations (Continued) 

 DD A expense for the three months ended September 30, 2024 decreased by 12.6 million compared to the same period in 2023. The decrease is primarily due to lower volumes in the Gulf of Mexico and at Eagle Ford Shale, partially offset by higher volumes in Canada Offshore and Onshore and higher rates in the U.S. due to development drilling. 
 DD A expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 increased by 2.9 million compared to the same period in 2023. Higher DD A expense from Canada E P primarily related to increased volumes at Terra Nova, partially offset by lower volumes in the U.S. and higher rates in the U.S., primarily due to development drilling at various offshore platforms. 

Impairment of Assets 
 For the three months ended September 30, 2024, there were no impairments. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company impaired assets for 34.5 million, related to the Calliope field in the Gulf of Mexico, as a result of operational issues that led to a reserve reduction. 
 There were no impairments in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023. 

Exploration Expenses 
 The Company s exploration expenses were as follows: 
 Three Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30, (Millions of dollars) 2024 2023 2024 2023 Exploration expenses 
 Dry holes and previously suspended exploration costs 11.2 11.3 69.5 107.8 Geological and geophysical 12.7 4.3 22.3 15.6 Other exploration 5.4 8.0 18.9 20.9 Undeveloped lease amortization 1.9 2.8 7.7 8.2 Total exploration expenses 
 31.2 26.4 118.4 152.5 
 Exploration expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2024 increased by 4.8 million compared to the prior year, primarily as a result of higher geological and geophysical costs in the Gulf of Mexico in the current period. Dry hole costs in the current period represented costs associated with the Sebastian #1 (Mississippi Canyon 387) operated exploration well in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico that encountered non-commercial hydrocarbons in the third quarter of 2024. In the third quarter of 2023, we recorded dry hole costs related to the Chinook #7 (Walker Ridge 425) exploration well in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico. 
 Exploration expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 decreased by 34.1 million compared to the same period in 2023. In the current period, dry hole costs were recorded for the Sebastian #1 (Mississippi Canyon 387) operated exploration well, the Orange #1 (Mississippi Canyon 216) non-operated exploration well, and for the previously suspended exploration well at Hoffe Park #1 (Mississippi Canyon 166) in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico. In 2023, we recorded previously suspended exploration costs for the Cholula-1EXP well in Mexico and dry hole costs for the Chinook #7 (Walker Ridge 425) exploration well in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico. 

Other 
 Other expenses for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 decreased by 1.1 million and 33.7 million, respectively, compared to the same periods in 2023. For the three months ended September 30, 2024 the decrease is primarily due to the absence of other operating expenses in Canada related to the Terra Nova life extension project. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 the decrease was due to a combination of interest income received and a favorable state tax settlement related to U.S. Onshore activities.

 Income Taxes 
 Income taxes for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 decreased by 75.9 million and 108.7 million, respectively, compared to the same periods in 2023. Lower income taxes for each period, respectively, were primarily the result of lower year-to-date pre-tax income, and an income tax deduction for prior years Australia exploration spend. 

Corporate 
 Corporate activities included interest expense and income, foreign exchange effects and corporate overhead not allocated to E P. 
 Corporate activities reported a loss of 33.7 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, an unfavorable variance of 3.6 million compared to the same period of 2023. The unfavorable variance was primarily due to unrealized foreign exchange losses 14.0 million), partially offset by decreased interest expense 8.8 million). Lower interest expense for the current period was primarily due to lower overall debt levels. 
 Corporate activities reported a loss of 88.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, a favorable variance of 16.5 million compared to the same period of 2023. The favorable variance was primarily due to lower interest expense 26.6 million) and unrealized foreign exchange gains 10.1 million) and was partially offset by increased selling and general expense 15.6 million) and lower income tax benefits 6.7 million). Lower interest expense for the current period was primarily due to lower overall debt levels. Higher selling and general expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 were primarily attributable to timing of corporate donations. Lower income tax benefit was the result of lower pre-tax losses. 

Financial Condition 
 The Company s primary sources of liquidity are cash on hand, net cash provided by continuing operations activities and available borrowing capacity under the New RCF. The Company s liquidity requirements consist primarily of capital expenditures, debt maturity, retirement and interest payments, working capital requirements, dividend payments, and, as applicable, share repurchases. The Company may, from time to time, redeem, repurchase or otherwise acquire its outstanding notes through open market purchases, tender offers or pursuant to the terms of such securities. 

Cash Flows 
 The following table presents the Company s cash flows for the periods presented: 
 Nine Months Ended September 30, (Thousands of dollars) 2024 2023 Net cash provided by (required by): 
 Net cash provided by continuing operations activities 1,295.4 1,205.7 Net cash required by investing activities 
 (733.3) (822.2) Net cash required by financing activities 
 (608.8) (547.4) Effect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents 0.8 (0.4) Net decrease in cash and cash equivalents 
 (45.9) (164.2) 
 Cash Provided by Continuing Operations Activities 
 Net cash provided by continuing operations activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 89.7 million higher compared to the same period in 2023. The increase in cash flows from operations activities was primarily attributable to a decrease in non-cash working capital in the current period, compared to an increase in the prior period 174.6 million), no contingent consideration payments related to prior Gulf of

 Mexico acquisitions in 2024 (2023: 139.6 million), changes in other operating activities, net 59.1 million), an increase in other income 32.8 million), and a decrease in interest expense 26.4 million). These were partially offset by lower revenue from production 196.7 million), and an increase in lease operating expenses 129.2 million). The increase due to changes in non-cash working capital is primarily due to lower accounts receivable, partially offset by lower accounts payable. The decreases in accounts receivable and accounts payable are primarily due to lower overall production volumes and gas prices, other receivable settlements, and exploration activities in the Gulf of Mexico. The increase due to changes in other operating activities is primarily due to spend on asset retirement obligations in the prior period. 
 Payments of contingent consideration are shown both in Operating Activities and Financing Activities in the Company s Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows; amounts considered as financing activities are those amounts paid up to the original estimated contingent consideration liability included in the purchase price allocation, at the time of acquisition. Any contingent consideration paid above the original estimated liability, included in the purchase price, are considered operating activities. During the nine months ended September 30, 2023, the Company paid a total of 199.8 million in contingent consideration, of which 139.6 million is shown in Operating Activities and 60.2 million is shown in Financing Activities in the Company s Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. As of the end of the second quarter of 2023, the Company had no further obligation payable for contingent consideration relating to prior Gulf of Mexico acquisitions. 
 Cash Required by Investing Activities 
 Net cash required by investing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 88.9 million lower compared to the same period in 2023. The decrease was due to lower property additions and dry hole costs 169.0 million), partially offset by cash inflows from the sale of certain non-core operated Kaybob Duvernay assets and all of our non-operated Placid Montney assets Kaybob properties 102.9 million) in 2023. 
 A reconciliation of Property additions and dry hole costs in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows to total capital expenditures for continuing operations follows. 
 Nine Months Ended September 30, (Millions of dollars) 2024 2023 Property additions and dry hole costs per cash flow statements 733.3 902.3 Acquisition of oil properties per the cash flow statements

 Lower capital expenditures in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period of 2023 was primarily attributable to lower exploration expenditures in the Gulf of Mexico, lower field development costs due to the Terra Nova asset life extension project ending in 2023, and lower development drilling costs at Eagle Ford Shale and Tupper Montney, partially offset by higher development expenditures at various Gulf of Mexico fields. 
 Capital expenditures in 2024 primarily relate to development drilling and field development activities at Eagle Ford Shale 246.8 million), at the Khaleesi, Mormont and Samurai fields, and the non-operated St. Malo and Lucius fields in the Gulf of Mexico 235.7 million), and at Tupper Montney 75.4 million), Kaybob Duvernay

 Exploration costs in 2024 were primarily comprised of activities in the Gulf of Mexico related to the Sebastian #1 (Mississippi Canyon 387), Orange #1 (Mississippi Canyon 216), and Oso #1 (Atwater Valley 138) exploration wells. Sebastian #1 and Orange #1 encountered non-commercial hydrocarbons during 2024. Oso #1 encountered non-commercial hydrocarbons in 2023, and operations completed in 2024. Additional exploratory costs relate to the Ocotillo #1 (Mississippi Canyon 40) exploration well. 
 Cash Required by Financing Activities 
 Net cash required by financing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 increased by 61.4 million compared to the same period in 2023. In 2024, the cash used in financing activities was principally for the repurchase of common shares 300.1 million), cash dividends to shareholders of 0.90 per share 136.2 million), withholding tax on stock-based incentive awards 25.3 million), distributions to the noncontrolling interest in the Gulf of Mexico 96.6 million), and debt repurchases of 50.0 million.

Liquidity 
 At September 30, 2024 the Company had approximately 1.1 billion of liquidity consisting of 271.2 million in cash and cash equivalents and 799.6 million available on its committed senior unsecured RCF with a major banking consortium. 
 The Company s 800.0 million senior unsecured RCF was set to expire in November 2027 and as of September 30, 2024 the Company had no outstanding borrowings under the RCF and 0.4 million of outstanding letters of credit, which reduce the borrowing capacity of the facility. At September 30, 2024 the interest rate in effect on borrowings under the facility would have been 7.20 . At September 30, 2024 the Company was in compliance with all covenants related to the RCF. Subsequent to quarter end, on October 7, 2024, the Company entered into a New RCF, a credit agreement governing a 1,200.0 million senior unsecured revolving credit facility with a maturity date in October 2029, which replaced the prior RCF.

 (255.2) (94.3) 
 As of September 30, 2024 net working capital decreased by 160.9 million compared to December 31, 2023. The decrease was primarily attributable to lower accounts receivable 80.9 million), lower cash balance 45.9 million), and higher operating lease liabilities 45.5 million), and was partially offset by lower accounts payable 17.1 million). 
 Lower accounts receivable was primarily due to lower revenues. Higher operating lease liabilities were primarily attributable to the current portion of lease extensions recorded during the period related to a drill ship in the

 Other Key Performance Metrics 
 The Company uses other operational performance and income metrics to review operational performance. Management uses adjusted net income, earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) and adjusted EBITDA internally to evaluate the Company s operational performance and trends between periods and relative to its industry competitors. Adjusted net income excludes certain items that management believes affect the comparability of results between periods. Management believes this information may be useful to investors and analysts to gain a better understanding of the Company s financial results. Adjusted net income, EBITDA, and adjusted EBITDA are non-GAAP financial measures and should not be considered a substitute for net income (loss) or cash provided by operating activities as determined in accordance with GAAP.

Outlook 
 The oil and gas industry is impacted by global commodity pricing and as a result the prices for the Company s primary products are often volatile and are affected by the levels of supply and demand for energy. As discussed in the Results of Operations section discussing revenues, on page 29 , lower average crude oil and natural gas pricing during the third quarter of 2024 compared to same period in 2023 directly impacted the Company s product sales revenue. 
 As of close on November 5, 2024, forward price curves for existing forward contracts for the remainder of 2024 and 2025 are shown in the table below: 
 2024 2025 WTI /BBL) 71.99 69.92 NYMEX /MMBTU) 2.67 3.00 AECO (US Equivalent/MCF) 1.31 1.45 
 Similar to the overall inflation in the wider economy, the oil and gas industry and the Company are observing higher costs for goods and services used in E P operations. Murphy continues to manage input costs through its dedicated procurement department focused on managing supply chain and other costs to deliver cash flow from operations. 
 We cannot predict what impact economic factors (including, but not limited to, inflation, global conflicts and possible economic recession) may have on future commodity pricing. Lower prices, should they occur, will result in lower profits and operating cash flows. For the fourth quarter of 2024, production is expected to average between 181.5 and 189.5 thousand barrels of oil equivalents per day (MBOEPD), excluding noncontrolling interest. 
 The Company s capital expenditure spend for 2024 is expected to be between 920 million and 1,020 million, excluding noncontrolling interest. Capital and other expenditures are routinely reviewed and planned capital expenditures may be adjusted to reflect differences between budgeted and forecast cash flow during the year. Capital expenditures may also be affected by asset purchases or sales, which often are not anticipated at the time a budget is prepared. The Company will primarily fund its capital program in 2024 using operating cash flow and available cash. If oil and/or natural gas prices weaken, actual cash flow generated from operations could be reduced such that capital spending reductions are required and/or borrowings under available credit facilities might be required during the year to maintain funding of the Company s ongoing development projects. 
 The Company plans to utilize surplus cash (not planned to be used by operations, investing activities, dividends or payment to noncontrolling interests) in accordance with the Company s capital allocation framework designed to allow for additional shareholder returns and debt reduction. Details of the framework can be found in the Capital Allocation Framework section of the Company s Form 8-K filed on August 4, 2022 and August 8, 2024. The Company s Board of Directors has authorized a share repurchase program whereby the Company can repurchase up to 1,100.0 million of the Company s common stock. 
 Subsequent to quarter end, on October 3, 2024, the Company closed the Offering of 600.0 million aggregate principal amount of new senior notes that bear interest at a rate of 6.000 per annum and mature on October 1, 2032, the proceeds of which will be used for the repayment of debt. To date, the Company has repurchased and canceled 258.8 million of the 2027 Notes, 200.2 million of the 2028 Notes and 62.1 million of the 2029 Notes. In addition, on October 7, 2024, the Company entered into a credit agreement governing a 1,200.0 million New RCF with a maturity date on October 7, 2029. Further details of these transactions can be found in the Company s Form 8-K filed on October 3, 2024 and October 7, 2024, respectively. 
 The Company continues to monitor the impact of commodity prices on its financial position and is currently in compliance with the covenants related to the RCF (see Note E ).

ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 
 The Company is exposed to market risks associated with interest rates, prices of crude oil, natural gas and petroleum products, and foreign currency exchange rates. As described in Note L to this Form 10-Q report, Murphy, at times, makes use of derivative financial and commodity instruments to manage risks associated with existing or anticipated transactions. 
 There were commodity transactions in place at September 30, 2024, covering certain future U.S. natural gas sales volumes for the remainder of 2025. A 10 increase in the respective benchmark price of these commodities would have increased the net payable associated with these derivative contracts by approximately 2.5 million, while a 10 decrease would have decreased the recorded net payable by a similar amount. 
 There were no derivative foreign exchange contracts in place at September 30, 2024. 

ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 
 Under the direction of its principal executive officer and principal financial officer, controls and procedures have been established by the Company to ensure that material information relating to the Company and its consolidated subsidiaries is made known to the officers who certify the Company s financial reports and to other members of senior management and the Board of Directors. 
 Based on the Company s evaluation as of the end of the period covered by the filing of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, the principal executive officer and principal financial officer of Murphy Oil Corporation have concluded that the Company s disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934) are effective to ensure that the information required to be disclosed by Murphy Oil Corporation in reports that it files or submits under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in SEC rules and forms. 
 During the quarter ended September 30, 2024, there were no changes in the Company s internal control over financial reporting that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company s internal control over financial reporting.
