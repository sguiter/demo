 Expenditures directly related to the development and improvement of real estate assets are capitalized at cost as land and buildings and improvements. Indirect development costs, including salaries and benefits and other related costs directly attributable to the development of properties, are also capitalized. We begin capitalizing development, construction, and carrying costs when the development of the future real estate asset is probable and certain activities necessary to prepare the underlying real estate for its intended use have been initiated. All construction and carrying costs are capitalized and reported in the balance sheet as properties under development until the apartment homes are substantially completed. As apartment homes within development properties are substantially completed, the total capitalized development cost of each apartment home is transferred from properties under development and land to buildings and improvements.

 We have a billion unsecured revolving credit facility which matures in August 2026, with two options to extend the facility at our election for two consecutive six-month periods and to expand the facility up to three times by up to an additional 500 million upon satisfaction of certain conditions. The interest rates on our unsecured revolving credit facility is based upon, at our option, (a) the daily or the one-, three-, or six-month Secured Overnight Financing Rate ("SOFR") plus, in each case, a spread based on our credit rating, or (b) a base rate equal to the higher of: (i) the Federal Funds Rate plus 0.50 , (ii) Bank of America, N.A.'s prime rate, (iii) Term SOFR plus 1.0 , and (iv) 1.0 . Advances under our unsecured revolving credit facility may be priced at the scheduled rates, or we may enter into bid rate loans with participating banks at rates below the scheduled rates. These bid rate loans have terms of or less and may not exceed the lesser of million or the remaining amount available under our unsecured revolving credit facility. Our unsecured revolving credit facility is subject to customary financial covenants and limitations. We believe we are in compliance with all such financial covenants and limitations as of September 30, 2024 and through the date of this filing. 
 Our unsecured revolving credit facility provides us with the ability to issue up to million in letters of credit. While our issuance of letters of credit does not increase our borrowings outstanding under our unsecured revolving credit facility, it does reduce the amount available. At September 30, 2024, we had outstanding letters of credit totaling approximately million and approximately billion available under our unsecured revolving credit facility.

The 2034 Notes were offered to the public at of their face amount with a stated rate of and a yield to maturity of . After deducting underwriting discounts and other offering expenses, the net proceeds from the sale of the 2034 Notes was approximately million. Interest on the 2034 Notes is payable semi-annually on January 15 and July 15, beginning July 15, 2024. We may redeem the 2034 Notes, in whole or in part, at any time at a redemption price equal to the principal amount and accrued interest of the notes being redeemed, plus a make-whole provision. If, however, we redeem the 2034 Notes on or after three months prior to their maturity date, the redemption price will equal 100 of the principal amount of the 2034 Notes to be redeemed plus accrued and unpaid interest on the amount being redeemed to the redemption date. The 2034 Notes are direct, senior unsecured obligations and rank equally with all of our other unsecured and unsubordinated indebtedness. In January 2024, we utilized a portion of the net proceeds from the 2034 Notes to repay the million, unsecured term loan due in August 2024 with a one year extension option to August 2025. As a result of the early repayment, we expensed approximately million of unamortized loan costs, which are reflected in the loss on early retirement of debt in our condensed consolidated statements of income and comprehensive income. 
 In January 2024, we utilized cash on hand to repay the principal amount of our senior unsecured notes payable, which had a maturity date of January 15, 2024, for a total of million, plus accrued interest. 
 In September 2024, we extended the maturity date of our million unsecured floating rate term loan with an unrelated third party from September 2024 to September 2026.

 Fair Value Hedges. From time to time, we utilize interest rate swaps to achieve an additional level of floating rate debt relative to fixed rate debt as we deem appropriate. We designate fixed to floating interest rate swaps as fair value hedges. The changes in fair value of these derivative instruments and the offsetting changes in fair value of the underlying hedged debt due to changes in the relevant benchmark interest rates are recorded in interest expense. At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we had one interest rate swap with a notional amount of million designated as a fair value hedge, which converted our million principal amount of fixed rate senior unsecured notes due November 2026 into a floating rate instrument with an interest rate based on a SOFR index. 
 Refer to Note 12, "Fair Value Measurements" for the outstanding derivative instruments and the corresponding fair value classifications.

Shares issued or to be issued are counted against the Share Limit as (1) to for every share award, excluding share options and share appreciation rights, granted, and (2) 1.0 to for every share option or share appreciation right granted. As of September 30, 2024, there were approximately million common shares available for grant under the 2018 Share Plan, which would result in approximately million shares which could be granted pursuant to full value awards conversion ratios as defined under the 2018 Share Plan.

In the event the holder of the share awards attains at least age 65, and with respect to an employee, also attains at least ten or more years of service ("Retirement Eligibility") before the term in which the awards are scheduled to vest, the value of the share awards to such individual is amortized from the date of grant to the individual's Retirement Eligibility date. All new share awards granted to individuals after they reach Retirement Eligibility vest on the date of grant.

 properties currently under construction to be approximately million. We expect to fund this amount through a combination of one or more of the following: cash flows generated from operations, draws on our unsecured revolving credit facility, the use of debt and equity offerings under our automatic shelf registration statement, proceeds from property dispositions, equity issued from our ATM program, and other unsecured borrowings or secured mortgages. 
 Litigation. We are subject to various legal proceedings and claims which arise in the ordinary course of business. Matters which arise out of allegation of bodily injury, property damage, and employment practices are generally covered by insurance. While the resolution of these legal proceedings and claims cannot be predicted with certainty, management currently believes the final outcome of such matters will not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial statements. 
 We have been named as a defendant in several cases alleging antitrust violations by a seller of revenue management software and owners and/or operators of multifamily housing, including us, which utilize this software. The complaints allege collusion among the defendants to fix rents in violation of Section 1 of the Sherman Act. The U.S. Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation has consolidated some cases, including those filed against us, into a single action in the United States District Court for the Middle District of Tennessee. We and our co-defendants formed a joint defense group which allows free communication and strategizing among us and our attorneys as well as allows us to combine efforts in drafting motions. In addition to those lawsuits, we and several other owners and/or operators of multifamily housing have been sued in separate actions by the Attorney General of the District of Columbia and the Attorney General of Arizona. Those lawsuits also allege collusion among the defendants to fix rents in violation of DC and Arizona law, respectively. Additionally, we were served with Civil Investigative Demands ("CIDs"), separately, by the U.S. Department of Justice ("DOJ") and the Attorney General of Texas. The CIDs are not lawsuits alleging wrongdoing but mechanisms by which the government can obtain information from companies regarding their use of the revenue management software. We have completed our compliance with the DOJ CID, and our compliance efforts with the Texas CID are ongoing. Furthermore, a federal grand jury subpoena was issued to us by the Antitrust Division of the DOJ requesting the production of information, documents, and records pertaining to our information technology infrastructure and systems, hardware, software, services, databases, and preservation of electronically stored information. We believe all of the lawsuits are without merit. We intend to vigorously defend these actions and are cooperating and responding to the Texas CID and subpoena. At this stage of the proceedings, it is not possible to predict or determine the outcome nor is it possible to estimate the amount of loss, if any, which may be associated with an adverse decision on any of these matters. 
 Other Commitments and Contingencies . In the ordinary course of our business, we issue letters of intent indicating a willingness to negotiate for acquisitions, dispositions, or joint ventures and also enter into arrangements contemplating various transactions. Such letters of intent and other arrangements are non-binding as to either party unless and until a definitive contract is entered into by the parties. Even if definitive contracts relating to the purchase or sale of real property are entered into, these contracts generally provide the purchaser with time to evaluate the property and conduct due diligence, during which periods the purchaser will have the ability to terminate the contracts without penalty or forfeiture of any deposit or earnest money. There can be no assurance definitive contracts will be entered into with respect to any matter covered by letters of intent or we will consummate any transaction contemplated by any definitive contract. Furthermore, due diligence periods for real

 Lease Commitments . Substantially all of our lessee operating leases, which are recorded within other liabilities in our condensed consolidated balance sheets, are related to office facility leases. We had no significant changes to our lessee lease commitments for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. The lease and non-lease components, excluding short-term lease contracts with a duration of 12 months or less, are accounted for as a combined single component based upon the standalone price at the time the applicable lease is commenced and is recognized as a lease expense on a straight-line basis over the lease term. Most of our office facility leases include options to renew and generally are not included in the operating lease liabilities or right-of-use assets as they are not reasonably certain of being exercised. If an option to renew is exercised, it would be considered a separate contract and recognized based upon the standalone price at the time the option to renew is exercised. Variable lease payments which values are not known at lease commencement, such as executory costs of real estate taxes, property insurance, and common area maintenance, are expensed as incurred. Rental expense totaled approximately million and million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and approximately million and million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively.

 of our adjusted taxable income. As a REIT, we generally will not be subject to federal income tax on our taxable income at the corporate level to the extent such income is distributed to our shareholders annually. If our taxable income exceeds our dividends in a tax year, REIT tax rules allow us to designate dividends from the subsequent tax year in order to avoid current taxation on undistributed income. If we fail to qualify as a REIT in any taxable year, we may be subject to federal and state income taxes for such year. In addition, we may not be able to requalify as a REIT for the four subsequent taxable years and may be subject to federal and state income taxes in those years as well. Historically, we have incurred only state and local income, franchise, and excise taxes. Taxable income from non-REIT activities managed through taxable REIT subsidiaries is subject to applicable federal, state, and local income taxes. Our consolidated operating partnerships are flow-through entities and are not subject to federal income taxes at the entity level. 
 We have recorded income, franchise, sales, and excise taxes in the condensed consolidated statements of income and comprehensive income for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 as income tax expense. Income taxes for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 primarily related to state income tax. We have significant temporary or permanent differences or tax credits associated with our taxable REIT subsidiaries.

Although we believe the expectations reflected in our forward-looking statements are based upon reasonable assumptions, we can give no assurance our expectations will be achieved. Any statements contained herein which are not statements of historical fact should be deemed forward-looking statements. Reliance should not be placed on these forward-looking statements as these statements are subject to known and unknown risks, uncertainties, and other factors beyond our control and could differ materially from our actual results and performance. 
 Factors which may cause our actual results or performance to differ materially from those contemplated by forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, the following: 
 Volatility in capital and credit markets, or other unfavorable changes in economic conditions, either nationally or regionally in one or more of the markets in which we operate, could adversely impact us; 
 Short-term leases could expose us to the effects of declining market rents; 
 Competition could limit our ability to lease apartments or increase or maintain rental income; 
 We could be negatively impacted by the risks associated with land holdings and related activities; 
 Development, repositions, redevelopment, and construction risks could impact our profitability; 
 Our acquisition strategy may not produce the cash flows expected; 
 Changes in rent control or rent stabilization laws and regulations could adversely affect our operations and property values;

 Insufficient cash flows could limit our ability to make required payments for debt obligations or pay distributions to shareholders; 
 Issuances of additional debt may adversely impact our financial condition; 
 We could be unable to renew, repay, or refinance our outstanding debt; 
 Rising interest rates could increase our borrowing costs, lower the value of our real estate, and decrease our share price, leading investors to seek higher yields through other investments; 
 Failure to maintain our current credit ratings could adversely affect our cost of funds, related margins, liquidity, and access to capital markets; 
 Share ownership limits and our ability to issue additional equity securities may prevent takeovers beneficial to shareholders; 
 The form, timing, and amount of dividend distributions in future periods may vary and be impacted by economic and other considerations; 
 Environmental, social, and governance factors may impose additional costs and/or expose us to new risks; 
 Litigation risks could affect our business; 
 Damage from catastrophic weather and other natural events could result in losses;

 Executive Summary 
 Camden Property Trust and all consolidated subsidiaries are primarily engaged in the ownership, management, development, reposition, redevelopment, acquisition, and construction of multifamily apartment communities. We focus on investing in markets characterized by high-growth economic conditions, strong employment, and attractive quality of life which we believe leads to higher demand for our apartments and retention of our residents. As of September 30, 2024, we owned interests in, operated, or were developing 177 multifamily properties comprised of 59,996 apartment homes across the United States. In addition, we own other land holdings which we may develop into multifamily apartment communities in the future. 
 Business Environment and Current Outlook 
 During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, our results reflect an increase in same store revenues of approximately 0.6 and 1.5 , respectively, as compared to the same periods in 2023. The increases were in part due to higher average rental rates, which we believe were primarily attributable to job growth, favorable demographics with a higher propensity to rent versus buy, and continued demand for multifamily housing in our markets. 
 We believe the levels of new multifamily supply in the submarkets and asset classes in which we operate continue to be elevated for the remainder of 2024 and into 2025, but should be met with continued demand to absorb these new deliveries. However, if this were to change or other economic conditions were to worsen, our operating results could be adversely affected. 
 Consolidated Results 
 Net income (loss) attributable to common shareholders was (4.2) million and 48.0 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and was 122.6 million and 181.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The 52.2 million and 58.4 million decreases during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the same periods in 2023, were primarily due to recognizing a 41.0 million impairment associated with land development activities. The decrease during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, was also due to recognizing a higher gain on sale of one operating property in 2023 of 48.9 million as compared to recognizing a gain on sale of one operating property in 2024 of 43.8 million. See further discussion of our 2024 operations as compared to 2023 in "Results of Operations," below. 
 Construction and Development Activity 
 At September 30, 2024, we had a total of five properties under construction comprising 1,746 apartment homes. As of September 30, 2024, we estimated the total additional cost to complete the construction of these five properties is approximately 267.0 million. 
 We stopped development activities for the foreseeable future on four of our developments in the third quarter of 2024 and recorded approximately 41.0 million of impairment charges on three of these land parcels. We review our long-lived assets on an annual basis or whenever events or circumstances indicated the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable and our impairment evaluations take into consideration the current and anticipated economic climate. We currently have three other land parcels held for future development we plan to develop. However, the commencement of future developments may be impacted by macroeconomic issues, multifamily market conditions, and other factors. We will continue to evaluate future development starts based on market, economic, and capital market conditions. However, there can be no assurance we will not have impairments charges in the future. 
 Disposition 
 In February 2024, we sold one operating property comprised of 592 apartment homes located in Atlanta, Georgia for approximately 115.0 million and recognized a gain of approximately 43.8 million. 
 Other 
 In January 2024, we issued 400.0 million of 4.90 senior unsecured notes due January 15, 2034. We utilized a portion of the net proceeds from these notes to repay the outstanding balance on our 300.0 million, 6.21 unsecured term loan due in August 2024. As a result of the early repayment, we expensed approximately 0.9 million of unamortized loan costs, which are reflected in the loss on early retirement of debt in our condensed consolidated statements of income and comprehensive income. 
 In January 2024, we utilized cash on hand to repay the principal amount of our 4.36 senior unsecured notes payable, which had a maturity date of January 15, 2024, for a total of 250.0 million, plus accrued interest. 
 On July 8, 2024, Hurricane Beryl impacted several of our multifamily communities in the Houston, Texas area. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, we expensed approximately 2.1 million of costs, net of anticipated insurance recoveries related to this hurricane.

Table of Contents 

 In September 2024, we extended the maturity date of our 40.0 million unsecured floating rate term loan with an unrelated third party from September 2024 to September 2026. 
 In September 2024, we utilized cash on hand and our unsecured revolving credit facility to repay the principal amount of our 3.68 senior unsecured notes payable, which had a maturity date of September 15, 2024, for a total of 250.0 million, plus accrued interest. 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we repurchased 515,974 common shares for approximately 50.0 million at an average price of 96.88 per share. As of the date of this filing, the remaining dollar value of our common equity securities authorized to be repurchased under this plan was approximately 450.0 million. 
 Future Outlook 
 Subject to market conditions, we intend to continue to seek opportunities to develop new communities and to redevelop, reposition, and acquire existing communities. We also intend to evaluate our portfolio and plan to continue our practice of selective dispositions as market conditions warrant and opportunities arise. We expect to maintain a strong balance sheet and preserve our financial flexibility by continuing to focus on our core fundamentals which we believe are generating positive cash flows from operations, maintaining appropriate debt levels and leverage ratios, and controlling overhead costs. We intend to meet our near-term liquidity requirements through a combination of one or more of the following: cash flows generated from operations, draws on our unsecured revolving credit facility, the use of debt and equity offerings under our automatic shelf registration statement, proceeds from property dispositions, equity issued from our 2023 ATM program, and other unsecured borrowings or secured mortgages. 
 As of September 30, 2024, we had approximately 1.0 billion available under our 1.2 billion unsecured revolving credit facility and do not have any debt maturing until April 2026. As of September 30, 2024, and through the date of this filing, we also had common shares having an aggregate offering amount of up to 500.0 million remaining available for sale under our 2023 ATM program. We believe we are well-positioned with a strong balance sheet and sufficient liquidity to fund new development, repositions, redevelopment, and other capital requirements including scheduled debt maturities. We will, however, continue to assess and take further actions we believe are prudent to meet our objectives and capital requirements.

 Land Holdings. At September 30, 2024, we also had four undeveloped land tracts with a valuation of approximately 57.8 million. 
 
 Results of Operations 
 Changes in revenues and expenses related to our operating properties from period-to-period are due primarily to the performance of stabilized properties in the portfolio, the lease-up of newly-constructed properties, and the impact of acquisitions and dispositions. 
 Management considers property net operating income ("NOI") to be an appropriate supplemental measure of operating performance to net income because it reflects the operating performance of our communities without an allocation of corporate level property management overhead or general and administrative costs. We define NOI as property revenue less property operating and maintenance expenses less real estate taxes. NOI is further detailed in the Property-Level NOI table as seen below. NOI is not defined by accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ("GAAP") and should not be considered an alternative to net income as an indication of our operating performance. Additionally, NOI as disclosed by other REITs may not be comparable to our calculation. 
 Reconciliations of net income to NOI for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 are as follows:

 Not a meaningful percentage. 
 (1) For 2024, same store communities are communities we wholly-owned and were stabilized since January 1, 2023, excluding communities under redevelopment and properties held for sale. Non-same store communities are stabilized communities not owned or stabilized since January 1, 2023, including communities under redevelopment and excluding properties held for sale. We define communities under redevelopment as communities with capital expenditures which improve a community's cash flow and competitive position through extensive unit, exterior building, common area, and amenity upgrades. Management believes same store information is useful as it allows both management and investors to determine financial results over a particular period for the same set of communities. Development and lease-up communities are non-stabilized communities we have developed since January 1, 2023, excluding properties held for sale. Dispositions/Other includes those communities disposed of or held for sale which are not classified as discontinued operations, non-multifamily rental properties, expenses related to land holdings not under active development, and other miscellaneous revenues and expenses, including net below market leases, casualty-related expenses net of recoveries, and severance related costs. 
 Same Store Analysis 
 Same store property NOI decreased approximately 0.1 million and increased approximately 7.2 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, as compared to the same periods in 2023. 
 The 0.1 million decrease in same store property NOI for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily due to an increase in same store property expenses of approximately 2.4 million which was offset by an increase of approximately 2.3 million in same store property revenues as compared to the same period in 2023. 
 The 2.3 million increase in same store property revenues during the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the same period in 2023, was primarily due to an approximate 0.8 million increase in average rental rates and lower uncollectible revenues of approximately 1.6 million, partially offset by 0.6 million of lower miscellaneous fee income. The increase was also due to approximately 0.5 million of higher income from our utility rebilling and ancillary income programs. 
 The 2.4 million increase in same store property expenses during the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the same period in 2023, was primarily due to higher utilities expense of approximately 1.9 million, higher salaries and benefits of approximately 1.8 million, higher repairs and maintenance expense of approximately 1.3 million, and higher marketing, leasing, and other expenses of approximately 0.6 million. These increases were partially offset by lower insurance expense of approximately 1.9 million and lower real estate taxes of approximately 1.3 million primarily due to higher refunds received.

Table of Contents 

 The 7.2 million increase in same store property NOI for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the same period in 2023 was primarily due to an increase of approximately 16.4 million in same store property revenues which was partially offset by an increase in same store property expenses of approximately 9.2 million as compared to the same period in 2023. 
 The 16.4 million increase in same store property revenues during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the same period in 2023, was primarily due to an approximate 7.5 million increase in rental revenues due in part to higher average rental rates, and approximately 7.3 million of lower uncollectible revenue. The increase was also due to 1.6 million of higher income from our utility rebilling and ancillary income programs. 
 The 9.2 million increase in same store property expenses during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the same period in 2023, was primarily due to higher salaries and benefits of approximately 5.0 million, higher utilities expense of approximately 3.9 million, higher repairs and maintenance expense of approximately 2.4 million, higher marketing, leasing, and other expenses of approximately 2.0 million, and higher property general and administrative expenses of approximately 0.6 million. These increases were partially offset by lower insurance expenses of approximately 3.5 million and lower real estate taxes of approximately 1.2 million. 
 Non-same Store and Development and Lease-up Analysis 
 Property NOI from non-same store and development and lease-up communities increased approximately 2.4 million and 7.6 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, as compared to the same periods in 2023. The increases were due to increases from non-same store communities of approximately 0.9 million and 5.7 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, as compared to the same periods in 2023, and increases from development and lease-up communities of 1.5 million and 1.9 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, as compared to the same periods in 2023. The increases in property NOI from our non-same store communities were primarily due to the stabilization of two operating properties in 2023 and one operating property in 2024. The increases in property NOI from our development and lease-up communities were primarily due to the timing of lease-up of two operating properties under development and one development community under lease-up, which completed construction during the second quarter of 2024. 
 The following table details the changes, described above, relating to non-same store and development and lease up NOI: 
 (in millions) For the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to 2023 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to 2023 Property Revenues: Revenues from non-same store stabilized properties 1.1 6.8 Revenues from development and lease-up properties 2.8 4.7 Other non same-store 0.1 3.9 11.6 Property Expenses: Expenses from non-same store stabilized properties 0.1 1.1 Expenses from development and lease-up properties 1.3 2.8 Other non same-store 0.1 0.1 1.5 4.0 Property NOI: NOI from non-same store stabilized properties 1.0 5.7 NOI from development and lease-up properties 1.5 1.9 Other non same-store (0.1) 2.4 7.6 
 Dispositions/Other Property Analysis 
 Dispositions/Other property NOI decreased approximately 9.1 million and 20.2 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, as compared to the same periods in 2023. The decreases were comprised of lower NOI related to dispositions of approximately 6.0 million and 18.4 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, as compared to the same periods in 2023. The decreases in NOI related to dispositions were due to the dispositions of one operating property in each of June 2023, December 2023, and February 2024. The decreases were also due to lower other property NOI of approximately 3.1 million and 1.8 million for the three and nine months ended September 30,

 2024, respectively, as compared to the same periods in 2023. The 3.1 million lower other property NOI was primarily due to recognizing higher storm-related expenses of approximately 2.1 million during the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the same period in 2023, and recognizing approximately 1.0 million of higher revenues related to business interruption proceeds during the three months ended September 30, 2023. The 1.8 million lower other property NOI for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily due to higher storm-related expenses of approximately 3.3 million, partially offset by approximately 1.1 million of higher revenues related to business interruption insurance proceeds for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the same period in 2023.

 Fee and asset management income from construction and development activities at our third-party construction projects, increased approximately 0.6 million and 3.2 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, as compared to the same periods in 2023. The increases were related to higher fees earned on third-party construction projects due to higher activity during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the same periods in 2023. 
 Interest and other income increased approximately 1.0 million and 3.9 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, as compared to the same periods in 2023. The increases were primarily due to higher investment interest income earned due to having higher average cash balances during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the same periods in 2023. 
 Our deferred compensation plans recognized income of approximately 8.2 million and 15.1 million during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, as compared to incurring a loss of approximately 3.3 million during the three months ended September 30, 2023 and recognizing income of approximately 5.4 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The changes were related to the performance of the investments held in deferred compensation plans for participants and were directly offset by the expense related to these plans, as discussed below.

 Property management expense, which represents regional supervision and accounting costs related to property operations, increased approximately 1.9 million and 4.1 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, as compared to the same periods in 2023. The increases were primarily related to higher salaries, benefits, and incentive compensation costs, and higher advocacy contributions. Property management expenses were approximately 2.5 and 2.0 of total property revenues for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and were 2.5 and 2.2 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. 
 General and administrative expense increased approximately 3.3 million and 6.9 million during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, as compared to the same periods in 2023. The increases were primarily related to higher salaries, benefits, and incentive compensation costs, higher legal expenses, and higher abandoned acquisition and development pursuit costs. Excluding income on deferred compensation plans, general and administrative expenses were

 approximately 4.8 and 4.0 of total revenues for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and were 4.6 and 4.0 of total revenues for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. 
 Interest expense decreased approximately 0.5 million and 2.2 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, as compared to the same periods in 2023. The decreases were primarily due to the repayments of a 300 million, 6.21 unsecured term loan and a 250.0 million, 4.36 senior unsecured notes payable in January 2024, the repayment of a 250 million, 3.68 senior unsecured notes payable in in September 2024, and lower interest expense recognized on our unsecured revolving credit facility resulting from lower average balances outstanding during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the same periods in 2023. The decreases were partially offset by increases in interest expense due to the issuance of 500 million senior unsecured notes in November 2023, the issuance of 400 million senior unsecured notes in January 2024 and slight decreases in capitalized interest expense primarily due to having lower average balances in assets under construction during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the same periods in 2023. The decrease in interest expense during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, was also due to the early retirement of 185.3 million of secured variable rate notes in May 2023 and the repayment of a 250 million, 5.07 senior unsecured notes payable in June 2023. 
 Depreciation and amortization expense increased approximately 1.5 million and 6.7 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, as compared to the same periods in 2023. The increases were primarily due to higher depreciation related to the completion of apartment homes in our development pipeline and the completion of capitalized improvements during 2023 and 2024. The increases were partially offset by the disposition of one operating property in each of December 2023 and February 2024. 
 Our deferred compensation plans incurred an expense of approximately 8.2 million and 15.1 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, as compared to recognizing a benefit of approximately 3.3 million during the three months ended September 30, 2023 and incurring an expense of approximately 5.4 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The changes were related to the performance of the investments held in deferred compensation plans for participants and were directly offset by the income related to these plans, as discussed in the non-property income/(loss) section above.

 The impairment expense associated with land development activities for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, of approximately 41.0 million related to three projects we have put on hold for the foreseeable future. These impairment charges represent the difference between each parcel's estimated fair value and the carrying value, which included the original purchase price and other capitalized development costs. 
 The 0.9 million loss on early retirement of debt for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was due to the write-off of unamortized loan costs related to the early retirement of our 300 million unsecured term loan which was scheduled to mature in August 2024. The 2.5 million loss on early retirement of debt during the nine months ended September 30, 2023 was due to the early repayment of our 185.2 million secured variable rate notes due in 2024 and 2026, and consisted of approximately 1.7 million of prepayment penalties and fees and approximately 0.8 million of unamortized fair value adjustments. 
 The 43.8 million gain on sale during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was due to the disposition of one operating property located in Atlanta, Georgia in February 2024. The 48.9 million gain on the sale during the nine months ended September 30, 2023, was due to the disposition of one operating property located in Costa Mesa, California in June 2023. 
 Income tax expense decreased approximately 0.4 million for each of the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the same periods in 2023. The decreases were primarily due to lower state and franchise income taxes relating to recent tax legislation changes in certain state jurisdictions, offset by an increase in taxable income due to higher third-party construction activities within a taxable REIT subsidiary.

Funds from Operations ("FFO"), Core FFO, and Core Adjusted FFO ("Core AFFO") 
 Management considers FFO, Core FFO, and Core AFFO to be appropriate supplementary measures of the financial performance of an equity REIT. The National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts ("NAREIT") currently defines FFO as net income (computed in accordance with GAAP), excluding depreciation and amortization related to real estate, gains and losses from the sale of certain real estate assets, gains and losses from change in control, impairment write-downs of certain real estate assets and investments in entities when the impairment is directly attributable to decreases in the value of depreciable real estate held by the entity, and adjustments for unconsolidated joint ventures to reflect FFO on the same basis. Our calculation of diluted FFO also assumes conversion of all potentially dilutive securities, including certain non-controlling interests, which are convertible into common shares. We consider FFO to be an appropriate supplemental measure of operating performance because, by excluding gains and losses on dispositions of real estate, impairment write-downs of certain real estate assets, and depreciation, FFO can assist in the comparison of the operating performance of a company's real estate investments between periods or to different companies. 
 Core FFO represents FFO as further adjusted for items not considered part of our core business operations. We consider Core FFO to be a helpful supplemental measure of operating performance as it excludes not only depreciation expense of real estate assets, but it also excludes certain items which, by nature, are not comparable period over period and therefore tends to obscure actual operating performance. Our definition of Core FFO may differ from other REITs, and there can be no assurance our basis for computing this measure is comparable to other REITs. 
 Core AFFO is calculated utilizing Core FFO less recurring capitalized expenditures which are necessary to help preserve the value of and maintain the functionality at our communities. We also consider Core AFFO to be a useful supplemental measure because it is frequently used by analysts and investors to evaluate a REIT's operating performance between periods or to different companies. Our definition of recurring capital expenditures may differ from other REITs, and there can be no assurance our basis for computing this measure is comparable to other REITs. 
 To facilitate a clear understanding of our consolidated historical operating results, we believe FFO, Core FFO, and Core AFFO should be examined in conjunction with net income attributable to common shareholders as presented in the condensed consolidated statements of income and comprehensive income and data included elsewhere in this report. FFO, Core FFO, and Core AFFO are not defined by GAAP and should not be considered alternatives to net income attributable to common shareholders as an indication of our operating performance. Additionally, FFO, Core FFO, and Core AFFO as disclosed by other REITs may not be comparable to our calculation. 
 Reconciliations of net income attributable to common shareholders to FFO, Core FFO, and Core AFFO for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 are as follows:

 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 Financial Condition and Sources of Liquidity 
 We intend to maintain a strong balance sheet and preserve our financial flexibility, which we believe should enhance our ability to identify and capitalize on investment opportunities as they become available. We intend to maintain what management believes is a conservative capital structure by: 
 extending and sequencing the maturity dates of our debt where practicable; 
 managing interest rate exposure using what management believes to be prudent levels of fixed and floating rate debt; 
 maintaining what management believes to be conservative coverage ratios; and 
 using what management believes to be a prudent combination of debt and equity. 
 Our interest expense coverage ratio, net of capitalized interest, was approximately 6.9 for each of the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, and 6.9 and 6.8 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. This ratio is a method for calculating the amount of operating cash flows available to cover interest expense and is calculated by dividing interest expense for the period into the sum of property revenues and expenses, non-property income, and other expenses, after adding back depreciation, amortization, and interest expense. Approximately 89.9 of our properties were unencumbered at both September 30, 2024 and 2023. Our weighted average maturity of debt was approximately 6.5 years at September 30, 2024. 
 Our primary source of liquidity is cash flows generated from operations. Other sources may include one or more of the following: availability under our unsecured revolving credit facility, the use of debt and equity offerings under our automatic shelf registration statement, proceeds from property dispositions, equity issued from our 2023 ATM program, and other unsecured borrowings or secured mortgages. We believe our liquidity and financial condition are sufficient to meet all of our reasonably anticipated cash needs during the next twelve months from our filing date including: 
 normal recurring operating expenses; 
 current debt service requirements including scheduled debt maturities; 
 recurring and non-recurring capital expenditures; 
 funding of property developments, repositions, redevelopments, and acquisitions; 
 the minimum dividend payments required to maintain our REIT qualification under the Code; and 
 funding share repurchases. 
 Factors which could increase or decrease our future liquidity include but are not limited to volatility in capital and credit markets, changes in rent control or rent stabilization laws, sources of financing, the minimum REIT dividend requirements, our ability to complete asset purchases, sales, or developments, the effect our debt level and changes in credit ratings could have on our cost of funds, and our ability to access capital markets. 
 Cash Flows 
 The following is a discussion of our cash flows for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the same period in 2023. 
 Net cash from operating activities was approximately 622.5 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to approximately 603.0 million for the same period in 2023. The increase was primarily due to a higher prepayment of rental income received from our residents, the growth attributable to our same store and non-same store communities, and lower interest payments on our secured and unsecured debt, partially offset by a decrease in cash from property operations due to the sale of two operating properties in 2023 and one operating property in 2024. See further discussion of our 2024 operations as compared to 2023 in "Results of Operations." 
 Net cash used in investing activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 totaled approximately 196.0 million as compared to 240.7 million during the same period in 2023. Cash outflows during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 primarily related to amounts paid for property development and capital improvements of approximately 306.6 million, partially offset by net proceeds from the sale of one operating property of approximately 114.5 million. Cash outflows during the nine months ended September 30, 2023 primarily related to amounts paid for property development and capital improvements of approximately 294.3 million, partially offset by net proceeds from the sale of one operating property of approximately 60.4 million. The increase in property development and capital improvements for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the same period in 2023, was primarily due to higher capital improvements and repositions

Table of Contents 

 expenditures in 2024 as compared to 2023. The property development and capital improvements during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, included the following: 
 Nine Months Ended September 30, (in millions) 2024 2023 Expenditures for new development, including land 129.7 127.4 Capital expenditures 82.0 75.2 Reposition expenditures 70.1 64.1 Direct real estate taxes and capitalized interest and other indirect costs 24.8 27.6 Total 306.6 294.3 
 
 Net cash used in financing activities totaled approximately 652.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to approximately 356.8 million during the same period in 2023. Cash outflows during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 primarily related to the repayment of our 250 million senior unsecured notes in September 2024 and the repayment of our 300 million unsecured term loan and the 250 million senior unsecured notes in January 2024. Cash outflows also related to 337.5 million used for distributions to common shareholders and non-controlling interest holders, and 50.0 million used for common share repurchases. These outflows were partially offset by net proceeds of approximately 396.0 million from the issuance of 400.0 million senior unsecured notes in January 2024, and net proceeds of 138.0 million of borrowings from our unsecured revolving credit facility. Cash outflows during the nine months ended September 30, 2023 primarily related to the repayment of 250 million senior unsecured notes and 187.7 million secured variable rate notes, which includes prepayment penalties and fees, and 324.4 million used for distributions to common shareholders and non-controlling interest holders. These outflows were partially offset by net proceeds of 405.0 million of borrowings from our unsecured revolving credit facility. 
 Financial Flexibility 
 We have a 1.2 billion unsecured revolving credit facility which matures in August 2026, with two options to extend the facility at our election for two consecutive six-month periods and to expand the facility up to three times by up to an additional 500 million upon satisfaction of certain conditions. The interest rates on our unsecured revolving credit facility is based upon, at our option, (a) the daily or the one-, three-, or six-month Secured Overnight Financing Rate ("SOFR") plus, in each case, a spread based on our credit rating, or (b) a base rate equal to the higher of: (i) the Federal Funds Rate plus 0.50 , (ii) Bank of America, N.A.'s prime rate, (iii) Term SOFR plus 1.0 , and (iv) 1.0 . Advances under our unsecured revolving credit facility may be priced at the scheduled rates, or we may enter into bid rate loans with participating banks at rates below the scheduled rates. These bid rate loans have terms of 180 days or less and may not exceed the lesser of 600 million or the remaining amount available under our unsecured revolving credit facility. Our unsecured revolving credit facility is subject to customary financial covenants and limitations. We believe we are in compliance with all such financial covenants and limitations as of September 30, 2024 and through the date of this filing. 
 Our unsecured revolving credit facility provides us with the ability to issue up to 50 million in letters of credit. While our issuance of letters of credit does not increase our borrowings outstanding under our unsecured revolving credit facility, it does reduce the amount available. At September 30, 2024, we had outstanding letters of credit totaling approximately 27.7 million and approximately 1.0 billion available under our unsecured revolving credit facility. 
 In May 2023, we created the 2023 ATM share offering program through which we can, but have no obligation to, sell common shares and we may also enter into separate forward sale agreements with forward purchasers for an aggregate offering amount of up to 500.0 million, in amounts and at times as we determine, into the existing trading market at current market prices as well as through negotiated transactions. Actual sales from time to time may depend on a variety of factors including, among others, market conditions, the trading price of our common shares, and determinations by management of the appropriate sources of funding for us. We intend to use proceeds from the sale of our common shares under the 2023 ATM program for general corporate purposes, which may include reducing future borrowings under our unsecured revolving credit facility, the repayment of other indebtedness, the redemption or other repurchase of outstanding debt or equity securities, funding for development activities, and financing for acquisitions. As of the date of this filing, we have not sold any shares or entered into any forward sales agreement and have common shares having an aggregate offering amount of up to 500.0 million remaining available for sale under the 2023 ATM program. 
 We believe our ability to access capital markets is enhanced by our senior unsecured debt ratings by Moody's, Fitch, and Standard and Poor's, which are currently A3 with stable outlook, A- with stable outlook, and A- with stable outlook, respectively. We believe our ability to access capital markets is also enhanced by our ability to borrow on a secured basis from 
 32 

Table of Contents 

 various institutions including banks, Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, or life insurance companies. However, we may not be able to maintain our current credit ratings and or borrow on a secured or unsecured basis in the future. 
 Future Cash Requirements and Contractual Obligations 
 One of our principal long-term liquidity requirements includes the repayment of maturing debt, including any future borrowings under our unsecured revolving credit facility. As of the date of this filing, we did not have any debt maturing during the remainder of 2024 through April 2026. See Note 6, " Notes Payable ," in the notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for a further discussion of our scheduled maturities. 
 As of September 30, 2024, we estimated the additional cost to complete the construction of five properties to be approximately 267.0 million. Of this amount, we expect to incur costs between approximately 23 million and 33 million during the remainder of 2024 and to incur the remaining costs during 2025 through 2027. Additionally, we expect to incur costs between approximately 20 million and 24 million of reposition, redevelopment, repurpose, and revenue enhancing expenditures and between approximately 28 million and 36 million of additional recurring capital expenditures. 
 We anticipate meeting our near-term liquidity requirements through a combination of one or more of the following: cash flows generated from operations, draws on our unsecured revolving credit facility, the use of debt and equity offerings under our automatic shelf registration statement, proceeds from property dispositions, equity issued from our ATM program, and other unsecured borrowings or secured mortgages. We continue to evaluate our portfolio and plan to continue our practice of selective dispositions as market conditions warrant and opportunities arise. 
 As a REIT, we are subject to a number of organizational and operational requirements, including a requirement to distribute current dividends to our shareholders equal to a minimum of 90 of our annual taxable income. In order to minimize paying income taxes, our general policy is to distribute at least 100 of our taxable income. In September 2024, our Board of Trust Managers declared a quarterly dividend of 1.03 per common share to our common shareholders of record as of September 30, 2024. The quarterly dividend was subsequently paid on October 17, 2024, and we paid equivalent amounts per unit to holders of the common operating partnership units. Assuming similar quarterly dividend distributions for the remainder of 2024, our annualized dividend rate would be 4.12 per share or unit.
