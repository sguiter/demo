Forward
Looking Statements 

This
report contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the
 Exchange Act ). Forward-looking statements are typically identified by the words believe, expect, 
 intend, estimate and similar expressions. Those statements appear in a number of places in this report and
include statements regarding our intent, belief or current expectations or those of our directors or officers with respect to, among
other things, trends affecting our financial condition and results of operations and our business and growth strategies. These forward-looking
statements are not guarantees of future performance and involve risks and uncertainties. Actual results may differ materially from those
projected, expressed or implied in the forward-looking statements as a result of various factors (such factors are referred to herein
as Cautionary Statements ), including but not limited to the following: (i) our loan origination activities, revenues and
profits are limited by available funds; (ii) we operate in a highly competitive market and competition may limit our ability to originate
loans with favorable interest rates; (iii) our Chief Executive Officer is critical to our business and our future success may depend
on our ability to retain him; (iv) if we overestimate the yields on our loans or incorrectly value the collateral securing the loan,
we may experience losses; (v) we may be subject to lender liability claims; (vi) our due diligence may not uncover all
of a borrower s liabilities or other risks to its business; (vii) borrower concentration could lead to significant losses; (viii)
we may choose to make distributions in our own stock, in which case you may be required to pay income taxes in excess of the cash dividends
you receive; and (ix) an increase in interest rates may impact our profitability. The accompanying information contained in this report,
including the information set forth under Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, 
identifies important factors that could cause such differences. Further information on potential factors that could affect our business
is described under the heading Risk Factors in Part I, Item 1A, of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended
December 31, 2023. These forward-looking statements speak only as of the date of this report, and we caution potential investors not
to place undue reliance on such statements. We undertake no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements. All subsequent
written or oral forward-looking statements attributable to us or persons acting on our behalf are expressly qualified in their entirety
by the Cautionary Statements.

2. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 

The
following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our unaudited
condensed consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. The discussion and analysis
contain forward-looking statements based on current expectations that involve risks and uncertainties. Actual results and the timing
of certain events may differ significantly from those projected in such forward-looking statements. 

We
are a New York-based real estate finance company that specializes in originating, servicing and managing a portfolio of first mortgage
loans. We offer short-term, secured, non-banking loans (sometimes referred to as hard money loans), which we may renew
or extend on, before or after their initial term expires, to real estate investors to fund their acquisition, renovation, rehabilitation
or development of residential or commercial properties located in the New York metropolitan area, including New Jersey and Connecticut,
and in Florida. 

The
properties securing the loans are generally classified as residential or commercial real estate and, typically, are not income producing.
Our loans are generally secured by a first mortgage lien on real estate. In addition, each loan is personally guaranteed by the principal(s)
of the borrower, which guarantee may be collaterally secured by a pledge of the guarantor s interest in the borrower. The face
amount of the loans we originated in the past seven years ranged from 40,000 to a maximum of 3.6 million. Our lending policy limits
the maximum amount of any loan to the lower of (i) 9.9 of the aggregate amount of our loan portfolio (not including the loan under consideration)
and (ii) 4 million. Our loans typically have a maximum initial term of 12 months and bear interest at a fixed rate of 9 to 13.5 per
year. In addition, we usually receive origination fees or points ranging from 0 to 2 of the original principal amount
of the loan as well as other fees relating to underwriting and funding the loan. Interest is always payable monthly, in arrears. In the
case of acquisition financing, the principal amount of the loan usually does not exceed 75 of the value of the property (as determined
by an independent appraiser) and in the case of construction financing, it is typically up to 80 of construction costs. 

Since
commencing our business in 2007, except as set forth below, we have never foreclosed on a property, although sometimes we have renewed
or extended the term of a loan to enable the borrower to avoid premature sale or refinancing of the property. When we renew or extend
a loan, we generally receive additional points and other fees. In June 2023, we filed a foreclosure lawsuit relating to
one property, as a result of a deed transfer from the borrower to a buyer without our consent. In that instance, the buyer of the property
on which we had a valid mortgage suffered a data breach which resulted in the failure of the buyer to remit the funds needed for the
loan payoff. In October 2023, we received the entire payoff amount for the loan receivable, including all unpaid fees, to rectify the
situation. 

Our
primary business objective is to grow our loan portfolio while protecting and preserving capital in a manner that provides for attractive
risk-adjusted returns to our shareholders over the long term through dividends. We intend to achieve this objective by continuing to
selectively originate, fund loans secured by first mortgages on residential and commercial real estate held for investment located in
the New York metropolitan area, including New Jersey and Connecticut, and in Florida, and to carefully manage and service our portfolio
in a manner designed to generate attractive risk-adjusted returns across a variety of market conditions and economic cycles. We believe
that current market dynamics specifically the demand/supply imbalance for relatively small real estate loans, presents opportunities
for us to selectively originate high-quality first mortgage loans and we believe that these market conditions should persist for a number
of years. We have built our business on a foundation of intimate knowledge of the New York metropolitan area real estate market combined
with a disciplined credit and due diligence culture that is designed to protect and preserve capital. We believe that our flexibility
and ability to structure loans that address the needs of our borrowers without compromising our standards on credit risk, our expertise,
our intimate knowledge of the New York metropolitan area real estate market and our focus on newly originated first mortgage loans, has
defined our success until now and should enable us to continue to achieve our objectives. 

A
principal source of new transactions has been repeat business from prior customers and their referral of new business. We also receive
leads for new business from banks, brokers and a limited amount of advertising. Finally, our Chief Executive Officer also spends a significant
portion of his time on new business development. We rely on our own employees, independent legal counsel, and other independent professionals
to verify titles and ownership, to file liens and to consummate the transactions. Outside appraisers are used to assist us in evaluating
the worth of collateral, when deemed necessary by management. We also use construction inspectors. 

For
the nine month periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the total amounts of 29,362,922 and 40,810,565, respectively, have been lent,
offset by collections received from borrowers, under our commercial loans of 33,749,887 and 44,512,989, respectively. 

At
September 30, 2024, we were committed to 8,147,338 in construction loans that can be drawn by our borrowers when certain conditions
are met. 

To
date, none of the loans previously made have been non-collectable, although no assurances can be given that existing or future loans
may not prove to be non-collectible or foreclosed in the future. 

We
satisfied all of the requirements to be taxed as a real estate investment trust REIT and elected to be taxed as a REIT
commencing with our taxable year ended December 31, 2014. In order to maintain our qualification for taxation as a REIT and avoid any
excise tax on our net taxable income, we are required to distribute each year at least 90 of our REIT taxable income. If we distribute
less than 100 of our taxable income (but more than 90 ), the undistributed portion will be taxed at the regular corporate income tax
rates. As a REIT, we may also be subject to federal excise taxes and minimum state taxes.

Results
of Operations 

Three
months ended September 30, 2024 compared to three months ended September 30, 2023 

Revenue 

Total
revenues for the three months ended September 30, 2024 were approximately 2,313,000 compared to approximately 2,434,000 for the three
months ended September 30, 2023, a decrease of 121,000 or 5.0 . The decrease in revenue was due to a reduction in loans receivable,
period over period, and reduced origination fees, which were impacted by a slowdown in new loan originations, partially offset by higher
interest rates charged on our commercial loans. For the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, approximately 1,953,000 and
 1,992,000, respectively, of our revenues were attributable to interest income on secured commercial loans that we offer to real estate
investors, and approximately 360,000 and 441,000, respectively, of our revenues were attributable to origination fees on such loans.
The loans are principally secured by collateral consisting of real estate and accompanied by personal guarantees from the principals
of the borrowers. 

Interest
and amortization of deferred financing costs 

Interest
and amortization of deferred financing costs for the three months ended September 30, 2024 were approximately 537,000 compared to approximately
 614,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2023, a decrease of 77,000, or 12.5 . The decrease is primarily attributable to the
decrease in interest expense due to a reduction in borrowed amounts related to the use of the Webster Credit Line. (See Note 5 to the
condensed consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this quarterly report on Form 10-Q). 

General
and administrative expenses 

General
and administrative expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2024 were approximately 380,000 compared to approximately 377,000
for the three months ended September 30, 2023, an increase of 3,000. The increase is primarily due to higher salaries, partially offset
by reductions in marketing expenses and legal fees. 

Net
income 

Net
income for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was approximately 1,399,000 compared to approximately 1,446,000 for the three
months ended September 30, 2023, a decrease of 47,000, or 3.3 . This decrease is primarily attributable to the decrease in revenue,
partially offset by the decrease in interest expense. 

Nine
months ended September 30, 2024 compared to nine months ended September 30, 2023 

Revenue 

Total
revenues for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 were approximately 7,330,000 compared to approximately 7,231,000 for the nine
months ended September 30, 2023, an increase of 99,000, or 1.4 . The increase in revenue was due to higher interest rates charged on
our commercial loans, partially offset by a reduction in loans receivable, period over period, and reduced origination fees, which were
impacted by a slowdown in new loan originations. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, revenues of approximately 6,128,000
and 5,889,000, respectively, were attributable to interest income on the secured commercial loans that we offer to real estate investors,
and approximately 1,201,000 and 1,342,000, respectively, of our revenues were attributable to origination fees on such loans. The loans
are principally secured by collateral consisting of real estate and accompanied by personal guarantees from the principals of the borrowers. 

Interest
and amortization of deferred financing costs 

Interest
and amortization of deferred financing costs for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 were approximately 1,831,000 compared to approximately
 1,856,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, a decrease of 25,000, or 1.3 . The decrease is primarily attributable to the
decrease in interest expense due to a reduction in borrowed amounts related to the use of the Webster Credit Line. (See Note 5 to the
condensed consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this quarterly report on Form 10-Q). 

13 

General
and administrative expenses 

General
and administrative expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 were approximately 1,225,000 compared to approximately 1,274,000
for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, a decrease of 49,000, or 3.8 . The decrease is primarily due to a special bonus awarded
to officers in 2023 for extending the Webster Credit Line and a reduction in marketing expenses, partially offset by higher salaries
and costs related to the filing of our registration statement on Form S-3 incurred in 2024. 

Net
income 

Net
income for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was approximately 4,285,000 compared to approximately 4,128,000 for the nine months
ended September 30, 2023, an increase of 157,000, or 3.8 . This increase is primarily attributable to the increase in interest income
from loans, partially offset by the decrease in origination fees. 

Liquidity
and Capital Resources 

At
September 30, 2024, we had cash of approximately 168,000, compared to cash of approximately 104,000 at December 31, 2023. 

For
the nine months ended September 30, 2024, net cash provided by operating activities was approximately 4,005,000, compared to approximately
 4,137,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease in net cash provided by operating activities primarily resulted
from the increase in interest and other fees receivable on loans and the decrease in deferred origination fees, partially offset by the
increase in net income. 

For
the nine months ended September 30, 2024, net cash provided by investing activities was approximately 4,383,000, compared to
approximately 3,697,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Net cash provided by investing activities for the nine months
ended September 30, 2024 mainly consisted of the collection of our commercial loans of approximately 33,750,000 (not including a 50,000 holdback), offset by the
issuance of commercial loans of approximately 29,363,000. Net cash provided by investing activities for the nine months ended
September 30, 2023, mainly consisted of the collection of our commercial loans of approximately 44,513,000, offset by the issuance
of commercial loans of approximately 40,811,000. 

For
the nine months ended September 30, 2024, net cash used in financing activities was 9,912,000, compared to approximately 7,805,000
for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Net cash used in financing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 reflects
the partial repayment of the Webster Credit Line of approximately 5,982,000, dividend payments of approximately 3,918,000, repurchase
of treasury shares of approximately 10,000 and deferred financing costs of approximately 2,000. Net cash used in financing activities
for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 reflects the partial repayment of the Webster Credit Line of approximately 3,561,000, dividend
payments of approximately 4,019,000, repurchase of treasury shares of approximately 186,000 and deferred financing costs of approximately
 38,000. 

Our
Amended and Restated Credit and Security Agreement with Webster, Flushing Bank and Mizrahi provides for the Webster Credit Line. Currently,
the Webster Credit Line provides us with a credit line of 32.5 million in the aggregate until February 28, 2026, secured by assignments
of mortgages and other collateral. The interest rates relating to the Webster Credit Line equal (i) SOFR plus a premium, which rate aggregated
approximately 8.4 , including a 0.5 agency fee, as of September 30, 2024, or (ii) a Base Rate (as defined in the Amended and Restated
Credit Agreement) plus 2.00 and a 0.5 agency fee, as chosen by the Company for each drawdown. 

The
Webster Credit Line contains various covenants and restrictions including covenants limiting the amount that the Company can borrow relative
to the value of the underlying collateral, maintaining various financial ratios and limitations on the terms of loans the Company makes
to its customers, limiting the Company s ability to pay dividends under certain circumstances, and limiting the Company s
ability to repurchase its common shares, sell assets, engage in mergers or consolidations, grant liens, and enter into transactions with
affiliates. In addition, the Webster Credit Line contains a cross default provision which will deem any default under any indebtedness
owed by us or our subsidiary, MBC Funding II, as a default under the credit line. Under the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, the
Company may repurchase, redeem or otherwise retire its equity securities in an amount not to exceed ten percent of our annual net income
from the prior fiscal year. Further, the Company may issue up to 20 million in bonds through its subsidiary, of which not more than
 10 million of such bonds may be secured by mortgage notes receivable, and provided that the terms and conditions of such bonds are approved
by Webster, subject to its reasonable discretion. In addition, the terms of the personal guaranty provided by Mr. Ran were amended such that the potential sums owed
under such guaranty will not exceed the sum of 1,000,000 plus any costs relating to the enforcement of the personal guaranty. 

14 

We
were in compliance with all covenants of the Webster Credit Line, as amended, as of September 30, 2024. At September 30, 2024, the outstanding
amount under the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement was 19,170,268. The interest rate on the amount outstanding fluctuates daily.
The rate, including a 0.5 agency fee, was approximately 8.4 as of September 30, 2024. 

MBC
Funding II has 6,000,000 of outstanding principal amount of Notes. The Notes mature on April 22, 2026, unless redeemed earlier, and
accrue interest at a rate of 6 per annum commencing on May 16, 2016 and will be payable monthly, in arrears, in cash, on the 15th day
of each calendar month, commencing June 2016. 

Under
the terms of the Indenture, the aggregate outstanding principal balance of the mortgage loans held by MBC Funding II, together with its
cash on hand, must always equal at least 120 of the aggregate outstanding principal amount of the Notes at all times. To the extent
the aggregate principal amount of the mortgage loans owned by MBC Funding II plus its cash on hand is less than 120 of the aggregate
outstanding principal balance of the Notes, MBC Funding II is required to repay, on a monthly basis, the principal amount of the Notes
equal to the amount necessary such that, after giving effect to such repayment, the aggregate principal amount of all mortgage loans
owned by it plus, its cash on hand at such time is equal to or greater than 120 of the outstanding principal amount of the Notes. For
this purpose, each mortgage loan is deemed to have a value equal to its outstanding principal balance, unless the borrower is in default
of its obligations. 

The
Notes are secured by a first priority lien on all of MBC Funding II s assets, including, primarily, mortgage notes, mortgages and
other transaction documents entered into in connection with first mortgage loans originated and funded by us, which MBC Funding II acquired
from MBC pursuant to an asset purchase agreement. MBC Funding II may redeem the Notes, in whole or in part, at any time after April 22,
2019 upon at least 30 days prior written notice to the noteholders. The redemption price will be equal to the outstanding principal amount
of the Notes redeemed plus the accrued but unpaid interest thereon up to, but not including, the date of redemption, without penalty
or premium. No Notes were redeemed by MBC Funding II as of September 30, 2024. 

MBC
Funding II is obligated to offer to redeem the Notes if there occurs a change of control with respect to us or MBC Funding
II or if we or MBC Funding II sell any assets unless, in the case of an asset sale, the proceeds are reinvested in the business of the
seller. The redemption price in connection with a change of control will be 101 of the principal amount of the Notes redeemed
plus accrued but unpaid interest thereon up to, but not including, the date of redemption. The redemption price in connection with an
asset sale will be the outstanding principal amount of the Notes redeemed plus accrued but unpaid interest thereon up to, but not including,
the date of redemption. 

We
guarantee MBC Funding II s obligations under the Notes, which are secured by our pledge of 100 of the outstanding common shares
of MBC Funding II that we own. 

On
April 11, 2023, our board of directors authorized a share buyback program for the repurchase of up to 100,000 of our common shares. Before this program expired on April 10, 2024, we had purchased an aggregate of 56,294 common shares at an aggregate
cost of approximately 271,000. 

We
anticipate that our current cash balances and the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, as described above, together with our cash flows
from operations will be sufficient to fund our operations for the next 12 months. In addition, from time to time, we receive short-term
unsecured loans from our executive officers and others in order to provide us with the flexibility necessary to maintain a steady deployment
of capital. However, we expect our working capital requirements to increase over the next 12 months as we continue to strive for growth
at the right conditions.
