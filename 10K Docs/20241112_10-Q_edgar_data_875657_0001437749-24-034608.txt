As of September 30, 2024, total unamortized debt issuance costs of , including placement, renewal and legal fees associated with the Amended Credit Agreement, are classified as a reduction of long-term debt on the balance sheet. Debt issuance costs are amortized to interest expense over the term of the Amended Credit Agreement. 

The remaining availability under the Revolving Credit Facility is subject to certain borrowing base limits based on trade receivables and inventories. 

The Company is required to repay the borrowings under the Term Loan Facility in equal consecutive monthly payments commencing on February 1, 2022, in arrears, together with applicable interest. All unpaid principal and accrued and unpaid interest with respect to the Term Loan Facility is due and payable in full on January 1, 2027.

The Company may voluntarily prepay principal amounts outstanding at any time subject to certain restrictions. 

In addition to the customary affirmative and negative covenants, the Company must maintain a consolidated senior leverage ratio, as defined in the Amended Credit Agreement, of equal to or less than to 1.0 for the fiscal quarters ending December 31, 2022 and March 31, 2023, and equal to or less than to 1.0 for the fiscal quarters ending June 30, 2023 and thereafter. The Company was in full compliance with its covenants under the Amended Credit Agreement as of September 30, 2024. 

Borrowings under the Amended Credit Agreement are secured by substantially all the assets of the Company and its subsidiaries. 

Interest accrues on outstanding indebtedness under the Amended Credit Agreement at the Daily Simple SOFR Rate, plus an index spread adjustment of , plus the applicable margin. Upon the effectiveness of the Fourth Amendment Agreement, the applicable margin ranges from to basis points and is determined based on the Company s senior leverage ratio. 

In addition, the Company must pay a fee of to based on the average daily unused availability under the Revolving Credit Facility. 

Payments must be made by the Company to the extent borrowings exceed the maximum amount then permitted to be drawn under the terms of the Amended Credit Agreement and from the proceeds of certain transactions. Upon the occurrence of an event of default, the outstanding obligations may be accelerated, and the Bank will have other customary remedies including resort to the security interest the Company provided to the Bank.

As of September 30, 2024, management has concluded it is more likely than not that these domestic NOL and credit carryforwards will be fully utilized. 

As of September 30, 2024, for certain past operations in the U.K., we continue to report a valuation allowance for NOL carryforwards of approximately , nearly all of which can be carried forward indefinitely. Utilization of the net operating losses may be limited due to the change in the past U.K. operation and cannot currently be used to reduce taxable income at our other U.K. subsidiary, Accutronics Ltd. There are no other deferred tax assets related to the past U.K. operations. 

As of September 30, 2024, we have not recognized a valuation allowance against our other foreign deferred tax assets, as realization is considered to be more likely than not.

Our U.S. tax matters for 2014 thru 2023 remain subject to examination by various state and local tax jurisdictions. Our tax matters for the years 2014 thru 2023 remain subject to examination by the respective foreign tax jurisdiction authorities.

Accrued warranty obligations ending 

Contingencies and Legal Matters 

We are subject to legal proceedings and claims that arise from time to time in the normal course of business. We believe that the final disposition of any such matters will not have a material adverse effect on the Company s financial position, results of operations or cash flows. However, recognizing that legal matters are subject to inherent uncertainties, there exists the possibility that ultimate resolution of these matters could have a material adverse impact on the Company s financial position, results of operations or cash flows. We are not aware of any such situations at this time.

million for the acquisition (the Acquisition subject to customary post-closing working capital and net cash adjustments. 

Based in Raynham, MA and with over forty years of battery technology experience in critical applications, Electrochem designs and manufactures primary lithium metal and ultracapacitor cells and battery packs serving energy, military and various environmental, industrial and utility end markets on a global basis. Acquiring Electrochem advances our strategy of more fully realizing the operating leverage of our business model through scale and manufacturing cost efficiencies. Electrochem brings a blue-chip customer base with little or no overlap with Ultralife s customers, long-tenured technical resources which we plan to utilize in progressing our global new product initiatives, and a complimentary portfolio of highly engineered thionyl, sulfuryl and bromine chloride cells and packs which can be commercially cost prohibitive to substitute or switch out. We view this acquisition as an avenue to create highly attractive opportunities to drive revenue growth through heightened cross-selling platforms and extend our reach into underserved adjacent markets that demand uncompromised safety, service, reliability and quality. In addition, the combination of Electrochem and Ultralife creates achievable opportunities for gross margin expansion through the realization of vertical integration, supply chain synergies and lean initiatives. With Electrochem we are increasing our value to our customers and significantly strengthening our competitive position in our end markets. 

The Company funded the purchase price for the Acquisition through the New Credit Agreement, as defined and described below. 

The Agreement contains customary terms and conditions including representations and warranties, subject to a mutually acceptable buyer-side representation and warranty insurance policy obtained by the Company, the cost of which was shared equally between the Company and the Seller. 

The acquisition of Electrochem will be accounted for as a business combination, and accordingly, the assets acquired and liabilities assumed will be recognized at fair value as of the acquisition date. The operating results and cash flows of Electrochem will be included in the consolidated financial statements from the date of acquisition in the Company s Battery Energy Products segment. 

Due to the timing of the acquisition, the initial accounting is not yet complete. The Company is in the process of preparing the preliminary estimate of the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed and the associated adjustments for the supplemental pro forma revenue and earnings information. 

For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company incurred non-recurring transaction costs of , including due diligence and consulting services. Such costs are reported as selling, general and administrative expenses. 

New Credit Agreement 

On October 31, 2024, Ultralife, SWE, CLB, Excell USA, and Electrochem, as borrowers, and certain other subsidiaries of the Company, entered into a new Credit and Security Agreement with KeyBank National Association KeyBank or the Bank ), as lender and administrative agent (the New Credit Agreement ). The proceeds of the loans under the New Credit Agreement were used, in part, to repay outstanding indebtedness under the Company s Amended Credit Agreement.

Overview 

Consolidated revenues of 35,694 for the three-month period ended September 30, 2024, decreased by 3,794 or 9.6 , from 39,488 for the three-month period ended September 30, 2023, reflecting decreases in government/defense sales of 14.1 and commercial sales of 6.8 . Sales for our Battery Energy Products segment increased 1.9 from 31,919 for the third quarter of 2023 to 32,529 for the third quarter of 2024, and sales for our Communications Systems segment decreased 58.2 from 7,569 to 3,165. 

Gross profit was 8,682, or 24.3 of revenue, for the three-month period ended September 30, 2024, compared to 9,774, or 24.8 of revenue, for the same quarter a year ago. The 50-basis point decline primarily resulted from lower factory volume and the lower-margin product mix for our Communications Systems segment. 

Operating expenses increased to 8,171 for the three-month period ended September 30, 2024, compared to 7,639 for the three-month period ended September 30, 2023. The increase of 532 or 7.0 was primarily attributable to investments in new product development, the addition of sales resources to support future growth, and the recognition of legal and other fees recognized in the period directly relating to the execution of a stock purchase agreement on September 27, 2024 to acquire Electrochem Solutions, Inc. Operating expenses represented 22.9 of revenues compared to 19.3 of revenues for the year-earlier period. 

19

Operating income for the three-month period ended September 30, 2024 was 511, or 1.4 of revenues, compared to 2,135 or 5.4 of revenue for the year-earlier period. The decrease in operating income resulted from a 9.6 decline in revenues, the cost of our investments in new product development, the cost of additional sales resources to support future organic growth and expenses directly relating to the execution of a stock purchase agreement on September 27, 2024 to acquire Electrochem Solutions, Inc. 

Net income attributable to Ultralife Corporation was 258 or 0.02 per share basic and diluted on a GAAP basis, compared to 1,330 or 0.08 per share basic and diluted for, the third quarter of 2023. 

Adjusted EBITDA, defined as net income (loss) attributable to Ultralife Corporation before net interest expense, provision (benefit) for income taxes, depreciation and amortization, and stock-based compensation expense, plus/minus expenses/income that we do not consider reflective of our ongoing operations, amounted to 1,919, or 5.4 of revenues, for the third quarter of 2024, compared to 3,480 or 8.8 of revenues, for the third quarter of 2023. See the section Adjusted EBITDA beginning on Page 23 for a reconciliation of adjusted EBITDA to net income attributable to Ultralife Corporation. 

Our top priorities continue to be gross margin increases through focused initiatives on material deflation and lean productivity and growing our opportunity funnels and customer wins to continue fueling our growth. We remain optimistic that we are well positioned to sustain long-term profitable growth. 

Results of Operations 

Three-Month Periods Ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023 

Revenues. Consolidated revenues for the three-month period ended September 30, 2024 were 35,694, a decrease of 3,794, or 9.6 , from 39,488 for the three-month period ended September 30, 2023. Overall, government/defense sales decreased 14.1 and commercial sales decreased 6.8 . 

Battery Energy Products revenues increased 610, or 1.9 , from 31,919 for the three-month period ended September 30, 2023 to 32,529 for the three-month period ended September 30, 2024. The revenue growth was primarily attributable to an increase in government/defense sales of 2,244 or 28.9 reflecting strong demand from our U.S.-based global prime, partially offset by a decrease of 1,634 or 6.8 in commercial sales, The decline in commercial sales primarily resulted from a 12.4 decrease in medical battery sales and a 10.9 in industrial market sales, partially offset by a 1.5 increase in oil gas market sales. 

Communications Systems sales decreased 4,404, or 58.2 , from 7,569 for the three-month period ended September 30, 2023 to 3,165 for the three-month period ended September 30, 2024. The decrease was primarily attributable to large shipments in the 2023 period of vehicle-amplifier adaptor orders to a global defense contractor for the U.S. Army and of integrated systems of amplifiers and radio vehicle mounts to a major international defense contractor for an ongoing allied country government/defense modernization program which had been delayed from earlier periods due to supply chain disruptions and the timing of orders for the current year period. 

Cost of Products Sold / Gross Profit. Cost of products sold totaled 27,012 for the quarter ended September 30, 2024, a decrease of 2,702, or 9.1 , from the 29,714 reported for the same three-month period a year ago. Consolidated cost of products sold as a percentage of total revenue increased from 75.2 for the three-month period ended September 30, 2023 to 75.7 for the three-month period ended September 30, 2024. Correspondingly, consolidated gross margin decreased from 24.8 for the three-month period ended September 30, 2023, to 24.3 for the three-month period ended September 30, 2024, primarily reflecting lower factory volume and product mix for our Communications Systems segment. 

For our Battery Energy Products segment, gross profit for the third quarter of 2024 was 8,047, an increase of 319 or 4.1 from gross profit of 7,728 for the third quarter of 2023. Battery Energy Products gross margin of 24.7 increased by 50-basis points from the 24.2 gross margin for the year-earlier period, primarily reflecting higher factory volume in our Newark, NY facility, partially offset by some inefficiencies resulting from delays in raw material components. 

For our Communications Systems segment, gross profit for the third quarter of 2024 was 635 or 20.0 of revenues, compared to gross profit of 2,046 or 27.0 of revenues for the third quarter of 2023. The 700-basis point decrease in gross margin was primarily due to lower factory volume and unfavorable product mix as compared to the year-earlier period. 

20

Operating Expenses. Operating expenses for the three-month period ended September 30, 2024 were 8,171, an increase of 532, or 7.0 , from the 7,639 for the three-month period ended September 30, 2023. The increase was primarily attributable to investments in new product development and the addition of experienced sales resources to drive organic sales growth and expenses directly relating to the execution of a stock purchase agreement on September 27, 2024 to acquire Electrochem Solutions, Inc. in the 2024 third quarter. 

Overall, operating expenses were 22.9 of revenue for the quarter ended September 30, 2024 compared to 19.3 of revenue for the quarter ended September 30, 2023. Amortization expense associated with intangible assets related to our acquisitions was 229 for the third quarter of 2024 204 in selling, general and administrative expenses and 25 in research and development costs), compared to 227 for the third quarter of 2023 203 in selling, general, and administrative expenses and 24 in research and development costs). Research and development costs were 2,101 for the three-month period ended September 30, 2024, an increase of 232 or 12.4 , from 1,869 for the three-month period ended September 30, 2023. The increase is largely attributable to the timing of new product development in both of our businesses as we aggressively pursue both government/defense major programs and commercial opportunities. Selling, general, and administrative expenses were 6,070 for the three-month period ended September 30, 2024, an increase of 300 or 5.2 from 5,770 for the third quarter of 2023. The period over period increase was primarily attributable to the recognition of legal and other fees incurred directly relating to the execution of a stock purchase agreement on September 27, 2024 to acquire Electrochem Solutions, Inc. and additional sales resources to support future organic growth. 

Other (Expense) Income. Other expense totaled 158 for the three-month period ended September 30, 2024, compared to 386 for the three-month period ended September 30, 2023. Interest and financing expense decreased 413, or 70.3 , from 586 for the third quarter of 2023 to 173 for the comparable period in 2024. The decrease is due to the continued paydown of debt in the third quarter of 2024. Miscellaneous income amounted to 15 for the third quarter of 2024 compared to 200 for the third quarter of 2023, primarily attributable to foreign exchange gains due to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. 

Income Taxes. The income tax provision for the 2024 third quarter was 74, compared to 446 for the third quarter of 2023. Our effective tax rate decreased to 21.0 for the third quarter of 2024 as compared to 25.5 for the third quarter of 2023, primarily attributable to the geographic mix of our operating results. The income tax provision for the third quarter of 2024 is comprised of a 173 current provision for taxes expected to be paid on income primarily from foreign jurisdictions and a deferred tax benefit of 99. For the comparable 2023 period, the income tax provision for the third quarter of 2023 is comprised of an 89 current provision for taxes expected to be paid on income primarily in foreign jurisdictions, representing a cash-based effective tax rate of 5.1 , and a 357 deferred tax provision which primarily represents non-cash charges for U.S. taxes that we expect will be fully offset by net operating loss carryforwards and other tax credits for the foreseeable future. The period over period change in the cash-based current tax provisions is primarily attributable to the geographic mix of our operating results. See Note 6 to the consolidated financial statements in Item 1 of Part I of this Form 10-Q for additional information regarding our income taxes. 

Net Income (Loss) Attributable to Ultralife. Net income attributable to Ultralife was 258, or 0.02 per share basic and diluted on a GAAP basis for the three-month period ended September 30, 2024, compared to 1,330, or 0.08 per share basic and diluted, for the three-month period ended September 30, 2023. Adjusted EPS was 0.01 on a diluted basis for the third quarter of 2024, compared to 0.10 for the third quarter of 2023. Adjusted EPS excludes the provision (benefit) for deferred taxes of 99) and 357 for the 2024 and 2023 periods, respectively, which primarily represent non-cash charges (benefits) for U.S. taxes that we expect will be fully offset by net operating loss carryforwards and other tax credits for the foreseeable future. See the section Adjusted EPS on Page 26 for a reconciliation of adjusted EPS to EPS. 

Weighted average shares outstanding used to compute diluted earnings per share increased from 16,303,139 for the third quarter of 2023 to 16,874,057 for the third quarter of 2024. The increase is attributable to stock option exercises since the third quarter of 2023 and a greater average stock price in the current quarter. Accordingly, dilutive shares of 249,082 were added to basic weighted average shares for the 2024 period compared to 65,275 for the 2023 period. 

21

Nine-Month Periods Ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023 

Revenues. Consolidated revenues for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024 were 120,604, an increase of 6,508, or 5.7 , over 114,096 for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2023. Overall, government/defense sales increased 5,507 or 13.5 and commercial sales increased 1,001 or 1.4 . On January 25, 2023, the Company experienced a ransomware cyberattack which impacted our ability to process orders, ship products, provide services to our customers and effectively manage our sales and operating planning process over a several week period for our Newark, NY location and an even longer period for our Virginia Beach, VA location. A large portion of our time during the quarter was devoted to data restoration, systems security augmentation, and regulatory reporting of the cyberattack, all of which were successfully accomplished with no ransom paid. Management continues to work on its cybersecurity insurance claim covering the cost of engaging external cybersecurity experts and the business interruption impact. 

Battery Energy Products revenues increased 9,951, or 10.6 , from 94,250 for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2023 to 104,201 for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024. The increase was attributable to a 8,950 or 42.8 increase in government/defense sales and a 1,001 or 1.4 increase in commercial sales. The increase in government/defense sales primarily reflects continued strong demand from our largest U.S.-based global prime. The growth in commercial sales was driven by a 4,146 or 16.7 increase in medical sales due to continuing surging demand for our core medical battery products from global medical device OEM s, partially offset by a decrease of 2,591 or 8.3 in oil gas sales and a 550 or 3.2 decrease in industrial sales due primarily to general economic conditions. 

Communications Systems revenues decreased 3,443, or 17.3 , from 19,846 for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2023 to 16,403 for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024. This decrease was primarily attributable to shipments of vehicle-amplifier adaptor orders to a global defense contractor for the U.S. Army and of integrated systems of amplifiers and radio vehicle mounts to a major international defense contractor for an ongoing allied country government/defense modernization program in 2023 and the timing of orders in 2024. 

Cost of Products Sold / Gross Profit. Cost of products sold totaled 88,889 for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024, an increase of 2,591, or 3.0 , from the 86,298 reported for the same nine-month period a year ago. Consolidated cost of products sold as a percentage of total revenue decreased from 75.6 for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2023 to 73.7 for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024. Correspondingly, consolidated gross margin increased from 24.4 for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2023, to 26.3 for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024, primarily reflecting higher factory volume, level loading of production and improved price realization for our Battery Energy Products Segment, tempered by lower volume experienced in our Communications Systems segment. 

For our Battery Energy Products segment, gross profit for the first nine months of 2024 was 26,986 an increase of 5,203 or 23.9 over gross profit of 21,783 for the comparable 2023 period. Battery Energy Products gross margin of 25.9 increased by 90 basis points from the 25.0 gross margin for the year-earlier period, primarily reflecting higher factory volume, more level-loaded production driving utilization and price realization. 

For our Communications Systems segment, gross profit for the first nine months of 2024 was 4,729 or 28.8 of revenues, compared to gross profit of 6,015 or 30.3 of revenues, for the comparable 2023 period. The decrease of 150 basis points was primarily due to lower factory volume and unfavorable product mix compared to last year s nine-month period. 

Operating Expenses. Operating expenses for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024 were 23,224, an increase of 1,252 or 5.7 from the 21,972 for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2023. The increase is primarily attributable to commissions on higher sales, greater participation in trade shows, the addition of experienced sales resources, investments in new product development and the recognition of expenses directly relating to the signing of the stock purchase agreement on September 30 th to acquire Electrochem Solutions, Inc. Both periods reflected continued tight control over discretionary spending. 

Overall, operating expenses as a percentage of revenues were 19.3 for both the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024 and the nine-month period ended September 30, 2023. Amortization expense associated with intangible assets related to our acquisitions was 684 for the first nine months of 2024 609 in selling, general and administrative expenses and 75 in research and development costs), compared with 663 for the first nine months of 2023 591 in selling, general, and administrative expenses and 72 in research and development costs). Research and development costs were 5,854 for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024, an increase of 175 or 3.1 , from 5,679 for the nine-months ended September 30, 2023. The increase reflects higher investments in new product development in both of our segments to drive organic sales growth. Selling, general, and administrative expenses were 17,370 for the 2024 nine-month period, an increase of 1,077 or 6.6 over the 16,293 for the year-earlier period, primarily reflecting commissions on higher sales, greater participation in trade shows, the addition of experienced sales resources and the recognition of expenses directly relating to the execution of a stock purchase agreement on September 27, 2024 to acquire Electrochem Solutions, Inc. 

22

Other Income (Expense). Other expense totaled 685 for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024, compared to other income of 178 for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2023. Other income (expense) for the 2024 period includes a preliminary payment of 235 from our insurance carrier pertaining to the cyberattack experienced by the Company in the first quarter of 2023, and other income for the 2023 period includes 1,544 attributable to an Employee Retention Credit ERC claimed by the Company under Section 2301 of the Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security Act. Interest and financing expense decreased 339 or 23.4 from 1,450 for the first nine months of 2023 to 1,111 for the comparable period in 2024. The decrease is primarily due to the reduction of our debt during the second and third quarters of 2024. Excluding the 235 gain attributable to insurance proceeds in 2024, miscellaneous income was 191, and excluding the 1,544 ERC gain in the 2023 period, miscellaneous income amounted to 84, primarily attributable to foreign exchange gains and loss due to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. 

Income Taxes. The income tax provision for the 2024 nine-month period was 1,630, compared to 1,688 for the 2023 nine-month period. Our effective tax rate decreased to 20.9 for the 2024 period as compared to 28.1 for the 2023 period, primarily attributable to the geographic mix of our operating results. The income tax provision for the first nine months of 2024 is comprised of a 335 current provision for taxes expected to be paid on income primarily in foreign jurisdictions, representing a cash-based effective tax rate of 4.3 , and a 1,295 deferred tax provision which primarily represents non-cash charges for U.S. taxes that we expect will be fully offset by net operating loss carryforwards and other tax credits for the foreseeable future.

The period over period change in the cash-based taxes is primarily attributable to the geographic mix of our operating results. See Note 6 to the consolidated financial statements in Item 1 of Part I of this Form 10-Q for additional information regarding our income taxes. 

Net Income Attributable to Ultralife. Net income attributable to Ultralife was 6,118, or 0.37 per share basic and diluted on a GAAP basis for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024, compared to 4,324, or 0.27 per share basic and diluted, for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2023. Adjusted EPS was 0.44 on a diluted basis for the 2024 period, compared to 0.34 for the 2023 period. Adjusted EPS excludes the provision for deferred taxes of 1,295 and 1,245 for the 2024 and 2023 periods, respectively, which primarily represents non-cash charges for U.S. taxes that we expect will be fully offset by net operating loss carryforwards and other tax credits for the foreseeable future. See the section Adjusted EPS on Page 26 for a reconciliation of adjusted EPS to EPS. 

Weighted average shares outstanding used to compute diluted earnings per share increased from 16,174,341 for the first nine-months of 2023 to 16,742,120 for the first nine-months of 2024. The increase is attributable to stock option exercises since the third quarter of 2023 and a greater average stock price in the current period. Accordingly, diluted shares of 212,072 were added to basic weighted average shares outstanding in 2024 compared to 2,441 for the 2023 period. 

Adjusted EBITDA 

In evaluating our business, we consider and use adjusted EBITDA, a non-GAAP financial measure, as a supplemental measure of our operating performance. We define adjusted EBITDA as net income (loss) attributable to Ultralife before interest expense, provision (benefit) for income taxes, depreciation and amortization, and stock-based compensation expense, plus/minus expense/income that we do not consider reflective of our ongoing continuing operations. We also use adjusted EBITDA as a supplemental measure to review and assess our operating performance and to enhance comparability between periods. We believe the use of adjusted EBITDA facilitates investors understanding of operating performance from period to period by backing out potential differences caused by variations in such items as capital structures (affecting relative interest expense and stock-based compensation expense), the amortization of intangible assets acquired through our business acquisitions (affecting relative amortization expense and provision (benefit) for income taxes), the age and book value of facilities and equipment (affecting relative depreciation expense) and one-time charges/benefits relating to income taxes. We also present adjusted EBITDA from operations because we believe it is frequently used by securities analysts, investors and other interested parties as a measure of financial performance. We reconcile adjusted EBITDA to net income (loss) attributable to Ultralife, the most comparable financial measure under GAAP. 

23

We use adjusted EBITDA in our decision-making processes relating to the operation of our business together with GAAP financial measures such as operating income (loss). We believe that adjusted EBITDA permits a comparative assessment of our operating performance, relative to our performance based on our GAAP results, while eliminating the effects of depreciation and amortization, which may vary from period to period without any correlation to underlying operating performance, and of stock-based compensation, which is a non-cash expense that varies widely among companies. We believe that by presenting adjusted EBITDA, we assist investors in gaining a better understanding of our business on a going forward basis. We provide information relating to our adjusted EBITDA so that securities analysts, investors and other interested parties have the same data that we employ in assessing our overall operations. We believe that trends in our adjusted EBITDA are a valuable indicator of our operating performance on a consolidated basis and of our ability to produce operating cash flows to fund working capital needs, to service debt obligations and to fund capital expenditures. 

The term adjusted EBITDA is not defined under GAAP and is not a measure of operating income (loss), operating performance or liquidity presented in accordance with GAAP. Our adjusted EBITDA has limitations as an analytical tool, and when assessing our operating performance, adjusted EBITDA should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for net income (loss) attributable to Ultralife or other consolidated statement of operations data prepared in accordance with GAAP. Some of these limitations include, but are not limited to, the following: 

Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect (1) our cash expenditures or future requirements for capital expenditures or contractual commitments; (2) changes in, or cash requirements for, our working capital needs; (3) the interest expense, or the cash requirements necessary to service interest or principal payments, on our debt; (4) income taxes or the cash requirements for any tax payments; and (5) all of the costs associated with operating our business; 

Although depreciation and amortization are non-cash charges, the assets being depreciated and amortized often will have to be replaced in the future, and adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations does not reflect any cash requirements for such replacements; 

While stock-based compensation is a component of cost of products sold and operating expenses, the impact on our consolidated financial statements compared to other companies can vary significantly due to such factors as assumed life of the stock-based awards and assumed volatility of our common stock; and 

Other companies may calculate adjusted EBITDA differently than we do, limiting its usefulness as a comparative measure. 

We compensate for these limitations by relying primarily on our GAAP results and using adjusted EBITDA only on a supplemental basis. Neither current nor potential investors in our securities should rely on adjusted EBITDA as a substitute for any GAAP measures and we encourage investors to review the following reconciliation of adjusted EBITDA to net income attributable to Ultralife Corporation.

Adjusted Earnings Per Share 

In evaluating our business, we consider and use adjusted EPS, a non-GAAP financial measure, as a supplemental measure of our business performance. We define adjusted EPS as net income attributable to Ultralife Corporation excluding the provision (benefit) for deferred income taxes divided by our weighted average shares outstanding on both a basic and diluted basis. We believe that this information is useful in providing period-to-period comparisons of our results by reflecting the portion of our tax provision that will be predominantly offset by our U.S. net operating loss carryforwards and other tax credits for the foreseeable future. We reconcile adjusted EPS to EPS, the most comparable financial measure under GAAP. Neither current nor potential investors in our securities should rely on adjusted EPS as a substitute for any GAAP measures and we encourage investors to review the following reconciliation of adjusted EPS to EPS and net income attributable to Ultralife Corporation.

Liquidity and Capital Resources 

As of September 30, 2024, cash totaled 6,774, as compared to 10,278 at December 31, 2023. The decrease reflects a 17,712 reduction in our outstanding debt, largely offset by strong income and cash generation during the period. 

For the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024, cash generated from operations was 13,590, as compared to 503 used in operations for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2023. For the 2024 period, cash generated from operations was comprised of net income of 6,176, plus non-cash items totaling 4,807 for depreciation, amortization, stock-based compensation, and deferred taxes, plus 2,607 attributable to reduced working capital. 

Cash used in investing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 1,326 for capital expenditures, primarily reflecting investments in equipment for new products transitioning to higher-volume manufacturing. 

Cash used in financing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 15,820, representing a 17,712 reduction in our outstanding debt and 68 in debt issuance costs paid during the period in connection with the Fourth Amendment Agreement, partially offset by 1,960 in cash generated from employee stock option exercise proceeds. 

We continue to have significant U.S. net operating loss carryforwards available to utilize as an offset to future taxable income. See Note 6 to the consolidated financial statements of this Form 10-Q for additional information. 

Going forward, we expect positive operating cash flow and the availability under our Revolving Credit Facility will be sufficient to meet our general funding requirements for the foreseeable future. 

To provide flexibility in accessing the capital markets, on March 30, 2021, the Company filed a shelf registration statement on Form S-3 (File No. 333-254846) (the Prior Registration Statement registering securities in an aggregate amount of 100,000,000. None of the 100,000,000 of registered securities were sold under the Prior Registration Statement (the Unsold Securities ). Under the rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC the Prior Registration Statement was set to expire on April 2, 2024. Therefore, on March 29, 2024, the Company filed a new shelf registration statement on Form S-3 (File No. 333-278360) (the New Registration Statement to replace the Prior Registration Statement. The New Registration Statement includes all 100,000,000 of the Unsold Securities registered on the Prior Registration Statement. During the grace period afforded by Rule 415(a)(5) under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the Securities Act ), we may offer and sell the Unsold Securities under the Prior Registration Statement until the SEC declares the New Registration Statement effective. Pursuant to Rule 415(a)(6) under the Securities Act, the offering of the Unsold Securities under the Prior Registration Statement will be deemed terminated as of the date of effectiveness of the New Registration Statement. Upon the filing of an appropriate prospectus supplement or supplements under either the Prior Registration Statement, or upon its effectiveness the New Registration Statement, we may offer and sell our securities from time to time in one or more offerings, at our discretion. We intend to use the net proceeds resulting from any sales of these securities for general corporate purposes which may include, but are not limited to, potential acquisitions of complementary businesses or technologies, strategic capital expenditures to expand and protect our competitive position, and investments in the development of transformational, competitively differentiated products for attractive growth markets. 

Commitments 

As of September 30, 2024, the Company had 3,368 outstanding borrowings on the Revolving Credit Facility and 4,667 on the Term Loan Facility. The Company was in full compliance with all covenants under the Amended Credit Agreement as of September 30, 2024. 

As of September 30, 2024, we have made commitments to purchase approximately 597 of production machinery and equipment.

Critical Accounting Policies 

Management exercises judgment in making important decisions pertaining to choosing and applying accounting policies and methodologies in many areas. Not only are these decisions necessary to comply with GAAP, but they also reflect management s view of the most appropriate manner in which to record and report our overall financial performance. All accounting policies are important, and all policies described in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements in our 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K should be reviewed for a greater understanding of how our financial performance is recorded and reported. 

During the first nine months of 2024, there were no significant changes in the manner in which our significant accounting policies were applied or in which related assumptions and estimates were developed. 

Item 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

Our President and Chief Executive Officer (Principal Executive Officer) and our Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer (Principal Financial Officer) have evaluated our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Securities Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(e)) as of the end of the period covered by this quarterly report. Based on this evaluation, our President and Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of such date. 

Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
