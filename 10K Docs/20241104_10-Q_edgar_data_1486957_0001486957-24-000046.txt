 Reportable Segments 
 reportable segments: Government Operations and Commercial Operations. Our reportable segments are further described as follows: 
 Our Government Operations segment manufactures naval nuclear reactors, including the related nuclear fuel, for the U.S. Naval Nuclear Propulsion Program for use in submarines and aircraft carriers. Through this segment, we also fabricate fuel-bearing precision components that range in weight from a few grams to hundreds of tons, manufacture electromechanical equipment, perform design, manufacturing, inspection, assembly and testing activities and downblend Cold War-era government stockpiles of high-enriched uranium. In addition, we supply proprietary and sole-source valves, manifolds and fittings to global naval and commercial shipping customers. In-house capabilities also include wet chemistry uranium processing, advanced heat treatment to optimize component material properties and a controlled, clean-room environment with the capacity to assemble railcar-size components. This segment also provides various other services, primarily through joint ventures, to the U.S. Government including nuclear materials management and operation, environmental management and administrative and operating services for various U.S. Government-owned facilities. These services are primarily provided to the U.S. Department of Energy ("DOE"), including the National Nuclear Security Administration, the Office of Nuclear Energy, the Office of Science and the Office of Environmental Management, the Department of Defense and NASA. In addition, this segment also develops technology for advanced nuclear reactors for a variety of power and propulsion applications in the space and terrestrial domains and offers complete advanced nuclear fuel and reactor design and engineering, licensing and manufacturing services for these programs. 
 Our Commercial Operations segment fabricates commercial nuclear steam generators, nuclear fuel, fuel handling systems, pressure vessels, reactor components, heat exchangers, tooling delivery systems and other auxiliary equipment, including containers for the storage of spent nuclear fuel and other high-level waste, and supplies nuclear-grade materials and precisely machined components for nuclear utility customers. We have supplied the nuclear industry with more than large, heavy components worldwide and are the only commercial heavy nuclear component manufacturer in North America. This segment also provides specialized engineering services that include structural component design, 3-D thermal-hydraulic engineering analysis, weld and robotic process development, electrical and controls engineering and metallurgy and materials engineering. In addition, this segment offers in-plant inspection, maintenance and modification services for nuclear steam generators, heat exchangers, reactors, fuel handling systems and balance of plant equipment, as well as specialized non-destructive examination and tooling/repair solutions. This segment also manufactures medical radioisotopes, radiopharmaceuticals and medical devices, and partners with life science and pharmaceutical companies developing new drugs.

 Contracts and Revenue Recognition 
 Provision for Income Taxes 
 Our effective tax rate for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was as compared to for the three months ended September 30, 2023. Our effective tax rate for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was as compared to for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The effective tax rates for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023 were higher than the U.S. corporate income tax rate of 21 primarily due to state income taxes within the U.S. and the unfavorable rate differential associated with our foreign earnings. 
 Certain jurisdictions have implemented the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development s Pillar Two rules regarding a global minimum tax. Effective January 1, 2024, these rules enforce a minimum effective tax rate of 15 , calculated on a jurisdictional basis. Considering our current global footprint, we do not anticipate that these new rules will materially impact our provision for income taxes.

 Derivative Financial Instruments 
 At September 30, 2024, we had deferred approximately million of net gains on these derivative financial instruments. Assuming market conditions continue, we expect to recognize the majority of this amount in the next 12 months. For the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, we recognized (gains) losses of million and ) million, respectively, and for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, we recognized (gains) losses of ) million and ) million, respectively, in Other net on our condensed consolidated statements of income associated with FX forward contracts not designated as hedging instruments. 
 At September 30, 2024, our derivative financial instruments consisted of FX forward contracts with a total notional value of million with maturities extending to July 2026. These instruments consist primarily of FX forward contracts to purchase or sell Canadian dollars and Euros. We are exposed to credit-related losses in the event of non-performance by counterparties to derivative financial instruments. We attempt to mitigate this risk by using major financial institutions with high credit ratings. Our counterparties to derivative financial instruments have the benefit of the same collateral arrangements and covenants as described under our credit facility.

 Performance Obligations 
 As we progress on our contracts and the underlying performance obligations for which we recognize revenue over time, we refine our estimates of variable consideration and total estimated costs at completion, which impact the overall profitability on our contracts and performance obligations. Changes in these estimates result in the recognition of cumulative catch-up adjustments that impact our revenues and/or costs of contracts.

 Operating Income (1) 
 
 (1) During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, no adjustments to any one contract had a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, our Government Operations segment results were favorably impacted by contract adjustments related to a nuclear operations contract. These adjustments resulted in an increase in revenue of million and million and decreases in cost of operations of million, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 respectively. 
 Contract Assets and Liabilities 
 We include revenues and related costs incurred, plus accumulated contract costs that exceed amounts invoiced to customers under the terms of the contracts, in Contracts in progress. Costs specific to certain contracts for which we recognize revenue at a point in time are also included in Contracts in progress. We include in Advance billings on contracts billings that exceed accumulated contract costs and revenues recognized over time. Amounts that are withheld on our fixed-price incentive fee contracts are classified within Retainages. Certain of these amounts require conditions other than the passage of time to be achieved, with the remaining amounts only requiring the passage of time. Most long-term contracts contain provisions for progress payments. Our unbilled receivables do not contain an allowance for credit losses as we expect to invoice customers and collect all amounts for unbilled receivables. Changes in Contracts in progress and Advance billings on contracts are primarily driven by differences in the timing of revenue recognition and billings to our customers. Our fixed-price incentive fee contracts for our Government Operations segment include provisions that result in an increase in retainages on contracts during the first and third quarters of the year, with larger payments received during the second and fourth quarters. Retainages also vary as a result of timing differences between incurring costs and achieving milestones that allow us to recover these amounts. 
 Retainages Advance billings on contracts 
 During the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, we recognized million and million, respectively, of revenues that were in Advance billings on contracts at the beginning of each year. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, we recognized million and million, respectively, of revenues that were in Advance billings on contracts at the beginning of each year. 
 Remaining Performance Obligations 
 Remaining performance obligations represent the dollar amount of revenue we expect to recognize in the future from performance obligations on contracts previously awarded and in progress. At September 30, 2024, our remaining performance obligations were million. We expect to recognize approximately of the revenue associated with our remaining performance obligations by the end of 2025, with the remainder to be recognized thereafter.

 We estimate the fair value of investments based on quoted market prices. For investments for which there are no quoted market prices, we derive fair values from available yield curves for investments of similar quality and terms. 
 Derivatives 
 Level 2 derivative assets and liabilities currently consist of FX forward contracts. Where applicable, the value of these derivative assets and liabilities is computed by discounting the projected future cash flow amounts to present value using market-based observable inputs, including FX forward and spot rates, interest rates and counterparty performance risk adjustments. At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we had FX forward contracts outstanding to purchase or sell foreign currencies, primarily Canadian dollars and Euros, with a total fair value of ) million and ) million, respectively. Derivative assets and liabilities are included in Accounts receivable other and Accounts payable, respectively, on our condensed consolidated balance sheets.

Where quoted prices are not available, we base the fair values on the present value of future cash flows discounted at estimated borrowing rates for similar debt instruments or on estimated prices based on current yields for debt issues of similar quality and terms. At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the fair value of the Senior Notes due 2028 was million and million, respectively, and the fair value of the Senior Notes due 2029 was million and million, respectively. The fair value of our remaining debt instruments approximated their carrying values at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. 
 Note receivable. Included in Other Assets is a note receivable related to a third-party loan. We base the fair value of this level 2 note receivable instrument on the present value of future cash flows discounted at market interest rates for financial instruments with similar quality and terms.

 Cautionary Statement Concerning Forward-Looking Statements 
 From time to time, our management or persons acting on our behalf make forward-looking statements to inform existing and potential security holders about our Company. Forward-looking statements include those statements that express a belief, expectation or intention, as well as those that are not statements of historical fact, within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"). Statements and assumptions regarding expectations and projections of specific projects, our future backlog, revenues, income, capital spending, strategic investments, acquisitions or divestitures, return of capital activities or margin improvement initiatives are examples of forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements are generally accompanied by words such as "estimate," "project," "predict," "believe," "expect," "anticipate," "plan," "seek," "goal," "could," "intend," "may," "should" or other words that convey the uncertainty of future events or outcomes. In addition, sometimes we will specifically describe a statement as being a forward-looking statement and refer to this cautionary statement. 
 We have based our forward-looking statements on information currently available to us and our current expectations, estimates and projections about our Company, industries and business environment. We caution that these statements are not guarantees of future performance and you should not rely unduly on them as they involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions that we cannot predict. In addition, we have based many of these forward-looking statements on assumptions about future events that may prove to be inaccurate. While our management considers these statements and assumptions to be reasonable, they are inherently subject to numerous factors, including potentially the risk factors described in Item 1A of our 2023 10-K, most of which are difficult to predict and many of which are beyond our control. Accordingly, our actual results may differ materially from the future performance that we have expressed or forecast in our forward-looking statements. 
 We have discussed many of these factors in more detail elsewhere in this Report. These factors are not necessarily all the factors that could affect us. Unpredictable or unanticipated factors we have not discussed in this Report or in our 2023 10-K could also have material adverse effects on actual results of matters that are the subject of our forward-looking statements. We do not intend to update or review any forward-looking statement or our description of important factors, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, except as required by applicable laws. 
 
 General 
 We operate in two reportable segments: Government Operations and Commercial Operations. In general, we operate in capital-intensive industries and rely on large contracts for a substantial amount of our revenues. We are currently exploring growth strategies across our segments to expand and complement our existing businesses. We would expect to fund these opportunities with cash generated from operations or by raising additional capital through debt, equity or some combination thereof. 
 Government Operations 
 The revenues of our Government Operations segment are largely a function of defense spending by the U.S. Government. Through this segment, we engineer, design and manufacture precision naval nuclear components, reactors and nuclear fuel for the U.S. Department of Energy ("DOE")/National Nuclear Safety Administration's Naval Nuclear Propulsion Program. In addition, we supply proprietary and sole-source valves, manifolds and fittings to global naval and commercial shipping customers. As a supplier of major nuclear components for certain U.S. Government programs, this segment is a significant participant in the defense industry. 
 This segment also provides various services to the U.S. Government by managing and operating high-consequence operations at U.S. nuclear weapons sites, national laboratories and manufacturing complexes. The revenues and equity income of investees under these types of contracts are largely a function of spending by the U.S. Government and the performance

Table of Contents 

 scores we and our consortium partners earn in managing and operating these sites. With our specialized capabilities of full life-cycle management of special materials, facilities and technologies, we believe this segment is well-positioned to continue participating in the ongoing cleanup, operation and management of critical government-owned nuclear sites, laboratories and manufacturing complexes maintained by the DOE, NASA and other federal agencies. 
 Additionally, this segment also develops technology for a variety of applications, including advanced nuclear power sources, and offers complete advanced nuclear fuel and reactor design and engineering, licensing and manufacturing services for new advanced nuclear reactors. 
 Commercial Operations 
 Through this segment, we design and manufacture commercial nuclear steam generators, heat exchangers, pressure vessels, reactor components, as well as other auxiliary equipment, including containers for the storage of spent nuclear fuel and other high-level nuclear waste. This segment is a leading supplier of nuclear fuel, fuel handling systems, tooling delivery systems, nuclear-grade materials and precisely machined components, and related services for CANDU nuclear power plants. This segment also provides a variety of engineering and in-plant services and is a significant supplier to nuclear power utilities undergoing major refurbishment and plant life extension projects. Additionally, this segment is a global manufacturer and supplier of critical medical radioisotopes and radiopharmaceuticals. 
 Our Commercial Operations segment's overall activity primarily depends on the demand and competitiveness of nuclear energy and the demand for critical radioisotopes and radiopharmaceuticals. A significant portion of our Commercial Operations segment's operations depends on the timing of maintenance outages, the cyclical nature of capital expenditures and major refurbishment and life extension projects, as well as the demand for nuclear fuel and fuel handling equipment primarily in the Canadian market, which could cause variability in our financial results. 
 Critical Accounting Estimates 
 For a summary of the critical accounting policies and estimates that we use in the preparation of our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements, see Item 7 of our 2023 10-K. There have been no material changes to our critical accounting policies and estimates during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 
 Contracts Revenue Recognition 
 We generally recognize estimated contract revenue and resulting income over time based on the measurement of the extent of progress toward completion using total costs incurred as a percentage of the total estimated project costs for individual performance obligations. We review contract price and cost estimates periodically as the work progresses and reflect adjustments proportionate to the percentage-of-completion in income in the period when those estimates are revised. If a current estimate of total contract costs indicates a loss on a contract, the projected loss is recognized in full when determined. 
 As we progress on our contracts and the underlying performance obligations, we refine our estimates of variable consideration and total estimated costs at completion, which impact the overall profitability on our contracts and performance obligations. Changes in these estimates result in the recognition of cumulative catch-up adjustments that impact our revenues and/or costs of contracts. The aggregate impact of changes in estimates increased our revenues and operating income as follows: 
 Three Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 2024 2023 (In thousands) (In thousands) Revenues (1) 
 10,241 17,370 7,449 4,328 Operating Income (1) 
 9,721 19,870 6,372 6,828 
 (1) During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, no adjustments to any one contract had a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, our Government Operations segment results were favorably impacted by contract adjustments related to a nuclear operations contract. These adjustments resulted in an increase in revenue of 20.4 million and 20.0 million and decreases in cost of operations of 2.5 million, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 respectively.

 Consolidated Results of Operations 
 Three months ended September 30, 2024 vs. 2023 
 Consolidated revenues increased 13.9 , or 82.0 million, to 672.0 million in the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 590.0 million for the corresponding period of 2023, due to increases in our Government Operations and Commercial Operations segments of 82.2 million and 0.8 million, respectively. 
 Consolidated operating income increased 11.2 million to 96.6 million in the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 85.4 million for the corresponding period of 2023. Operating income in our Government Operations segment increased 16.0 million which was partially offset by lower operating income in our Commercial Operations segment of 2.4 million when compared to the corresponding period in the prior year. We also experienced an increase in Unallocated Corporate expenses of 2.4 million when compared to the corresponding period in the prior year. 
 Nine months ended September 30, 2024 vs. 2023 
 Consolidated revenues increased 10.5 , or 186.6 million, to 1,957.4 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 1,770.8 million for the corresponding period of 2023, due to increases in our Government Operations and Commercial Operations segments of 158.3 million and 29.4 million, respectively. 
 Consolidated operating income increased 28.5 million to 288.3 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 259.9 million for the corresponding period of 2023. Operating income in our Government Operations and Commercial Operations segments increased 21.4 million and 10.3 million, respectively. These increases were partially offset by an increase in Unallocated Corporate expenses of 3.3 million when compared to the corresponding period in the prior year.

 Three months ended September 30, 2024 vs. 2023 
 Revenues increased 82.2 million, or 17.2 , to 560.1 million in the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 477.9 million for the corresponding period of 2023. The increase was primarily driven by higher volume in the manufacture of nuclear components for U.S. Government programs of 47.2 million as well as an increase in revenues caused by the timing of long-lead material procurements of 32.0 million, when compared to the corresponding period in the prior year. Continued growth in design and engineering work executed by our advanced technologies business, particularly in the defense market, resulted in an additional increase in revenues of 20.7 million. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in revenues associated with our downblending operations. 
 Operating income increased 16.0 million to 101.6 million in the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 85.6 million for the corresponding period of 2023, primarily driven by the operating income impact of the changes in revenues noted above. 
 Nine months ended September 30, 2024 vs. 2023 
 Revenues increased 158.3 million, or 11.1 , to 1,588.0 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 1,429.7 million for the corresponding period of 2023. The increase was primarily driven by higher volume in the manufacture of nuclear components for U.S. Government programs of 101.4 million when compared to the corresponding period in the prior year. Continued growth in design and engineering work executed by our advanced technologies business, particularly in the defense market, resulted in additional revenues of 59.0 million. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in revenues associated with our downblending operations. 
 Operating income increased 21.4 million to 279.8 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 258.4 million for the corresponding period of 2023, primarily driven by the operating income impact of the changes in revenues noted above. This was partially offset by a decrease associated with our downblending operations and by investments in new digital and transformation related initiatives that caused an increase in selling, general and administrative expenses when compared to the corresponding period of the prior year.

 Three months ended September 30, 2024 vs. 2023 
 Revenues increased 0.7 , or 0.8 million, to 113.1 million in the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 112.4 million for the corresponding period of 2023. The increase was primarily related to higher revenues in our nuclear components, medical radioisotopes, fuel handling and fuel fabrication businesses, partially offset by lower revenues in our on-site refurbishment work when compared to the same period in the prior year. 
 Operating income decreased 2.4 million to 6.7 million in the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 9.1 million for the corresponding period of 2023. The decrease was primarily related to a 2.2 million increase in expenses associated with due diligence and restructuring-related activities as well as higher expenses in our components business when compared to the corresponding period of the prior year. These decreases were partially offset by a favorable shift in our product mix when compared to the same period in the prior year. 
 Nine months ended September 30, 2024 vs. 2023 
 Revenues increased 8.6 , or 29.4 million, to 371.6 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 342.2 million for the corresponding period of 2023. The increase was driven by higher revenues across all of our core

 businesses when compared to the corresponding period in the prior year which included a 12.6 million increase in our medical radioisotopes business. 
 Operating income increased 10.3 million to 31.9 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 21.6 million for the corresponding period of 2023. The increase was primarily due to the increase in revenues noted above as well as a favorable shift in our product mix. The increase was partially offset by a 1.1 million increase in expenses associated with due diligence and restructuring-related activities when compared to the corresponding period of the prior year. 
 
 Unallocated Corporate 
 Unallocated corporate expenses increased 2.4 million and 3.3 million in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, when compared to the corresponding periods of 2023. During the third quarter of 2023, we undertook several initiatives to transform our current information technology infrastructure and to improve the effectiveness of our digital framework. These initiatives are expected to continue into 2026 and accounted for increases in expense of 2.0 million and 6.1 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively. We also experienced an increase in legal and consulting costs associated with due diligence activities of 2.2 million and 2.1 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively. These increases were partially offset by decreases in healthcare costs when compared to the corresponding periods in the prior year. 
 
 Provision for Income Taxes 
 Three Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 Change 2024 2023 Change (In thousands) Income before Provision for Income Taxes 90,624 78,166 12,458 270,630 235,779 34,851 Provision for Income Taxes 20,983 17,814 3,169 59,410 55,769 3,641 Effective Tax Rate 23.2 22.8 22.0 23.7 
 We primarily operate in the U.S., Canada and the U.K. and we recognize our U.S. income tax provision based on the U.S. federal statutory rate of 21 , our Canadian tax provision based on the Canadian local statutory rate of approximately 25 , and our U.K. tax provision based on the U.K. local statutory rate of 25 . 
 Our effective tax rate for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was 23.2 as compared to 22.8 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. Our effective tax rate for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 22.0 as compared to 23.7 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The effective tax rates for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023 were higher than the U.S. corporate income tax rate of 21 , primarily due to state income taxes within the U.S. and the unfavorable rate differential associated with our foreign earnings. 
 Certain jurisdictions have implemented the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development s Pillar Two rules regarding a global minimum tax. Effective January 1, 2024, these rules enforce a minimum effective tax rate of 15 , calculated on a jurisdictional basis. Considering our current global footprint, we do not anticipate that these new rules will materially impact our provision for income taxes. 
 
 Backlog 
 Backlog represents the dollar amount of revenue we expect to recognize in the future from contracts awarded and in progress. Not all of our expected revenue from a contract award is recorded in backlog for a variety of reasons, including that some projects are awarded and completed within the same reporting period. 
 Our backlog is equal to our remaining performance obligations under contracts that meet the criteria in FASB Topic Revenue from Contracts with Customers , as discussed in Note 2 to our condensed consolidated financial statements included in this Report. It is possible that our methodology for determining backlog may not be comparable to methods used by other companies. 
 We are subject to the budgetary and appropriations cycle of the U.S. Government as it relates to our Government Operations segment. Backlog may not be indicative of future operating results and projects in our backlog may be cancelled, modified or otherwise altered by customers.

 We do not include the value of our unconsolidated joint venture contracts in backlog. These unconsolidated joint ventures are included in our Government Operations segment. 
 As of September 30, 2024, our ending backlog was 3,380.7 million, which included 366.4 million of unfunded backlog related to U.S. Government contracts. We expect to recognize approximately 48 of the revenue associated with our backlog by the end of 2025, with the remainder to be recognized thereafter. 
 Major new awards from the U.S. Government are typically received following Congressional approval of the budget for the U.S. Government's next fiscal year, which starts October 1, and may not be awarded to us before the end of the calendar year. Due to the fact that most contracts awarded by the U.S. Government are subject to these annual funding approvals, the total values of the underlying programs are significantly larger. 
 The value of unexercised options excluded from backlog as of September 30, 2024, was approximately 100 million, which is expected to be awarded in 2024, subject to annual Congressional appropriations. 
 
 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 Credit Facility 
 On October 12, 2022, we entered into an Amended and Restated Credit Agreement (the "Credit Facility") with Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as administrative agent, and the other lenders party thereto. The Credit Facility consists of a 750 million senior secured revolving credit facility (the "Revolving Credit Facility") and a 250 million senior secured term A loan (the "Term Loan"). The Revolving Credit Facility and the Term Loan are scheduled to mature on October 12, 2027. The proceeds of loans under the Credit Facility are available for working capital needs, permitted acquisitions and other general corporate purposes. 
 The Credit Facility allows for additional parties to become lenders and, subject to certain conditions, for the increase of the commitments under the Credit Facility, subject to an aggregate maximum for all additional commitments of (1) the greater of (a) 400 million and (b) 100 of EBITDA, as defined in the Credit Facility, for the last four full fiscal quarters, plus (2) all voluntary prepayments of the Term Loan, plus (3) additional amounts provided the Company is in compliance with a pro forma first lien net leverage ratio test of less than or equal to 2.50 to 1.00. 
 The Company's obligations under the Credit Facility are guaranteed, subject to certain exceptions, by substantially all of the Company's present and future wholly owned domestic restricted subsidiaries. The Credit Facility is secured by first-priority liens on certain assets owned by the Company and its subsidiary guarantors (other than its subsidiaries comprising a portion of its Government Operations segment). 
 The Credit Facility requires interest payments on outstanding loans on a periodic basis until maturity. We are required to make quarterly amortization payments on the Term Loan in an amount equal to (i) 0.625 of the initial aggregate principal amount of the Term Loan on the last business day of each quarter beginning the quarter ended March 31, 2023 and ending the quarter ending December 31, 2024 and (ii) 1.25 of the initial aggregate principal amount of the Term Loan on the last business day of each quarter ending after December 31, 2024, with the balance of the Term Loan due at maturity. We may prepay all loans under the Credit Facility at any time without premium or penalty (other than customary Term SOFR breakage costs), subject to notice requirements. 
 The Credit Facility includes financial covenants that are evaluated on a quarterly basis, based on the rolling four-quarter period that ends on the last day of each fiscal quarter. The maximum permitted total net leverage ratio is 4.00 to 1.00, which may be increased to 4.50 to 1.00 for up to four consecutive fiscal quarters after a material acquisition. The minimum consolidated interest coverage ratio is 3.00 to 1.00. In addition, the Credit Facility contains various restrictive covenants, including with respect to debt, liens, investments, mergers, acquisitions, dividends, equity repurchases and asset sales. As of September 30, 2024, we were in compliance with all covenants set forth in the Credit Facility.

 Outstanding loans under the Credit Facility bear interest at our option at either (1) the Term SOFR plus a credit spread adjustment of 0.10 plus a margin ranging from 1.0 to 1.75 per year or (2) the base rate plus a margin ranging from 0.0 to 0.75 per year. We are charged a commitment fee on the unused portion of the Revolving Credit Facility, and that fee ranges from 0.15 to 0.225 per year. Additionally, we are charged a letter of credit fee of between 1.0 and 1.75 per year with respect to the amount of each financial letter of credit issued under the Revolving Credit Facility, and a letter of credit fee of between 0.75 and 1.05 per year with respect to the amount of each performance letter of credit issued under the Revolving Credit Facility. The applicable margin for loans, the commitment fee and the letter of credit fees set forth above will vary quarterly based on our total net leverage ratio. Based on the total net leverage ratio applicable at September 30, 2024, the margin for Term SOFR and base rate loans was 1.25 and 0.25 , respectively, the letter of credit fee for financial letters of credit and performance letters of credit was 1.25 and 0.825 , respectively, and the commitment fee for the unused portion of the Revolving Credit Facility was 0.175 . 
 As of September 30, 2024, borrowings under the Term Loan totaled 239.1 million, borrowings and letters of credit issued under the Revolving Credit Facility totaled 200.0 million and 1.4 million, respectively, and we had 548.6 million available under the Revolving Credit Facility for borrowings and to meet letter of credit requirements. As of September 30, 2024, the weighted-average interest rate on outstanding borrowings under the Credit Facility was 6.31 . 
 The Credit Facility generally includes customary events of default for a secured credit facility. Under the Credit Facility, (1) if an event of default relating to bankruptcy or other insolvency events occurs with respect to the Company, all related obligations will immediately become due and payable; (2) if any other event of default exists, the lenders will be permitted to accelerate the maturity of the related obligations outstanding; and (3) if any event of default exists, the lenders will be permitted to terminate their commitments thereunder and exercise other rights and remedies, including the commencement of foreclosure or other actions against the collateral. 
 If any default occurs under the Credit Facility, or if we are unable to make any of the representations and warranties in the Credit Facility, we will be unable to borrow funds or have letters of credit issued under the Credit Facility. 
 Senior Notes due 2028 
 We issued 400 million aggregate principal amount of 4.125 senior notes due 2028 (the "Senior Notes due 2028") pursuant to an indenture dated June 12, 2020 (the "2020 Indenture"), among the Company, certain of our subsidiaries, as guarantors, and U.S. Bank Trust Company, National Association (formerly known as U.S. Bank National Association) ("U.S. Bank"), as trustee. The Senior Notes due 2028 are guaranteed by each of the Company's present and future direct and indirect wholly owned domestic subsidiaries that is a guarantor under the Credit Facility. 
 Interest on the Senior Notes due 2028 is payable semi-annually in cash in arrears on June 30 and December 30 of each year at a rate of 4.125 per annum. The Senior Notes due 2028 will mature on June 30, 2028. 
 We may redeem the Senior Notes due 2028, in whole or in part, at any time at a redemption price equal to (i) 101.031 of the principal amount to be redeemed if the redemption occurs during the 12-month period beginning on June 30, 2024 and (ii) 100.0 of the principal amount to be redeemed if the redemption occurs on or after June 30, 2025, in each case plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but excluding, the redemption date. 
 The 2020 Indenture contains customary events of default, including, among other things, payment default, failure to comply with covenants or agreements contained in the 2020 Indenture or the Senior Notes due 2028 and certain provisions related to bankruptcy events. The 2020 Indenture also contains customary negative covenants. As of September 30, 2024, we were in compliance with all covenants set forth in the 2020 Indenture and the Senior Notes due 2028. 
 Senior Notes due 2029 
 We issued 400 million aggregate principal amount of 4.125 senior notes due 2029 (the "Senior Notes due 2029") pursuant to an indenture dated April 13, 2021 (the "2021 Indenture"), among the Company, certain of our subsidiaries, as guarantors, and U.S. Bank, as trustee. The Senior Notes due 2029 are guaranteed by each of the Company's present and future direct and indirect wholly owned domestic subsidiaries that is a guarantor under the Credit Facility. 
 Interest on the Senior Notes due 2029 is payable semi-annually in cash in arrears on April 15 and October 15 of each year, at a rate of 4.125 per annum. The Senior Notes due 2029 will mature on April 15, 2029.

Table of Contents 

 We may redeem the Senior Notes due 2029, in whole or in part, at any time at a redemption price equal to (i) 102.063 of the principal amount to be redeemed if the redemption occurs during the 12-month period beginning on April 15, 2024, (ii) 101.031 of the principal amount to be redeemed if the redemption occurs during the 12-month period beginning on April 15, 2025 and (iii) 100.0 of the principal amount to be redeemed if the redemption occurs on or after April 15, 2026, in each case plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but excluding, the redemption date. 
 The 2021 Indenture contains customary events of default, including, among other things, payment default, failure to comply with covenants or agreements contained in the 2021 Indenture or the Senior Notes due 2029 and certain provisions related to bankruptcy events. The 2021 Indenture also contains customary negative covenants. As of September 30, 2024, we were in compliance with all covenants set forth in the 2021 Indenture and the Senior Notes due 2029. 
 Other Arrangements 
 We have posted surety bonds to support regulatory and contractual obligations for certain decommissioning responsibilities, projects and legal matters. We utilize bonding facilities to support such obligations, but the issuance of bonds under those facilities is typically at the surety's discretion, and the bonding facilities generally permit the surety, in its sole discretion, to terminate the facility or demand collateral. Although there can be no assurance that we will maintain our surety bonding capacity, we believe our current capacity is adequate to support our existing requirements for the next 12 months. In addition, these bonds generally indemnify the beneficiaries should we fail to perform our obligations under the applicable agreements. We, and certain of our subsidiaries, have jointly executed general agreements of indemnity in favor of surety underwriters relating to surety bonds those underwriters issue. As of September 30, 2024, bonds issued and outstanding under these arrangements totaled approximately 101.1 million. 
 Similarly, we have provided letters of credit to governmental agencies and contractual counterparties to support regulatory and contractual obligations for certain decommissioning responsibilities, projects and legal matters. We utilize our Revolving Credit Facility and a bilateral letter of credit facility to support such obligations, but the issuance of letters of credit under our bilateral letter of credit facility is at the issuer s discretion, and our bilateral letter of credit facility generally permits the issuer, in its sole discretion, to demand collateral if the issuer does not otherwise have the benefit of the collateral under our Credit Facility. Although there can be no assurance that we will maintain our bilateral letter of credit facility capacity, we believe our current capacity, together with capacity under our Revolving Credit Facility, is adequate to support our existing requirements for the next 12 months. As of September 30, 2024, letters of credit issued and outstanding under our bilateral letter of credit facility totaled approximately 35.6 million, and such letters of credit are secured by the collateral under our Credit Facility. 
 Long-term Benefit Obligations 
 As of September 30, 2024, we had underfunded defined benefit pension and postretirement benefit plans with obligations totaling approximately 96.2 million. These long-term liabilities are expected to require use of our resources to satisfy future funding obligations. Based largely on statutory funding requirements, we expect to make contributions of approximately 1.4 million for the remainder of 2024 related to our pension and postretirement plans. We may also make additional contributions based on a variety of factors including, but not limited to, tax planning, evaluation of funded status and risk mitigation strategies. 
 Other 
 Cash, Cash Equivalents, Restricted Cash and Investments 
 Our domestic and foreign cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash and cash equivalents and investments as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 were as follows: 
 September 30, 2024 December 31, 2023 (In thousands) Domestic 46,427 71,177 Foreign 6,196 19,934 Total 52,623 91,111

 Our working capital increased by 102.7 million to 545.5 million at September 30, 2024 from 442.8 million at December 31, 2023, primarily attributable to changes in contracts in progress and retainages due to the timing of project cash flows which was partially offset by the timing of vendor payments. 
 Our net cash provided by operating activities decreased by 10.4 million to 131.5 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to cash provided by operating activities of 141.9 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease in cash provided by operating activities was primarily attributable to the timing of project cash flows which was partially offset by the timing of vendor payments and an increase in net income. 
 Our net cash used in investing activities decreased by 4.1 million to 100.9 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to cash used in investing activities 105.0 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2023. No single item contributed significantly to this change. 
 Our net cash used in financing activities increased by 47.7 million to 69.9 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to cash used in financing activities of 22.2 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in cash used in financing activities was primarily attributable to a reduction in net borrowings of long-term debt of 30.0 million as well as an increase in repurchases of common stock of 20.0 million when compared to the corresponding period of the prior year. 
 At September 30, 2024, we had restricted cash and cash equivalents totaling 6.4 million, 3.5 million of which was held for future decommissioning of facilities (which is included in Other Assets on our condensed consolidated balance sheets) and 3.0 million of which was held to meet reinsurance reserve requirements of our captive insurer. 
 At September 30, 2024, we had long-term investments with a fair value of 10.7 million. Our investment portfolio consists primarily of corporate bonds and mutual funds. Our debt securities are carried at fair value and are either classified as trading, with unrealized gains and losses reported in earnings, or as available-for-sale, with unrealized gains and losses, net of tax, being reported as a component of other comprehensive income. Our equity securities are carried at fair value with the unrealized gains and losses reported in earnings. 
 Cash Requirements 
 As discussed in Note 9 to our condensed consolidated financial statements, subsequent to September 30, 2024, we announced our intention to acquire Aerojet Ordinance Tennessee, Inc., a subsidiary of L3Harris Technologies. We expect to make a significant cash investment during the fourth quarter of 2024 to complete this acquisition. 
 We believe we have sufficient cash and cash equivalents and borrowing capacity, along with cash generated from operations and continued access to capital markets, to satisfy our cash requirements for the next 12 months and beyond. 
 
 Item 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 
 Our exposures to market risks have not changed materially from those disclosed in Item 7A of our 2023 10-K. 
 
 Item 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 
 As of the end of the period covered by this Report, we carried out an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as that term is defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) adopted by the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") under the Exchange Act). This evaluation was conducted under the supervision and with the participation of management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer. Our disclosure controls and procedures were developed through a process in which our management applied its judgment in assessing the costs and benefits of such controls and procedures, which, by their nature, can provide only reasonable assurance regarding the control objectives. You should note that the design of any system of disclosure controls and procedures is based in part upon various assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and we cannot assure you that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions, regardless of how remote. Based on the evaluation referred to above, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures are effective as of September 30, 2024 to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the SEC, and such information is accumulated and communicated to management as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding disclosure. There has been no change in our internal control over financial
