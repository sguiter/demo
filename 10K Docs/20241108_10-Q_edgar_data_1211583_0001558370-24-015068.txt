 of their prompt payment discounts and, therefore, the Company deducts the full amount of these discounts from total product sales when revenues are recognized. Rebates: Allowances for rebates include mandated discounts under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program and other government programs. Rebate amounts owed after the final dispensing of the product to a benefit plan participant are based upon contractual agreements or legal requirements with public sector benefit providers, such as Medicaid. The allowance for rebates is based on statutory or contractual discount rates and expected utilization. The Company s estimates for the expected utilization of rebates are based on customer and payor data received from the specialty distributors and historical utilization rates that will develop over time, as PEDMARK is the Company s first and only commercial product. Rebates are generally invoiced by the payor and paid in arrears, such that the accrual balance consists of an estimate of the amount expected to be incurred for the current quarter s shipments to the customers, plus an accrual balance for known prior quarters unpaid rebates. If actual future rebates vary from estimates, the Company may need to adjust its accruals, which would affect net product revenues in the period of adjustment. Co-payment Assistance: Patients who have commercial insurance and meet certain eligibility requirements may receive co-payment assistance. The Company accrues a liability for co-payment assistance based on actual program participation and estimates of program redemption using customer data provided by the third party that administers the copay program. Other Customer Credits: The Company pays fees to its customers for account management, data management and other administrative services. To the extent the services received are distinct from the sale of products to its customers, the Company classifies these payments in selling and marketing expenses in its condensed consolidated statements of operations. Distribution and Other Fees: The Company pays distribution and other fees to certain customers in connection with the sales of PEDMARK. The Company records distribution and other fees paid to its customers as a reduction of revenue, unless the payment is for a distinct good or service from the customer and the Company can reasonably estimate the fair value of the goods or services received. If both conditions are met, the Company records the consideration paid to the customer as an operating expense. These costs are typically known at the time of sale, resulting in minimal adjustments subsequent to the period of sale.

After FDA approval in September 2022, the Company had various lots of PEDMARK in various stages of production in connection with the product launch in the fourth quarter of 2022.

The following discussion should be read in conjunction with our Annual Report and the condensed consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes included elsewhere in this report. Overview We are a commercial-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on our only product PEDMARK in the United States and PEDMARQSI the European brand name for PEDMARK. On September 20, 2022, we received approval from the US Food and Drug Administration FDA for PEDMARK (sodium thiosulfate injection) to reduce the risk of ototoxicity associated with cisplatin in pediatric patients one month of age and older with localized, non-metastatic solid tumors. This approval makes PEDMARK the first and only treatment approved by the FDA in this area of unmet medical need. On October 17, 2022, we announced commercial availability of PEDMARK in the U. S. In addition, in January 2023, PEDMARK was included in the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) clinical practice guidelines for Adolescent and Young Adult (AYA) Oncology with a category 2A recommendation. In June 2023, we received European Commission Marketing Authorization for PEDMARQSI . Further, the decision included the receipt of a Pediatric Use Marketing Authorization PUMA in the European Union EU with up to 10 years of data and market protection. On March 17, 2024, we announced that we had entered into an exclusive licensing agreement with Norgine to commercialize PEDMARQSI in Europe, New Zealand and Australia. The licensing agreement provided us with approximately 43,200 up front and may provide us with up to approximately 230,000 in milestone and royalty payments in the future. Norgine is currently preparing for an EU launch of PEDMARQSI in the next several months. In the U.S., we sell our product through an experienced field force and medical science liaisons who are helping to educate the medical communities and patients about cisplatin induced ototoxicity and our programs supporting patient access to PEDMARK. Further, in the United States we have established Fennec HEARS , a comprehensive single source program designed to connect PEDMARK patients to both patient financial and product access support. The program offers assistance and resources, regardless of insurance type, that can address co-pays or lack of coverage when certain eligibility requirements are met. Fennec HEARS also provides access to care coordinators that can answer insurance questions about coverage for PEDMARK and provide tips and resources for managing treatment. We received Orphan Drug Exclusivity for PEDMARK in January 2023, which provides seven years of market exclusivity from its FDA approval on September 20, 2022, until September 20, 2029. We currently have six patents listed for

 PEDMARK in the FDA s Orange Book. In September 2022, the USPTO issued Patent No. 11,291,728 (the US 728 Patent ), in December 2022, the USPTO issued Patent No. 11,510,984 US 984 Patent and in April 2023, the USPTO issued Patent No. 11,671,793 US 793 Patent that covers PEDMARK pharmaceutical formulation. Further, additional issued patents included US 11,964,018 Patent (the US 018 Patent) and US 11,992,530 Patent (the US 530 Patent and US 11,998,604 Patent (the 604 Patent covering methods of using our PEDMARK product to reduce ototoxicity in a patient receiving a platinum based chemotherapeutic for the treatment of a cancer. The US 728, US 984 US 793, US 018, US 530 and US 604 patents will expire in 2039. We are also pursuing additional patent applications in both the U.S. and internationally for PEDMARK. PEDMARK Product Overview PEDMARK is the first and only therapy approved by the FDA indicated to reduce the risk of ototoxicity associated with cisplatin treatment in pediatric patients with localized, non-metastatic, solid tumors. Further, PEDMARQSI , known as PEDMARK in the U.S., was granted marketing authorization by the European Commission in June 2023. PEDMARK is a unique formulation of sodium thiosulfate in single-dose, ready-to-use vials for intravenous use in pediatric patients. PEDMARK is also the only therapeutic agent with proven efficacy and safety data with an established dosing paradigm, across two open-label, randomized Phase 3 clinical studies, the Clinical Oncology Group COG Protocol ACCL0431 and SIOPEL 6. In the U.S. and Europe, it is estimated that more than 10,000 children annually may receive platinum-based chemotherapy. The incidence of ototoxicity depends upon the dose and duration of chemotherapy, and many of these children require lifelong hearing aids. There is currently no established preventive agent for this hearing loss and only expensive, technically difficult, and sub-optimal cochlear (inner ear) implants have been shown to provide some benefit. Infants and young children that suffer ototoxicity at critical stages of development lack speech language development and literacy, and older children and adolescents lack social-emotional development and educational achievement. PEDMARK has been studied by co-operative groups in two Phase 3 clinical studies of survival and reduction of ototoxicity, COG ACCL0431 and SIOPEL 6. Both studies have been completed. The COG ACCL0431 protocol enrolled childhood cancers typically treated with intensive cisplatin therapy for localized and disseminated disease, including newly diagnosed hepatoblastoma, germ cell tumor, osteosarcoma, neuroblastoma, medulloblastoma, and other solid tumors. SIOPEL 6 enrolled only hepatoblastoma patients with localized tumors. Cisplatin Induced Ototoxicity Cisplatin and other platinum compounds are essential chemotherapeutic agents for the treatment of many pediatric malignancies. Unfortunately, platinum-based therapies can cause ototoxicity, or hearing loss, which is permanent, irreversible, and particularly harmful to the survivors of pediatric cancer. The incidence of ototoxicity depends upon the dose and duration of chemotherapy, and many of these children require lifelong hearing aids or cochlear implants, which can be helpful for some, but do not reverse the hearing loss and can be costly over time. Infants and young children that are affected by ototoxicity at critical stages of development lack speech and language development and literacy, and older children and adolescents often lack social-emotional development and educational achievement.

Research and development expenses increased by 85 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same period in 2023. Our research and development activities for this period consisted of costs associated with investigator initiated clinical trials. During the same period in 2023 and prior to approval of PEDMARK , manufacturing costs pertaining to PEDMARK were expensed to R D expense in the period incurred, and following approval are reflected in inventory. Selling and marketing expenses were 4,601 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 3,384 for the comparable three month period in 2023. Selling and marketing expenses include remuneration of our sales and marketing employees, dollars spent on marketing campaigns (sponsorships, trade shows, presentations, etc.), and any activities to support marketing and sales activities. The increase is largely related to increased payroll and additional marketing expenses in the comparable period as we focused on expanding our outreach to community oncology centers and the adolescent and young adult (AYA) population. General and administrative expenses increased by 2,316 compared to the same period in 2023, as a result of an increase in select expenses such as salaries, equity renumeration and intellectual property litigation expenses compared to the same period in 2023. Interest expense increased 169 compared to the same period in 2023. This increase is associated with higher debt levels as compared with the same period in 2023. Additionally, we hold shares of Processa Pharmaceuticals, Inc. Processa (NASDAQ: PCSA) which are marked to market each balance sheet date and unrealized gains or losses are recognized at that time. The value of the Processa shares held by us decreased for the three month period ended September 30, 2024, as compared with the same period in 2023. Other losses were driven mainly by unrealized losses related to our foreign currency transactions. We have vendors that transact in Euros, Great British Pounds and Canadian Dollars.

 Amortization expense is also a non-cash expense and relates to amortization of the deferred issuance costs of the loan facilities with Petrichor. Amortization expense decreased by 51 for the three months ended September 30, 2023, compared to the same period in 2023. Interest income increased by 414 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same period in 2023. This increase in interest income was primarily driven by a higher cash balance and higher interest rates for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same period in 2023.

Selling and marketing expenses include distribution costs, logistics, shipping and insurance, advertising, wages commissions and out-of-pocket expenses. We recorded 14,482 in selling and marketing expenses for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024, compared to 8,255 for the same period in 2023. The increase is largely related to increased payroll and additional marketing expenses in the comparable period as we focused on expanding our outreach to community oncology centers and the adolescent and young adult (AYA) population. There was a 5,240 increase in general and administrative expenses for the nine-months ended September 30, 2024, compared to same period in 2023. There was an increase in consulting and professional costs compared to same period in 2023 which is largely attributable to increased European pre-commercialization related expenses and expenses associated with the Norgine transaction and intellectual property expenses related to ongoing litigation. The value of the Processa shares held by us declined by 14 for nine-months ended September 30, 2024. The shares declined in value by 43 during same period in 2023. We acquired the Processa shares on October 30, 2020. The Processa shares are marked to market at each balance sheet date with the resulting change in value being booked as an unrealized gain or loss. Amortization expense decreased by 153 for nine-months ended September 30, 2024, over the same period in 2023.

 Interest expenses increased by 624 for the nine-month ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023. The increase was driven mainly by higher average debt balances and higher interest rates on long-term debt. Interest income increased by 957 for the nine-months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the same period in 2023, due to higher cash balances and higher rates on money market accounts for the comparable periods.

 We continue to pursue various strategic alternatives including collaborations with other pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies. Our projections of further capital requirements are subject to substantial uncertainty. Our working capital requirements may fluctuate in future periods depending upon numerous factors, including: our ability to obtain additional financial resources; our ability to enter into collaborations that provide us with up-front payments, milestones or other payments; progress or lack of progress in our preclinical studies or clinical trials; unfavorable toxicology in our clinical programs; our drug substance requirements to support clinical programs; change in the focus, direction, or costs of our research and development programs; headcount expense; the costs involved in preparing, filing, prosecuting, maintaining, defending and enforcing our patent claims; competitive and technological advances; the potential need to develop, acquire or license new technologies and products; our business development activities; new regulatory requirements implemented by regulatory authorities; the timing and outcome of any regulatory review process; and commercialization activities, if any. Outstanding Share Information Our outstanding share data as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 was as follows (in thousands): 

September 30, December 31, Outstanding Share Type 2024 2023 Change Common shares 27,422 27,027 395 Warrants 150 150 Stock options 5,455 5,032 423 Total 33,027 32,209 818 Financial Instruments We invest excess cash and cash equivalents in high credit quality investments held by financial institutions in accordance with our investment policy designed to protect the principal investment. At September 30, 2024, we had approximately 3,049 in our cash accounts and 37,271 in savings and money market accounts. While we have never experienced any loss or write down of our money market investments since our inception, the amounts we hold in money market accounts are substantially above the 250 amount insured by the FDIC and may lose value. Our investment policy is to manage investments to achieve, in the order of importance, the financial objectives of preservation of principal, liquidity and return on investment. Investments may be made in U.S. or Canadian obligations and bank securities, commercial paper of U.S. or Canadian industrial companies, utilities, financial institutions and consumer loan companies, and securities of foreign banks provided the obligations are guaranteed or carry ratings appropriate to the policy. Securities must have a minimum Dun Bradstreet rating of A for bonds or R1 low for commercial paper. The policy also provides for investment limits on concentrations of securities by issuer and maximum-weighted average time to maturity of twelve months. This policy applies to all of our financial resources. The policy risks are primarily the opportunity cost of the conservative nature of the allowable investments. Until we are cash flow positive from operations, we have chosen to avoid investments of a trading or speculative nature. We classify fixed income investments with original maturities at the date of purchase greater than three months which mature at or less than twelve months as current. We carry investments at their fair value with unrealized gains and losses included in other comprehensive income (loss); however, we have not held any instruments that were classified as short-term investments during the periods presented in this Quarterly Report. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements Since our inception, we have not had any material off-balance sheet arrangements.

 Contractual Obligations and Commitments None, other than the OHSU Agreement, lease agreements, and severance amounts described in notes to our condensed consolidated financial statements contained elsewhere in this Quarterly Report. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates A summary of our critical accounting policies and use of estimates are presented in Part II, Item 7, Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operation of our Annual Report. There have been no material changes to our critical accounting policies and use of estimates during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. Revenue Recognition Under Accounting Standards Codification ASC 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, we recognizes revenue when our customers obtain control of promised goods or services, in an amount that reflects the consideration which we determine we expect to receive in exchange for those goods or services. To determine revenue recognition for arrangements that we determine are within the scope of ASC 606, we perform the following five steps: (i) identify the contract(s) with a customer (ii) identify the performance obligation(s) in the contract (iii) determine the transaction price (iv) allocate the transaction price to the performance obligation(s) in the contract and (v) recognize revenue when (or as) we satisfy our performance obligation(s). As part of the accounting for these arrangements, we must make significant judgments, including identifying performance obligations in the contract, estimating the amount of variable consideration to include in the transaction price and allocating the transaction price to each performance obligation. Stock-based Compensation The calculation of the fair values of our stock-based compensation plans requires estimates that require management s judgments. Under ASC 718, the fair value of each stock option is estimated on the grant date using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. The valuation models require assumptions and estimates to determine expected volatility, expected life, expected dividends and expected risk-free interest rates. The expected volatility was determined using historical volatility of our stock based on the contractual life of the award. The risk-free interest rate assumption was based on the yield on zero-coupon U.S. Treasury strips at the award grant date. We also used historical data to estimate forfeiture experience. In valuing options granted in the fiscal years ended September 30, 2024, we used the following weighted average assumptions: 

Valuation Assumptions Black-Scholes Model Assumptions September 30, 2024 Expected dividend 0.00 Risk free rate 3.79 - 5.15 Expected volatility 45 - 67 Expected life 1.5 - 6.0 years Common shares and warrants Common shares are recorded as the net proceeds received on issuance after deducting all share issuance costs and the relative fair value of investor warrants. Warrants are recorded at relative fair value and are deducted from the proceeds of common shares and recorded on the consolidated statements of shareholders equity (deficit) as additional paid-in capital.

 Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk Not applicable. Item 4. Controls and Procedures . (a) Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures . Our management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, has conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act") as of September 30, 2024. Our disclosure controls and procedures are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports our files under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including the our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, to allow for timely decisions regarding required disclosures. In designing and evaluating our disclosure controls and procedures, our management recognizes that disclosure controls and procedures, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the disclosure controls and procedures are met. Our disclosure controls and procedures have been designed to meet reasonable assurance standards. In addition, the design of disclosure controls and procedures must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints that require our management to apply its judgment in evaluating the benefits of possible controls and procedures relative to their costs. The design of any disclosure controls and procedures also is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions. Based on this evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that, as of September 30, 2024, our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective because of a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting related to fees and allowances paid to distributors for distinct services. Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act. Our management evaluated the effectiveness of its internal control over financial reporting based on the framework in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework). Based on that evaluation, our management has concluded that, as of September 30, 2024, our internal controls over financial reporting were not effective because of the existence of a material weakness in internal control over financial reporting related to fees and allowances paid to distributors for distinct services. A material weakness is defined as a deficiency or combination of deficiencies in internal control over financial reporting such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of annual or interim consolidated financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. With respect to the fees and allowances paid to distributors for distinct services, the execution of the controls over the application of accounting literature did not operate effectively with respect to: Measurement and classification of fees paid to customers for distinct services under ASC 606 Revenue from Contracts with Customers. Measurement of services received and expensed in a reporting period, measurement of services that pertain to future periods, and the periods of attribution for those future services. We are evaluating the material weaknesses and developing a plan of remediation to strengthen the effectiveness of the design and operation of its internal control environment. The remediation plan will include the following actions: Enhance the formality of its review procedures with respect to accounting for new contracts with customers.

Table of Contents 
 Strengthen the review process to improve the operation of accounting and review controls with respect to complex and non-recurring transactions, as well as those transactions that require significant estimates and judgments. Engaging additional service providers or hiring additional full-time employees may be necessary and advisable to address these weaknesses. The actions that we are taking are subject to ongoing senior management review as well as Audit Committee oversight. We are committed to maintaining a strong internal control environment and believes that these remediation efforts will represent significant improvements in our controls. We have started to implement these steps including hiring additional full-time employee to assist with technical accounting and financial reporting; however, some of these steps will take time to be fully integrated and confirmed to be effective and sustainable. Additional controls may also be required over time. Until the remediation steps set forth above are fully implemented and tested, the material weakness described above will continue to exist. (b) Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting. We are in the process of implementing changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) but do not believe any of these changes, as of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q have materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect our internal control over financial reporting. PART II: OTHER INFORMATION Item 1. Legal Proceedings . For information about our legal proceedings, please see our Commitments and Contingencies footnote (Note 6) to our unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report . Item 1A. Risk Factors. Our Annual Report includes a detailed discussion of our risk factors under the heading PART I, Item 1A Risk Factors. You should carefully consider the risk factors discussed in our Annual Report, as well as other information in this Quarterly Report. Any of these risks could cause our business, financial condition, results of operations and future growth prospects to suffer. Please see below for additional risk factors: We have entered into, and may in the future enter into, strategic transactions for the research, development and commercialization of PEDMARK. If any of these transactions are not successful, then we may not be able to capitalize on the market potential of such product candidates. Further, we may not be able to enter into future transactions on acceptable terms, if at all, which could adversely affect our ability to develop and commercialize our potential future product candidates and former lead product candidate, impact our cash position, increase our expense, and present significant distractions to our management. We have entered into, and may enter into in the future, strategic transactions, such as out-licensing of product candidates or technologies. For example, in March 2024, we entered into a collaboration and license agreement with Norgine. Our ability to generate revenue from any of our strategic transactions will depend on our partners abilities to successfully perform the functions assigned to them in these transactions. We cannot predict the success of any of our strategic transactions. We also intend to evaluate and, if strategically attractive, seek to enter into additional collaborations in the future, including with biotechnology or biopharmaceutical companies or hospitals. The competition for partners is intense, and the negotiation process is time-consuming and complex. If we are not able to enter into strategic transactions, we may not have access to required liquidity or expertise to further develop our potential future product candidates or our discovery platform.

Table of Contents 
 Any existing or potential future collaboration or other strategic transaction may require us to incur non-recurring or other charges, increase our near- and long-term expenditures and pose significant integration or implementation challenges or disrupt our management or business. We may acquire additional technologies and assets, form strategic alliances or create joint ventures with third parties that we believe will complement or augment our existing business, but we may not be able to realize the benefit of such acquisitions or collaborations. In addition, any new collaboration that we enter into may be on terms that are not optimal for us. Our existing and future strategic transactions would entail numerous operational and financial risks, including: exposure to unknown liabilities; disruption of our business and diversion of our management s time and attention in order to manage a collaboration or develop acquired products, potential future product candidates or technologies; incurrence of substantial debt or dilutive issuances of equity securities to pay transaction consideration or costs; higher-than-expected collaboration, acquisition or integration costs, write-downs of assets or goodwill or impairment charges, increased amortization expenses; collaborators have significant discretion in determining the efforts and resources they apply to these collaborations, and may not pursue development of any product candidates we may develop or may elect not to continue development programs based on preclinical study results, changes in the collaborator s strategic focus or other factors that may be beyond our control; collaborators could independently develop, or develop with third parties, products that may compete directly or indirectly with our potential future product candidates if the collaborators believe that the competitive products are more likely to be successfully developed or can be commercialized under terms that are more economically attractive than ours; potential future product candidates discovered in collaboration with us may be viewed by our collaborators as competitive with their own product candidates or products, which may cause collaborators to cease to devote resources to the development or commercialization of our potential future product candidates; difficulty and cost in facilitating the collaboration or combining the operations and personnel of any acquired business; disputes may arise between a collaborator and us, including with respect to the ownership of any intellectual property developed pursuant to our collaborations, that cause the delay or termination of the research, development or commercialization of a potential future product candidate, or that result in costly litigation or arbitration that diverts management s attention and resources; impairment of relationships with key suppliers, manufacturers or customers of any acquired business due to changes in management and ownership; and the inability to retain key employees of any acquired business. Accordingly, although there can be no assurance that we will undertake or successfully complete any strategic transactions of the nature described above, any collaborations that we are currently engaged in or transactions we may complete in the future may be subject to the foregoing or other risks and our business could be materially harmed by such transactions. Conversely, any failure to enter any collaboration or other strategic transaction that would be beneficial to us could delay the development and potential commercialization of our potential future product candidates and have a negative impact on the competitiveness of any potential future product candidate that reaches market. In addition, to the extent that any of our existing or future partners were to terminate a collaboration agreement, we may be forced to independently develop our future product candidates, including funding preclinical studies or clinical trials, assuming marketing and distribution costs and maintaining, enforcing and defending intellectual property rights, or, in certain instances, abandon potential future product candidates altogether, any of which could result in a change to our business plan and materially harm our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.

Exhibit 99.1 FENNEC PHARMACEUTICALS REPORTS THIRD QUARTER 2024 FINANCIAL RESULTS AND PROVIDES BUSINESS UPDATE ~ Achieved Third Quarter 2024 Net Product Sales of 7.0 Million ~ ~ Increasing Momentum and Successful Reimbursement in the Adolescent and Young Adult (AYA) Segment Following Strategic Investments to Drive Awareness of Ototoxicity Adoption of PEDMARK ~ ~ Strengthened Executive Leadership Team with Chief Medical Officer, Chief Commercial Officer Chief Strategy Officer Appointments ~ ~ Company Has Approximately 40 Million in Cash, Cash Equivalents, and Investment Securities Expected to Fund Operations Into at Least 2026 ~ ~ Management to Host Conference Call Today at 8:30 a.m. ET ~ Research Triangle Park, NC, November 7, 2024 Fennec Pharmaceuticals Inc. (NASDAQ:FENC; TSX: FRX), a specialty pharmaceutical company, today reported its financial results for the third quarter ended September 30, 2024, and provided a business update. I am pleased with the progress that we have made since recently joining Fennec in August as CEO. We are making significant headway that will position us for near-term and sustainable growth, including market expansion to the Adolescent and Young Adult (AYA) community with payor reimbursement, and adoption within prominent academic centers, said Jeff Hackman, chief executive officer of Fennec Pharmaceuticals. Our strategic and focused investments in educational initiatives reflect the strength of the foundation we are building upon with PEDMARK . Together with the recent executive leadership team appointments combined with Fennec s talented employee base, I believe that we are well positioned to execute, accelerate growth and unlock value across all key market segments. Recent Developments and Highlights: Appointed Pierre S. Sayad, PhD, M.S., as chief medical officer, Terry Evans as chief commercial officer and Christiana Cioffi, MBA, as chief strategy officer. Seasoned biopharmaceutical industry executives with proven clinical, commercial, sales, operational, and oncology market expertise will significantly accelerate our ability to build upon and seamlessly execute our integrated commercial strategy for PEDMARK and create shareholder value. Surpassed greater than 90 reimbursement for PEDMARK in the AYA population in Q3. Insights from a market and situational analysis to better understand patient incidence and 

 addressable patient populations identified significant near-and long-term opportunities across the Pediatric and AYA market segments. The opportunity for the AYA segment is significant with at least 10,000 patients treated annually with cisplatin, including primary tumors such as germ cell tumors and thyroid tumors. The incidence of ototoxicity induced by cisplatin has been estimated to be 36 of adult patients with cancer and 40 -60 of pediatric cancer patients. i PEDMARQSI commercial launch in Europe : Following the exclusive licensing agreement announcement executed in March with Norgine, PEDMARQSI is expected to be available in select markets in Europe in the coming months, which will generate additional revenue for Fennec in 2025 and beyond. Investigator-initiated clinical trial (STS-J01) in Japan evaluating PEDMARK fully enrolled in October 2024: The clinical trial of STS-J01 evaluates the efficacy and safety of PEDMARK in reducing ototoxcity induced by cisplatin in children and AYAs with localized solid tumors. The primary endpoint of the trial is to assess the frequency of hearing impairment at the end of treatment. Results of the trial are expected in 2025 with the potential evaluation for registration of PEDMARK in Japan thereafter. Participation in Key Scientific Meetings: During the third quarter, Fennec actively participated in key regional and national scientific meetings, including the National Community Oncology Dispensing Association (NCODA) International Fall Summit, the Testicular Cancer Awareness Foundation s annual Conference and the Association of Pediatric Hematology/Oncology Nurses (APHON) annual meeting. Financial Results for the Third Quarter 2024 Net Product Sales The Company recorded net product sales of 7.0 million for the three-month period ended September 30, 2024, compared to 6.5 million in net product sales for the same period in 2023. Cash Position Cash and cash equivalents were 40.3 million on September 30, 2024. Cash decreased by 2.7 million over the previous quarter. The decrease in cash is the result of cash inflows from net sales offset by cash outlays for operating expenses related to the promotion of our product, selling and marketing expenses and general and administrative expenses. We anticipate that our cash, cash equivalents and investment securities as of September 30, 2024 will be sufficient to fund our planned operations into at least 2026. Selling and Marketing Expenses The Company recorded 4.6 million in selling and marketing expenses for the period ended September 30, 2024, compared to 3.4 million for the same period in 2023. The increase is largely related to additional selling and marketing expenses as the Company expanded its focus in the AYA and community oncology population during 2024. General and Administrative (G A) Expenses G A expenses were 6.1 million compared to 3.8 million in the same period in 2023 and 6.9 million in the second quarter of 2024. The 

 increase includes additional expenses related to non-cash equity compensation, one-time severance related to our previous CEO and ongoing IP litigation expenses. Net Earnings Net loss for the quarter ended September 30, 2024 was 5.7 million (basic and diluted loss of 0.21 per share) compared to a net loss of 1.9 million (basic and diluted loss of 0.07 per share) for the same period in 2023.

 About Cisplatin-Induced Ototoxicity Cisplatin and other platinum compounds are essential chemotherapeutic agents for the treatment of many pediatric malignancies. Unfortunately, platinum-based therapies can cause ototoxicity, or hearing loss, which is permanent, irreversible, and particularly harmful to the survivors of pediatric cancer. ii The incidence of ototoxicity depends upon the dose and duration of chemotherapy, and many of these children require lifelong hearing aids or cochlear implants, which can be helpful for some, but do not reverse the hearing loss and can be costly over time. iii Infants and young children that are affected by ototoxicity at critical stages of development lack speech and language development and literacy, and older children and adolescents often lack social-emotional development and educational achievement. iv PEDMARK (sodium thiosulfate injection) PEDMARK is the first and only U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved therapy indicated to reduce the risk of ototoxicity associated with cisplatin treatment in pediatric patients with localized, non-metastatic, solid tumors. It is a unique formulation of sodium thiosulfate in single-dose, ready-to-use vials for intravenous use in pediatric patients. PEDMARK is also the first and only therapeutic agent with proven efficacy and safety data with an established dosing regimen, across two open-label, randomized Phase 3 clinical studies, the Children s Oncology Group (COG) Protocol ACCL0431 and SIOPEL 6. In the U.S. and Europe, it is estimated that, annually, more than 10,000 children may receive platinum-based chemotherapy. The incidence of ototoxicity depends upon the dose and duration of chemotherapy, and many of these children require lifelong hearing aids. There is currently no established preventive agent for this hearing loss and only expensive, technically difficult, and sub-optimal cochlear (inner ear) implants have been shown to provide some benefit. Infants and young children that suffer ototoxicity at critical stages of development lack speech language development and literacy, and older children and adolescents lack social-emotional development and educational achievement. 

 PEDMARK has been studied by co-operative groups in two Phase 3 clinical studies of survival and reduction of ototoxicity, COG ACCL0431 and SIOPEL 6. Both studies have been completed. The COG ACCL0431 protocol enrolled childhood cancers typically treated with intensive cisplatin therapy for localized and disseminated disease, including newly diagnosed hepatoblastoma, germ cell tumor, osteosarcoma, neuroblastoma, medulloblastoma, and other solid tumors. SIOPEL 6 enrolled only hepatoblastoma patients with localized tumors. Indications and Usage PEDMARK (sodium thiosulfate injection) is indicated to reduce the risk of ototoxicity associated with cisplatin in pediatric patients 1 month of age and older with localized, non-metastatic solid tumors. Limitations of Use The safety and efficacy of PEDMARK have not been established when administered following cisplatin infusions longer than 6 hours. PEDMARK may not reduce the risk of ototoxicity when administered following longer cisplatin infusions, because irreversible ototoxicity may have already occurred. Important Safety Information PEDMARK is contraindicated in patients with history of a severe hypersensitivity to sodium thiosulfate or any of its components. Hypersensitivity reactions occurred in 8 to 13 of patients in clinical trials. Monitor patients for hypersensitivity reactions. Immediately discontinue PEDMARK and institute appropriate care if a hypersensitivity reaction occurs. Administer antihistamines or glucocorticoids (if appropriate) before each subsequent administration of PEDMARK. PEDMARK may contain sodium sulfite; patients with sulfite sensitivity may have hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylactic symptoms and life-threatening or severe asthma episodes. Sulfite sensitivity is seen more frequently in people with asthma. PEDMARK is not indicated for use in pediatric patients less than 1 month of age due to the increased risk of hypernatremia or in pediatric patients with metastatic cancers. Hypernatremia occurred in 12 to 26 of patients in clinical trials, including a single Grade 3 case. Hypokalemia occurred in 15 to 27 of patients in clinical trials, with Grade 3 or 4 occurring in 9 to 27 of patients. Monitor serum sodium and potassium levels at baseline and as clinically indicated. Withhold PEDMARK in patients with baseline serum sodium greater than 145 mmol/L. Monitor for signs and symptoms of hypernatremia and hypokalemia more closely if the glomerular filtration rate (GFR) falls below 60 mL/min/1.73m 2 . Administer antiemetics prior to each PEDMARK administration. Provide additional antiemetics and supportive care as appropriate. The most common adverse reactions 25 with difference between arms of >5 compared to cisplatin alone) in SIOPEL 6 were vomiting, nausea, decreased hemoglobin, and hypernatremia. The most common adverse reaction 25 with difference between arms of >5 compared to cisplatin alone) in COG ACCL0431 was hypokalemia.
