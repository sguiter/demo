Condensed Notes to Unaudited Quarterly Consolidated Financial Statements 
 . In April 1999, PCA acquired the containerboard and corrugated packaging products business of Pactiv Corporation ("Pactiv"), formerly known as Tenneco Packaging, Inc. We are a large diverse manufacturer of both packaging and paper products. We are headquartered in Lake Forest, Illinois and we operate primarily in the United States. We report our business in reportable segments: Packaging, Paper, and Corporate and Other. Our Packaging segment produces a wide variety of containerboard and corrugated packaging products. The Paper segment manufactures and sells a range of communication-based papers. Corporate and Other includes support staff services and related assets and liabilities, transportation assets, and activity related to other ancillary support operations. For more information about our segments, see Note 18, Segment Information. The consolidated financial statements of PCA as of September 30, 2024 and for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 are unaudited but include all adjustments (consisting only of normal recurring adjustments) that management considers necessary for a fair presentation of such financial statements. The preparation of the consolidated financial statements involves the use of estimates and accruals. Actual results may vary from those estimates. These financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States for interim financial information and with Article 10 of Regulation S-X of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Accordingly, they do not include all of the information and notes required by accounting principles generally accepted in the United States for complete audited financial statements. Operating results for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the year ending December 31, 2024. These consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of PCA and its majority-owned subsidiaries after elimination of intercompany balances and transactions.

Total revenue 

Packaging Revenue Our containerboard mills produce linerboard and corrugating medium which are papers primarily used in the production of corrugated products. The majority of our containerboard production is used internally by our corrugated products manufacturing facilities. The remaining containerboard is sold to outside domestic and export customers. Our corrugated products manufacturing plants produce a wide variety of corrugated

owned by PCA and owned by Boise Cascade Company ("Boise Cascade"). PCA is the primary beneficiary of LTP and has the power to direct the activities that most significantly affect the economic performance of LTP. Therefore, we consolidate 100 of LTP in our financial statements. See Note 17, Transactions With Related Parties, for more information related to LTP. The Company recognizes revenue within this segment when performance obligations under the terms of a contract with a customer are satisfied. This occurs with the transfer of control of our products at a specific point in time. Practical Expedients and Exemption Shipping and handling fees billed to a customer are recorded on a gross basis in "Net sales" with the corresponding shipping and handling costs included in "Cost of sales" in the concurrent period as the revenue is recorded. We expense sales commissions when incurred because the amortization period is one year or less. Sales commissions are recorded in "Selling, general, and administrative expenses". We do not disclose the value of unsatisfied performance obligations for contracts with an original expected duration of one year or less.

million and million of income tax expense and had an effective tax rate of and , respectively. The increase in our effective tax rate for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023 was primarily due to higher nondeductible employee remuneration paid to covered employees. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, we recorded million and million of income tax expense and had an effective tax rate of and , respectively. The decrease in our effective tax rate for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023 was primarily due to higher excess tax benefits associated with employee restricted stock and performance unit vests. Our current effective tax rate is higher than the federal statutory income tax rate of due primarily to the effect of state and local income taxes. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, cash paid for taxes, net of refunds received, was million and million, respectively. The increase in cash tax payments between the periods is primarily due to higher 2024 forecasted taxable income. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, there were no significant changes to our uncertain tax positions.

On September 15, 2024, we used the net proceeds from the November 2023 offering of the senior notes due 2033 and cash on hand to repay our outstanding senior notes due 2024. The repayment of the old notes was million, which included principal and accrued interest. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, cash payments for interest were million and million, respectively. Included in interest expense, net is the amortization of financing costs, which includes the amortization of debt issuance costs and amortization of bond discount. For the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, amortization of debt issuance costs was million and million,

million and million, respectively. For both the three and nine month periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the amortization of bond discount was insignificant. At September 30, 2024, we had million of fixed-rate senior notes outstanding. The fair value of our fixed-rate debt was estimated to be million. The difference between the book value and fair value is due to the difference between the period-end market interest rate and the stated rate of our fixed-rate debt. We estimated the fair value of our fixed-rate debt using quoted market prices (Level 2 inputs) within the fair value hierarchy, which is further defined in Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in "Part II, Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data" of our 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K. For more information on our long-term debt and interest rates on that debt, see Note 10, Debt, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in "Part II, Item 8.

. Fair values were determined for each individual marketable debt security in the investment portfolio. When evaluating a marketable debt security for impairment, PCA reviews factors such as the duration and extent to which the fair value of the marketable debt security is less than its cost, the financial condition of the issuer and any changes thereto, the general market condition in which the issuer operates, and PCA s intent to sell, or whether it will be more likely than not be required to sell, the marketable debt security before recovery of its amortized cost basis. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we do t consider any of the impairments related to our marketable debt securities to be the result of credit losses. Therefore, we have t recorded an allowance for credit losses related to our marketable debt securities. All unrealized gains and losses were recorded in other comprehensive income (OCI).

Share-based compensation expense, net of tax benefit 

The fair value of restricted stock is determined based on the closing price of the Company s stock on the grant date. Compensation expense, net of estimated forfeitures, is recorded over the requisite service period. As PCA s Board of Directors has the ability to accelerate the vesting of these awards upon an employee s retirement, the Company accelerates the recognition of compensation expense for certain employees approaching normal retirement age.

used TSR as the performance measure and used ROIC as the performance measure. The ROIC component of performance unit awards is valued based on the closing price of the stock on the grant date. As the ROIC component contains a performance condition, compensation expense, net of estimated forfeitures, is recorded over the requisite service period based on the most probable number of awards expected to vest. The TSR component of performance unit awards is valued using a Monte Carlo simulation as the TSR component contains a market condition. The Monte Carlo simulation estimates the fair value of the TSR component based on the expected term of the award, a risk-free interest rate, expected dividends, and expected volatility of the Company s common stock and the common stock of the peer companies. Compensation expense is recorded ratably over the expected term of the award regardless of whether the market condition is satisfied.

On August 27, 2024, PCA s Board of Directors declared a regular quarterly cash dividend of per share of common stock, which was paid on October 15, 2024 to shareholders of record as of September 16, 2024. The dividend payment was million. Repurchases of Common Stock On January 26, 2022, PCA announced that its Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of an additional billion of the Company s outstanding common stock. Repurchases may be made from time to time in open market or privately negotiated transactions in accordance with applicable securities regulations.

For the full year 2023, sales to ODP represented about of our Paper segment sales. At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we had million and million of accounts receivable due from ODP, respectively, which represents approximately of our total Company receivables for both periods. 

 owned by PCA and owned by Boise Cascade Company ("Boise Cascade"). LTP procures sawtimber, pulpwood, residual chips, and other residual wood fiber to meet the wood and fiber requirements of PCA and Boise Cascade in Louisiana. PCA is the primary beneficiary of LTP and has the power to direct the activities that most significantly affect the economic performance of LTP. Therefore, we consolidate 100 of LTP in our financial statements in our Corporate and Other segment. The carrying amounts of LTP's assets and liabilities (which relate primarily to non-inventory working capital items) on our Consolidated Balance Sheets were million at September 30, 2024 and million at December 31, 2023. During the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, we recorded million and million, respectively, and during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, we recorded million and million, respectively, of LTP sales to Boise Cascade in "Net Sales" in the Consolidated Statements of Income and approximately the same amount of expenses in "Cost of Sales". During the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, fiber purchases from related parties were million and million , respectively, and during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, fiber purchases from related parties were million and million, respectively. Most of these purchases related to chip and log purchases by LTP from Boise Cascade's wood products business. These purchases are recorded in "Cost of Sales" in the Consolidated Statements of Income. 

 reportable segments: Packaging, Paper, and Corporate and Other. These segments represent distinct businesses that are managed separately because of differing products and services. Each of these businesses requires distinct operating and marketing strategies. Each segment s profits and losses are measured on operating profits before interest expense, net, non-operating pension income (expense), and income taxes. For certain allocated expenses, the related assets and liabilities remain in the Corporate and Other segment.

, a tank located in the pulp mill at the Company's DeRidder, Louisiana facility exploded, resulting in three contractor fatalities and other injuries. The Company was served with multiple lawsuits involving the decedents and other allegedly injured parties, alleging negligence on the part of the Company and claiming compensatory and punitive damages. The Company believes that these suits are covered by its liability insurance policies, subject to an aggregate million deductible. The majority of these lawsuits were settled by the Company and its insurers. The Company has not paid any losses in excess of its insurance deductible in connection with these settlements, and its insurance deductible has been satisfied in full. To date, all settlements in excess of the deductible have been paid out by one of the Company s insurers. The remaining lawsuit, which involves nine plaintiffs, was tried in the U.S. District Court for the Middle District of Louisiana in April 2024. On April 24, 2024, a jury awarded these plaintiffs approximately million in compensatory damages. The verdict is subject to interest. The amount of the verdict with interest is within the remaining limits of the Company's liability insurance policies. The matter is in the post-trial stage, and the Company intends to appeal the decision. While the Company cannot predict the outcome of the appeal and the ultimate outcome of this matter, the Company believes that it has sufficient insurance to cover the verdict and interest. At September 30, 2024, the Company recorded an accrual of million including the compensatory damages as well as interest of million in Accrued liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Additionally, a receivable of million for the insurance recovery was recorded in Prepaids and other current assets in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. In May 2017, the EPA conducted an on-site inspection of the DeRidder facility to assess compliance with the Clean Air Act, Risk Management Program RMP ). The Company provided additional information to the EPA promptly after the inspection to address certain areas of concern AOCs observed during the inspection. Since the inspection in 2017, PCA performed several voluntary activities to address the AOCs presented in the EPA's inspection report and has removed the RMP covered process from the facility. In January 2021, the EPA and U.S. Department of Justice DOJ initiated civil judicial enforcement discussions with PCA. During the third quarter of 2022, we reached a settlement with the agencies, resulting in an agreed civil penalty of million. The Company did not admit liability for violation of the Clean Air Act in connection with the settlement. The settlement was approved by the federal district court for the Western District of Louisiana in December 2022, and the agreed civil penalty was paid out in January 2023. Legal Proceedings We are also a party to various legal actions arising in the ordinary course of our business. These legal actions include commercial liability claims, premises liability claims, and employment-related claims, among others. As of the date of this filing, we believe it is not reasonably possible that any of the legal actions against us will, either individually or in the aggregate, have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows.

 Overview 
 PCA is the third largest producer of containerboard products and a leading producer of UFS paper in North America. We operate eight mills and 86 corrugated products manufacturing plants. Our containerboard mills produce linerboard and corrugating medium, which are papers primarily used in the production of corrugated products. Our corrugated products manufacturing plants produce a wide variety of corrugated packaging products, including conventional shipping containers used to protect and transport manufactured goods, multi-color boxes and displays with strong visual appeal that help to merchandise the packaged product in retail locations, and honeycomb protective packaging. In addition, we are a large producer of packaging for meat, fresh fruit and vegetables, processed food, beverages, and other industrial and consumer products. We also manufacture and sell UFS papers, including both commodity and specialty papers, which may have custom or specialized features such as colors, coatings, high brightness, and recycled content. We are headquartered in Lake Forest, Illinois and operate primarily in the United States. 
 Included in this Item 2 are various non-GAAP financial measures, including earnings per diluted share excluding special items, net income excluding special items, earnings before non-operating pension income (expense), interest, income taxes, and depreciation, amortization, and depletion EBITDA ), segment EBITDA, EBITDA excluding special items, and segment EBITDA excluding special items. We provide important disclosures regarding our presentation of non-GAAP financial measures and reconciliations of presented non-GAAP financial measures to the most comparable measures presented in accordance with GAAP later in this section under the caption Non-GAAP Financial Measures. 
 This Item 2 is intended to supplement, and should be read in conjunction with, Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations included in our 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K. 
 Executive Summary 
 Third quarter net sales were 2.18 billion in 2024 and 1.94 billion in 2023. We reported 238 million of net income, or 2.64 per diluted share, during the third quarter of 2024, compared to 183 million, or 2.03 per diluted share, during the same period in 2023. Net income included 1 million of expense for special items in the third quarter of 2024, compared to 2 million of expense for special items in 2023 (discussed below). Excluding special items, net income was 239 million, or 2.65 per diluted share, during the third quarter of 2024, compared to 185 million, or 2.05 per diluted share, in the third quarter of 2023. 1 The increase in net income was driven primarily by higher volume and prices and mix in the Packaging segment, higher volume in the Paper segment, lower freight and logistics expenses, lower scheduled outage expenses, and lower interest expense. These items were partially offset by lower prices and mix in the Paper segment, higher operating and converting costs, higher depreciation expense, and other expenses. For additional detail on special items included in reported GAAP results and other non-GAAP measures, see Item 2. Non-GAAP Financial Measures. 
 Packaging segment operating income was 321 million in the third quarter of 2024, compared to 257 million in the third quarter of 2023. Packaging segment EBITDA excluding special items was 446 million in the third quarter of 2024 compared to 374 million in the third quarter of 2023. 1 The increase was due to higher sales and production volumes and prices and mix, lower freight and logistics expense, and lower scheduled mill outage expenses, partially offset by higher operating and converting costs. Strong demand drove a new all-time containerboard production record of 1.3 million tons. Corrugated plants also had record breaking performance with shipments per day up 11.1 compared to the third quarter of 2023. Prices and mix moved higher as we implemented previously announced price increases for containerboard and corrugated products. 
 Paper segment operating income was 39 million in the third quarter of 2024, compared to 28 million in the third quarter of 2023. Paper segment EBITDA excluding special items was 43 million in the third quarter of 2024, compared to 35 million in the third quarter of 2023. 1 The increase was due to higher sales and production volumes, lower scheduled mill outage expenses, and lower operating costs, partially offset by lower prices and mix and higher freight and logistic expense. 
 Packaging segment operating income was 804 million in the first nine months of 2024, compared to 811 million in the same period in 2023. Packaging segment EBITDA excluding special items was 1,172 million in the first nine months of 2024 compared to 1,171 million in the first nine months of 2023. 1 The slight increase in EBITDA excluding special items was due primarily to higher sales and production volumes, and lower freight and logistics expense, partially offset by lower prices and mix, higher operating and converting costs, higher expenses related to corrugated plant capital projects and other costs, and higher scheduled mill outage expenses. 
 
 1 Net income excluding special items, earnings per diluted share excluding special items, and segment EBITDA excluding special items are non-GAAP financial measures. See Non-GAAP Financial Measures later in this Item 2. 17 

Paper segment operating income was 95 million in the first nine months of 2024, compared to 91 million in the first nine months of 2023. Paper segment EBITDA excluding special items was 114 million in the first nine months of 2024, compared to 115 million in the same period in 2023. 1 The slight decrease in EBITDA excluding special items was due to lower prices and mix and higher scheduled mill outage expenses, partially offset by higher sales and production volumes, and lower operating costs. 
 Industry and Business Conditions 
 Trade publications reported North American industry-wide corrugated products shipments were up 0.6 in total and down (1.0 per workday with one additional shipping day during the third quarter of 2024 compared to the same quarter of 2023. Reported industry containerboard production increased 3.1 compared to the third quarter of 2023. Reported industry containerboard inventories at the end of the third quarter of 2024 were approximately 2.6 million tons, up 1.9 compared to the same period in 2023. Reported containerboard export shipments were up 2.2 compared to the third quarter of 2023. In February 2024, reported index prices increased 40 per ton for linerboard and 60 per ton for corrugating medium, followed by an additional increase in June 2024 of 40 per ton for linerboard and corrugating medium. 
 The market for communication papers competes heavily with electronic data transmission and document storage alternatives. Increasing shifts to these alternatives have reduced usage of traditional print media and communication papers. Trade publications reported North American UFS paper shipments were up 2.7 in the third quarter of 2024 compared to the same quarter of 2023. Average prices reported by a trade publication for cut size office papers were higher by 7 per ton, or 0.5 in the third quarter of 2024, compared to the second quarter of 2024, and lower by 20 per ton, or (1.4 ), compared to the third quarter of 2023. In January 2024, reported index prices declined 40 per ton for cut size office papers and 20 per ton for offset printing papers, followed by 20 per ton price increases in April and May 2024 for both cut size office papers and offset printing papers. 
 Outlook 
 We expect demand in our Packaging segment to remain strong with corrugated shipments-per-day continuing to strengthen and slightly higher containerboard volume. However, total corrugated products shipments will be impacted by two less shipping days than the third quarter and recent hurricane damage to the strawberry crops in Florida affecting our customers. With current containerboard inventory below target levels, we will also attempt to build inventory prior to year-end. We expect continued realization from our previously announced price increases and higher export prices, although with a seasonally less rich mix compared to the third quarter. In our Paper segment, shipments are expected to be lower versus the seasonally stronger third quarter while prices and mix should be fairly flat. Operating and converting costs are expected to increase, driven by higher seasonal energy costs and chemical costs. Scheduled mill maintenance outage costs are estimated to be higher than the third quarter, and depreciation expense should be slightly higher. Considering these items, we expect fourth quarter earnings to be lower than third quarter earnings.

 Income from Operations 
 Income from operations increased 69 million, or 26.5 , during the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same period in 2023. The third quarter of 2024 included 1 million of special items related to corrugated products facility closure costs, compared to 2 million of special items expense primarily related to Jackson mill conversion-related activities and corrugated products facilities closure costs in the third quarter of 2023. 
 Packaging. Packaging segment operating income increased 64 million to 321 million, compared to 257 million during the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase related primarily to higher sales and production volumes 113 million), lower freight expenses 11 million), higher containerboard and corrugated products prices and mix 4 million), and lower annual outage expenses 1 million), partially offset by higher operating and converting costs 58 million), and higher depreciation expense 6 million). Operating costs were higher primarily because we operated the Wallula, Washington containerboard mill for the entire third quarter of 2024 while the mill was temporarily idled during the third quarter of 2023. The third quarter of 2024 included 1 million of special items related to corrugated products facility closure costs, compared to no special items in the third quarter of 2023. 
 19 

Paper. Paper segment operating income increased 11 million to 39 million, compared to 28 million during the three months ended September 30, 2023.

There were no special items in the Paper segment during the third quarter of 2024, compared to 3 million of expense for Jackson mill conversion-related activities in the third quarter of 2023. 
 Non-Operating Pension Income, Interest Expense, Net and Income Taxes 
 Non-operating pension income increased 3 million during the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same period in 2023. The increase in non-operating pension income was related to favorable 2023 asset performance and favorable assumption changes. 
 Interest expense, net for the three months ended September 30, 2024 decreased 3 million when compared to the same period in 2023. The decrease in interest expense, net was primarily due to higher interest income on invested cash in 2024 due to higher rates and higher cash balances. 
 During the three months ended September 30, 2024, we recorded 81 million of income tax expense, compared to 61 million of expense during the three months ended September 30, 2023. The effective tax rate for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was 25.3 and 25.1 , respectively. The increase in our effective tax rate for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023 was primarily due to higher nondeductible employee remuneration paid to covered employees.

The increase was driven primarily by higher volumes in the Packaging and Paper segments, and lower freight and logistic expenses, partially offset by lower prices and mix in the Packaging and Paper segments, higher operating and converting costs, and higher annual outage expense. In the nine months ended September 30, 2024, gross profit included 2 million of special items expense primarily related to Jackson mill conversion-related activities. In the nine months ended September 30, 2023, gross profit included 12 million of special items expense primarily related to closure costs related to corrugated products facilities and Jackson mill conversion-related activities. 
 Selling, General, and Administrative Expenses 
 Selling, general, and administrative expenses SG A increased 25 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same period in 2023. The increase was primarily due to employee-related expenses and higher bad debt expense.

We discuss these items in more detail in Note 5, Other Income (Expense), Net, of the Condensed Notes to Unaudited Quarterly Consolidated Financial Statements in Part I, Item 1. Financial Statements of this Form 10-Q. 
 Income from Operations 
 Income from operations decreased 15 million, or (1.8 ), during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same period in 2023. The first nine months of 2024 and 2023 included special items expense of 11 million and 22 million, respectively, related to Jackson mill conversion-related costs and corrugated facility closure costs. 
 Packaging. Packaging segment operating income decreased 6 million to 804 million during the first nine months of 2024, compared to the same period last year. The decrease related primarily to lower containerboard and corrugated products prices and mix 257 million), higher operating and converting costs 70 million), higher depreciation expense 15 million), higher expenses related to corrugated plant capital projects and other costs 7 million), and higher annual outage expenses 1 million), partially offset by higher sales and production volumes 314 million), and lower freight expenses 22 million). Operating costs were higher primarily because we operated the Wallula, Washington containerboard mill for the entire third quarter of 2024 while the mill was temporarily idled during the third quarter of 2023. Special items during the first nine months of 2024 included 5 million of expense related to Jackson mill conversion-related activities and corrugated facility closure costs, compared to 13 million of expense related to corrugated facility closure costs in the same period in 2023. 
 Paper. Paper segment operating income increased 4 million to 95 million, compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase primarily related to higher sales and production volumes 18 million), lower operating costs 6 million), and lower depreciation 2 million), partially offset by lower prices and mix 22 million), and higher annual outage expenses 3 million). Special items during the first nine months of 2024 and 2023 included 6 million and 9 million, respectively, of expense related to Jackson mill conversion-related activities. 
 Non-Operating Pension Income, Interest Expense, and Income Taxes 
 Non-operating pension income increased 9 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same period in 2023. The increase in non-operating pension income was related to favorable 2023 asset performance and favorable assumption changes. 
 Interest expense, net decreased 13 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same period in 2023. The decrease in interest expense, net was primarily due to higher interest income on invested cash in 2024 due to higher rates and higher cash balances. 
 21 

During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we recorded 189 million of income tax expense, compared to 190 million of expense during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The effective tax rate for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was 24.4 and 24.8 , respectively. The decrease in our effective tax rate for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023 was primarily due to higher excess tax benefits associated with employee restricted stock and performance unit vests. 
 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 Sources and Uses of Cash 
 Our primary sources of liquidity are net cash provided by operating activities and available borrowing capacity under our revolving credit facility. At September 30, 2024, we had 677 million of cash and cash equivalents, 165 million of marketable debt securities, and 323 million of unused borrowing capacity under the revolving credit facility, net of letters of credit. Currently, our primary uses of cash are for operations, capital expenditures, acquisitions, debt service, common stock dividends, and repurchases of common stock. We believe that net cash generated from operating activities, cash on hand, available borrowings under our revolving credit facility, and available capital through access to capital markets will be adequate to meet our liquidity and capital requirements, including payments of any declared common stock dividends, for the foreseeable future. As our debt or credit facilities become due, we will need to repay, extend, or replace such facilities. Our ability to do so will be subject to future economic conditions and financial, business, and other factors, many of which are beyond our control. 
 Below is a summary table of our cash flows, followed by a discussion of our sources and uses of cash through operating activities, investing activities, and financing activities (dollars in millions):

Operating Activities 
 Our operating cash flow is primarily driven by our earnings and changes in operating assets and liabilities, such as accounts receivable, inventories, accounts payable and other accrued liabilities, as well as factors described below. Cash requirements for operating activities are subject to PCA s operating needs and the timing of collection of receivables and payments of payables and expenses. 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, net cash provided by operating activities was 866 million, compared to 980 million in the same period in 2023, a decrease of 114 million. Cash from operations excluding changes in cash used for operating assets and liabilities increased 43 million primarily due to lower pension contributions made during the first nine months in 2024 compared to the same period in 2023, higher accruals for workers compensation made during the first nine months in 2024 compared to the same period in 2023, and higher net income in 2024. Cash from operations decreased by 157 million due to changes in operating assets and liabilities primarily due to the following: 
 a) a net unfavorable change in accounts receivable during the first nine months of 2024 compared to the same period in 2023 primarily due to an increase in accounts receivable levels for the Packaging segment in 2024 due to higher prices and sales volumes and an increase in accounts receivable levels for the Paper segment in 2024 due to higher sales volumes; 

b) a net unfavorable change in prepaid expenses and other current assets during the first nine months of 2024 compared to the same period in 2023 primarily due to the accrued receivable for the insurance recovery related to the DeRidder litigation; 

c) a net unfavorable change in inventories during the first nine months of 2024 compared to the same period in 2023 primarily due to an increase in Packaging segment inventory balances related to higher volume, partially offset by a favorable change in Paper segment inventory balances primarily due to a 2023 increase in Paper segment inventory balances; and 

d) a net unfavorable change in income taxes due to a smaller increase in income tax payables during the first nine months of 2024 compared to the same period in 2023. 

These unfavorable changes were partially offset by the following: 
 e) a net favorable change in accrued liabilities during the first nine months of 2024 compared to the same period in 2023 primarily related to the accrued liability for the DeRidder trial compensatory damages and interest recorded during the first nine months of 2024; and 

f) a net favorable change in accounts payable during the first nine months of 2024 compared to the same period in 2023 primarily related to a larger increase in accounts payable levels during the first nine months of 2024 due to higher volumes.

Investing Activities 
 We used 75 million for investing activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 331 million during the same period in 2023. We spent 468 million for internal capital investments during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 329 million during the same period in 2023. Additionally, in September 2024, we received 400 million in net proceeds from the maturity of our investments in time deposits, which were used to repay our 3.65 senior notes that were due on September 15, 2024. 
 We expect capital investments in 2024 to be within a range of 670 million to 690 million. These expenditures could increase or decrease as a result of a number of factors, including our financial results, strategic opportunities, future economic conditions, and our regulatory compliance requirements. We currently estimate capital expenditures to comply with environmental regulations will be about 15 million in 2024. Our estimated environmental expenditures could vary significantly depending upon the enactment of new environmental laws and regulations. For additional information, see Environmental Matters in Part II, Item 7. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations of our 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K. 
 Financing Activities 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, net cash used for financing activities was 763 million, compared to 396 million of net cash used for financing activities during the same period in 2023. We paid 337 million of dividends during the first nine months of both 2024 and 2023. In addition, we withheld shares to cover 25 million of employee restricted stock taxes during the first nine months of 2024 compared to 16 million of employee restricted stock taxes withheld during the same period in 2023. We did not have any repurchases and retirements of the Company s common stock during the first nine months of 2024, compared to repurchases and retirements of 0.3 million shares of the Company's common stock for 42 million during the same period in 2023. 
 On September 15, 2024, we used the net proceeds received from the November 2023 offering of the 5.70 senior notes due 2033 and cash on hand to repay our outstanding 3.65 senior notes due 2024. The repayment of the old 3.65 notes was 400 million excluding accrued interest. 
 In addition to the items discussed in Note 11, Debt, of the Condensed Notes to Unaudited Quarterly Consolidated Financial Statements in "Part I, Item 1. Financial Statements" of this Form 10-Q, see Note 10, Debt, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of our 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K for more information. 
 Contractual Obligations 
 There have been no material changes to the contractual obligations disclosed in Item 7. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations of our 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K. 
 Non-GAAP Financial Measures 
 Earnings per diluted share excluding special items, net income excluding special items, EBITDA, segment EBITDA, EBITDA excluding special items, and segment EBITDA excluding special items are non-GAAP financial measures. Management excludes special items, as it believes that these items are not necessarily reflective of the ongoing operations of our business. These measures are presented because they provide a means to evaluate the performance of our segments and our Company on an ongoing basis using the same measures that are used by our management, because these measures assist in providing a meaningful comparison between periods and because these measures are frequently used by investors and other interested parties in the evaluation of companies and the performance of their segments. Any analysis of non-GAAP financial measures should be done in conjunction with results presented in accordance with GAAP. The non-GAAP measures are not intended to be substitutes for GAAP financial measures and should not be used as such. Reconciliations of the non-GAAP measures to the most comparable measure reported in accordance with GAAP are detailed below.

Market Risk and Risk Management Policies 
 PCA is exposed to the impact of commodity price changes, interest rate changes, and changes in the market value of its financial instruments. To manage these risks, we may from time to time enter into transactions, including certain physical commodity transactions, that are determined to be derivatives. As of September 30, 2024, we are party to certain physical commodity transactions related to natural gas supply contracts. These contracts qualify for the normal purchase normal sale ("NPNS") exception, and we have elected that exception. For a discussion of derivatives and hedging activities, see Note 2, Summary of Significant Account Policies, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of our 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K. 
 At September 30, 2024, interest rates on 100 of PCA s outstanding debt are fixed.

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 
 Management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon the Company s consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. On an ongoing basis, PCA evaluates its estimates, including those related to business combinations, pensions and other postretirement benefits, goodwill and intangible assets, long-lived asset impairment, environmental liabilities, and income taxes, among others. PCA bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. 
 PCA has included in its 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K a discussion of its critical accounting policies and estimates which require management s most difficult, subjective, or complex judgments used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements. PCA has not had any changes to these critical accounting estimates during the first nine months of 2024. 
 New and Recently Adopted Accounting Standards 
 For a listing of our new and recently adopted accounting standards, see Note 2, New and Recently Adopted Accounting Standards, of the Condensed Notes to Unaudited Quarterly Consolidated Financial Statements in Part I, Item 1. Financial Statements of this Form 10-Q. 
 Forward-Looking Statements 
 Some of the statements in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, and in particular, statements found in this Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, that are not historical in nature are forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Forward-looking statements include statements about our expectations regarding our future liquidity, earnings, expenditures, and financial condition. These statements are often identified by the words will, should, anticipate, believe, expect, intend, estimate, hope, or similar expressions. These statements reflect management s current views with respect to future events and are subject to risks and uncertainties. There are important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in forward-looking statements, many of which are beyond our control. These factors, risks and uncertainties include the following: 
 the impact of general economic conditions; 

the impact of acquired businesses and risks and uncertainties regarding operation, expected benefits and integration of such businesses; 

containerboard, corrugated products, and white paper general industry conditions, including competition, product demand, product pricing, and input costs; 

fluctuations in wood fiber and recycled fiber costs; 

fluctuations in purchased energy costs; 

the possibility of unplanned outages or interruptions at our principal facilities; and 

legislative or regulatory actions or requirements, particularly concerning environmental or tax matters. 

Our actual results, performance or achievement could differ materially from those expressed in, or implied by, these forward-looking statements, and accordingly, we can give no assurances that any of the events anticipated by the forward-looking statements will transpire or occur, or if any of them do occur, what impact they will have on our results of operations or financial condition. Given these uncertainties, investors are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements. We expressly disclaim any obligation to publicly revise any forward-looking statements that have been made to reflect the occurrence of events after the date hereof. For a discussion of other factors, risks and uncertainties that may affect our business, see Item 1A. Risk Factors included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023.

 Item 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 
 PCA maintains disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934) that are designed to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed in PCA s filings under the Securities Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the periods specified in the rules and forms of the SEC and that such information is accumulated and communicated to PCA s management, including its Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 
 Prior to filing this report, PCA completed an evaluation under the supervision and with the participation of PCA s management, including PCA s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of PCA s disclosure controls and procedures as of September 30, 2024. The evaluation of PCA s disclosure controls and procedures included a review of the controls objectives and design, PCA s implementation of the controls, and the effect of the controls on the information generated for use in this report. Based on this evaluation, PCA s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that PCA s disclosure controls and procedures were effective at the reasonable assurance level as of September 30, 2024. 
 Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 There have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act) that occurred during the most recent fiscal quarter ended September 30, 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
