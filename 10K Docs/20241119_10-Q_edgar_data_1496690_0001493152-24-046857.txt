, and used net cash flows in
operating activities of for the six months ended September 30, 2024, and has an accumulated deficit and working capital deficit
of and , as of September 30, 2024. These factors, among others, raise a substantial doubt regarding the Company s
ability to continue as a going concern operation for a period of 12 months from the issuance date of these condensed financial statements.
The continuation of the Company as a going concern is dependent upon the continued financial support from its shareholders, the ability
of the Company to obtain necessary financing to continue operations, and the attainment of profitability. If the Company is unable to
obtain adequate capital, it could be forced to cease operations. The accompanying condensed financial statements do not include any adjustments
to reflect the recoverability and classification of recorded asset amounts and classification of liabilities that might be necessary
should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern. 

Basis
of Presentation 

The
interim unaudited condensed financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the
United States of America GAAP and include the accounts of the Company. The preparation of interim condensed financial
statements requires management to make assumptions and estimates that impact the amounts reported. The interim condensed financial statements
and accompanying notes are the representations of the Company s management, who is responsible for their integrity and objectivity.
These interim condensed financial statements, reflect all adjustments, consisting of normal recurring adjustments, necessary for a fair
presentation of the Company s results of operations, financial position and cash flows for the interim periods ended September 30, 2024
and 2023; however, certain information and footnote disclosures normally included in our audited annual financial statements, as included
in the Company s interim condensed financial statements, have been condensed or omitted pursuant to such SEC rules and regulations
and accounting principles applicable for interim periods. These unaudited condensed financial statements should be read in conjunction
with the financial statements and the notes thereto included in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K/A for the year ended March
31, 2024, filed with the SEC on July 15, 2024. It is important to note that the Company s results of operations and cash flows
for interim periods are not necessarily indicative of the results of operations and cash flows to be expected for a full fiscal year
or any other interim period.

of the asset or asset group may not be recoverable. Maintenance and repairs are charged to operations as incurred. Expenditures which
substantially increase the useful lives of the related assets are capitalized.

The
Company follows the provisions of ASC 740-10, Accounting for Uncertain Income Tax Positions . When tax returns are
filed, it is highly certain that some positions taken would be sustained upon examination by the taxing authorities, while others are
subject to uncertainty about the merits of the position taken or the amount of the position that would be ultimately sustained. In accordance
with the guidance of ASC 740-10, the benefit of a tax position is recognized in the financial statements in the period during which,
based on all available evidence, management believes it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination,
including the resolution of appeals or litigation processes, if any. Tax positions taken are not offset or aggregated with other positions.
Tax positions that meet the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold are measured as the largest amount of tax benefit that is likely of being realized upon settlement with the applicable taxing authority. The portion of the benefits associated
with tax positions taken that exceeds the amount measured as described above should be reflected as a liability for unrecognized tax
benefits in the accompanying balance sheets along with any associated interest and penalties that would be payable to the taxing authorities
upon examination.

Critical
Accounting Policies and Estimates 

We
apply the following critical accounting policies and estimates in the preparation of our financial statements: 

17 

Inventory 

Inventory
is finished goods which consists of plastic prepaid debit cards and gift cards not yet loaded with funds. and is valued at the lower
of cost or net realizable value using the specific identification method. The reported net value of inventory includes saleable prepaid
debit cards and gift cards that will be sold or used in future periods. The Company reserves for obsolete and slow-moving inventory. 

Internal-Use
Software Development Costs 

Costs
incurred to develop internal-use software during the preliminary project stage are expensed as incurred. Internal-use software development
costs are capitalized during the application development stage, which is after: (i) the preliminary project stage is completed; and (ii)
management authorizes and commits to funding the project and it is probable the project will be completed and used to perform the function
intended. Capitalization ceases at the point the software project is substantially complete and ready for its intended use, and after
all substantial testing is completed. Upgrades and enhancements are capitalized if it is probable that those expenditures will result
in additional functionality. Amortization is provided for on a straight-line basis over the expected useful life of five years of the
internal-use software development costs and related upgrades and enhancements. When existing software is replaced with new software,
the unamortized costs of the old software are expensed when the new software is ready for its intended use. 

The
Company conducts a qualitative assessment of internal-use software impairment using the guidelines of ASC 350-40-35-1 Internal-Use
Software . If impairment is indicated, then the Company conducts a quantitative impairment test under ASC 360 for long lived assets. 

Stock-based
Compensation 

The
Company accounts for equity-based transactions with non-employees under the provisions of ASC Topic No. 505-50, Equity-Based Payments
to Non-Employees ASC 505-50 ). The Company has established that equity-based payment transactions with non-employees
shall be measured at the fair value of the consideration received or the fair value of the equity instruments issued, whichever is more
reliably measurable. Under ASU 2018-07 which aligns the measurement date criteria for non-employees with ASC 718 for employees, the fair
value of common stock issued for payments to non-employees is measured on the date of grant. The fair value of equity instruments, other
than common stock, is estimated using the Black-Scholes option valuation model. In general, we recognize the fair value of the equity
instruments issued as deferred stock compensation and amortize the cost over the term of the contract. 

The
Company accounts for employee stock-based compensation in accordance with the guidance of ASC Topic 718, Compensation Stock
Compensation. Under the fair value recognition provisions, stock-based compensation expense is measured at the grant date based on
the fair value of the award and is recognized ratably over the requisite service period. 

18 

Revenue
Recognition 

The
Company recognizes revenues from card sales, when the product is deemed delivered to the customer, and the ownership/control is transferred.
The Company will recognize revenue from card services fees and card transactions once the service or transaction is completed, respectively.
The Company s revenue recognition policy is based on the revenue recognition criteria established under the Financial Accounting
Standards Board Accounting Standards Codification 606 Revenue From Contracts With Customers which has established
a five-step process to govern contract revenue and satisfy each element is as follows: (1) Identify the contract(s) with a customer;
(2) identify the performance obligations in the contract; (3) determine the transaction price; (4) allocate the transaction price to
the performance obligations in the contract; and (5) recognize revenue when or as you satisfy a performance obligation. The Company records
the revenue once all the above steps are completed. 

Under
this guidance, revenue is recognized when control of promised goods or services is transferred to our customers, in an amount that reflects
the consideration we expect to be entitled to in exchange for those goods or services. We review our sales transactions to identify contractual
rights, performance obligations, and transaction prices, including the allocation of prices to separate performance obligations, if applicable.
Revenue and costs of sales are recognized once products or services are delivered to the customer s control and performance obligations
are satisfied.

Investing

Net
cash used in investing activities for the six months ended September 30, 2024, was 0. Net cash used in investing activities for the
six months ended September 30, 2023, totaled 696,550 due to cash paid for purchase of internal-use software development costs of 383,001
and purchase of property and equipment of 313,549. 

Financing
Activities 

Net
cash provided by financing activities for the six months ended September 30, 2024, was 160,000 consisting of cash received from sale
of common stock. Net cash provided by financing activities for the six months ended September 30, 2023 was 1,180,000 consisting of cash
received from sale of common stock. 

Future
Capital Requirements 

Our
current available cash may not be sufficient to satisfy our liquidity requirements. Our capital requirements for the next twelve months
will depend on numerous factors, including management s evaluation of the timing of projects to pursue. Subject to our ability
to generate revenues and cash flow from operations and our ability to raise additional capital (including through possible joint ventures
and/or partnerships), we expect to incur substantial expenditures to carry out our business plan, as well as costs associated with our
capital raising efforts, and being a public company. 

Our
plans to finance our operations include seeking equity and debt financing, alliances or other partnership agreements, or other business
transactions, that would generate sufficient resources to ensure continuation of our operations. 

The
sale of additional equity or debt securities may result in additional dilution to our shareholders. If we raise additional funds through
the issuance of debt securities or preferred stock, these securities could have rights senior to those of our common stock and could
contain covenants that would restrict our operations. Any required additional capital may not be available on reasonable terms, if at
all. If we were unable to obtain additional financing, we may be required to reduce the scope of, delay or eliminate some or all of our
planned activities and limit our operations which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results
of operations. 

Inflation 

The
amounts presented in our financial statements do not provide for the effect of inflation on our operations or financial position. The
net operating losses shown would be greater than reported if the effects of inflation were reflected either by charging operations with
amounts that represent replacement costs or by using other inflation adjustments. 

22 

Going
Concern 

The
accompanying interim condensed financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis which contemplates the realization of
assets and settlement of liabilities and commitments in the normal course of business. The Company has not yet generated any significant
revenues and has suffered operating losses since July 6, 2007 (Inception Date) to date. The Company has recorded a net loss of 493,420,
used net cash flows in operating activities of 223,088 for the six months ended September 30, 2024, and has an accumulated deficit and
working capital deficit of 4,365,172 and 887,855 as of September 30, 2024. These factors, among others, raise a substantial doubt regarding
the Company s ability to continue as a going concern operation for a period of 12 months from the issuance date of these condensed
financial statements. The continuation of the Company as a going concern is dependent upon the continued financial support from its shareholders,
the ability of the Company to obtain necessary financing to continue operations, and the attainment of profitability. If the Company
is unable to obtain adequate capital, it could be forced to cease operations. The accompanying interim condensed financial statements
do not include any adjustments to reflect the recoverability and classification of recorded asset amounts and classification of liabilities
that might be necessary should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern. 

Development
Stage and Capital Resources 

We
have devoted substantially all of our efforts to business planning since our inception on July 6, 2007. Accordingly, we are considered
to be in the development stage. We have not generated any revenues from our operations on a commercial scale and we will not commence
generating revenues until sometime during the first calendar quarter of 2025. 

Off-Balance
Sheet Arrangements 

We
have not engaged in any off-balance sheet arrangements as defined in Item 303(c) of the SEC s Regulation S-K. We did not have any
relationships with unconsolidated organizations or financial partnerships, such as structured finance or special-purpose entities that
would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes. 

Recent
Accounting Pronouncements 

We
have implemented all new accounting pronouncements that are in effect and that may impact our financial statements and do not believe
that there are any other new accounting pronouncements that have been issued that might have a material impact on our financial position
or results of operations which have not been adopted.

4. Controls and Procedures. 

Evaluation
of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

As
of the end of the period covered by this report, we carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of our
management, including our Principal Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls
and procedures, as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Currently, there is only one officer
and one director, and as such is solely responsible for evaluating the Company s disclosure controls and procedures. Based upon
that evaluation, the principal executive officer (who also serves as the principal financial and accounting officer) believes that the
Company s disclosure controls and procedures are not effective as of September 30, 2024 due to the material weaknesses in internal
control over financial reporting. We noted deficiencies involving lack of segregation of duties, lack of internal control documentation
that we believe to be material weaknesses. Other material weaknesses include lack of monitoring controls over the evaluation of impairment
of intangibles and long-lived assets. 

Changes
in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 

Other
than the deficiencies as disclosed above, there have been no changes in our internal control over financial
reporting during the quarter ended September 30, 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our
internal control over financial reporting.

PART
II. 

Item
2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds. 

During
the three months ended September 30, 2024, the Company sold 21,250 shares of common stock for a total cash consideration of 85,000. 

The
shares of common stock were issued and sold pursuant to exemptions from the registration requirements of Section 5 of the Securities
Act contained in Section 4(a)(2) and/or Regulation D thereof. No sales commissions were paid in connection with the sales of these securities
and no general solicitation was used. 

Item
5. Other Information. 

During
the quarter ended September 30, 2024, no director or officer of the Company or a Rule 10b5-1 trading arrangement 
or non-Rule 10b5-1 trading arrangement, as each term is defined in Item 408(a) of Regulation S-K.
