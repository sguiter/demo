and of gold is allocated gold in the form of good delivery gold bars as of September 30, 2024 and 2023,
respectively. A current list of all gold held by the Custodian is available on the sponsor s website. The cost of gold is determined
according to the average cost method and the fair value is based on the London Bullion Market Association LBMA PM Gold
Price. If there is no LBMA Gold Price PM on any day, the Trustee is authorized to use the most recently announced LBMA Gold Price AM
unless the Trustee, in consultation with the Sponsor, determines that such price is inappropriate as a basis for evaluation. 

The
LBMA PM Gold Price is set using the afternoon session of the ICE Benchmark Administration equilibrium auction, an electronic, tradable
and auditable over-the-counter auction market with the ability to participate in US Dollars, Euros or British Pounds for LBMA authorized
participating gold bullion banks or market makers that establishes a reference gold price for that day s trading. 

The
per Share amount of gold exchanged for a purchase or redemption is calculated daily by the Trustee, using the LBMA PM Gold Price to calculate
the gold amount in respect of any liabilities for which covering gold sales have not yet been made, and represents the per Share amount
of gold held by the Trust, after giving effect to its liabilities, to cover expenses and liabilities and any losses that may have occurred. 

ASC
820 establishes a hierarchy that prioritizes inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value. The three levels of inputs are
as follows: 

Level
1: Unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the Trust has the ability to access. 

Level
2: Observable inputs other than quoted prices included in level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability either directly or indirectly.
These inputs may include quoted prices for the identical instrument on an inactive market, prices for similar instruments and similar
data. 

Level
3: Unobservable inputs for the asset or liability to the extent that relevant observable inputs are not available, representing the Trust s
own assumptions about the assumptions that a market participant would use in valuing the asset or liability, and that would be based
on the best information available.

of the adjusted daily net asset value of the Trust, paid monthly in arrears. 

The
Sponsor has agreed to assume administrative and marketing expenses incurred by the Trust, including the Trustee s monthly fee and
out of pocket expenses, the Custodian s fee and the reimbursement of the Custodian s expenses, exchange listing fees, United
States Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC registration fees, printing and mailing costs, audit fees and certain
legal expenses. 

As
of period ended September 30, 2024, the fees payable to the Sponsor were . As of the year ended June 30, 2024, the fees payable
to the Sponsor were . 

With
respect to expenses not otherwise assumed by the Sponsor, the Trustee will, at the direction of the Sponsor or in its own discretion,
sell the Trust s gold as necessary to pay these expenses. When selling gold to pay expenses, the Trustee will endeavor to sell
the smallest amounts of gold needed to pay these expenses in order to minimize the Trust s holdings of assets other than gold.
Other than the Sponsor s Fee, the Trust had expenses during the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. 

Unless
otherwise directed by the Sponsor, when selling gold the Trustee will endeavor to sell at the price established by the LBMA PM Gold Price.
The Trustee will place orders with dealers (which may include the Custodian) through which the Trustee expects to receive the most favorable
price and execution of orders. The Custodian may be the purchaser of such gold only if the sale transaction is made at the next LBMA
PM Gold Price or such other publicly available price that the Sponsor deems fair, in each case as set following the sale order. A gain
or loss is recognized based on the difference between the selling price and the cost of the gold sold. Neither the Trustee nor the Sponsor
is liable for depreciation or loss incurred by reason of any sale. 

Realized
gains and losses result from the transfer of gold for Share redemptions and / or to pay expenses and are recognized on a trade date basis
as the difference between the fair value and cost of gold transferred. Gain or loss on sales of gold bullion is calculated on a trade
date basis using the average cost method. 

Shares (a block of Shares is called a Basket only to Authorized
Participants. The creation and redemption of Baskets will only be made in exchange for the delivery to the Trust or the distribution
by the Trust of the amount of gold represented by the Baskets being created or redeemed, the amount of which will be based on the combined
Fine Ounces represented by the number of shares included in the Baskets being created or redeemed determined on the day the order to
create or redeem Baskets is properly received. 

Orders
to create and redeem Baskets may be placed only by Authorized Participants. An Authorized Participant must: (1) be a registered broker-dealer
or other securities market participant, such as a bank or other financial institution, which, but for an exclusion from registration,
would be required to register as a broker-dealer to engage in securities transactions, (2) be a participant in DTC, and (3) must have
an agreement with the Custodian establishing an unallocated account in London or have an existing unallocated account meeting the standards
described herein. To become an Authorized Participant, a person must enter into an Authorized Participant Agreement with the Sponsor
and the Trustee. The Authorized Participant Agreement provides the procedures for the creation and redemption of Baskets and for the
delivery of the gold required for such creations and redemptions. The Authorized Participant Agreement and the related procedures attached
thereto may be amended by the Trustee and the Sponsor, without the consent of any investor or Authorized Participant. A transaction fee
of will be assessed on all creation and redemption transactions. Multiple Baskets may be created on the same day, provided each
Basket meets the requirements described below and that the Custodian is able to allocate gold to the Trust Allocated Account such that
the Trust Unallocated Account holds no more than Fine Ounces of gold at the close of a business day. 

Authorized
Participants who make deposits with the Trust in exchange for Baskets will receive no fees, commissions or other form of compensation
or inducement of any kind from either the Sponsor or the Trust, and no such person has any obligation or responsibility to the Sponsor
or the Trust to effect any sale or resale of shares. 

reserves for uncertain tax positions are required as of September 30, 2024 and June 30, 2024. 

The
Sponsor evaluates tax positions taken or expected to be taken in the course of preparing the Trust s tax returns to determine whether
the tax positions are more-likely-than-not to be sustained by the applicable tax authority. Tax positions not deemed to
meet that threshold would be recorded as an expense in the current year. The Trust is required to analyze all open tax years. Open tax
years are those years that are open for examination by the relevant income taxing authority.

Item
2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 

This
information should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and notes to financial statements included in Item 1 of Part
I of this Form 10-Q. The discussion and analysis that follows may contain statements that relate to future events or future performance.
In some cases, such forward-looking statements can be identified by terminology such as may, should, could, 
 expect, plan, anticipate, believe, estimate, predict, 
 potential or the negative of these terms or other comparable terminology. Except as required by applicable disclosure laws,
neither the Sponsor, nor any other person assumes responsibility for the accuracy or completeness of any forward-looking statements.
Neither the Trust nor the Sponsor is under a duty to update any of the forward-looking statements to conform such statements to actual
results or to a change in the Sponsor s expectations or predictions. 

Introduction 

The
Trust is a common law trust, formed under the laws of the state of New York on August 24, 2017. The Trust is not managed like a corporation
or an active investment vehicle. It does not have any officers, directors, or employees and is administered by the Trustee pursuant to
the Trust Agreement. The Trust is not registered as an investment company under the Investment Company Act of 1940 and is not required
to register under such act. It does not hold or trade in commodity futures contracts, nor is it a commodity pool, or subject to regulation
as a commodity pool operator or a commodity trading adviser in connection with issuing Shares. 

The
Trust holds gold and is expected to issue Baskets in exchange for deposits of gold, and to distribute gold in connection with redemptions
of Baskets. Shares issued by the Trust represent units of undivided beneficial interest in and ownership of the Trust. The investment
objective of the Trust is for the Shares to reflect the performance of the price of gold, less the Trust s expenses. The Sponsor
believes that, for many investors, the Shares will represent a cost-effective investment relative to traditional means of investing in
gold. 

The
Trust issues and redeems Shares only with Authorized Participants in exchange for gold and only in aggregations of 50,000 Shares or integral
multiples thereof. A list of current Authorized Participants is available from the Sponsor or the Trustee. 

Shares

Valuation
of Gold; Computation of Net Asset Value 

On
each business day, as soon as practicable after 4:00 p.m. (New York time), the Trustee evaluates the gold held by the Trust and determines
the net asset value of the Trust and the NAV. The Trustee values the gold held by the Trust using that day s LBMA Gold Price PM.
If there is no announced LBMA Gold Price PM on a business day, the Trustee is authorized to use that day s LBMA Gold Price AM.
Having valued the gold held by the Trust, the Trustee then subtracts all accrued fees, expenses and other liabilities of the Trust from
the value of the gold and other assets of the Trust. The result is the net asset value of the Trust. The Trustee computes the NAV by
dividing the net asset value of the Trust by the number of Shares outstanding on the date the computation is made. 

Liquidity
and Capital Resources 

The
Trust is not aware of any trends, demands, commitments, events or uncertainties that are reasonably likely to result in material changes
to its liquidity needs. In exchange for the Sponsor s Fee, the Sponsor has agreed to assume most of the expenses incurred by the
Trust. As a result, the only ordinary expense of the Trust during the period covered by this report was the Sponsor s Fee. 

The
Trustee will, at the direction of the Sponsor or in its own discretion, sell the Trust s gold as necessary to pay the Trust s
expenses not otherwise assumed by the Sponsor. The Trustee will not sell gold to pay the Sponsor s Fee but will pay the Sponsor s
Fee through in-kind transfers of gold to the Sponsor. On September 30, 2024 the Trust did not have any cash balances. 

Off-Balance
Sheet Arrangements 

The
Trust has no off-balance sheet arrangements. 

Critical
Accounting Policies 

The
financial statements and accompanying notes are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States
of America. The preparation of these financial statements relies on estimates and assumptions that impact the Trust s financial
position and results of operations. These estimates and assumptions affect the Trust s application of accounting policies. Below,
the Trust describes the valuation of gold bullion, a critical accounting policy that the Trust believes is important to understanding
its results of operations and financial position. In addition, please refer to Note 2 to the financial statements included in this report
for further discussion of the Trust s accounting policies. 

Results
of Operations 

The
Quarter Ended September 30, 2024 

The
Trust s net asset value increased from 790,994,009 on June 30, 2024 to 879,107,605 on September 30, 2024, a 11.14 increase.
The Trust s number of shares outstanding decreased from 34,350,000 to 33,850,000 over this period. The net 500,000 shares decrease
was a result of 6 creation orders and 16 redemption orders (50,000 shares per creation and redemption). The Trust s net asset value
was positively impacted by the change in the price of gold, which increased 12.83 from 2,330.90 on June 30, 2024 to 2,629.95 on September
30, 2024. 

The
12.77 increase in the Trust s net asset value per share, from 23.03 on June 30, 2024, to 25.97 on September 30, 2024 is directly
related to the 12.83 increase in the price of gold. 

The
Trust s net asset value per share increased slightly less than the price of gold on a percentage basis due to the Sponsor s
fees, which were 366,604 for the quarter, or 0.1749 of the Trust s average weighted net assets of 830,592,005 during the quarter.
The net asset value per share of 26.31 on September 26, 2024, was the highest during the quarter, compared with a low during the quarter
of 23.01 on July 01, 2024. 

Net
increase in net assets resulting from operations for the quarter ended September 30, 2024, was 100,010,521, resulting from an unrealized
gain on investment in gold bullion of 93,978,695, increased by a gain of 6,398,430 on metal sold to cover redemption orders and Sponsor s
fees but increased by the Sponsor s fees of 366,604. Other than the Sponsor s fees the Trust had no expenses during the
quarter.

3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 

Not

Item
4. Controls and Procedures 

Disclosure
Controls and Procedures 

The
duly authorized officers of the Sponsor, performing functions equivalent to those a principal executive officer and principal financial
officer of the Trust would perform if the Trust had any officers, have evaluated the effectiveness of the Trust s disclosure controls
and procedures, and have concluded that the disclosure controls and procedures of the Trust were effective as of the end of the period
covered by this report. Such disclosure controls and procedures are designed to provide reasonable assurance that information required
to be disclosed in the reports that the Trust files or submits under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, are recorded, processed,
summarized and reported, within the time period specified in the applicable rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated
and communicated to the duly authorized officers of the Sponsor performing functions equivalent to those a principal executive officer
and principal financial officer of the Trust would perform if the Trust had any officers, and to Audit Committee of the Sponsor, as appropriate,
to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 

Internal
Control over Financial Reporting 

There
has been no change in the internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the fiscal quarter that has materially affected,
or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the Trust s internal control over financial reporting.
