 Item 2. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 
 You should read the following in conjunction with our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements and the related notes thereto that appear elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and the audited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto and under the heading Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in our Annual Report on Form 10-K filed on February 22, 2024. In addition to historical information, the following discussion and analysis includes forward-looking information that involves risks, uncertainties and assumptions. Our actual results and the timing of events could differ materially from those anticipated by these forward-looking statements as a result of many factors, including those discussed under Risk Factors in our Annual Report on Form 10-K filed on February 22, 2024, as updated from time to time in our subsequent periodic and current reports filed with the SEC. 
 
 Overview 
 We are a biopharmaceutical company focused on the discovery, clinical development and commercialization of innovative, small molecule drugs that address underserved medical needs primarily in psychiatric and neurological disorders. 
 Commercial Product 
 In December 2019, CAPLYTA (lumateperone) was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), for the treatment of schizophrenia in adults (42 mg/day) and we initiated the commercial launch of CAPLYTA in March 2020. In December 2021, CAPLYTA was approved by the FDA for the treatment of bipolar depression in adults (42 mg/day). We initiated the commercial launch of CAPLYTA for the treatment of bipolar depression in December 2021. Additionally, in April 2022, the FDA approved two additional dosage strengths of CAPLYTA, 10.5 mg and 21 mg capsules, to provide dosage recommendations for patients concomitantly taking strong or moderate CYP3A4 inhibitors, and 21 mg capsules for patients with moderate or severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh class B or C). We initiated the commercial launch of these special population doses in August 2022. As used in this report, CAPLYTA refers to lumateperone approved by the FDA for the treatment of schizophrenia in adults and for the treatment of bipolar depression in adults, and lumateperone refers to, where applicable, CAPLYTA as well as lumateperone for the treatment of indications beyond schizophrenia and bipolar depression. 
 Clinical and Nonclinical Development Programs 
 Lumateperone Program 
 Lumateperone is in Phase 3 clinical development as a novel treatment for major depressive disorder, or MDD. In April 2024 and June 2024, we announced positive topline results from our Phase 3 clinical trials, Study 501 and Study 502, respectively, evaluating lumateperone 42 mg as an adjunctive therapy to antidepressants for the treatment of MDD. In both studies, lumateperone 42 mg given once daily as adjunctive therapy to antidepressants met the primary endpoint by demonstrating a statistically significant and clinically meaningful reduction in the Montgomery Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) total score compared to placebo at Week 6. In Study 501, in the modified intent-to-treat (mITT) study population, the least squares (LS) mean reduction from baseline for lumateperone 42 mg was 14.7 points, versus 9.8 points for placebo (LS mean difference = -4.9 points; p Table of Contents 

 Adverse events were mostly mild to moderate and resolved within a short period of time. These adverse events were similar to those seen in prior studies of lumateperone as a treatment for bipolar depression and schizophrenia. 
 We recently completed clinical conduct of our open label roll-over study, Study 503, to assess long-term safety in patients with MDD. We expect to submit a supplemental new drug application, or sNDA, with the FDA for approval of lumateperone as an adjunctive therapy to antidepressants for the treatment of MDD in the fourth quarter of 2024. 
 We are currently conducting an additional global Phase 3 clinical trial, Study 505, evaluating lumateperone 42 mg as an adjunctive therapy to antidepressants for the treatment of MDD. Following our positive results in Studies 501 and 502, we have amended the entry criteria of Study 505 to obtain additional clinical experience with lumateperone in patients who have had an inadequate response to a greater number of antidepressants. The objective of this study is to further expand the large body of evidence supporting lumateperone antidepressant efficacy across different patient populations. 
 In the first quarter of 2020, as part of our lumateperone bipolar depression clinical program, we initiated our third monotherapy Phase 3 study, Study 403, evaluating lumateperone as monotherapy in the treatment of major depressive episodes associated with bipolar I or bipolar II disorder. Following the positive results in our adjunctive study that was part of our bipolar depression clinical program, Study 402, we amended Study 403 to evaluate major depressive episodes with mixed features in bipolar disorder in patients with bipolar I or bipolar II disorder and mixed features in patients with MDD. In March 2023, we announced positive topline results from Study 403 as lumateperone 42 mg given once daily met the primary endpoint in the study by demonstrating a statistically significant and clinically meaningful reduction in the MADRS total score compared to placebo at Week 6 in the combined patient population of MDD with mixed features and bipolar depression with mixed features (5.7 point reduction vs. placebo; p Table of Contents 

 ITI-1284 Program 
 We are developing ITI-1284-ODT-SL for the treatment of generalized anxiety disorder, psychosis in Alzheimer's disease and agitation in patients with Alzheimer's disease. ITI-1284-ODT-SL is a deuterated form of lumateperone, a new molecular entity formulated as an oral disintegrating tablet for sublingual administration. ITI-1284-ODT-SL is formulated as an oral solid dosage form that dissolves almost instantly when placed under the tongue, allowing for ease of use in the elderly and may be particularly beneficial for patients who have difficulty swallowing conventional tablets. Phase 1 single and multiple ascending dose studies in healthy volunteers and healthy elderly volunteers (> than 65 years of age) evaluated the safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics of ITI-1284-ODT-SL. In these studies, there were no reported serious adverse events in either age group. In the elderly cohort, reported adverse events were infrequent with the most common adverse event being transient dry mouth (mild). Based on these results, we have initiated Phase 2 programs evaluating ITI-1284-ODT-SL for the treatment of generalized anxiety disorder, psychosis in Alzheimer's disease and agitation in patients with Alzheimer s disease. The FDA has informed us that they do not believe the deuterated and undeuterated forms of lumateperone are identical. As a result, the non-clinical data from lumateperone may not be broadly applied to ITI-1284-ODT-SL, and we conducted additional toxicology studies. These studies have been completed and patient enrollment is ongoing in our Phase 2 study evaluating ITI-1284-ODT-SL as adjunctive therapy to anti-anxiety medications in patients with generalized anxiety disorder. We expect to initiate patient enrollment in our Phase 2 study evaluating ITI-1284-ODT-SL as monotherapy in patients with generalized anxiety disorder in the fourth quarter of 2024. We have also initiated patient enrollment in a Phase 2 clinical study evaluating ITI-1284-ODT-SL in patients with psychosis associated with Alzheimer s disease and in a Phase 2 clinical study evaluating ITI-1284-ODT-SL in patients with agitation associated with Alzheimer s disease. We are continuing with Phase 1 studies with ITI-1284-ODT-SL, including drug-drug interaction studies. 
 PDE1 Program 
 We have another major program that has yielded a portfolio of compounds that selectively inhibit the enzyme phosphodiesterase type 1, or PDE1. PDE1 enzymes are highly active in multiple disease states, and our PDE1 inhibitors are designed to reestablish normal function in these disease states. Abnormal PDE1 activity is associated with cellular proliferation and activation of inflammatory cells. Our PDE1 inhibitors ameliorate both of these effects in animal models. We intend to pursue the development of our phosphodiesterase, or PDE, program, for the treatment of aberrant immune system activation in several central nervous system, or CNS, and non-CNS conditions with a focus on diseases where excessive PDE1 activity has been demonstrated and increased inflammation is an important contributor to disease pathogenesis. Our potential disease targets include immune system regulation, neurodegenerative diseases, cancers and other non-CNS disorders. Lenrispodun (ITI-214) is our lead compound in this program. Following the favorable safety and tolerability results in our Phase 1 program, we initiated our development program for lenrispodun for Parkinson s disease and conducted a Phase 1/2 clinical trial of lenrispodun in patients with Parkinson s disease to evaluate safety and tolerability in this patient population, as well as motor and non-motor exploratory endpoints. In this study, lenrispodun was generally well-tolerated with a favorable safety profile and clinical signs consistent with improvements in motor symptoms and dyskinesias. Our Phase 2 clinical trial of lenrispodun evaluating improvements in motor symptoms, changes in cognition, and inflammatory biomarkers in patients with Parkinson s disease is ongoing. We expect to complete this study by the end of 2025. We also have an active Investigational New Drug application, or IND, to evaluate our newest candidate within the PDE1 inhibitor program, ITI-1020, as a novel cancer immunotherapy. Our Phase 1 program with ITI-1020 in healthy volunteers is ongoing. 
 ITI-333 Program 
 We also have a development program with our ITI-333 compound as a potential treatment for substance use disorders, pain and psychiatric comorbidities including depression and anxiety. There is a pressing need to develop new drugs to treat opioid addiction and safe, effective, non-addictive treatments to manage pain. ITI-333 is a novel compound that uniquely combines activity as an antagonist at serotonin 5-HT2A receptors and a partial agonist at -opioid receptors. These combined actions support the potential utility of ITI-333 in the treatment of opioid use disorder and associated comorbidities (e.g., depression, anxiety, sleep disorders) without opioid-like safety and tolerability concerns. We have conducted a Phase 1 single ascending dose study evaluating the safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics of ITI-333 in healthy volunteers. In this study, ITI-333 achieved plasma exposures at or above those required for efficacy and was generally safe and well-tolerated. We have an ongoing neuroimaging study to investigate brain occupancy for receptors that play a role in substance use disorder and also have applicability for pain. The results of this study will support the dose selection for future studies. In addition, we completed a multiple ascending dose study with ITI-333 in healthy volunteers. In this study, ITI-333 was generally safe and well-tolerated.

 ITI-1500 Program 
 We also have the ITI-1500 program focused on the development of novel non-hallucinogenic psychedelics, which we refer to as neuroplastogens. Compounds in this series interact with serotonergic (5-HT2a) receptors in a unique way, potentially allowing the development of this new drug class in mood, anxiety and other neuropsychiatric disorders without the liabilities of known psychedelics including the hallucinogenic potential and risk for cardiac valvular pathologies. Our lead compound in this program, ITI-1549, is currently being evaluated in IND enabling studies and is expected to enter human testing in 2025. 
 
 Results of Operations 
 The following discussion summarizes the key factors our management believes are necessary for an understanding of our financial statements. 
 Revenues 
 Revenues are comprised primarily of net product sales of our commercial product, CAPLYTA, in the United States. Our net product sales of CAPLYTA represent sales primarily to wholesalers and specialty distributors and reflect certain adjustments deducted from gross product sales to arrive at product sales, net. 
 Expenses 
 Our operating expenses are comprised of (i) costs of product sales; (ii) selling expenses; (iii) general and administrative expenses; and (iv) research and development expenses. 
 Costs of product sales are comprised of: 
 royalty payments on product sales; 
 direct costs of formulating, manufacturing and packaging drug product; and 
 overhead costs consisting of labor, share-based compensation, shipping, external inventory manufacturing and other miscellaneous operating costs. 
 Selling expenses are incurred in three major categories: 
 salaries, share-based compensation, incentives and related benefit costs of a dedicated sales force and commercial organization; 
 marketing and promotion expenses; and 
 sales operation costs. 
 General and administrative expenses are incurred in three major categories: 
 salaries, share-based compensation and related benefit costs; 
 patent, legal and professional costs; and 
 office, facilities and infrastructure overhead. 
 Research and development costs are comprised of: 
 fees paid to external parties that provide us with contract services, such as pre-clinical testing, manufacturing and related testing, clinical trial activities and license milestone payments; and 
 internal recurring costs, such as costs relating to labor and fringe benefits, share-based compensation, materials, supplies, facilities and maintenance.

 The process of researching, developing and commercializing drugs for human use is lengthy, unpredictable and subject to many risks. The costs associated with the commercialization of CAPLYTA and development of our product candidates are substantial, and we have not yet generated sufficient revenue to offset our operating costs. Costs for the clinical development of lumateperone-related projects, including for the treatment of MDD, consume and, together with our required post-marketing studies and other anticipated clinical development programs, will continue to consume a large portion of our current, as well as projected, resources. We intend to pursue other disease indications that lumateperone may address, but there are significant costs associated with pursuing FDA approval for those indications, which would include the cost of additional clinical trials. 
 A portion of product sold through September 30, 2024 consisted of active pharmaceutical ingredient (API) and drug product that was previously charged to research and development expenses prior to FDA approval of CAPLYTA. Because the Company s policy does not allow for the capitalization of the cost of drug product that was incurred prior to FDA approval, the cost of drug product sold is lower than it would have been and has a positive impact on our cost of product sales for the three and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. We expect to continue to have this favorable impact on cost of product sales and related product gross margins until the cost of our sales of CAPLYTA include drug product that is manufactured entirely after the FDA approval. We expect that this will be the case for the remainder of the year and, as a result, our cost of product sales is less than we anticipate it will be in future periods. In addition, as our net product sales increase and we exceed certain sales thresholds, the applicable royalty rate for payments we make under our License Agreement with Bristol Myers Squibb (BMS) increases, which results in an increase to cost of product sales. 
 We expect that our selling, general and administrative costs will increase from prior periods primarily due to costs associated with our recently completed and future sales force expansions, promotional activities to support the commercial sales of CAPLYTA, as well as costs associated with expanding our infrastructure and anticipated increases in professional fees. During the third quarter of 2024, we expanded our sales force by approximately 150 representatives who will focus on commercial sales of CAPLYTA to primary care physicians. We also expect to further expand our sales force in 2025. We also expect that research and development expenses will increase moderately as we are expanding our clinical trial programs and pre-clinical development activities. We granted significant share-based awards in 2024 and 2023. We expect to continue to grant share-based awards in the future. We expect that our growing employee base will increase our share-based compensation expense in future periods. In addition, inflation has and may continue to affect us by increasing clinical trial, selling, labor and other operational costs. 
 The following table sets forth our revenues, operating expenses, interest income, income tax expense and net loss for the three and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 (in thousands):

 Comparison of Three and Nine-Month Periods Ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023 
 Product Sales, Net 
 Net product sales for the periods presented are comprised of sales of CAPLYTA for the treatment of schizophrenia and bipolar depression. Net product sales were 175.2 million and 481.3 million for the three and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024 compared to 125.8 million and 330.7 million for the three and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2023, which represents increases of 39 and 46 , respectively. These increases are primarily due to continued growth in sales volume of CAPLYTA for the treatment of schizophrenia and for the treatment of bipolar depression, driven primarily by prescription growth. 
 Cost of Product Sales 
 Cost of product sales was 15.3 million and 36.6 million for the three and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024, compared to 9.1 million and 23.0 million for the three and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2023, which represents increases of 68 and 59 , respectively. Cost of product sales consisted primarily of product royalty fees, direct costs and overhead, all of which increased as a result of the increased sales volume. 
 Selling, General and Administrative Expenses 
 Selling, general and administrative expenses for the three-month period ended September 30, 2024 were 132.1 million as compared to 105.2 million in the three-month period ended September 30, 2023, which represents an increase of 26 . 
 Selling costs were 98.7 million for the three-month period ended September 30, 2024 as compared to selling costs of 80.9 million in the same period in 2023, which represents an increase of 22 . This increase is primarily due to increases of salaries, benefits, and share-based compensation of 11.0 million mainly driven by the primary care sales force expansion that occurred this quarter, professional fees and other costs of 3.4 million and marketing and advertising costs of 3.4 million. Compensation and related benefit costs for our commercial functions for the three-month periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 constituted 35 and 35 , respectively, of our selling costs. 
 General and administrative expenses were 33.4 million for the three-month period ended September 30, 2024 as compared to 24.3 million in the same period in 2023, which represents an increase of 37 . This increase is due to increases in IT related services of 3.8 million, salaries of 3.0 million and professional fees and other costs of 2.3 million. Compensation and related benefit costs for our general and administrative functions for the three-month periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 constituted 24 and 18 , respectively, of our general and administrative costs. 
 Selling, general and administrative expenses for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024 were 366.8 million as compared to 305.1 million in the nine-month period ended September 30, 2023, which represents an increase of 20 . 
 Selling costs were 279.3 million for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024 as compared to selling costs of 233.5 million in the same period in 2023, which represents an increase of 20 . This increase is primarily due to increases of salaries, benefits and share-based compensation of 23.3 million mainly driven by the primary care sales force expansion that occurred this quarter, marketing and advertising costs of 11.2 million, commercialization costs of 9.2 million and professional fees and other costs of 2.1 million. Compensation and related benefit costs for our commercial functions for the nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 constituted 33 and 35 , respectively, of our selling costs. 
 General and administrative expenses were 87.5 million for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024 as compared to 71.6 million in the same period in 2023, which represents an increase of 22 . This increase is due to increases in IT related services of 9.0 million, salaries of 4.7 million and professional fees and other costs of 2.2 million. Compensation and related benefit costs for our general and administrative functions for the nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 constituted 24 and 22 , respectively, of our general and administrative costs.

 Research and Development Expenses 
 The following tables set forth our research and development expenses for the three and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 (in thousands): 
 Three Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 2024 2023 External service costs 53,188 29,123 126,029 94,579 Internal and other costs 13,631 12,427 39,806 34,789 Total research and development expenses 66,819 41,550 165,835 129,368 
 Three Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 2024 2023 Lumateperone costs 40,605 23,149 100,328 78,510 Non-lumateperone costs 16,383 9,614 37,859 27,670 Overhead and other costs 9,831 8,787 27,648 23,188 Total research and development expenses 66,819 41,550 165,835 129,368 
 Research and development expenses were 66.8 million for the three-month period ended September 30, 2024 as compared to 41.6 million in the same period in 2023, which represents an increase of 61 . This increase is due primarily to increases of 17.4 million for lumateperone costs, 6.8 million for non-lumateperone costs and 1.0 million for overhead and other costs. External service costs increased by 24.0 million for the period due to the increased number of clinical trials for lumateperone and non-lumateperone projects. Internal and other costs increased by 1.2 million for the period due primarily to labor related costs and share-based compensation. 
 Research and development expenses were 165.8 million for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024 as compared to 129.4 million in the same period in 2023, which represents an increase of 28 . This increase is due primarily to increases of 21.8 million for lumateperone costs, 10.2 million for non-lumateperone costs and 4.4 million for overhead and other costs. External service costs increased by 31.4 million for the period due to the increased number of clinical trials for lumateperone and non-lumateperone projects. Internal and other costs increased by 5.0 million for the period due primarily to labor related costs and share-based compensation. 
 
 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 
 Sources of Liquidity 
 To date, we have funded our operations through proceeds from public and private offerings of our common stock and other securities, as well as collections from net product revenue related to the sales of CAPLYTA. As of September 30, 2024, our cash and cash equivalents, investment securities, and restricted cash totaled approximately 1.0 billion, which we believe, along with cash generated from ongoing operations, will enable us to fund our operating expenses and capital expenditure requirements for at least the foreseeable future from the filing date of this report. During that time, we expect to have increased net product revenue as well as increases in our operating expenses. 
 We balance the level of cash, cash equivalents and investments on hand with our projected needs. We then assess the availability of funding on favorable terms with minimal risk. Subject to market conditions, interest rates, results of our clinical trials, progress of our commercialization efforts and other factors, we may pursue opportunities to obtain additional financing in the future, which could include public or private sales of our equity securities, sales of debt securities, incurrence of debt from commercial lenders, strategic collaborations, and licensing a portion or all of our product candidates and technology. To the extent that we raise additional capital through the sale of equity or convertible debt securities, the ownership interest of our existing stockholders will be diluted, and the terms may include liquidation or other preferences that adversely affect the rights of our stockholders. Debt financing, if available, may involve agreements that include covenants limiting or restricting our ability to take specific actions, such as incurring debt, making capital expenditures or declaring dividends. If we raise additional funds through government or other third-party funding, marketing and distribution arrangements or other collaborations, strategic alliances or licensing arrangements with third parties, we may have to relinquish valuable rights to our technologies, future revenue streams, research programs or product candidates or to grant licenses on terms that may not be favorable to us.

Table of Contents 

 Our cash, cash equivalents, and investments are maintained in checking accounts, money market accounts, money market funds, U.S. government agency securities, certificates of deposit, commercial paper, corporate notes and corporate bonds at major financial institutions. Our aim is to minimize the potential effects of concentration and degrees of risk. Although we maintain cash balances and investments with financial institutions in excess of insured limits, we do not anticipate any losses with respect to such balances because these financial institutions are highly-rated institutions and custodians of our investments. 
 
 Cash Flows 
 
 The following table summarizes our cash flows for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 (in thousands): 
 
 Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 Change Net cash used in operating activities (60,099) (122,138) 62,039 Net cash (used in) provided by investing activities (185,258) 58,119 (243,377) Net cash provided by financing activities 561,902 14,806 547,096 Net increase (decrease) in cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash 316,545 (49,213) 365,758 
 Net cash used in operating activities totaled 60.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 122.1 million of net cash used in operating activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. This decrease in cash used in operations primarily resulted from an increase in our net product sales. 
 Net cash used in investing activities totaled 185.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 58.1 million of cash provided by investing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in net cash used in investing activities was primarily due to an increase in purchases of investment securities. 
 Net cash provided by financing activities totaled 561.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 14.8 million of cash provided by financing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. This increase in net cash provided by financing activities was attributable primarily to the completion of an underwritten public offering of shares of our common stock in April 2024 resulting in net proceeds of approximately 543.1 million, after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and offering expenses. 
 
 Operational and Capital Funding Requirements 
 Our cash requirements in the short and long term consist of operational, manufacturing, and capital expenditures, a portion of which contain contractual or other obligations. Our material long-term contractual commitments are comprised of licensing and royalty commitments with BMS, operating leases for our office and laboratory spaces, and purchase obligations supporting our commercial and R D operations. Refer to our discussion of Liquidity and Capital Resources in Part II, Item 7 Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, and Note 7, Right of Use Assets and Lease Liabilities, and Note 8, Commitments and Contingencies, in the Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements in Part I, Item 1, Financial Statements, of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the discussion of our contractual commitments. 
 
 Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 
 Our critical accounting policies are those policies which require the most significant judgments and estimates in the preparation of our condensed consolidated financial statements. We evaluate our estimates, judgments, and assumptions on an ongoing basis. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. A summary of our critical accounting policies is presented in Part II, Item 7, of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. There have been no material changes to our critical accounting policies during the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024.

Table of Contents 

 The discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, or GAAP. The preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts of assets and liabilities as of the date of the balance sheet and reported amounts of revenues and expenses for the periods presented. Judgments must also be made about the disclosure of contingent liabilities. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. These estimates and assumptions form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from those estimates and under different assumptions or conditions. 
 
 Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements 
 In November 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-07, Segment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures , requiring public entities to disclose information about their reportable segments significant expenses and other segment items on an interim and annual basis. Public entities with a single reportable segment are also required to apply the disclosure requirements. The standard is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2023, and for interim reporting periods beginning January 1, 2025, with early adoption permitted. We are currently evaluating the potential impact that this new standard will have on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.

 Item 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 
 Interest Rate Sensitivity. As of September 30, 2024, we had cash, cash equivalents, investment securities and restricted cash of approximately 1.0 billion, consisting of cash deposited in highly rated financial institutions in the United States and in short-term U.S. Treasury bonds, money market funds, as well as high-grade corporate bonds and commercial paper. The primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve our capital for the purpose of funding operations and we do not enter into investments for trading or speculative purposes. We believe that we do not have material exposure to high-risk investments such as mortgage-backed securities, auction rate securities or other special investment vehicles within our money-market fund investments. We believe that we do not have any material exposure to changes in fair value as a result of changes in interest rates as we intend and have the ability to hold our investments to maturity. During the third quarter of 2024, there was an unrealized gain due to a decline in interest rates that resulted in a net unrealized gain position of 1.6 million as of September 30, 2024. 
 Inflation Risk . Inflation generally affects us by increasing our cost of labor, clinical trial costs, and other outsourced activities. To date, inflation has not had a material impact on our business. Should global inflation increase in the future, we expect increases in clinical trial, selling, labor, and other operating costs. If our costs were to become subject to significant inflationary pressures, we may not be able to fully offset such higher costs through price increases of our product. Our inability or failure to do so could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
 24 

Table of Contents 

 Capital Market Risk. Although we receive product revenues from commercial sales of CAPLYTA, we may in the future raise funds through other sources. One possible source of funding is through further securities offerings. Our ability to raise funds in this manner depends upon capital market forces affecting our stock price among other things. 
 Foreign Currency Risk. Due to our operations outside of the United States, we are exposed to market risk related to changes in foreign currency exchange rates. Historically, our foreign currency exposure has been limited so we have not hedged for this exposure. Changes in the relative values of currencies occur regularly and, in some instances, could materially adversely affect our business, our results of operations or our cash flows. For the nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, changes in foreign currency exchange rates did not have a material impact on our historical financial position, our business, our financial condition, our results of operations or our cash flows. 
 
 Item 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 
 (a) Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures . Our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, after evaluating the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the Exchange Act) as of the end of the period covered by this Form 10-Q, have concluded that, based on such evaluation, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective at a reasonable assurance level to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms, and is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 
 (b) Changes in Internal Controls . There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting identified in connection with the evaluation of such internal control that occurred during the three-month period ended September 30, 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

 PART II: OTHER INFORMATION 
 
 Item 1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS 
 As previously disclosed, in February 2024, we received notices from Alkem Laboratories Ltd., Aurobindo Pharma USA, Inc. and Aurobindo Pharma Ltd., Dr. Reddy s Laboratories Inc. (on behalf of Dr. Reddy s Laboratories Ltd.), MSN Laboratories Private Ltd., Sandoz Inc., Hetero USA, Inc. (the U.S. Regulatory Agent for Hetero Labs Limited Unit - V, a division of Hetero Labs Limited) and Zydus Pharmaceuticals (USA), Inc., which we refer to as ANDA Filers, that each company had filed an abbreviated new drug application, or ANDA, with the FDA seeking approval of generic version of CAPLYTA. The ANDAs each contained Paragraph IV Patent Certifications alleging that certain of our patents covering CAPLYTA are invalid and/or will not be infringed by each ANDA Filer s manufacture, use or sale of the medicine for which the ANDA was submitted. 
 Under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, as amended by the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984, or the FDCA, we had 45 days from receipt of the notice letters to commence patent infringement lawsuits against these generic drug manufacturers in a federal district court to trigger a stay precluding the FDA s approval of any ANDA from being effective any earlier than 7.5 years from the date of approval of the CAPLYTA new drug application or entry of judgment holding the patents invalid, unenforceable, or not infringed, whichever occurs first. After conducting the necessary due diligence, and within the 45 day period required under the FDCA, we filed lawsuits on March 27, 2024 and March 28, 2024 in the U.S. District Court for the District of New Jersey against each of the seven generic drug manufacturers who notified us of their ANDA filings. Our lawsuits seek a declaratory judgment that our patents have been infringed by the respective ANDA Filer, an order that any FDA approval of the ANDA Filer's product be not earlier than the date of the expiration of our applicable patents, injunctions against the commercialization of the ANDA Filer's product prior to such expiration date, and an award for attorneys' fees, costs and expenses. In the ANDA Filers respective answers to our complaints filed in May, June and July 2024, five of the ANDA Filers asserted counterclaims against us seeking a declaratory judgment of noninfringement and invalidity of our patents. 
 On July 16, 2024, the U.S. District Court for the District of New Jersey issued an order consolidating the cases described above for all pretrial purposes. A scheduling conference for the consolidated cases was held on July 29, 2024 and on August 8, 2024, the U.S. District Court for the District of New Jersey issued a scheduling order that set the date for the bench trial to begin on October 27, 2026. 
 In July and August 2024, we received an additional notice from each of (i) Dr. Reddy s Laboratories Inc. and Dr. Reddy s Laboratories Ltd., and (ii) Alkem Laboratories Ltd., respectively, each of which is an ANDA Filer, that such ANDA Filer had filed an additional Paragraph IV Patent Certification alleging that an additional patent covering CAPLYTA is invalid and/or will not be infringed by such ANDA Filer s manufacture, use or sale of the medicine for which the ANDA was submitted. On August 29, 2024, we filed additional lawsuits in the U.S. District Court for the District of New Jersey against each of the seven ANDA Filers with respect to two additional patents covering CAPLYTA (including the patent referenced in the July and August ANDA Filer notices) seeking a declaratory judgment that our patents have been infringed by the respective ANDA Filer, an order that any FDA approval of the ANDA Filer s product be not earlier than the date of expiration of our applicable patents, injunctions against the commercialization of the ANDA Filer s product prior to such expiration date, and an award for attorneys fees, costs and expenses. In the ANDA Filers respective answers to these complaints filed up to the date of this report, two of the ANDA Filers asserted counterclaims against us seeking a declaratory judgment of noninfringement and invalidity of our patents. On October 15, 2024, the U.S. District Court for the District of New Jersey issued an order consolidating these additional cases with the consolidated case described above for all pretrial purposes. 
 While we intend to vigorously defend and enforce our intellectual property rights protecting CAPLYTA, we can offer no assurance as to when the lawsuits will be decided, whether the lawsuits will be successful, or that a generic equivalent of CAPLYTA will not be approved and enter the market before the expiration of our patents.

Exhibit 10.7 
 
 INTRA-CELLULAR THERAPIES, INC. 
 
 AMENDED AND RESTATED EMPLOYEE PROPRIETARY INFORMATION, INVENTIONS, AND NON-COMPETITION AGREEMENT 
 
 In consideration of my employment or continued employment by INTRA-CELLULAR THERAPIES, INC. (the Company ), and the compensation now and hereafter paid to me, I hereby agree as follows 
 
 1. NONDISCLOSURE. 
 
 1.1 Recognition of Company s Rights Nondisclosure. At all times during my employment and thereafter, I will hold in strictest confidence and will not disclose, use, lecture upon or publish any of the Company s Proprietary Information (defined below), except as such disclosure, use or publication may be required in connection with my work for the Company, or unless an officer of the Company expressly authorizes such in writing. I will obtain Company s written approval before publishing or submitting for publication any material (written, verbal, or otherwise) that relates to my work at Company and or incorporates any Proprietary Information. I hereby assign to the Company any rights I may have or acquire in such Proprietary Information and recognize that all Proprietary Information shall be the sole property of the Company and its assigns. I have been informed and acknowledge that the unauthorized taking of the Company s trade secrets may subject me to civil and or criminal penalties. 
 
 1.2 Proprietary Information. The term Proprietary Information shall mean any and all confidential and or proprietary knowledge, data or information of the Company. By way of illustration but not limitation, Proprietary Information includes (a) tangible and intangible information relating to antibodies and other biological materials, cell lines, samples of assay components, media and or cell lines and procedures and formulations for producing any such assay components, media and or cell lines, formulations, products, processes, know-how, designs, formulas, methods, developmental or experimental work, clinical data, improvements, discoveries, plans for research, new products Inventions (b) marketing and selling, business plans, budgets and unpublished financial statements, licenses, prices and costs, suppliers and customers and (c) information regarding the skills and compensation of other employees of the Company. Notwithstanding the foregoing, it is understood that, at all such times, I am free to use information which is generally known in the trade or industry, which is not gained as result of a breach of this Agreement, and my own, skill, knowledge, know-how and experience to whatever extent and in whichever way I wish. 

1.3 Third Party Information. I understand, in addition, that the Company has received and in the future will receive from third parties confidential or proprietary information Third Party Information subject to a duty on the Company s part to maintain the confidentiality of such information and to use it only for certain limited purposes. During the term of my employment and thereafter, I will hold Third Party Information in the strictest confidence and will not disclose to anyone (other than Company personnel who need to know such information in connection with their work for the Company) or use, except in connection with my work for the Company, Third Party Information unless expressly authorized by an officer of the Company in writing. 
 1.4 No Improper Use of Information of Prior Employers and Others. During my employment by the Company I will not improperly use or disclose any confidential information or trade secrets, if any, of any former employer or any other person to whom I have an obligation of confidentiality, and I will not bring onto the premises of the Company any unpublished documents or any property belonging to any former employer or any other person to whom I have an obligation of confidentiality unless consented to in writing by that former employer or person. I will use in the performance of my duties only information which is generally known and used by persons with training and experience comparable to my own, which is common knowledge in the industry or otherwise legally in the public domain, or which is otherwise provided or developed by the Company. 
 
 2. ASSIGNMENT OF INVENTIONS. 
 
 2.1 Proprietary Rights. The term Proprietary Rights shall mean all trade secret, patent, copyright, mask work and other intellectual property rights or moral rights throughout the world. Moral rights refers to any rights to claim authorship of an Invention or to object to or prevent the modification of any Invention, or to withdraw from circulation or control the publication or distribution of any Invention, and any similar right, existing under judicial or statutory law of any country in the world, or under any treaty, regardless of whether or not such right is denominated or generally referred to as a moral right. 
 
 2.2 Prior Inventions. Inventions, if any, patented or unpatented, which I made prior to the commencement of my employment with the Company are excluded from the scope of this Agreement. To preclude any possible uncertainty, I have set forth on Exhibit A (Previous Inventions) attached hereto a complete list of all Inventions that I have, alone or jointly with others, conceived, developed or reduced to practice or caused to be conceived, developed or reduced to practice prior to the commencement of my employment with the Company, that I consider to be my property or the property of third parties and that I wish to have excluded from the scope of this Agreement (collectively referred to as Prior Inventions ). If disclosure of any such Prior Invention would cause me to violate any prior confidentiality agreement, I understand that I am not to list such Prior Inventions in Exhibit A but am only to disclose a cursory name for each such invention, a listing of the party(ies) to whom it belongs and the fact that full disclosure as to such inventions has not been made for that reason. A space is provided on Exhibit A for such purpose. If no such disclosure is attached, I represent that there are no Prior Inventions. If, in the course of my employment with the Company, I incorporate a Prior Invention into a Company product, process or machine, the Company is hereby granted and shall have a nonexclusive, royalty-free, irrevocable, perpetual, worldwide license (with rights to sublicense through multiple tiers of sublicensees) to make, have made, modify, use and sell such Prior Invention. 
 2 

Notwithstanding the foregoing, I agree that I will not incorporate, or permit to be incorporated, Prior Inventions in any Company Inventions without the Company s prior written consent. 
 
 2.3 Assignment of Inventions. Subject to Sections 2.4, and 2.6, I hereby assign and agree to assign in the future (when any such Inventions or Proprietary Rights are first reduced to practice or first fixed in a tangible medium, as applicable) to the Company all my right, title and interest in and to any and all Inventions (and all Proprietary Rights with respect thereto) whether or not patentable or registrable under copyright or similar statutes, made or conceived or reduced to practice or learned by me, either alone or jointly with others, during the period of my employment with the Company. Inventions assigned to the Company, or to a third party as directed by the Company pursuant to this Section 2, are hereinafter referred to as Company Inventions . 
 
 2.4 Unassigned Inventions. I recognize that this Agreement will not be deemed to require assignment of any Invention that was developed entirely on my own time without using the Company s equipment, supplies, facilities, or trade secrets and neither related to the Company s actual or anticipated business, research or development, nor resulted from work performed by me for the Company. 
 
 2.5 Obligation to Keep Company Informed. During the period of my employment and for six (6) months after termination of my employment with the Company, I will promptly disclose to the Company fully and in writing all Inventions authored, conceived or reduced to practice by me, either alone or jointly with others. In addition, I will promptly disclose to the Company all patent applications filed by me or on my behalf within a year after termination of employment. The Company will keep in confidence and will not use for any purpose or disclose to third parties without my consent any confidential information disclosed in writing to the Company pursuant to this Agreement. 
 
 2.6 Government or Third Party. I also agree to assign all my right, title and interest in and to any particular Company Invention to a third party, including without limitation the United States, as directed by the Company. 
 
 2.7 Works for Hire. I acknowledge that all original works of authorship which are made by me (solely or jointly with others) within the scope of my employment and which are protectable by copyright are works made for hire, pursuant to United States Copyright Act (17 U.S.C., Section 101). 
 
 3 

2.8 Enforcement of Proprietary Rights. I will assist the Company in every proper way to obtain, and from time to time enforce, United States and foreign Proprietary Rights relating to Company Inventions in any and all countries. To that end I will execute, verify and deliver such documents and perform such other acts (including appearances as a witness) as the Company may reasonably request for use in applying for, obtaining, perfecting, evidencing, sustaining and enforcing such Proprietary Rights and the assignment thereof. In addition, I will execute, verify and deliver assignments of such Proprietary Rights to the Company or its designee. My obligation to assist the Company with respect to Proprietary Rights relating to such Company Inventions in any and all countries shall continue beyond the termination of my employment, but the Company shall compensate me at a reasonable rate after my termination for the time actually spent by me at the Company s request on such assistance. 
 
 In the event the Company is unable for any reason, after reasonable effort, to secure my signature on any document needed in connection with the actions specified in the preceding paragraph, I hereby irrevocably designate and appoint the Company and its duly authorized officers and agents as my agent and attorney in fact, which appointment is coupled with an interest, to act for and in my behalf to execute, verify and file any such documents and to do all other lawfully permitted acts to further the purposes of the preceding paragraph with the same legal force and effect as if executed by me. I hereby waive and quitclaim to the Company any and all claims, of any nature whatsoever, which I now or may hereafter have for infringement of any Proprietary Rights assigned hereunder to the Company. 
 
 2.9 Defend Trade Secrets Act. I hereby acknowledge notice under 18 U.S.C 1833(b)(1), which states, in pertinent part An individual shall not be held criminally or civilly liable under any Federal or State trade secret law for the disclosure of a trade secret that (A) is made (i) in confidence to a Federal, State, or local government official, either directly or indirectly, or to an attorney and (ii) solely for the purpose of reporting or investigating a suspected violation of law or (B) is made in a complaint or other document filed in a lawsuit or other proceeding, if such filing is made under seal. 
 
 4 

2.10 Preserved Rights. No provision of this Agreement shall prevent or restrict me from disclosing information about unlawful workplace acts, including but not limited to factual information relating to any claims of harassment, discrimination, or retaliation under Title VII the New York State Human Rights Law or any other similar federal, state, or local law, including claims based on race, sexual orientation, religion, color, national origin, ancestry, disability, medical condition, and age. No provision of this Agreement is intended to limit, or shall be interpreted as limiting, my right to file administrative charges with any Governmental Entity (as defined below) charged with enforcement of any law, including but not limited to the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, New York State Division of Human Rights and the New York City Commission on Human Rights, the Securities and Exchange Commission, and National Labor Relations Board, and to participate in agency investigations. Additionally, nothing herein is intended to restrict, or shall be interpreted as restricting, my right to engage in concerted activity protected by Section 7 of the National Labor Relations Act or my right to file for or collect unemployment benefits and or to seek and receive remedies for workplace injuries under the provisions of any applicable workers compensation act. Nothing in this Agreement shall prohibit or impede me from communicating, cooperating or filing a complaint with any U.S. or foreign federal, state or local governmental or law enforcement branch, federal or state attorney general, agency, entity, commission or other governmental authority or instrumentality of competent jurisdiction (collectively, a Governmental Entity or any attorney retained by me, with respect to possible violations of any U.S. or foreign federal, state or local law or regulation, or otherwise making disclosures to any Governmental Entity, in each case, that are protected under the whistleblower provisions of any such law or regulation (including, but not limited, under the federal securities laws, including the Dodd-Frank Act) provided, that in each case such communications and disclosures are consistent with applicable law.
