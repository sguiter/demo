Item
2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 

OVERVIEW 

Global
AI was organized as Mycatalogsonline.com, Inc. in the state of Nevada on January 6, 2009. In April 2009, the Company changed its name
to My Catalogs Online, Inc. In November 2012, the Company changed its name to Bright Mountain Holdings, Inc. In August 2013, the Company
changed its name to Wall Street Media Co, Inc. and in October 2023 the Company changed its name to Global AI, Inc. 

The Company has been involved
in developing and searching for artificial intelligence AI )-based products, solutions and services for customers. As part
of such efforts, the Company has retained seasoned technology executives and other full and part-time subcontractors to build product
and services, review technologies, structure research and development programs, work on GTM approach and increase engagement with
relevant industry players. 

The
Company acquires, integrates and develops AI-based technology companies and assets (the
 Acquisitions ). The Company focuses its Acquisitions on machine and deep learning, generative AI, computer vision,
natural language processing, and other AI technologies. The Company focuses on Acquisitions that are scalable and have revenue models
that provide for tangible growth. Once acquired, the Company integrates and further develops the companies and assets acquired
in the Acquisitions to increase their existing customer base and further develop their existing products and services. The Company also
engages in efforts to cross-pollinate knowledge and strategies derived from each of its Acquisitions with other Acquisitions for the
benefit of the Company s network as a whole. In addition, the Company centralizes back office administrative functions
and takes advantage of cost and revenue synergies across the Acquisitions platforms. 

On
September 12, 2023, Ingenious Investment AG purchased, from their own funds, from existing shareholders of the Company, in a series of
private transactions, a total of 24,944,466 shares of common stock, 0.001 per share of Global AI, Inc., representing 92.7 of the outstanding
shares of the Company s common stock at such time. 

Our
Business 

We
are a big data company using advanced statistical AI, machine learning and natural language processing techniques to deliver solutions
for institutional investors, financial and non-financial companies, governments and multilateral international organizations. Using big
data and AI, we are able to perform natural language processing over corpuses drawn from hundreds of thousands of sources and dozens
of natural languages. We offer bespoke projects and a text analysis platform to our clients. 

In
addition, we use big data and AI to develop alternative data signals for equity analysts and macro analysts. We produce big data and
AI-drive alternative data to measure Environmental, Social and Governance ESG risks and deliver on the sustainable development
goals SDGs ). 

We
believe that the biggest challenge with delivering on the SDGs is not a lack of capital, but rather a lack of data. Clear, accurate data
is necessary to benchmark progress on the SDGs and inform policymaking, corporate strategy and investing. The lack of data creates enormous
obstacles to align policymaking with sustainable economic development and mobilize institutional capital to where investments are most
needed to progress on the SDGs. 

While
we may lack official reporting mechanisms, our world today has a deluge of data. With all of the data available from corporations, nongovernmental
organizations NGOs ), and other open data sources, we believe that it is time to create processes for certifying unofficial
data as official data. Further, we believe that corporate partnerships are particularly crucial in achieving this goal. Private sector
collaboration can close gaps in official data, offset the critical funding gaps for tracking SDG metrics, and support the public good
by enabling a society to benchmark the SDGs by making use of all available data of quality. 

Our NGO, the Global Algorithmic Institute GAI ), is
using our big data and AI intellectual property and technology to provide the United Nations and its member countries with data in order
to know how well companies, countries and regions are performing on delivering the SDGs and where capital needs to be mobilized. More
specifically, our data helps countries know where and how they need to reallocate capital to where it is needed most to achieve the SDGs. Further,
GAI s work provides a basis for the United Nation s annual SDG Report and the Secretary General s Report on the private
sector s progress on sustainability, including economic, environmental, social as well institutional and governance, dimensions,
and its contributions to the SDGs. 

In
using the most advanced AI technologies, machine learning and natural language processing NLP ), our innovative technology
enables us to uncover hidden sustainability and non-financial risks. Our short-term and long-term ESG/SDG indicators provide important
insights for institutional investors. In addition, we offer Sentiment, Stress/Risk indicators, leading volatility signals, Equity Factors,
and custom Big Data and AI solutions for institutional investors, including: 

ESG
 SDG Scores, Benchmarks, Indices, Signals and Ratings, including short-term, long-term,
 volume, dispersion and momentum signals; 
 
 SDG
 Scores for each of the 17 SDGs as well as a company total SDG score; 
 
 Enable
 ESG/SDG-tilted strategies and thematic investments; 
 
 Optimize
 risk-return-impact decisions across equity and bonds; 
 
 Equity
 and Bond ESG/SDG screening attribution; 
 
 Compare
 your ESG/SDG exposure and risks across portfolios and benchmark against ESG/SDG Indices;
 and 
 
 Advanced
 text analytics insights, including word clouds.

Sustainable
Development 

The Company focuses on the role
of the private sector in achieving the sustainable development goals of ending poverty, protecting the planet and ensuring that all people
enjoy peace and prosperity by 2030. GAI aggregates firm-level, private sector data, and identify where the private sector should mobilize
its resources, know-how and capital to achieve the SDGs. 

Our work advances the reporting
requirements of SDG target 12.6, which requires United Nations Member States to encourage companies, especially large and transnational
companies, to adopt sustainable practices and to integrate sustainability information into their reporting cycle. Our dataset is the only
proxy available for governments to produce the data called for under SDG target 12.6 to measure the private sector s alignment with
the SDGs at the country, regional and global level for policy purposes. Ours are the first AI-driven data to inform policy, strategy,
and investment decision-making at the national level. Benchmarking progress on the SDGs requires harmonizing corporate reporting on sustainability
targets across industries and countries. This is why GAI is proud to focus on SDG indicator 12.6.1, which is the only SDG indicator uniquely
focused on the private sector s alignment with the SDGs at the country, regional and global level for policy purposes. 

The
current lack of SDG data for policy-making, corporate strategy, and investing severely constrains the ability of public and private stakeholders
to make SDG-driven decisions. This creates enormous obstacles to align policy-making with sustainable economic development and mobilize
the institutional capital to where those investments are most needed at the scale required to close the annual 2.5 trillion SDGs financing
gap. We believe that only with high-quality data can companies better align themselves with the SDGs, and motivate investors to mobilize
capital from billions to trillions to deliver on the SDGs. 

GAI has implemented an SDG Infrastructure
Projects-Investors Matchmaking Platform designed to systematically match infrastructure projects with institutional investors. The system
uses machine learning with a data-driven approach to promote the mobilization of private investment for the SDGs. It is designed to help
close the multi-trillion dollar financing gap required to reach the SDGs. 

Macroeconomic
Trends 

As
a corporation with a global presence, we are subject to risks and uncertainties caused by significant events with macroeconomic impacts,
including, but not limited to, geopolitical tensions, heightened interest rates, monetary policy changes, and foreign currency fluctuations.
Additionally, these macroeconomic impacts have disrupted, and may continue to disrupt, the operations of our customers and prospective
customers. We continuously monitor the direct and indirect impacts of these circumstances on our business and financial results, as well
as the overall global economy and geopolitical landscape. 

Geopolitical
Tensions 

Our
business operations are subject to interruption by events that are beyond our control, including geopolitical tensions. We continue to
closely monitor the impact of various geopolitical tensions and their global impacts on our business. While the ongoing Russia-Ukraine
and Israel conflicts are still evolving and the outcomes remain highly uncertain, we do not expect that the resulting challenging macroeconomic
conditions will have a material impact on our business or results of operations. 

Foreign
Currency Exchange Rates 

Exchange
rates are subject to significant and rapid fluctuations due to a number of factors, including interest rate changes, monetary policy
changes, and political and economic uncertainty which may adversely affect our results of operations or financial position. 

Customer
Impacts 

Current
macroeconomic conditions have impacted, and may continue to adversely impact, our customers businesses, particularly our early-
and growth-stage customers. Relationships with early- or growth-stage customers carry inherent risks because, among other things, such
customers may be unable to generate sufficient revenues or profitability or to access any necessary financing or funding in a timely
manner or on favorable terms to them in the current macroeconomic environment, which has impacted, and may continue to impact, our expected
revenue and collections. As a result, current macroeconomic conditions have impacted, and may continue to impact, our ability to realize
the full value of our commercial contracts with such early- or growth-stage customers. 

Recent
Events 

On
May 7, 2024, Abhinav Somani resigned as President and Chief Executive Officer of the Company. Nevenka Cresnar Pergar, the Chairperson
of the board of directors of the Company (the Board is acting as President and Chief Executive Officer until a replacement
is found. 

On
May 7, 2024, Sebastian Holl notified the Board of his resignation as a member of the Board. Neither Mr Somani nor Mr. Holl s resignation
was the result of any dispute or disagreement with the Company or the Board on any matter relating to the operations, policies or practices
of the Company.

CRITICAL
ACCOUNTING POLICIES 

In
response to the Securities and Exchange Commission s (the SEC financial reporting release, FR-60, Cautionary Advice
Regarding Disclosure About Critical Accounting Policies, the Company has selected its more subjective accounting estimation processes
for purposes of explaining the methodology used in calculating the estimate, in addition to the inherent uncertainties pertaining to
the estimate and the possible effects on the Company s financial condition. These accounting estimates are discussed below. These
estimates involve certain assumptions that if incorrect could create a material adverse impact on the Company s results of operations
and financial condition 

Revenue
Recognition 

The
Company recognized revenue using the five-step revenue recognition model as prescribed by ASC 606, Revenue from Contracts with
Customers . The underlying principle of new standard is that a business or other organization will recognize revenue to depict
the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects what it expects to receive in exchange for the goods
or services. The Company adopted the standard using the modified retrospective method and the adoption did not have a material impact
on its financial statements. 

RESULTS
OF OPERATIONS 

FOR
THE THREE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2024 COMPARED TO THE THREE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2023 

Revenue:
 The Company s revenues decreased by approximately 100 to 0 during the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to
 2,500 for the three months ended September 30, 2023 due to a decrease in consulting services provided. 

Operating
Expenses: The Company s operating expenses increased by approximately 7 to 117,932 during the three months ended September
30, 2024 as compared to 110,160 for the three months ended September 30, 2023 primarily due to an increase in general and administrative
expenses. 

Loss
from operations : The Company s loss from operations increased approximately 9 to 117,932 during the three months ended September
30, 2024 from a loss from operations of 108,160 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The primary reason for this was due to
an increase in general and administrative expenses. 

FOR
THE NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2024 COMPARED TO THE NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2023 

Revenue:
 The Company had no revenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 34,000 for the nine months ended September 30,2023. 

Operating
Expenses: The Company s operating expenses increased by approximately 408 to 737,991 during the nine months ended September
30, 2024 as compared to 145,405 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 primarily due to an increase in professional fees expense. 

11 

Net
loss from operations : The Company s net loss from operations increased approximately 562 to 737,991 during the nine months
ended September 30, 2024 from a net loss from operations of 111,405 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The primary reason
for this was due to an increase in professional fees expense. 

LIQUIDITY
AND CAPITAL RESOURCES 

Net
cash used in operating activities was 883,630 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to 89,237 for the nine months
ended September 30, 2023. The increase was primarily due to the increases in professional fees expense. 

As
of September 30, 2024, the Company had 13,669 in cash. The Company has sustained losses from operations, and such losses are expected
to continue. The Company s auditors have included a Going Concern Qualification in their report for the year ended
December 31, 2023. In addition, the Company has a working capital deficit at September 30, 2024 of 76,786 with minimal revenues. The
foregoing raises substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. The Company is actively seeking
to combine or merge with another operating company. There can be no assurance that the level of funding needed will be acquired or that
the Company will generate sufficient revenues to sustain operations for the next twelve months. The unaudited condensed financial statements
do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty. 

OFF-BALANCE
SHEET ARRANGEMENTS 

We
do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial
condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources,
that is material to investors.

Evaluation
of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

We
carried out an evaluation required by Rule 13a-15(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act ),
under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and principal financial officer,
of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures, as such term is defined in Exchange Act Rule
13a 15(e). Disclosure controls and procedures are designed with the objective of ensuring that (i) information required to be disclosed
in an issuer s reports filed under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified
in the SEC rules and forms and (ii) information is accumulated and communicated to management, including our Chief Executive Officer
and principal financial officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures. 

The
evaluation of our disclosure controls and procedures included a review of our objectives and processes and effect on the information
generated for use in this report. This type of evaluation is done quarterly so that the conclusions concerning the effectiveness of these
controls can be reported in our periodic reports filed with the SEC. We intend to maintain these controls as processes that may be appropriately
modified as circumstances warrant. 

Based
on their evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and principal financial officer has concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures
are not effective in timely alerting our Chief Executive Officer and principal financial officer to material information which is required
to be included in our periodic reports filed with the SEC as of the end of the period covering this annual report on Form 10-K.
