CAUTIONARY
NOTE REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS 

Except
for historical information, this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A
of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the Securities Act and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934,
as amended (the Exchange Act ), which involve risks and uncertainties. These forward-looking statements can be identified
by the use of forward- looking terminology, including the terms believe, estimate, project, 
 aim, anticipate, expect, seek, predict, contemplate, 
 continue, possible, intend, may, plan, forecast, 
 future, might, will, could, would or should or, in each
case, their negative, or other variations or comparable terminology. These forward-looking statements include all matters that are not
historical facts. They appear in a number of places throughout this Annual Report on Form 10-K and include statements regarding our intentions,
beliefs or current expectations concerning, among other things, our results of operations, financial condition, liquidity, prospects,
growth strategies, the industry in which we operate and potential acquisitions. We derive many of our forward- looking statements from
our operating budgets and forecasts, which are based upon many detailed assumptions. While we believe that our assumptions are reasonable,
we caution that it is very difficult to predict the impact of known factors, and, of course, it is impossible for us to anticipate all
factors that could affect our actual results. All forward-looking statements are based upon information available to us on the date of
this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. 

By
their nature, forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties because they relate to events and depend on circumstances that
may or may not occur in the future. We caution you that forward- looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and that
our actual results of operations, financial condition and liquidity, and the stability of the industry in which we operate may differ
materially from those made in or suggested by the forward-looking statements contained in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. In addition,
even if our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity and the development of the industry in which we operate are consistent
with the forward-looking statements contained in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, those results or developments may not be indicative
of results or developments in subsequent periods. Important factors that could cause our results to vary from expectations include those
discussed in Risk Factors in our most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K, as the same may be updated from time to time. 

Estimates
and forward-looking statements speak only as of the date they were made, and, except to the extent required by law, we undertake no obligation
to update or to review any estimate and/or forward-looking statement because of new information, future events or other factors.

On
August 30, 2021, the Company closed its acquisition of Mosbest, LLC dba Stateside Stateside pursuant to its Membership
Interest Purchase Agreement with Moise Emquies to purchase of the issued and outstanding equity of Stateside. On the acquisition
date, Stateside became a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company. 

On
December 30, 2022, the Company closed its previously announced acquisition of Sunnyside, LLC dba Sundry Sundry pursuant

On
June 21, 2023, the Company and the former owners of H J executed a Settlement Agreement and Release (the Settlement Agreement whereby contemporaneously with the parties execution of the Settlement Agreement (i) the Company agreed to make an aggregate cash
payment of to D. Jones Tailored Collection, Ltd. D. Jones ), (ii) the Company issued shares of common

and for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and has incurred
negative cash flows from operations for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. The Company has historically lacked liquidity
to satisfy obligations as they come due and as of September 30, 2024, and the Company had a working capital deficit of . These
factors, among others, arise substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. The Company expects
to continue to generate operating losses for the foreseeable future. The accompanying consolidated financial statements do not include
any adjustments as a result of this uncertainty. 

The
Company s ability to continue as a going concern for the next 12 months from the date the financial statements were available to
be issued is dependent upon its ability to generate sufficient cash flows from operations to meet its obligations, which it has not been
able to accomplish to date, and/or to obtain additional capital financing. Through the date the financial statements were available to
be issued, the Company has been primarily financed through the issuance of capital stock and debt. In the event that the Company cannot
generate sufficient revenue to sustain its operations, the Company will need to reduce expenses or obtain financing through the sale
of debt and/or equity securities. The issuance of additional equity would result in dilution to existing shareholders. If the Company
is unable to obtain additional funds when they are needed or if such funds cannot be obtained on terms acceptable to the Company, the
Company would be unable to execute upon the business plan or pay costs and expenses as they are incurred, which would have a material,
adverse effect on the business, financial condition and results of operations. No assurance can be given that the Company will be successful
in these efforts.

split became effective as of August 22, 2023. Accordingly, all share and per share amounts for all periods presented in the accompanying
consolidated financial statements and notes thereto have been adjusted retroactively, where applicable, to reflect this reverse stock
split and adjustment of the preferred stock conversion ratios.

Our
Company 

Digital
Brands is a curated collection of lifestyle brands, including Bailey, DSTLD, Sundry and Avo, that offers a variety of apparel products
through direct-to- consumer and wholesale distribution. Our complementary brand portfolio provides us with the unique opportunity to
cross merchandise our brands. We aim for our customers to wear our brands head to toe and to capture what we call closet share 
by gaining insight into their preferences to create targeted and personalized content specific to their cohort. Operating our brands
under one portfolio provides us with the ability to better utilize our technological, human capital and operational capabilities across

to scale our brands and overall portfolio.

Our
portfolio consists of four significant brands that leverage our three channels: our websites, wholesale and our own stores. 

Bailey 44 combines beautiful, luxe fabrics and on-trend designs to create sophisticated ready-to-wear capsules for women on-the-go.
Designing for real life, this brand focuses on feeling and comfort rather than how it looks on a runway. Bailey 44 is primarily a wholesale
brand, which we are transitioning to a digital, direct-to-consumer brand. 

DSTLD offers stylish high-quality garments without the luxury retail markup valuing customer experience over labels. DSTLD is
primarily a digital direct-to-consumer brand, to which we recently added select wholesale retailers to generate brand awareness. 

Stateside is an elevated, America first brand with all knitting, dyeing, cutting and sewing sourced and manufactured locally in
Los Angeles. The collection is influenced by the evolution of the classic T-shirt offering a simple yet elegant look. Stateside is primarily
a wholesale brand that we will be transitioning to a digital, direct-to-consumer brand. 

Sundry offers distinct collections of women s clothing, including dresses, shirts, sweaters, skirts, shorts, athleisure
bottoms and other accessory products. Sundry s products are coastal casual and consist of soft, relaxed and colorful designs that
feature a distinct French chic, resembling the spirits of the French Mediterranean and the energy of Venice Beach in Southern California.
Sundry is primarily a wholesale brand that we will be transitioning to a digital, direct-to-consumer brand. 

We
believe that successful apparel brands sell in all revenue channels. However, each channel offers different margin structures and requires
different customer acquisition and retention strategies. We were founded as a digital-first retailer that has strategically expanded
into select wholesale and direct retail channels. We strive to strategically create omnichannel strategies for each of our brands that
blend physical and online channels to engage consumers in the channel of their choosing. Our products are sold direct-to-consumers principally
through our websites and our own showrooms, but also through our wholesale channel, primarily in specialty stores and select department
stores. With the continued expansion of our wholesale distribution, we believe developing an omnichannel solution further strengthens
our ability to efficiently acquire and retain customers while also driving high customer lifetime value. 

We
believe that by leveraging a physical footprint to acquire customers and increase brand awareness, we can use digital marketing to focus
on retention and a very tight, disciplined high value new customer acquisition strategy, especially targeting potential customers lower
in the sales funnel. Building a direct relationship with the customer as the customer transacts directly with us allows us to better
understand our customer s preferences and shopping habits. Our substantial experience as a company originally founded as a digitally
native-first retailer gives us the ability to strategically review and analyze the customer s data, including contact information,
browsing and shopping cart data, purchase history and style preferences. This in turn has the effect of lowering our inventory risk and
cash needs since we can order and replenish product based on the data from our online sales history, replenish specific inventory by
size, color and SKU based on real times sales data, and control our mark-down and promotional strategies versus being told what mark
downs and promotions we have to offer by the department stores and boutique retailers. 

We
define closet share as the percentage share of a customer s clothing units that of closet she or he owns in her or his closet and the amount of those units that go to the brands that are selling these units. For example, if
a customer buys 20 units of clothing a year and the brands that we own represent 10 of those units purchased, then our closet share is
50 of that customer s closet, or 10 of our branded units divided by 20 units they purchased in entirety. Closet share is a similar
concept to the widely used term wallet share, it is just specific to the customer s closet. The higher our closet share, the higher
our revenue as higher closet share suggests the customer is purchasing more of our brands than our competitors. 

We
have strategically expanded into an omnichannel brand offering these styles and content not only on-line but at selected wholesale and
retail storefronts. We believe this approach allows us opportunities to successfully drive Lifetime Value LTV while increasing
new customer growth. We define Lifetime Value or LTV as an estimate of the average revenue that a customer will generate throughout their
lifespan as our customer. This value/revenue of a customer helps us determine many economic decisions, such as marketing budgets per
marketing channel, retention versus acquisition decisions, unit level economics, profitability and revenue forecasting. 

We
acquired Bailey in February 2020, Stateside in August 2021 and Sundry in December 2022. We agreed on the consideration that we paid in
each acquisition in the course of arm s length negotiations with the holders of the membership interests in each of Bailey, H J,
Stateside and Sundry. In determining and negotiating this consideration, we relied on the experience and judgment of our management and
our evaluation of the potential synergies that could be achieved in combining the operations of Bailey, Stateside and Sundry. We did
not obtain independent valuations, appraisals or fairness opinions to support the consideration that we paid/agreed to pay.

Avo
 Brand Summary 

Avo
is a women s essential brand that will offer t-shirts, sweats, dresses, sweaters and athleisure. Avo eliminates the wholesale mark-up,
so its products have a sharper price point. Avo also offers larger discounts when the customer bundles multiple products to their cart,
which allows Avo to leverage its shipping and fulfillment costs. Avo leverages the Company s current design and supply chain infrastructure,
so we use similar or the same fabrics and contractors for Avo that we do for our other brands. 

Avo launched in late August 2024 and prices
for t-shirts range from 20 to 50 based on the size of the customer s bundle. Other product prices will range from 17.50 for
tanks to 198 for sweaters with no retail price above 99 if the customer bundles three units or more. If the customer bundles two units
then they receive a 40 discount and if they bundle three units or more the customer receives a 60 discount. 

Material
Trends, Events and Uncertainties 

Supply
Chain Disruptions 

We
are subject to global supply chain disruptions, which may include longer lead times for raw fabrics, inbound shipping and longer production
times. Supply chain issues have specifically impacted the following for our brands: 

Increased costs in raw materials from fabric prices, which have increased 10 to 100 depending on the fabric, the time of year, and
the origin of the fabric, as well as where the fabric is being shipped; 

Increased cost per kilo to ship via sea or air, which has increased from 25 to 300 depending on the time of year and from the country
we are shipping from; 

Increased transit time via sea or air, which have increased by two weeks to two months; and 

Increased labor costs for producing the finished goods, which have increased 5 to 25 depending on the country and the labor skill required
to produce the goods. We have been able to pass along some of these increased costs and also offset some of these increased costs with
higher gross margin online revenue 

Seasonality 

Our
quarterly operating results vary due to the seasonality of our individual brands and are historically stronger in the second half of
the calendar year. 

Substantial
Indebtedness 

As
of September 30, 2024, we had an aggregate principal amount of debt outstanding of approximately 8.2 million. We believe this is an
amount of indebtedness which may be considered significant for a company of our size and current revenue base. Our substantial debt could
have important consequences to us. For example, it could: 

make it more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations to the holders of our outstanding debt, resulting in possible defaults on and
acceleration of such indebtedness; 

require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flows from operations to make payments on our debt, which would reduce the availability
of our cash flows from operations to fund working capital, capital expenditures or other general corporate purposes; 

increase our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions, including interest rate fluctuations; 

place us at a competitive disadvantage to our competitors with proportionately less debt for their size; 

limit our ability to refinance our existing indebtedness or borrow additional funds in the future; 

limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changing conditions in our business; and 

limit our ability to react to competitive pressures or make it difficult for us to carry out capital spending that is necessary or important
to our growth strategy. 

Any
of the foregoing impacts of our substantial indebtedness could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and
results of operations. 

23 

 Table of Contents 

We
currently have 3.5 million in notes outstanding pursuant to our Bailey acquisition. We are currently unable to repay or refinance borrowings
so any such action by these lenders could force us into bankruptcy or liquidation. 

In
addition, our ability to make scheduled payments on our indebtedness or to refinance our obligations under our debt agreements, will
depend on our financial and operating performance, which, in turn, will be subject to prevailing economic and competitive conditions
and to the financial and business risk factors we face as described in this section, many of which may be beyond our control. We may
not be able to maintain a level of cash flows from operating activities sufficient to permit us to pay the principal, premium, if any,
and interest on our indebtedness. 

If
our cash flows and capital resources are insufficient to fund our debt service obligations, we may be forced to reduce or delay capital
expenditures or planned growth objectives, seek to obtain additional equity capital or restructure our indebtedness. In the future, our
cash flows and capital resources may not be sufficient for payments of interest on and principal of our debt, and such alternative measures
may not be successful and may not permit us to meet scheduled debt service obligations. In addition, the recent worldwide credit crisis
could make it more difficult for us to refinance our indebtedness on favorable terms, or at all. 

In
the absence of such operating results and resources, we may be required to dispose of material assets to meet our debt service obligations.
We may not be able to consummate those sales, or, if we do, we will not control the timing of the sales or whether the proceeds that
we realize will be adequate to meet debt service obligations when due. 

Performance
Factors 

We
believe that our future performance will depend on many factors, including the following: 

Ability
to Increase Our Customer Base in both Online and Traditional Wholesale Distribution Channels 

We
are currently growing our customer base through both paid and organic online channels, as well as by expanding our presence in a variety
of physical retail distribution channels. Online customer acquisitions typically occur at our direct websites for each brand . Our
online customer acquisition strategies include paid and unpaid social media, search, display and traditional media. Our products for
Bailey, DSTLD and Stateside are also sold through a growing number of physical retail channels, including specialty stores, department
stores and online multi-brand platforms. 

Ability
to Acquire Customers at a Reasonable Cost 

We
believe an ability to consistently acquire customers at a reasonable cost relative to customer retention rates, contribution margins
and projected life-time value will be a key factor affecting future performance. To accomplish this goal, we intend to balance advertising
spend between online and offline channels, as well as cross marketing and cross merchandising our portfolio brands and their respective
products. We believe the ability to cross merchandise products and cross market brands, will decrease our customer acquisition costs
while increasing the customer s lifetime value and contribution margin. We will also balance marketing spend with advertising focused
on creating emotional brand recognition, which we believe will represent a lower percentage of our spend. 

Ability
to Drive Repeat Purchases and Customer Retention 

We
accrue substantial economic value and margin expansion from customer cohort retention and repeat purchases of our products on an annual
basis. Our revenue growth rate and operating margin expansion will be affected by our customer cohort retention rates and the cohorts
annual spend for both existing and newly acquired customers. 

Ability
to Expand Our Product Lines 

Our
goal is to expand our product lines over time to increase our growth opportunity. Our customer s annual spend and brand relevance
will be driven by the cadence and success of new product launches. 

24 

 Table of Contents 

Ability
to Expand Gross Margins 

Our
overall profitability will be impacted by our ability to expand gross margins through effective sourcing and leveraging buying power
of finished goods and shipping costs, as well as pricing power over time. 

Ability
to Expand Operating Margins 

Our
ability to expand operating margins will be impacted by our ability to leverage (1) fixed general and administrative costs, (2) variable
sales and marketing costs, (3) elimination of redundant costs as we acquire and integrate brands, (4) cross marketing and cross merchandising
brands in our portfolio, and (4) drive customer retention and customer lifetime value. Our ability to expand operating margins will result
from increasing revenue growth above our operating expense growth, as well as increasing gross margins. For example, we anticipate that
our operating expenses will increase substantially in the foreseeable future as we undertake the acquisition and integration of different
brands, incur expenses associated with maintaining compliance as a public company, and increased marketing and sales efforts to increase
our customer base. While we anticipate that the operating expenses in absolute dollars will increase, we do not anticipate that the operating
expenses as a percentage of revenue will increase. We anticipate that the operating expenses as a percentage of revenue will decrease
as we eliminate duplicative costs across brands including a reduction in similar labor roles, contracts for technologies and operating
systems and creating lower costs from higher purchasing power from shipping expenses to purchase orders of products. This reduction of
expenses and lower cost per unit due to purchasing power should create meaningful savings in both dollars and as a percentage of revenue. 

As
an example, we were able to eliminate several million in expenses within six months of acquiring Bailey. Examples of these savings include
eliminating several Bailey teams, which our teams took over. 

We
merged over half of the technology contracts and operating systems contracts from two brands into one brand contract at significant savings.
We also eliminated our office space and rent and moved everyone into the Bailey office space. Finally, we eliminated DSTLD s third-party
logistics company and started using Bailey s internal logistics. This resulted in an increase in our operating expenses in absolute
dollars as there were now two brands versus one brand. However, the operating expenses as a percentage of pre-COVID revenue declined
meaningfully and as we increase revenue for each brand, we expect to experience higher margins. 

Ability
to Create Free Cash Flow 

Our
goal is to achieve near term free cash flow through cash flow positive acquisitions, elimination of redundant expenses in acquired companies,
increasing customer annual spend and lowering customer acquisition costs through cross merchandising across our brand portfolio.

Net
Revenues 

Revenues
decreased by 0.8 million to 2.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 3.3 million in the corresponding
fiscal period in 2023. The decrease was primarily due to a delay in wholesale shipments in April 2024, and lower ecommerce revenues across
each brand due to less digital advertising spend. 

Gross
Profit 

Our
gross profit decreased by 0.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 to 1.1 million from a gross profit of 1.7 million
for the corresponding fiscal period in 2023. The decrease in gross margin was primarily attributable to a decrease in sales. 

Our
gross margin was 46 for three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 52 for the three months ended June 30, 2023. T he
decrease in gross margin was due to corresponding decrease in the ecommerce revenue. 

Operating
Expenses/(Income) 

Our
operating expenses decreased by 1.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 to 3.8 million compared to 5.1 million for
the corresponding fiscal period in 2023. General and administrative expenses decreased by 1.3 million, and sales and marketing expenses
decreased by 0.5 million. The deceases were primarily due to cost cutting measures and synergies from the Sundry acquisition including
the elimination of its warehouse, office, fulfillment and redundancies in headcount. In the third quarter of 2024, the Company recorded
impairment expense of 600,000 pertaining to Bailey s intangibles. 

Other
Income (Expenses) 

Other
expenses were 0.8 million while other expense was 2.0 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, primarily
consisting of interest expense.

months ended September 30, 2024 compared to income from continuing operations of 5.4 million for the corresponding fiscal period in
2023, primarily due to the change in fair value of contingent consideration in 2023 and lower gross profit in 2024, partially offset
by lower general and administrative and sales and marketing expenses.

the corresponding fiscal period in 2023. General and administrative expenses decreased by 5.7 million, and sales and marketing expenses
decreased by 1.2 million. The deceases were primarily due to cost cutting measures and synergies from the Sundry acquisition including
the elimination of its warehouse, office, fulfillment and redundancies in headcount. Other operating expenses included a gain of 10.7
million in 2023 due to the change in fair value of contingent consideration. In the third quarter of 2024, the Company recorded impairment expense of 600,000 pertaining to Bailey s intangibles. 

Other
Income (Expenses) 

Other
expenses were 2.5 million while other expense was 5.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively.
Interest expense in 2024 decreased due to less merchant advances and lower principal on outstanding loans. 

Net
Loss from Continuing Operations 

Our
net loss from continuing operations increased by 2.7 million to a net loss from continuing operations of 7.7 million for the nine months
ended September 30, 2024 compared to income from continuing operations of 5.0 million for the corresponding fiscal period in 2023, primarily
due to the change in fair value of contingent consideration in 2023 and lower gross profit in 2024, partially offset by lower general
and administrative and sales and marketing expenses.

Liquidity
and Capital Resources 

Each
of DBG, Bailey, Stateside and Sundry has historically satisfied our liquidity needs and funded operations with borrowings capital raises
and internally generated cash flow, Changes in working capital, most notably accounts receivable, are driven primarily by levels of business
activity. Historically each of DBG, Bailey, Stateside and Sundry has maintained credit line facilities to support such working capital
needs and makes repayments on that facility with excess cash flow from operations. 

As
of September 30, 2024, we had cash of 158,601, but we had a working capital deficit of 16.0 million. The Company requires significant
capital to meet its obligations as they become due. These factors raise substantial doubt about our Company s ability to continue
as a going concern. Throughout the next twelve months, the Company intends to fund its operations primarily from the funds raised through
the equity line of credit agreement. The Company may pursue secondary offerings or debt financings to provide working capital and satisfy
debt obligations. There can be no assurance as to the availability or terms upon which such financing and capital might be available
in the future. If the Company is unable to secure additional funding, it may be forced to curtail or suspend its business plans.

cash provided by investing activities was 41,331 in 2023 primarily due to a reduction of deposits, partially offset by purchase of property
and cash sold in the H J disposition. 

Cash
Flows Provided by Financing Activities 

Cash
provided by financing activities was 3.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. Cash inflows included 5.4 million in
net proceeds from the issuance from the common stock for cash and 0.8 million in proceeds from loans and notes. Cash outflows
are primarily due to 2.5 million in repayments of notes.

Contractual
 Obligations and Commitments 

As
of September 30, 2024, we had 8.2 million in outstanding principal on debt, primarily our promissory notes due to the Bailey44 Sellers,
the March 2023 Notes, PPP and merchant advances. Aside from our remaining non-current SBA obligations, all outstanding loans have maturity
dates through 2024. 

Critical
Accounting Policies and Estimates 

Our
management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements,
which have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States. The preparation of our consolidated
financial statements and related disclosures requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets
and liabilities, costs and expenses and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities in our financial statements. We base our
estimates on historical experience, known trends and events and various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances,
the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent
from other sources. We evaluate our estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis. Our actual results may differ from these estimates
under different assumptions or conditions. 

Emerging
Growth Company Status 

We
are an emerging growth company as that term is used in the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012 and, as such, have elected to
comply with certain reduced public company reporting requirements. 

Section
107 of the JOBS Act provides that an emerging growth company can take advantage of the extended transition period provided in Section
7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act for complying with new or revised accounting standards. In other words, an emerging growth company can
delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. We have elected
to take advantage of the benefits of this extended transition period. Our financial statements may, therefore, not be comparable to those
of companies that comply with such new or revised accounting standards. 

Off-Balance
Sheet Arrangements 

We
did not have during the periods presented, and we do not currently have, any off-balance sheet arrangements, as defined in the rules
and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission. 

ITEM
3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 

We
are a smaller reporting company as defined by Rule 12b-2 of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange
Act and are not required to provide the information required under this item. 

ITEM
4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 

Evaluation
of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

We
maintain disclosure controls and procedures as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act
of 1934, as amended, or the Exchange Act, that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports we file
and submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s
rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information
required to be disclosed by us in the reports we file or submit under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to our management,
including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required
disclosure. In designing and evaluating our disclosure controls and procedures, management recognizes that any controls and procedures,
no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives, and management necessarily
applies its judgment in evaluating the benefits of possible controls and procedures relative to their costs.

Our
management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, who serve as our principal executive officer
and principal financial and accounting officer, respectively, has evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures
as of September 30, 2024. In making this evaluation, our management considered the material weakness in our internal control over financial
reporting described below. Based on such evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that our
disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of such date. 

We
have initiated various remediation efforts, including the hiring of additional financial personnel/consultants with the appropriate public
company and technical accounting expertise and other actions that are more fully described below. As such remediation efforts are still
ongoing, we have concluded that the material weaknesses have not been fully remediated. Our remediation efforts to date have included
the following: 

We have made an assessment of the basis of accounting, revenue recognition policies and accounting period cutoff procedures. In some
cases, we made the necessary adjustments to convert the basis of accounting from cash basis to accrual basis. In all cases we have done
the required analytical work to ensure the proper cutoff of the financial position and results of operations for the presented accounting
periods. 

We have made an assessment of the current accounting personnel, financial reporting and information system environments and capabilities.
Based on our preliminary findings, we have found these resources and systems lacking and have concluded that these resources and systems
will need to be supplemented and/or upgraded. We are in the process of identifying a single, unified accounting and reporting system
that can be used by the Company and Bailey, with the goal of ensuring consistency and timeliness in reporting, real time access to data
while also ensuring ongoing data integrity, backup and cyber security procedures and processes. 

We engaged external consultants with public company and technical accounting experience to facilitate accurate and timely accounting
closes and to accurately prepare and review the financial statements and related footnote disclosures. We plan to retain these financial
consultants until such time that the internal resources of the Company have been upgraded and the required financial controls have been
fully implemented. 

We have made an assessment on significant judgments and estimates, including impairment of long-lived assets and inventory valuation.
We plan to take the steps as noted above to have the proper resources to conduct proper analyses on areas requiring judgments and estimates. 

The
actions that have been taken are subject to continued review, implementation and testing by management, as well as audit committee oversight.
While we have implemented a variety of steps to remediate these weaknesses, we cannot assure you that we will be able to fully remediate
them, which could impair our ability to accurately and timely meet our public company reporting requirements. 

Notwithstanding
the assessment that our internal controls over financial reporting are not effective and that material weaknesses exist, we believe that
we have employed supplementary procedures to ensure that the financial statements contained in this filing fairly present our financial
position, results of operations and cash flows for the reporting periods covered herein in all material respects. 

Limitations
on Effectiveness of Controls and Procedures 

Our
management, including our Chief Executive Officer (Principal Executive Officer) and Chief Financial Officer (Principal Financial Officer),
does not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures will prevent all errors and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well
conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Further,
the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and the benefits of controls must be considered
relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance
that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within the Company have been detected. These inherent limitations include, but
are not limited to, the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error
or mistake. Additionally, controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people, or
by management override of the control. The design of any system of controls also is based in part upon certain assumptions about the
likelihood of future events and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential
future conditions. Over time, controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or the degree of compliance with the policies
or procedures may deteriorate. Because of the inherent limitations in a cost-effective control system, misstatements due to error or
fraud may occur and not be detected. 

Management
believes that the material weakness set forth above did not have an effect on our financial results. 

Changes
in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 

No
change in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) occurred
during the quarter ended September 30, 2024 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal
control over financial reporting.

PART
II. OTHER INFORMATION 

ITEM
1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS 

We
are currently involved in, and may in the future be involved in, legal proceedings, claims, and government investigations in the ordinary
course of business. These include proceedings, claims, and investigations relating to, among other things, regulatory matters, commercial
matters, intellectual property, competition, tax, employment, pricing, discrimination, consumer rights, personal injury, and property
rights. These matters also include the following: 

On
 March 21, 2023, a vendor filed a lawsuit against Digital Brands Group related to trade payables totaling approximately 43,501. Such
 amounts include interest due, and are included in accounts payable, net of payments made to date, in the accompanying consolidated
 balance sheets. The Company does not believe it is probable that the losses in excess of such trade payables will be incurred. 

On February 7, 2023, a vendor filed a lawsuit against Digital Brands Group
related to trade payables totaling approximately 182,400. Such amounts include interest due, and are included in accounts payable, net
of payments made to date, in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. The Company settled for 250,000, in October 2024, which included
additional legal costs. 

In August 2020 and March 2021, two lawsuits were filed against Bailey s by third-party s related to prior services rendered.
The claims (including fines, fees, and legal expenses) total an aggregate of 96,900. Both matters were settled in February 2022 and are
on payment plans which will be paid off in the second quarter of 2025. 

On December 21, 2020, a Company investor filed a lawsuit against DBG for
reimbursement of their investment totaling 100,000. Claimed amounts are included in short-term convertible note payable in the accompanying
consolidated balance sheets and the Company does not believe it is probable that losses in excess of such short-term note payable will
be incurred. The Company is actively working to resolve this matter. 

On
 November 16, 2023 a vendor filed a lawsuit against Digital Brands Group related to trade payables totaling approximately 345,384
 , which represents past due fees and late fees. Such amounts are included in the accompanying balance sheets. The Company does not
 believe it is probable that the losses in excess of such pay trade payables will be incurred. 

On
 November 15, 2023 a vendor filed a lawsuit against Digital Brands Group related to trade payables totaling approximately 582,208,
 which represents double damages. The amount due to the vendor is 292,604. Such amounts are included in the accompanying balance
 sheets. The Company does not believe it is probable that the losses in excess of such pay trade payables will be incurred.

On
December 21, 2023, a former employee from over two years ago filed a wrongful termination lawsuit against the Company. The Company is
disputing this claim. To this point, this same law firm recently sent a demand letter for another wrongful termination of a temporary
worker we used from a third party placement agency. This person was not a Company employee at any time. 

A
 vendor filed a lawsuit against Bailey 44 related to a retail store lease in the amount of 1.5 million. The Company is disputing
 the claim for damages and the matter is ongoing. The vendor has recently updated the claim to now be 450,968 after signing a long-term
 lease with another brand for this location. The Company is disputing this new amount after review of the lease. 

All
claims above, to the extent management believes it will be liable, have been included in accounts payable and accrued expenses and other
liabilities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet as of September 30, 2024. 

Depending
on the nature of the proceeding, claim, or investigation, we may be subject to monetary damage awards, fines, penalties, or injunctive
orders. Furthermore, the outcome of these matters could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial
condition. The outcomes of legal proceedings, claims, and government investigations are inherently unpredictable and subject to significant
judgment to determine the likelihood and amount of loss related to such matters. While it is not possible to determine the outcomes,
we believe based on our current knowledge that the resolution of all such pending matters will not, either individually or in the aggregate,
have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, cash flows, or financial condition.

the note holder is in the process of returning the Shares to the Company s transfer agent for cancellation. Upon cancellation of
the Shares, the Company s issued and outstanding common stock count will decrease by 1,311,345 shares. On November 5, 2024, the
