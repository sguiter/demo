As of September 30, 2024, there were service-based stock options outstanding, and performance-based stock options outstanding, which were granted in October 2023 to the Company's current Chief Executive Officer subject to future market capitalization targets. 

The Company uses the Black-Scholes option pricing model to determine the fair value of service-based options granted. The following table summarizes the assumptions used to compute the fair value of options granted to employees and non-employees: 

Risk-free interest rate 

Expected dividend yield 

Expected life of options 

Weighted-average fair value of options granted 

Estimated volatility is a measure of the amount by which the Company s stock price is expected to fluctuate each year during the expected life of awards. The Company s estimated volatility was based on an average of the historical volatility of peer entities whose stock prices were publicly available. The Company s calculation of estimated volatility is based on historical stock prices of these peer entities over a period equal to the expected life of the awards. The Company uses the historical volatility of peer entities due to the lack of sufficient historical data of its stock price. The Company records forfeitures as they are incurred. 

The risk-free interest rate assumption is based upon observed interest rates on zero coupon U.S. Treasury bonds whose maturity period is appropriate for the term of the options. The dividend yield of zero is based on the fact that the Company has never paid cash dividends and has no present intention to pay cash dividends. The Company calculates the expected life of the options using the Simplified Method for the employee stock options as the Company does not have sufficient historical exercise data. 

Stock option expense was and for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, and ) and for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively.

Overview 

We are a global public safety technology and services company that delivers safe and effective policing solutions to law enforcement and security personnel worldwide. We are leading the movement for safer outcomes by equipping law enforcement with safer, non-painful compliance tools, and immersive training fit for modern society. We began sales of our first public safety product, the BolaWrap 100 remote restraint device, in late 2018. In the first quarter of 2022, we delivered a new generation product, the BolaWrap 150. The BolaWrap 150 is electronically deployed and is more robust, smaller, lighter and simpler to deploy than the BolaWrap 100 that has since been phased out. In late 2020 we added a new solution to our public safety technologies, our virtual reality VR training platform, Wrap Reality, and in August 2023 we acquired Intrensic, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company Intrensic ), which added a Body-Worn Camera BWC and Digital Evidence Management DEM solution to our portfolio of policing solutions. Wrap Reality is now sold to law enforcement agencies for simulation training, as well as corrections departments for the societal reentry scenarios. 

Our target market for our solutions includes approximately 900,000 full-time sworn law enforcement officers in over 18,000 federal, state, and local law enforcement agencies in the U.S. and over 12 million police officers in more than 100 countries. Additionally, we are exploring opportunities in other domestic markets, such as military and private security. Our international focus is on countries with the largest police forces. According to 360iResearch, a market research consulting firm, our non-lethal products are part of a global market segment expected to grow to 16.1 billion by 2027. 

We focus our efforts on the following products and services: 

BolaWrap Remote Restraint Device a hand-held remote restraint device that discharges a seven and half-foot Kevlar tether to entangle an individual at a range of 10-25 feet. BolaWrap assists law enforcement to safely and effectively control encounters early without resorting to painful force options. 

Wrap Reality a law enforcement 3D training system employing immersive computer graphics VR with proprietary software-enabled content. It allows up to two participants to enter a simulated training environment simultaneously, and customized weapons controllers enable trainees to engage in strategic decision making along the force continuum. Wrap Reality has 45 scenarios for law enforcement and corrections and 15 scenarios for societal reentry. Wrap Reality is one of the most robust 3D Virtual Reality solutions on the market for law enforcement and societal reentry today. 

Wrap Intrensic a Body-Worn Camera and Digital Evidence Management solutions provider. BWC and DEM play crucial roles in capturing, storing, and managing digital evidence, such as video and audio recordings for various purposes, including criminal investigations and maintaining transparency in public interactions. The Wrap Intrensic X2 camera hardware and storage and data management capability, along with awareness of front-line operations, provides customers with a solution to meet their challenges. Wrap Intrensic Evidence on our cloud-based video storage platform provides an unlimited video storage platform that includes video and other evidence uploading, search, retrieval, redaction, and evidence sharing while reducing the need for resources required to manage this evidence. 

In addition to the U.S. law enforcement market, we have shipped our restraint products to 62 countries. We have established an active distributor network representing 50 states and one dealer representing the U.S. territory of Puerto Rico. We have distribution agreements with 35 international distributors covering 75 countries. We focus significant sales, training and business development efforts to support our distribution network in addition to our internal sales team. 

We focus significant resources on research and development innovations and continue to enhance our products and plan to introduce new products. We believe we have established a strong brand and market presence globally and have established significant competitive advantages in our markets.

Business Outlook and Challenges 

We believe our Company's products and solutions are gaining global recognition and awareness through various channels such as social media, trade shows, and media exposure, among others. In part, this recognition and awareness can be attributed to positive feedback from law enforcement agencies and the successful deployment of our products. As a result, we believe our brand is becoming increasingly recognized on a global scale as a leader in remote restraint and non-lethal solutions. 

In addition, we are focused on marketing and public relations efforts. We believe there are market opportunities for our remote restraint and virtual reality solutions in the law enforcement and security sectors worldwide. These opportunities are driven by the increasing demand for less-lethal policing. 

In the law enforcement sector, our BolaWrap product has been successfully deployed in the field, as reported by many agencies. BolaWrap is now in use by over 900 U.S. law enforcement agencies and in 62 countries. Due to its safe remote restraint capabilities, some agencies do not deem its usage a categorical reportable use of force and rather place it underneath early use of force such as handcuffs. In our strategic roadmap, we clarified that law enforcement agencies deploy BolaWrap when verbal commands breakdown, but long before there is justifiable escalation to pepper spray, pepper ball, batons, bean bags, tasers or Conducted Electrical Weapons (CEW s) or firearms. 

Some agencies voluntarily report usage to us, but many do not. In the usage reports we have been provided, officers have reported successful outcomes in 84 of the use cases. This percentage is higher than what is often seen with less lethal tools. From the information we have been provided, the most common BolaWrap use case is for individuals with behavioral health issues, and the second most common BolaWrap use case is during domestic violence calls. 26 of the reported persons who are wrapped with the BolaWrap are thought to be under the influence of alcohol or drugs. 

There are many reasons why we may not receive reports on all the use of the BolaWrap, including, when uses of BolaWrap are considered evidence in ongoing criminal cases, are controlled by local policy or regulation, or require officer and union permission to be shared with us. However, some agencies have shared bodycam footage of successful field deployments with us, which we may use in our training and education efforts. We believe that as the reports of BolaWrap's effectiveness in de-escalation continue to increase, it will contribute to our future revenue growth. 

We anticipate and believe that our portfolio of safe, remote restraint products and training services has a strong and expanding pipeline of market opportunities in the law enforcement, military, corrections, and homeland security sectors both domestically and internationally. With the increasing demand for more humane and safer policing practices, we expect a continued surge in our global business. Currently, we are exploring major international business prospects, while simultaneously seeking to establish relationships with large police agencies in the U.S. However, we acknowledge that it is challenging to predict the exact timeline for closing these deals, or whether they will ultimately materialize. 

19

As part of our efforts to expand our sales and distribution operations, we provide a comprehensive training program for law enforcement officers and trainers in using the BolaWrap. This training equips them with knowledge about the appropriate use and limitations of BolaWrap in tandem with modern policing techniques for de-escalation of encounters. We now focus on also teaching when and why BolaWrap should be used, including the specific area of success, such as after verbal commands break down and before the law enforcement officer is ready to escalate to less lethal pain compliance tools. We believe that law enforcement trainers and officers who have been trained to use our products, or have witnessed demonstrations, are more inclined to support the acquisition and deployment of our products by their respective departments to drive successful outcomes. As of September 30, 2024, over 1,530 agencies have received BolaWrap training with over 5,400 training officers at those agencies certified as BolaWrap instructors and qualified to train the rest of their departments, representing a 10 increase in agencies and a 10 increase in trained officers as compared to September 30, 2023. 

Operating expense of 13.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 decreased by 2.3 million, when compared to operating expense of 15.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, as a result of the Company s cost containment initiatives enacted beginning in the first half of 2024 as well as a reduction in share-based compensation, offset by increased occupancy expenses related to our new office space. 

Although geopolitical tensions and macroeconomic challenges have affected our quarterly results in the past and may in the future, we believe our Company is uniquely positioned to provide lifesaving technologies and training that enable law enforcement officers worldwide to conduct safe and effective encounters while reducing the use of force. If departments follow our Use of Force Guarantee requirements, we have offered to buy back their BolaWrap devices if their reportable use of force is not reduced by 10 . With an increasing addressable market, the Company offers what we believe is a unique value proposition. Our improved pricing strategy, coupled with reduced operating expenses and our growing sales outlook, is expected to help reduce losses and improve cash flow in the future. 

We plan to increase the number of product demonstrations and training sessions, particularly in international markets. Our new focus on the when and why BolaWrap is used has shown improved results. This is a departure from the hardware product only approach of the past. Our sales of the BolaWrap 150 and Wrap Reality are expected to continue to rise, aided by our ongoing cost savings and cost control measures, which we expect to lead to an overall reduction in cash burn. 

As of September 30, 2024, we had backlog of approximately 156 thousand which is expected to be delivered in the fourth quarter of 2024. Additionally, as of September 30, 2024, we had deferred revenue of 673 thousand, which consisted of 97 thousand related to VR, 463 thousand related to Intrensic, 98 thousand related to BolaWrap extended warranties and services and 15 thousand related to training. Distributor and customer orders for future deliveries are generally subject to modification, rescheduling or in some instances, cancellation, in the normal course of business. 

Since inception, we have generated significant losses from operations and anticipate that we will continue to generate significant losses from operations for the foreseeable future. We believe that we have adequate financial resources to sustain our operations for the next twelve months following this Report. We recorded net income of 1.7 million during the first nine months of fiscal 2024 as compared to net loss of 11.8 million during the first nine months of fiscal 2023, an improvement of approximately 13.5 million for the comparable period. Net cash used in operations during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, was 6.0 million less than net cash used in operations during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. This decrease in net cash used in operations during the first nine months of 2024 was primarily driven by the Company s cost containment efforts initiated in the first half of 2024. 

We expect that we will continue to innovate new applications for our public safety technology, open new geographies, develop new products and technologies to meet diverse customer requirements and identify and develop new markets for our products. 

Supply chain disruptions also affected our operations and could negatively impact our ability to source materials, manufacture and distribute products in the future. Moreover, financial markets continue to experience significant volatility, which could potentially affect our ability to enter into or modify favorable terms and conditions regarding equity and debt financing activities. Nevertheless, we had 4.9 million in cash and cash equivalents as of September 30, 2024. We therefore believe we have sufficient capital to fund our operations for the next twelve months following this Report. However, we may require additional working capital and liquidity constraints and access to capital markets could still negatively affect our liquidity and may require changes to our plan of operations. 

Our Company may be positively or negatively impacted by continued social unrest, protests against racial inequality, and movements like "Defund the Police." Such unrest may be further fueled by misleading information or negative publicity about our solutions. We believe our solutions are the answer to reducing use of force and driving safer outcomes for officers and the citizens they interact with each day. Although the intensity of these events may have subsided, some may still indirectly or directly, influence police agency budgets and the funding available to current and potential customers. In addition, participants in these events may attempt to create the impression that our solutions are contributing to the perceived problems, potentially harming our business and operations, including our revenues, earnings, and cash flows from operations. 

Changes in our management and other critical personnel have the potential to positively or negatively affect our business. Such disruptions could have an adverse impact on our operations, programs, growth, financial condition, or results of operations. On the other hand, improvements in our operations, operating expenses, and go-to-market approaches could positively influence the success of our business in the future.

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 

The preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States U.S. GAAP requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expense, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. We evaluate our estimates, on an on-going basis, including those estimates related to recognition and measurement of contingencies and accrued expense. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. 

As part of the process of preparing our financial statements, we are required to estimate our provision for income taxes. Significant management judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes, deferred tax assets and liabilities, tax contingencies, unrecognized tax benefits, and any required valuation allowance, including taking into consideration the probability of the tax contingencies being incurred. Management assesses this probability based upon information provided by its tax advisers, its legal advisers and similar tax cases. If later our assessment of the probability of these tax contingencies changes, our accrual for such tax uncertainties may increase or decrease. Our effective tax rate for annual and interim reporting periods could be impacted if uncertain tax positions that are not recognized are settled at an amount which differs from our estimates. 

Some of our accounting policies require higher degrees of judgment than others in their application. These include share-based compensation and contingencies and areas such as revenue recognition, allowance for doubtful accounts, valuation of inventory and intangible assets, estimates of product line exit costs, warranty liabilities and impairments. 

Revenue Recognition . We sell our products to customers including law enforcement agencies, domestic distributors and international distributors and revenue from such transactions is recognized in the periods that products are shipped (free on board FOB shipping point) or received by customers (FOB destination), when the fee is fixed or determinable and when collection of resulting receivables is reasonably assured. We identify customer performance obligations, determine the transaction price, allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations and recognize revenue as we satisfy the performance obligations. Our primary performance obligations are products/accessories and VR software licensing or sale. Our customers do not have the right to return product unless the product is found to be defective. 

Share-Based Compensation. We follow the fair value recognition provisions issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB in Accounting Standards Codification ASC Topic 718, Stock Compensation ASC 718 and we adopted Accounting Standards Update ASU 2018-07 for share-based transactions with non-employees. Share-based compensation expense recognized includes stock option and restricted stock unit compensation expense. The grant date fair value of stock options is determined using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. The grant date is the date at which an employer and employee or non-employee reach a mutual understanding of the key terms and conditions of a share-based payment award. The Black-Scholes option-pricing model requires inputs including the market price of the Company s Common Stock on the date of grant, the term that the stock options are expected to be outstanding, the implied stock volatilities of several publicly traded peers over the expected term of stock options, risk-free interest rate and expected dividend. Each of these inputs is subjective and generally requires significant judgment to determine. The grant date fair value of restricted stock units is based upon the market price of the Company s Common Stock on the date of the grant. We determine the amount of share-based compensation expense based on awards that we ultimately expect to vest and account for forfeitures as they occur. The fair value of share-based compensation is amortized to compensation expense over the vesting term. 

Allowance for Doubtful Accounts. Our products are sold to customers in many different markets and geographic locations. We estimate our bad debt reserve on a case-by-case basis and the aging of accounts due to a limited number of customers mostly government agencies or well-established distributors. We base these estimates on many factors including customer credit worthiness, past transaction history with the customer, current economic industry trends and changes in customer payment terms. Our judgments and estimates regarding collectability of accounts receivable have an impact on our financial statements. 

Valuation of Inventory . Our inventory is comprised of raw materials, assemblies and finished products. We must periodically make judgments and estimates regarding the future utility and carrying value of our inventory. The carrying value of our inventory is periodically reviewed and impairments, if any, are recognized when the expected future benefit from our inventory is less than carrying value. 

21

Valuation of Intangible Assets. Intangible assets consisted of (a) capitalized legal fees and filing expense related to obtaining patents and trademarks, (b) customer agreements, tradenames, software, non-solicitation and non-compete agreements acquired in business combinations and valued at fair value at the acquisition date, and (c) the purchase cost of indefinite-lived website domains. We must make judgments and estimates regarding the future utility and carrying value of intangible assets. The carrying values of such assets are periodically reviewed and impairments, if any, are recognized when the expected future benefit to be derived from an individual intangible asset is less than carrying value. This generally could occur when certain assets are no longer consistent with our business strategy and whose expected future value has decreased. 

Accrued Expense. We establish a warranty reserve based on anticipated warranty claims at the time product revenue is recognized. This reserve requires us to make estimates regarding the amount and costs of warranty repairs we expect to make over a period of time. Factors affecting warranty reserve levels include the number of units sold, anticipated cost of warranty repairs, and anticipated rates of warranty claims. We have very limited history to make such estimates and warranty estimates have an impact on our financial statements. Warranty expense is recorded in cost of revenue. We evaluate the adequacy of this reserve each reporting period. 

We use the recognition criteria of FASB ASC Topic 450-20, Loss Contingencies, to estimate the amount of bonuses when it becomes probable a bonus liability will be incurred, and we recognize expense ratably over the service period. We accrue bonus expense each quarter based on estimated year-end results, and then adjust the actual in the fourth quarter based on our final results compared to targets. 

Warrants. The Company accounts for warrants as liability-classified instruments based on an assessment of the warrant s specific terms and applicable authoritative guidance in Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB Accounting Standards Codification ASC 480, Distinguishing Liabilities from Equity ASC 480 and ASC 815, Derivatives and Hedging ASC 815 ). The assessment considers whether the warrants are freestanding financial instruments pursuant to ASC 480, meet the definition of a liability pursuant to ASC 480, and whether the warrants meet all of the requirements for equity classification under ASC 815, including whether the warrants are indexed to the Company s own common shares and whether the warrant holders could potentially require net cash settlement in a circumstance outside of the Company s control, among other conditions for equity classification. This assessment, which requires the use of professional judgment, is conducted at the time of warrant issuance and as of each subsequent quarterly period end date while the warrants are outstanding. 

Business Combination. The Company accounts for its business combinations under the provisions of Accounting Standards Codification (" ASC ") Topic 805-10, Business Combinations (" ASC 805-10 "), which requires that the purchase method of accounting be used for all business combinations. Assets acquired and liabilities assumed, including non-controlling interests, are recorded at the date of acquisition at their respective fair values. The estimated fair value of net assets acquired, including the allocation of the fair value to identifiable assets and liabilities, was determined using established valuation techniques. ASC 805-10 also specifies criteria that intangible assets acquired in a business combination must meet to be recognized and reported apart from goodwill. Goodwill represents the excess purchase price over the fair value of the tangible net assets and intangible assets acquired in a business combination. Acquisition-related expenses are recognized separately from the business combinations and are expensed as incurred. 

The estimated fair value of the acquired intangible assets was determined using a method which reflects the present value of the operating cash flows generated by this asset after taking into account the cost to realize the revenue, and an appropriate discount rate to reflect the time value and risk associated with the invested capital. 

Certain adjustments to the assessed fair values of the assets and liabilities made subsequent to the acquisition date, but within the measurement period, which is up to one year, are recorded as adjustments to goodwill. Any adjustments subsequent to the measurement period are recorded in income. 

Historically, our assumptions, judgments and estimates relative to our critical accounting policies have not differed materially from actual results. Other than the warrants and business combination described above, there were no significant changes or modification of our critical accounting policies and estimates involving management valuation adjustments affecting our results for the period ended September 30, 2024. Our accounting policies are more fully described in Note 1. Organization and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements included in the Annual Report. 

Segment and Related Information 

The Company operates as a single segment. The Company s chief operating decision maker is Scot Cohen, the Company s Executive Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, who manages operations for purposes of allocating resources. Refer to Note 15. Major Customers and Related Information, in our financial statements for further discussion. 

Operating Expense 

Our operating expense includes (i) selling, general and administrative expense, (ii) research and development expense, and in the most recent fiscal quarter, and (iii) product line exit expense. Research and development expense is comprised of the costs incurred in performing research and development activities and developing production on our behalf, including compensation and consulting, design and prototype costs, contract services, patent costs and other outside expense. The scope and magnitude of our future research and development expense is difficult to predict at this time and will depend on elections made regarding research projects, staffing levels and outside consulting and contract costs. The future level of selling, general and administrative expense will be dependent on staffing levels, elections regarding expenditures on sales, marketing and customer training, the use of outside resources, public company and regulatory expense, and other factors, some of which are outside of our control. 

We expect our operating costs will continue to reduce from the first quarter of 2024, as a result of the changes from ongoing cost containment efforts. We may incur additional non-cash share-based compensation costs depending on future option and restricted stock unit grants that are impacted by stock prices and other valuation factors. Historical expenditures are not indicative of future expenditures.

Revenue 

We reported net revenue of 593 thousand for the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to 3.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023, an 84 decrease compared to the prior year. The decrease in 2024 as compared to the prior year is primarily a result of 2023 revenues that included large order intake in EMEA. 

We incurred product promotional costs of 1 thousand during the three months ended September 30, 2024, representing a 98 decrease as compared to 61 thousand for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The 2023 product promotional costs were related primarily to BolaWrap 150 demonstration products, and the cost of training products and accessories delivered to law enforcement agencies that were expensed as marketing costs. 

23

Gross Profit 

Our gross profit for the three months ended September 30, 2024, was 235 thousand, or a gross margin of 40 . Our gross profit for the three months ended September 30, 2023, was 2.2 million, or a gross margin of 60 . The 89 year-over-year decrease in gross profit was a result of lower volumes of BolaWrap 150 product sales slightly offset by the added high-margin revenue from the Company s Intrensic acquisition in August 2023. 

As our revenue history is limited, historical margins may not accurately reflect future margins. However, we expect higher margins with the production of the BolaWrap 150 compared to previous production due to design changes and improved pricing, as well as our higher margin revenue from the Intrensic product offerings. Our margins are also subject to variations based on the sales channels and product mix through which our products are sold. At present, our cassettes have lower margins than BolaWrap devices. As we scale cassette production, we will look to reduce our costs and drive higher cassette margins. Cassettes were a total of 10 of our overall revenue in the three months ended September 30, 2024, and will continue to grow as a recurring revenue base as more BolaWrap devices are in the field and the usage of BolaWrap increases due to the need of officers to de-escalate earlier to prevent injuries and use of higher levels of force. 

We regularly introduce updates and revisions to our products, which may include changes to raw materials and components, and can impact our product costs. Given our limited experience with warranty costs, our estimated future warranty expense may affect our gross margins. 

Our global supply chain has experienced notable component shortages, extended lead times, cost fluctuations, and logistical constraints, all of which have affected our product costs. Although we have seen these supply chain obstacles ease in 2024, we acknowledge that future supplier shortages, quality problems, and logistics delays could impact our production schedules and have a material negative impact on our financial condition, results of operation, and cash flows. 

Selling, General and Administrative Expense 

Selling, general and administrative SG A expense of 3.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, was reduced by 1.0 million when compared to 4.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease in SG A expense was primarily the result of the Company s cost containment initiatives enacted beginning in the first half of 2024 which was offset by an increase of 1.0 million in share-based compensation as well as by increased occupancy expenses related to our new office space. 

Share-based compensation costs allocated to SG A increased to 896 thousand for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to a negative 149 thousand for the three months ended September 30, 2023, resulting from forfeitures and cancellations in 2023. 

Salaries and burden costs of 756 thousand for the three months ended September 30, 2024, were approximately 880 thousand lower than in the three months ended September 30, 2023. This reduction reflects an approximate 32 reduction in the Company s workforce including a reduction of certain C-Level positions. During the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023, we decreased professional and consulting fees by 907 thousand reflecting the Company s cost containment efforts. We expect expenditures for SG A expenses in 2024 to continue to decline in the last quarter of 2024, as a result of the Company s cost cutting initiatives. 

Advertising and promotion costs were 81 thousand for the three months ended September 30, 2024, or a decrease of 143 thousand as compared to 224 thousand for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The changes in advertising costs were primarily related to reduced trade show costs offset by slight increases in digital marketing campaigns. 

Research and Development Expense 

Research and development expense decreased by 83 thousand for the three months ended September 30, 2024, when compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. We incurred a 36 thousand period over period increase in compensation expense as well as a 71 thousand period over period decrease in share-based compensation expense allocated to research and development expense as a result of reduction of personnel. Outside consulting costs decreased by 8 thousand for the three months ended September 30, 2024, when compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023, primarily due to the Company s move to a more variable cost model. 

24

Operating Loss 

Loss from operations of 3.6 million during the three months ended September 30, 2024, was an increase of 876 thousand compared to loss from operations of 2.8 million during the three months ended September 30, 2023, primarily reflecting the reduced revenues offset by lower operating costs from the Company s cost containment efforts. 

Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024, Compared to Nine Months Ended September 30, 2023

Revenue 

We reported net revenue of 3.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to 5.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, a 34 decrease. The decrease in 2024 is primarily a result of a 2.3 million decrease in sales of BolaWrap devices, cartridges and accessories to distributors in EMEA. We incurred discounts of 18 thousand during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 132 thousand for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. We expect a continued decline to minimal discounts throughout 2024, as we have phased out our promotional upgrade offer. 

We incurred product promotional costs of 101 thousand during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, related primarily to BolaWrap 150 demonstration products and the cost of training products and accessories delivered to law enforcement agencies that were expensed as marketing costs. We are responding to increased demand for training as a result of expanded product and brand awareness and increased successful field use by agencies but, due to increased awareness, expect reductions in product promotional costs throughout 2024. 

As of September 30, 2024, we had deferred revenue of 673 thousand, which consisted of 97 thousand related to VR, 463 thousand related to Intrensic, 98 thousand related to BolaWrap extended warranties and services and 15 thousand related to training. 

25

On September 30, 2024, we had backlog of 260 thousand expected to be delivered in the fourth quarter of 2024. Distributor and customer orders for future deliveries are generally subject to modification, rescheduling or, in some instances, cancellation in the normal course of business. 

Gross Profit 

Our gross profit for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, was 2.1 million, or a gross margin of 56 . Our gross profit for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, was 3.2 million, or a gross margin of 58 . The 36 year-over-year decrease in gross profit was a result of higher volumes of the BolaWrap 150 product sold to EMEA distributors in 2023 that were slightly offset by the added high-margin revenue from the Company s Intrensic acquisition in August 2023. 

As our revenue history is limited, historical margins may not accurately reflect future margins. However, we expect higher margins with the production of the BolaWrap 150 compared to previous production due to design changes and improved pricing. Our margins are also subject to variations based on the sales channels and product mix through which our products are sold. At present, our cassettes have lower margins than BolaWrap devices. As we scale cassette production, we will look to reduce our costs and drive higher cassette margins. Cassettes were a total of 13 of our overall revenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, and will continue to grow as a recurring revenue base as more BolaWrap devices are in the field and the usage of BolaWrap increases due to the need of officers to de-escalate earlier to prevent injuries and use of higher levels of force. 

We regularly introduce updates and revisions to our products, which may include changes to raw materials and components, and can impact our product costs. Given our limited experience with warranty costs, our estimated future warranty expense may affect our gross margins. 

Our global supply chain has experienced notable component shortages, extended lead times, cost fluctuations, and logistical constraints, all of which have affected our product costs. Although we have seen these supply chain obstacles ease in 2024, we acknowledge that future supplier shortages, quality problems, and logistics delays could impact our production schedules and have a material negative impact on our financial condition, results of operation, and cash flows. 

Selling, General and Administrative Expense 

SG A expense of 11.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, decreased by 1.6 million when compared to 12.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, as a result of the Company s cost containment initiatives enacted beginning in the first half of 2024 offset by increased occupancy expenses related to our new office space. 

Share-based compensation costs allocated to SG A increased to 1.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 1.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. This 331 thousand increase resulted primarily due to changes in management and changes in the Company s stock price. 

Salaries and burden costs of 3.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, was a 1.4 million decrease compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023, we increased our occupancy costs by 615 thousand, which was offset by a reduction of professional fees by 807 thousand and travel and entertainment costs by 211 thousand. We expect expenditures for SG A expense in 2024 to be lower than 2023 as a result of the Company s cost containment initiatives enacted beginning in the first half 2024. 

Advertising and promotion costs were 552 thousand for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, or a decrease of 117 thousand as compared to 669 thousand for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease in advertising costs was related to decreases in video and testimonial costs as well as reductions in trade shows and other cost containment efforts. 

Research and Development Expense 

Research and development expense decreased by 723 thousand for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, when compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2024. We incurred a 130 thousand period over period decrease in compensation expense allocated to research and development expense as a result of personnel changes along with a 165 thousand period over period decrease in share-based compensation expense allocated to research and development expense as a result of personnel changes. Outside consulting costs decreased by 101 thousand and material costs were lower by 128 thousand for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 

26

Operating Loss 

Loss from operations of 10.9 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, represents a reduction of 1.2 million compared to loss from operations of 12.1 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2023, reflecting increased focus on reducing operating costs. 

Liquidity and Capital Resources 

Overview 

Our primary source of liquidity to date has been funding from our stockholders from the sale of equity securities and the exercise of derivative securities, consisting of options and warrants. We expect our primary source of future liquidity will be from the sale of products, exercise of stock options and warrants and from future equity or debt financings. 

We have experienced net losses and negative cash flows from operations since our inception. As of September 30, 2024, we had cash and cash equivalents of 4.9 million, working capital of 1.6 million including the 7.2 million value of the Series A Warrants recorded in connection with the issuance of the Series A Preferred Stock in July 2023, and had sustained cumulative losses attributable to stockholders of 97.3 million. Our working capital net of the warrants-short term at September 30, 2024 was 8.6 million lower compared to December 31, 2023, primarily as a result of operating losses of 10.9 million for the period. Our working capital as of September 30, 2024 was negatively affected by the continued operating losses during the prior twelve months. We believe we have sufficient capital to fund our operations for the next twelve months following this Report. However, liquidity constraints and access to capital markets could still negatively affect our liquidity and may require changes to our investment strategy. 

Capital Requirements 

Our future liquidity requirements or future capital needs will depend on, among other things, capital required to introduce new products and the operational staffing and support requirements, as well as the timing and amount of future revenue and product costs. We anticipate that demands for operating and working capital may grow depending on decisions on staffing, development, production, marketing, training and other functions and based on other factors outside of our control, including the timing of receipt of revenue. 

Our future capital requirements, cash flows and results of operations could be affected by, and will depend on, many factors, some of which are currently unknown to us, including, among other things: 

Any future outbreaks pandemics or contagious diseases or fear of such outbreaks; 

Decisions regarding staffing, development, production, marketing and other functions; 

The timing and extent of market acceptance of our products; 

Costs, timing and outcome of planned production and required customer and regulatory compliance of our products; 

Costs of preparing, filing and prosecuting our patent applications and defending any future intellectual property-related claims; 

Costs and timing of additional product development; 

Costs, timing and outcome of any future warranty claims or litigation against us associated with any of our products; 

Ability to collect accounts receivable; and 

Timing and costs associated with any new financing. 

Principal factors that could affect our ability to obtain cash from external sources including from exercise of outstanding warrants and options include: 

Volatility in the capital markets; and 

Market price and trading volume of our Common Stock.

2023 Offering 

On June 29, 2023, the Company entered into a Series Purchase Agreement Series A Purchase Agreement with certain accredited investors, including the Company s Executive Chairman and Chief Executive Officer (collectively, the Series A Investors ), pursuant to which it agreed to sell to the Series A Investors in a registered direct offering (the Series A Offering (i) an aggregate of 10,000 shares of Series A Preferred Stock, initially convertible into up to 6,896,553 shares of the Company s Common Stock, at an initial conversion price of 1.45 per share, and (ii) warrants (the Series A Warrants to acquire up to an aggregate of 6,896,553 shares of Common Stock (the Series A Warrant Shares ).

On August 19, 2024, the Company entered into an Amendment Agreement (the Series A Amendment with the Required Holders (as defined in the Certificate of Designations). Pursuant to the Series A Amendment, the Required Holders agreed that (A) the unpaid and accrued dividends on the Series A Preferred Stock due July 1, 2024 (the July Delinquent Dividend Amount ), shall be payable, at the option of the Company, in (i) cash and/or (ii) shares of Common Stock, at a price per share of Common Stock equal to the lower of (x) 1.00 and (y) the Dividend Conversion Price (as defined in the Certificate of Designations), using July 1, 2024, as the applicable date of determination in accordance with the Certificate of Designations (B) the dividends due on October 1, 2024 (the October Dividend Amount and, together with the July Delinquent Dividend Amount, the Delinquent Dividend Amounts ), shall be payable in shares of Common Stock based on a per share price of Common Stock equal to 80 of the arithmetic average of the three (3) lowest closing sale prices of the Common Stock during the month of September 2024 and (C) such Delinquent Dividend Amounts and any Dividend Balance Shares (as defined in the Certificate of Designations), with respect thereto, if applicable, shall be delivered on October 1, 2024 and the Pre-Dividend Shares (as defined in the Certificate of Designations) with respect to each of the July Delinquent Dividend Amount and the October Dividend Amount, if applicable, shall be delivered to the Series A Investors on or prior to the twenty-first (21st) trading day prior to October 1, 2024.
