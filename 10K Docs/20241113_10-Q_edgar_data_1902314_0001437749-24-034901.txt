Non-GAAP Financial Measures 
 
 To supplement our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements presented on a GAAP basis, the Company presents its financial condition and results of operations in the way it believes will be most meaningful and representative of its business results. Some of the measurements the Company uses are "Non-GAAP financial measures" under SEC rules and regulations. The non-GAAP financial measures the Company presents are listed below and may not be comparable to similarly-named measures reported by other companies. The presentation of this additional information is not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for net earnings or diluted earnings per share prepared in accordance with GAAP. 
 
 The Company uses the following operating performance measure because the Company believes it provides both management and investors with a more complete understanding of the underlying operational results and trends and our marketplace performance as well as a more accurate view of the Company's ability to generate cash profits: 
 
 Adjusted Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation, and Amortization ("EBITDA") is derived by excluding the items set forth below from Income before income taxes. Excluded items include the following:

Capital Resources 
 
 We believe that existing cash and cash equivalents, marketable securities and cash generated from operations will provide sufficient liquidity to meet our ongoing working capital and capital expenditure requirements for the next 12 months from the date of this filing. At various times throughout the year and as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, some deposits held at financial institutions were in excess of federally insured limits. The Company has not experienced any losses related to these balances. 
 
 Our Board of Directors has adhered to a practice of not paying cash dividends. This policy takes into account our long-term growth objectives, including our anticipated investments for organic growth, potential acquisitions and stockholders' desire for capital appreciation of their holdings. 
 
 Revolving Line of Credit 
 
 On June 15, 2022, the Company entered into a loan agreement (the Loan Agreement for a revolving line of credit with Fifth Third Bank, National Association ("Fifth Third Bank"), for up to 5,000 bearing interest at the Secured Overnight Financing Rate ("SOFR") plus a margin of 2.25 , with a SOFR floor of 0.00 . The Loan Agreement has a maturity date of June 15, 2025 and contains various affirmative and negative covenants that are customary for lines of credit and transactions of this type, including limitations on the incurrence of debt and liabilities, as well as financial reporting requirements. The Loan Agreement also imposes certain financial covenants based on Debt Service Coverage Ratio, Current Ratio, and the Ratio of Total Liabilities to Total Net Worth (as such terms are defined in the Loan Agreement). All loans pursuant to the Loan Agreement are secured by a continuing and unconditional first priority security interest in and to any and all property of the Company. 
 
 As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, there were no outstanding borrowings under the revolving line of credit with Fifth Third Bank. 
 
 Critical Accounting Estimates 
 
 The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to adopt accounting policies related to estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period, as well as the related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements. On an ongoing basis, management evaluates its accounting policies, estimates and judgments, including those related to income taxes and inventories. Management bases its estimates and judgments on historical experience and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from these estimates. 
 
 There have been no material changes to the critical accounting estimates disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K, as filed with the SEC on March 25, 2024.

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 
 We maintain disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act") is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to us, including our Principal Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. 
 
 As required by Rules 13a-15(b) and 15d-15(b) of the Exchange Act, an evaluation as of September 30, 2024 was conducted under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Principal Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act). Based on this evaluation, our Principal Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures, as of September 30, 2024, were effective.
