acres or square kilometers. This Exploration License 434 is valid for three years until
September 13, 2026 with four potential 1-year extensions for a total of until September 13, 2030. This NMVL 434 effectively
supersedes our previous NML 428. 

On February 21, 2024, members of the Supervisory Committee visited
our rig site. During this visit, they interacted with staff from Zion Oil Gas, our consultants and potential service providers.
Some of these interactions occurred at Kibbutz Sde Eliyahu, while others were conducted through video conferencing with participants from
the United States, Europe and the Middle East. Following these discussions, the Committee officially accepted our work plan for the MJ-01
re-completion project. This acceptance allowed us to sign agreements and secure mobilization dates with our service providers to commence
and complete the project.

feet) of cement plugs and re-conditioning
the wellbore to allow unhindered access to the selected zones for testing. 

After six years of inactivity in a well over three miles deep, the
MJ-01 wellbore presents a challenging environment. The crew appears to have experienced elastic and partial collapse of the casing in
some areas. This led to the bottom hole assembly BHA becoming stuck over 4,000 meters from surface. Attempts to overpull
the BHA were unsuccessful, and the crew completed a backoff operation which left over 500 meters of the BHA remaining downhole. This is
not an uncommon occurrence with oil and gas drilling operations, but we do need to recover the fish to resume operations. The crew was
unsuccessful in retrieving the remaining BHA with the tools that were on location and will require specialized tools and techniques to
recover the entire fish. The specialized tools we need are not in Israel, but have been sourced, but not approved for mobilization
due to the active conflict in Israel. 

Another
delay arose out of the logistical challenges we face. The ongoing conflict in the region has impacted shipping routes, the timely arrival
of necessary equipment, and created travel difficulties for our rig crews. Our operations require specialized rig crews who are not available
in Israel. 

An even further delay has been created by many of our rig crew members
reaching the limit of their work visas. This requires us to reset visas, which is not a simple process, and it adds another layer of delay
and complexity. Moreover, the recent changes to visa eligibility have further complicated the process, as Israel, in just the last few
months, has changed their 90-day visa renewals from resetting at the end of the year to resetting after six months after expiration. We
are working with the Ministry of Interior on this issue. As a side note, the crew had to enter Israel under 90 day visas and not six month
or 12 month visas in order to comply with the labor law requirements in place at the time the operation commenced. 

In
light of the combination of downhole, logistical, and crew challenges, as well as holidays, and the one-year remembrance of October 7,
we have temporarily paused active operations. This is a necessary step to ensure the safety of our personnel and to ensure proper engineering
and tools are brought to location to avoid lengthy delays waiting for additional tools should any be required once the job resumes. We
anticipate that once we have the necessary tools and renewed visas for our crews, we can resume operations in Q4 2024 or Q1 2025. This
is, of course, subject to the realities of the present geopolitical environment. The conflict in Israel, while not directly impacting
our operations on a daily basis, creates uncertainties that could affect our schedule at any time. 

While
our MJ-01 re-completion project has faced a multitude of hurdles, including an active conflict, downhole issues and logistical challenges,
we continue to move forward each time a safe opportunity permits continuation of operations. However, we will only move forward in coordination
with Israeli authorities. We are actively monitoring the port situation to import the items needed to complete the current work program.
We remain optimistic about making significant progress in the coming months.

one year from the date the financials were issued. 

To
carry out planned operations, the Company must raise additional funds through additional equity and/or debt issuances or through profitable
operations. There can be no assurance that this capital or positive operational income will be available to the Company, and if it is
not, the Company may be forced to curtail or cease exploration and development activities. The consolidated condensed financial statements

 Zion Drilling, Inc. and Zion Drilling Services, Inc. described below. 

Current Exploration and Operation Efforts 

Zion Oil and Gas, Inc., a
Delaware corporation, is an oil and gas exploration company with a history of 24 years of oil and gas exploration in Israel. We were incorporated
in Florida on April 6, 2000 and reincorporated in Delaware on July 9, 2003. We completed our initial public offering in January 2007.
Our common stock, par value 0.01 per share (the Common Stock currently trades on the OTCQB marketplace of OTC Markets,
Inc. under the symbol ZNOG and our Common Stock warrant under the symbol ZNOGW. On January 24, 2020, Zion
incorporated a wholly owned subsidiary, Zion Drilling, Inc., a Delaware corporation, for the purpose of owning a drilling rig, related
equipment and spare parts, and on January 31, 2020, Zion incorporated another wholly owned subsidiary, Zion Drilling Services, Inc., a
Delaware corporation, to act as the contractor providing such drilling services. When Zion is not using the rig for its own exploration
activities, Zion Drilling Services may contract with other operators in Israel to provide drilling services at market rates then in effect. 

On September 14, 2023, the
Israel Ministry of Energy approved a new Megiddo Valleys License 434 NMVL 434 ), allowing for oil and gas exploration on
approximately 75,000 acres or 302 square kilometers. This Exploration License 434 is valid for three years until September 13, 2026 with
four potential 1-year extensions for a total of seven years until September 13, 2030. This NMVL 434 effectively supersedes our previous
NML 428. 

We continue our exploration
focus here based on our studies as it appears to possess the key geologic ingredients of an active petroleum system with significant exploration
potential. As previously announced, Zion is deploying new technologies and stimulation methods for its current re-entry into the MJ-01
well with the objective of potentially unlocking hydrocarbon flows in several identified key zones. 

On February 21, 2024, members of the Supervisory Committee visited
our rig site. During this visit, they interacted with staff from Zion Oil Gas, our consultants and potential service providers.
Some of these interactions occurred at Kibbutz Sde Eliyahu, while others were conducted through video conferencing with participants from
the United States, Europe and the Middle East. Following these discussions, the Committee officially accepted our work plan for the MJ-01
re-completion project. This acceptance allowed us to sign agreements and secure mobilization dates with our service providers to commence
and complete the project. 

The initial phase of our recompletion
project consisted of a category three inspection of the drilling rig, rigging down from MJ-02 and moving and rigging up over the MJ-01
well. 

Stage two of the operation
involved drilling out both the steel plugs along with 625 meters (about 2,050 feet) of cement plugs and re-conditioning the wellbore to
allow unhindered access to the selected zones for testing. 

After six years of inactivity in a well over three miles deep, the
MJ-01 wellbore presents a challenging environment. The crew appears to have experienced elastic and partial collapse of the casing in
some areas. This led to the bottom hole assembly BHA becoming stuck over 4,000 meters from surface. Attempts to overpull
the BHA were unsuccessful, and the crew completed a backoff operation which left over 500 meters of the BHA remaining downhole. This is
not an uncommon occurrence with oil and gas drilling operations, but we do need to recover the fish to resume operations. The crew was
unsuccessful in retrieving the remaining BHA with the tools that were on location and will require specialized tools and techniques to
recover the entire fish. The specialized tools we need are not in Israel, but have been sourced, but not approved
for mobilization due to the active conflict in Israel. 

Another delay arose out of
the logistical challenges we face. The ongoing conflict in the region has impacted shipping routes, the timely arrival of necessary equipment,
and created travel difficulties for our rig crews. Our operations require specialized rig crews who are not available in Israel. 

An even further delay has been created by many of our rig crew members
reaching the limit of their work visas. This requires us to reset visas, which is not a simple process, and it adds another layer of delay
and complexity. Moreover, the recent changes to visa eligibility have further complicated the process, as Israel, in just the last few
months, has changed their 90-day visa renewals from resetting at the end of the year to resetting after six months after expiration. We
are working with the Ministry of Interior on this issue. As a side note, the crew had to enter Israel under 90 day visas and not six month
or 12 month visas in order to comply with the labor law requirements in place at the time the operation commenced. 

39 

In light of the combination
of downhole, logistical, and crew challenges, as well as holidays, and the one-year remembrance of October 7, we have temporarily paused
active operations. This is a necessary step to ensure the safety of our personnel and to ensure proper engineering and tools are brought
to location to avoid lengthy delays waiting for additional tools should any be required once the job resumes. We anticipate that once
we have the necessary tools and renewed visas for our crews, we can resume operations in Q4 2024 or Q1 2025. This is, of course, subject
to the realities of the present geopolitical environment. The conflict in Israel, while not directly impacting our operations on a daily
basis, creates uncertainties that could affect our schedule at any time. 

While our MJ-01 re-completion
project has faced a multitude of hurdles, including an active conflict, downhole issues and logistical challenges, we continue to move
forward each time a safe opportunity permits continuation of operations. However, we will only move forward in coordination with Israeli
authorities. We are actively monitoring the port situation to import the items needed to complete the current work program. We remain
optimistic about making significant progress in the coming months.

Onshore Licensing, Oil and Gas Exploration
and Environmental Guidelines 

The Company is engaged in
oil and gas exploration and production and may become subject to certain liabilities as they relate to environmental cleanup of well sites
or other environmental restoration procedures and other obligations as they relate to the drilling of oil and gas wells or the operation
thereof. Various guidelines have been published in Israel by the State of Israel s Petroleum Commissioner, the Energy Ministry,
and the Environmental Ministry in recent years as it pertains to oil and gas activities. Mention of these guidelines was included in previous
Zion Oil Gas filings. 

We acknowledge that these
new regulations are likely to increase the expenditures associated with obtaining new exploration rights and drilling new wells. The Company
expects that additional financial burdens could occur as a result of the Ministry requiring cash reserves that could otherwise be used
for operational purposes. 

Capital Resources Highlights 

We need to raise significant
funds to finance the continued exploration efforts and maintain orderly operations. To date, we have funded our operations through the
issuance of our securities and convertible debt. We will need to continue to raise funds through the issuance of equity and/or debt securities
(or securities convertible into or exchangeable for equity securities). No assurance can be provided that we will be successful in raising
the needed capital on terms favorable to us (or at all). 

The Dividend Reinvestment and Stock Purchase
Plan 

On March 13, 2014, Zion filed
a registration statement on Form S-3 that was part of a replacement registration statement that was filed with the SEC using a shelf 
registration process. The registration statement was declared effective by the SEC on March 31, 2014. On February 23, 2017, the Company
filed a Form S-3 with the SEC (Registration No. 333-216191) as a replacement for the Form S-3 (Registration No. 333-193336), for which
the three-year period ended March 31, 2017, along with the base Prospectus and Supplemental Prospectus. The Form S-3, as amended, and
the new base Prospectus became effective on March 10, 2017, along with the Prospectus Supplement that was filed and became effective on
March 10, 2017. The Prospectus Supplement under Registration No. 333-216191 describes the terms of the DSPP and replaces the prior Prospectus
Supplement, as amended, under the prior Registration No. 333-193336. 

On March 27, 2014, we launched
our Dividend Reinvestment and Stock Purchase Plan (the DSPP pursuant to which stockholders and interested investors can
purchase shares of the Company s Common Stock as well as units of the Company s securities directly from the Company. The
terms of the DSPP are described in the Prospectus Supplement originally filed on March 31, 2014 (the Original Prospectus Supplement with the Securities and Exchange Commission SEC under the Company s effective registration Statement on Form S-3,
as thereafter amended. 

Please see Footnote 3D Dividend
Reinvestment and Stock Purchase Plan DSPP )), which is a part of this Form 10-Q filing, for details about specific stock
purchase and unit programs, dates, and filings during the years 2023 and 2024. 

For the three and nine months
ended September 30, 2024, approximately 3,692,000 and 12,160,000 were raised under the DSPP program, respectively. The 3,692,000 and
 12,160,000 figures were reduced by 536,000 and 2,299,000, respectively, in equity issuance costs to an outside party resulting in net
cash provided of 3,156,000 and 9,861,000, respectively. 

For the three and nine months
ended September 30, 2023, approximately 1,805,000, and 4,358,000 were raised under the DSPP program, respectively. The 4,358,000 figure
is net of 610,000 in equity issuance costs to an outside party.

Principal Components of our Cost Structure 

Our operating and other expenses
primarily consist of the following: 

Impairment of Unproved Oil and Gas Properties: Impairment expense is recognized if a determination is made that a well will not be commercially productive. The amounts include amounts paid in respect of the drilling operations as well as geological and geophysical costs and various amounts that were paid to Israeli regulatory authorities. 

General and Administrative Expenses: Overhead, including payroll and benefits for our corporate staff, costs of managing our exploratory operations, audit and other professional fees, and legal compliance is included in general and administrative expenses. General and administrative expenses also include non-cash stock-based compensation expense, investor relations related expenses, lease and insurance and related expenses. 

Depreciation, Depletion, Amortization and Accretion: The systematic expensing of the capital costs incurred to explore for natural gas and oil represents a principal component of our cost structure. As a full cost company, we capitalize all costs associated with our exploration, and apportion these costs to each unit of production, if any, through depreciation, depletion and amortization expense. As we have yet to have production, the costs of abandoned wells are written off immediately versus being included in this amortization pool. 

Going Concern Basis 

Since we have limited capital
resources, no revenue to date and a loss from operations, our consolidated condensed financial statements have been prepared on a going
concern basis, which contemplates realization of assets and liquidation of liabilities in the ordinary course of business. The appropriateness
of using the going concern basis is dependent upon our ability to obtain additional financing or equity capital and, ultimately, to achieve
profitable operations. Therefore, there is substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern for one year from the date
the financials were issued. The consolidated condensed financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the
outcome of this uncertainty. 

Israel-Hamas War 

On October 7, 2023, Hamas, a militant terrorist organization in Gaza,
infiltrated southern Israel, killing and injuring at least one thousand Israeli citizens. Roughly 250 Israeli hostages were then taken
back to Gaza. This unprovoked attack led the nation of Israel to declare war on Hamas approximately one week later. As of the date of
this report, Israel remains at war and there are daily battles inside the Gaza strip. Israel s stated goals are to completely dismantle
the terror infrastructure of Gaza, including its extensive tunnel network and to bring back safely all of the hostages. 

Israel-Hezbollah War and Wider Hostilities Towards Israel 

Immediately after the October 7, 2023 Hamas attack on Israel, the terrorist
organization Hezbollah in Lebanon began launching daily rockets into Israel. Over the course of the next several months, both Hezbollah
and Israel traded rocket fire into the other country, but without engaging in a full war. During Q3 2024, both sides increased the frequency
and number of missiles fired. In September 2024, Israel began a ground invasion into Lebanon and both sides are war today. As a result
of the wars in Israel, most airlines are not flying in and out of Israel, and the ports in Haifa and Ashdod remain closed. 

Russia Ukraine War 

Due to Russia s invasion of Ukraine, which began in February
2022, and the resulting sanctions and other actions against Russia and Belarus, there has been uncertainty and disruption in the global
economy. Although the Russian war against Ukraine did not have a material adverse impact on the Company s financial results for
the year ended December 31, 2023, at this time the Company is unable to fully assess the aggregate impact the Russian war against Ukraine
will have on its business due to various uncertainties, which include, but are not limited to, the duration of the war, the war s
effect on the global economy, future energy pricing, its impact to the businesses of the Company and actions that may be taken by governmental
authorities related to the war. 

Critical Accounting Policies 

Management s discussion
and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated condensed financial statements, which have
been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The preparation of these consolidated
condensed financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities
and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated condensed financial statements and the reported
amounts of revenues and expense during the reporting period. 

We have identified the accounting
principles which we believe are most critical to the reported financial status by considering accounting policies that involve the most
complex of subjective decisions or assessment. 

43 

Impairment of Oil and Gas Properties 

We follow the full-cost method
of accounting for oil and gas properties. Accordingly, all costs associated with acquisition, exploration and development of oil and gas
reserves, including directly related overhead costs, are capitalized. 

All capitalized costs of oil
and gas properties, including the estimated future costs to develop proved reserves, are amortized on the unit-of-production method using
estimates of proved reserves. Investments in unproved properties and major development projects are not amortized until proved reserves
associated with the projects can be determined or until impairment occurs. If the results of an assessment indicate that the properties
are impaired, the amount of the impairment is included in income from continuing operations before income taxes, and the adjusted carrying
amount of the unproved properties is amortized on the unit-of-production method. 

Our oil and gas properties
represent an investment in unproved properties. These costs are excluded from the amortized cost pool until proved reserves are found
or until it is determined that the costs are impaired. All costs excluded are reviewed at least quarterly to determine if impairment has
occurred. The amount of any impairment is charged to expense since a reserve base has not yet been established. A further impairment requiring
a charge to expense may be indicated through evaluation of drilling results, relinquishing drilling rights or other information. 

Abandonment of properties
is accounted for as adjustments to capitalized costs. The net capitalized costs are subject to a ceiling test which limits
such costs to the aggregate of the estimated present value of future net revenues from proved reserves discounted at ten percent based
on current economic and operating conditions, plus the lower of cost or fair market value of unproved properties. The recoverability of
amounts capitalized for oil and gas properties is dependent upon the identification of economically recoverable reserves, together with
obtaining the necessary financing to exploit such reserves and the achievement of profitable operations. 

During the three months ended
September 30, 2024, and 2023, respectively, the Company recorded nil and 36,000 in post-impairment charges. 

During the nine months ended
September 30, 2024, and 2023, respectively, the Company recorded nil and 129,000 post-impairment charges. 

The total net book value of
our unproved oil and gas properties under the full cost method is 21,033,000 and 16,637,000 at September 30, 2024 and at December 31,
2023, respectively. 

Asset Retirement Obligation 

We record a liability for
asset retirement obligation at fair value in the period in which it is incurred and a corresponding increase in the carrying amount of
the related long-lived assets. 

Fair Value Considerations 

We follow ASC 820, Fair
Value Measurements and Disclosures, as amended by Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Financial Staff Position (FSP) No.
157 and related guidance. Those provisions relate to the Company s financial assets and liabilities carried at fair value and the
fair value disclosures related to financial assets and liabilities. ASC 820 defines fair value, expands related disclosure requirements,
and specifies a hierarchy of valuation techniques based on the nature of the inputs used to develop the fair value measures. Fair value
is defined as the price that would be received from the sale of an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between
market participants at the measurement date, assuming the transaction occurs in the principal or most advantageous market for that asset
or liability. 

There are three levels of
inputs to fair value measurements - Level 1, meaning the use of quoted prices for identical instruments in active markets; Level 2, meaning
the use of quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets or quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that
are not active or are directly or indirectly observable; and Level 3, meaning the use of unobservable inputs. We use Level 1 inputs for
fair value measurements whenever there is an active market, with actual quotes, market prices, and observable inputs on the measurement
date. We use Level 2 inputs for fair value measurements whenever there are quoted prices for similar securities in an active market or
quoted prices for identical securities in an inactive market. We use observable market data whenever available.

Operating costs and expenses.
 Operating costs and expenses for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 were 1,775,000 and 5,632,000, respectively,
compared to 1,747,000 and 6,213,000, respectively, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023. Operating costs and expenses
for the three months ended September 30, 2024 were 28,000 (1.6 higher compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. Operating
costs for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 were 581,000 (9.4 lower compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 

General and administrative
expenses. General and administrative expenses G A expenses for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 were 1,143,000 and 3,519,000, respectively, compared to 1,332,000 and 4,106,000,
respectively, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023. This expense grouping includes salaries, benefits, stock option
expenses and professional fees. G A expenses were lower by 189,000, or 14.2 , during the most recent quarter versus the prior year
primarily due to lower salaries expenses and expenses associated with stock option grants. G A expenses were lower by 587,000, or
14.3 , during the first nine months of 2024 as compared to the nine months of 2023, primarily due to lower expenses associated with stock
option grants. 

Other expense. Other
expenses during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 were 632,000 and 2,113,000, respectively, compared to 379,000 and
 1,978,000, respectively, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023. Other general and administrative expenses are comprised
of non-compensation and non-professional expenses incurred. Other expenses increased by 253,000, or about 66.8 , and by 135,000, or
about 6.8 , for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively. Zion incurred lower annual meeting and insurance premium
expenses, but this was partially offset by higher marketing and investor relations expenses. 

Impairment of unproved
oil and gas properties. Impairment of unproved oil and gas properties expenses during the three and nine months ended September 30,
2024 were nil and nil compared to 36,000 and 129,000 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023. The expenses recorded
in 2023 are post impairment charges to the impairment recorded during 2023 related to the MJ-2 well. 

Other expense (income),

to 4,000) and 3,000, respectively, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023. The expenses in this category are comprised
of foreign currency exchange costs, primarily the New Israeli Shekel (NIS) to the US dollar, and the financial expenses/income. 

Net Loss . Net loss
for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 were 1,791,000 and 5,617,000 compared to 1,743,000 and 6,216,000 for the three
and nine months ended September 30, 2023. 

Liquidity and Capital Resources 

Liquidity is a measure of
a company s ability to meet potential cash requirements. As discussed above, we have historically met our capital requirements through
the issuance of common stock as well as proceeds from the exercise of warrants and options to purchase common shares. As disclosed on
our Balance Sheet, the company has 1,200,000,000 shares of authorized common stock and 880,562,128 shares issued as of September 30, 2024.
We are considering increasing our authorized shares during the next proxy season in 2025. 

Our ability to continue as
a going concern is dependent upon obtaining the necessary financing to complete further exploration and development activities and generate
profitable operations from our oil and natural gas interests in the future. Our current operations are dependent upon the adequacy of
our current assets to meet our current expenditure requirements and the accuracy of management s estimates of those requirements.
Should those estimates be materially incorrect, our ability to continue as a going concern will be impaired. Our financial statements
for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 have been prepared on a going concern basis, which contemplates the realization of assets
and the settlement of liabilities and commitments in the normal course of business. We have incurred a history of operating losses and
negative cash flows from operations. Therefore, there is substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern for one year
from the date the financials were issued. 

45 

At September 30, 2024, we
had approximately 779,000 in cash and cash equivalents compared to 615,000 at December 31, 2023, which does not include any restricted
funds. Our working capital (current assets minus current liabilities) was 337,000 at September 30, 2024 and 349,000) at December 31,
2023. 

As of September 30, 2024,
we provided bank guarantees to various governmental bodies (approximately 971,000) and others (approximately 91,000) in respect of our
drilling operation in the aggregate amount of approximately 1,062,000. The (cash) funds backing these guarantees are held in restricted
interest-bearing accounts in Israel and are reported on the Company s balance sheets as fixed short-term bank deposits restricted. 

During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, cash used in operating
activities totaled 5,102,000. Cash provided by financing activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 9,703,000 and
is primarily attributable to proceeds received from the Dividend Reinvestment and Stock Purchase Plan (the DSPP or the Plan ).
Net cash used in investing activities such as unproved oil and gas properties, equipment and spare parts was 4,389,000 for the nine months
ended September 30, 2024. 

During the nine months ended
September 30, 2023, cash used in operating activities totaled 3,909,000. Cash provided by financing activities during the nine months
ended September 30, 2023 was 4,370,000 and is primarily attributable to proceeds received from the Dividend Reinvestment and Stock Purchase
Plan (the DSPP or the Plan ). Net cash used in investing activities such as unproved oil and gas properties,
equipment and spare parts was 2,045,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 

Accounting standards require
management to evaluate our ability to continue as a going concern for a period of one year subsequent to the date of the filing of this
Form 10-Q. We expect to incur additional significant expenditures to further our exploration and development programs. While we raised
approximately 1,319,000 during the period October 1, 2024 through November 6, 2024, we will need to raise additional funds in order to continue
our exploration and development activities in our license area. Additionally, we estimate that, when we are not actively drilling a well,
our expenditures are approximately 600,000 per month excluding exploratory operational activities. However, when we are actively drilling
a well, we estimate an additional minimum expenditure of approximately 2,500,000 per month. The above estimates are subject to change.
Subject to the qualifications specified below, management believes that our existing cash balance, coupled with anticipated proceeds under
the DSPP, will be sufficient to finance our plan of operations through December 2024. 

During March 2020, a global
pandemic was declared by the World Health Organization related to the rapidly growing outbreak of a novel strain of coronavirus COVID-19 ).
The pandemic significantly impacted the economic conditions in the United States and Israel, as federal, state and local governments reacted
to the public health crisis, creating significant uncertainties in the United States, Israel and world economies. In the interest of public
health and safety, jurisdictions (international, national, state and local) where we have operations, restricted travel and required workforces
to work from home. However, as of the date of this report, most of our employees are working at our physical offices, but have the ability
to work from home as needed. 

Similar uncertainties are posed by the Israel-Hamas war, as well as
the Israel-Hezbollah war. The duration of both wars and its impact on the region and world is not fully known at this point in time. As
stated previously in this report, our operations are paused, and our rig crew workers are safely out of Israel and at home. 

No assurance can be provided
that we will be able to raise the needed operating capital. 

Even if we raise the needed
funds, there are factors that can nevertheless adversely impact our ability to fund our operating needs, including (without limitation),
the potential impact of the Israel-Hamas war, the Israel-Hezbollah war, the potential actions of other hostile parties in the region,
unexpected or unforeseen cost overruns in planned non-drilling exploratory work in existing license areas, the costs associated with extended
delays in undertaking the required exploratory work, and plugging and abandonment activities which is typical of what we have experienced
in the past. 

The financial information
contained in these consolidated condensed financial statements has been prepared on a basis that assumes that we will continue as a going
concern for one year from the date the financials were issued, which contemplates the realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities
and commitments in the normal course of business. This financial information and these consolidated condensed financial statements do
not include any adjustments that may result from the outcome of this uncertainty. 

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 

We do not currently use any
off-balance sheet arrangements to enhance our liquidity or capital resource position, or for any other purpose. 

Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements 

The Company does not believe
that the adoption of any recently issued accounting pronouncements in 2024 had a significant impact on our financial position, results
of operations, or cash flow. 

46 

ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES
ABOUT MARKET RISK 

Market risk is a broad term
for the risk of economic loss due to adverse changes in the fair value of a financial instrument. These changes may be the result of various
factors, including interest rates, foreign exchange rates, commodity prices and/or equity prices. In the normal course of doing business,
we are exposed to the risks associated with foreign currency exchange rates and changes in interest rates. 

Foreign Currency Exchange
Rate Risks. A portion of our expenses, primarily labor expenses and certain supplier contracts, are denominated in New Israeli Shekels NIS ). As a result, we have significant exposure to the risk of fluctuating exchange rates with the U.S. Dollar USD ),
our primary reporting currency. During the period January 1, 2024 through September 30, 2024, the USD has fluctuated by approximately
2.3 against the NIS (the USD strengthened relative to the NIS). Also, during the period January 1, 2023 through December 31, 2023, the
USD fluctuated by approximately 3.1 against the NIS (the USD strengthened relative to the NIS). Continued strengthening of the US dollar
against the NIS will result in lower operating costs from NIS denominated expenses. To date, we have not hedged any of our currency exchange
rate risks, but we may do so in the future. 

Interest Rate Risk. Our
exposure to market risk relates to our cash and investments. We maintain an investment portfolio of short-term bank deposits and money
market funds. The securities in our investment portfolio are not leveraged, and are, due to their very short-term nature, subject to minimal
interest rate risk. We currently do not hedge interest rate exposure. Because of the short-term maturities of our investments, we do not
believe that a change in market interest rates would have a significant negative impact on the value of our investment portfolio except
for reduced income in a low interest rate environment. At September 30, 2024 we had cash, cash equivalents and short-term and long-term
bank deposits of approximately 1,847,000. The weighted average annual interest rate related to our cash and cash equivalents for the
three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, exclusive of funds at US banks that earn no interest, was approximately 2.8 and 2.9 
respectively. 

The primary objective of our
investment activities is to preserve principal while at the same time maximizing yields without significantly increasing risk. To achieve
this objective, we invest our excess cash in short-term bank deposits and money market funds that may invest in high quality debt instruments. 

ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 

We maintain disclosure controls
and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports that we file or submit under the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934, is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time period specified in the SEC s rules and forms.
As of September 30, 2024, our chief executive officer and our chief financial officer conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of
our disclosure controls and procedures. Based on this evaluation, our chief executive officer and our chief financial officer concluded
that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of September 30, 2024. 

Changes in Internal Control over Financial
Reporting 

There were no changes in internal
controls over financial reporting that occurred during the quarter ended September 30, 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably
likely to materially affect, our internal controls over financial reporting. 

47 

PART II OTHER INFORMATION 

ITEM 1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

may be subject to routine litigation, claims or disputes in the ordinary course of business. The Company defends itself vigorously in
all such matters. However, we cannot predict the outcome or effect of any of the potential litigation, claims or disputes. 

The Company is not subject
to any litigation at the present time. 

ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS 

During the quarter ended September 30, 2024, with the exception of
the Israel-Hezbollah war, there were no material changes to the risk factors previously reported in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for
the year ended December 31, 2023.
