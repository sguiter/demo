CAUTIONARY STATEMENT REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS 
 This report contains forward-looking statements that involve substantial risks and uncertainties. Such statements involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors and undue reliance should not be placed thereon. These forward-looking statements are not historical facts, but rather are based on current expectations, estimates and projections about Blue Owl Capital Corporation II (the Company, we or our ), our current and prospective portfolio investments, our industry, our beliefs and opinions, and our assumptions. Words such as anticipates, expects, intends, plans, will, may, continue, believes, seeks, estimates, would, could, should, targets, projects, outlook, potential, predicts and variations of these words and similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements. These statements are not guarantees of future performance and are subject to risks, uncertainties and other factors, some of which are beyond our control and difficult to predict and could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or forecasted in the forward-looking statements, including without limitation: 
 an economic downturn could impair our portfolio companies ability to continue to operate, which could lead to the loss of some or all of our investments in such portfolio companies; 
 an economic downturn could disproportionately impact the companies that we intend to target for investment, potentially causing us to experience a decrease in investment opportunities and diminished demand for capital from these companies; 
 the impact of elevated interest and inflation rates, ongoing supply chain and labor market disruptions, including those as a result of strikes, work stoppages or accidents, instability in the U.S. and international banking systems, uncertainties related to the U.S. presidential election, and the risk of recession or a shutdown of government services could impact our business prospects and the prospects of our portfolio companies; 
 an economic downturn could also impact availability and pricing of our financing and our ability to access the debt and equity capital markets; 
 a contraction of available credit and/or an inability to access the equity markets could impair our lending and investment activities; 
 changes in base interest rates and significant market volatility on our business and our portfolio companies (including our business prospects and the prospects of our portfolio companies including the ability to achieve our and their business objectives), our industry and the global economy including as a result of ongoing supply chain disruptions; 
 interest rate volatility could adversely affect our results, particularly because we use leverage as part of our investment strategy; 
 currency fluctuations could adversely affect the results of our investments in foreign companies, particularly to the extent that we receive payments denominated in foreign currency rather than U.S. dollars; 
 our future operating results; 
 our contractual arrangements and relationships with third parties; 
 the ability of our portfolio companies to achieve their objectives; 
 competition with other entities and our affiliates for investment opportunities; 
 risks related to the uncertainty of the value of our portfolio investments, particularly those having no liquid trading market; 
 the use of borrowed money to finance a portion of our investments as well as any estimates regarding potential use of leverage; 
 the adequacy of our financing sources and working capital; 
 the loss of key personnel; 
 the timing of cash flows, if any, from the operations of our portfolio companies; 
 the ability of Blue Owl Credit Advisors LLC the Adviser or our Adviser to locate suitable investments for us and to monitor and administer our investments; 
 the ability of the Adviser to attract and retain highly talented professionals; 
 our ability to qualify for and maintain our tax treatment as a regulated investment company RIC under Subchapter M of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the Code ), and as a business development company BDC under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the 1940 Act 
 the impact that environmental, social and governance matters could have on our brand and reputation and our portfolio companies; 
 the effect of legal, tax and regulatory changes; 
 the impact of information technology system failures, data security breaches, data privacy compliance, network disruptions, and cybersecurity attacks, and the increasing use of artificial intelligence and machine learning technology; 
 the impact of geo-political conditions, including revolution, insurgency, terrorism or war, including those arising out of the ongoing war between Russia and Ukraine and the escalated conflict in the Middle-East, including the Israel-Hamas conflict, and general uncertainty surrounding the financial and political stability of the United States, the United Kingdom, the European Union and China, on financial market volatility, global economic markets, and various markets for commodities globally such as oil and natural gas; and 
 other risks, uncertainties and other factors previously identified in the reports and other documents we have filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission SEC ). 
 Although we believe that the assumptions on which these forward-looking statements are based are reasonable, any of those assumptions could prove to be inaccurate, and as a result, the forward-looking statements based on those assumptions also could be 
 1 

inaccurate. In light of these and other uncertainties, the inclusion of a projection or forward-looking statement in this report should not be regarded as a representation by us that our plans and objectives will be achieved. These forward-looking statements apply only as of the date of this report. Moreover, we assume no duty and do not undertake to update the forward-looking statements. Because we are an investment company, the forward-looking statements and projections contained in this report are excluded from the safe harbor protection provided by Section 21E of the U.S. Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act ).

 and generally range in size between million and million, although the investment size will vary with the size of the Company s capital base. 
 The Company has elected to be regulated as a business development company BDC under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the 1940 Act ). In addition, for tax purposes, the Company is treated as a regulated investment company RIC under Subchapter M of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the Code ). Because the Company has elected to be regulated as a BDC and qualifies as a RIC under the Code, the Company s portfolio is subject to diversification and other requirements. 
 On February 28, 2017, the Company formed a wholly-owned subsidiary, OR Lending II LLC, a Delaware limited liability company, which holds a California finance lenders license. OR Lending II LLC makes loans to borrowers headquartered in California. From time to time the Company may form wholly-owned subsidiaries to facilitate the normal course of business. 
 Blue Owl Credit Advisors, LLC (the Adviser serves as the Company s investment adviser. The Adviser is registered with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission SEC as an investment adviser under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 (the Advisers Act ), an indirect affiliate of Blue Owl Capital Inc. Blue Owl (NYSE: OWL) and part of Blue Owl s Credit platform, which focuses on direct lending. Blue Owl consists of investment platforms: (1) Credit, which focuses on direct lending, (2) GP Strategic Capital, which focuses on acquiring equity stakes in and providing debt financing to institutional alternative asset managers and (3) Real Estate, which focuses on triple net lease real estate strategies and real estate credit. Subject to the overall supervision of the Company s board of directors (the Board ), the Adviser manages the day-to-day operations of, and provides investment advisory and management services to, the Company. 
 In April 2017, the Company commenced its continuous public offering, commenced operations and made its first portfolio company investment. The Company terminated its continuous public offering as of April 30, 2021. Prior to the termination of its continuous public offering, the Company issued shares of its common stock for gross proceeds of approximately billion, including seed capital contributed by the Adviser in September 2016 and approximately million in gross proceeds raised in the private placement from certain individuals and entities affiliated with the Adviser. 
 The Board expects to contemplate a liquidity event for the Company s shareholders three to after the completion of the continuous public offering. The Company considers the offering period to be complete as of the termination date of the most recent public equity offering as the Company did not conduct a public equity offering during the ensuing period. A liquidity event could include: (i) a listing of shares on a national securities exchange; (ii) a merger or another transaction approved by the Board in which shareholders will receive cash or shares of a publicly traded company; or (iii) a sale of all or substantially all of its assets either on a complete portfolio basis or individually followed by a liquidation to the Company and distribution of cash to its shareholders. A liquidity event may include a sale, merger or rollover transaction with one or more affiliated investment companies managed by the Adviser. A liquidity event involving a merger or sale of all or substantially all of the Company s assets would require the approval of its shareholders in accordance with the Company s charter. Certain types of liquidity events, such as one involving a listing of shares on a national securities exchange, would allow the Company to retain its investment portfolio intact. If the Company determines to list securities on a national securities exchange, the Company expects to, although is not required to, maintain its external management structure. If the Company has not consummated a liquidity event by the anniversary of the completion of the offering, the Board will consider (subject to any necessary shareholder approvals and applicable requirements of the 1940 Act) liquidating the Company and distributing cash to its shareholders, and dissolving the Company in an orderly manner. The Board, as part of its ongoing duties, will review and evaluate any potential liquidity events and options as they become available and their favorability given current market conditions; however, there is no assurance that a liquidity event will be completed at any particular time or at all.

 Unless earlier terminated as described below, the Administration Agreement will remain in effect for from the date it first became effective, and will remain in effect from year to year if approved annually by (1) the vote of the Board, or by the vote of a majority of its outstanding voting securities, and (2) the vote of a majority of the Company s directors who are not interested persons of the Company, of the Adviser or of any of their respective affiliates, as defined in the 1940 Act. The Administration Agreement may be terminated at any time, without the payment of any penalty, on days written notice, by the vote of a majority of the outstanding voting securities of the Company, or by the vote of the Board or by the Adviser. 
 No person who is an officer, director, or employee of the Adviser or its affiliates and who serves as a director of the Company receives any compensation from the Company for his or her services as a director. However, the Company reimburses the Adviser (or its affiliates) for an allocable portion of the compensation paid by the Adviser or its affiliates to the Company s Chief Compliance Officer, Chief Financial Officer and their respective staffs (based on the percentage of time those individuals devote, on an estimated basis, to the business and affairs of the Company). Directors who are not affiliated with the Adviser receive compensation for their services and reimbursement of expenses incurred to attend meetings. 
 Investment Advisory Agreement 
 The Investment Advisory Agreement became effective on May 18, 2021. Under the terms of the Investment Advisory Agreement, the Adviser is responsible for managing the Company s business and activities, including sourcing investment opportunities, conducting research, performing diligence on potential investments, structuring its investments, and monitoring its portfolio companies on an ongoing basis through a team of investment professionals. On May 6, 2024, the Board approved the continuation of the Investment Advisory Agreement. 
 Under the terms of the Investment Advisory Agreement, the Adviser is responsible for managing the Company s business and activities, including sourcing investment opportunities, conducting research, performing diligence on potential investments, structuring its investments, and monitoring its portfolio companies on an ongoing basis through a team of investment professionals. 
 The Adviser s services under the Investment Advisory Agreement are not exclusive, and it is free to furnish similar services to other entities so long as its services to the Company are not impaired. 
 Unless earlier terminated as described below, the Investment Advisory Agreement will remain in effect for from the date it first became effective, and will remain in effect from year-to-year if approved annually by a majority of the Board or by the holders of a majority of the Company s outstanding voting securities and, in each case, by a majority of independent directors. 
 The Investment Advisory Agreement will automatically terminate within the meaning of the 1940 Act and related SEC guidance and interpretations in the event of its assignment. In accordance with the 1940 Act, without payment of any penalty, the Company may terminate the Investment Advisory Agreement with the Adviser upon days written notice. The decision to terminate the agreement may be made by a majority of the Board or the shareholders holding a majority (as defined under the 1940 Act) of the outstanding shares of the Company s common stock or the Adviser. In addition, without payment of any penalty, the Adviser may generally

 Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited) Continued 

 days written notice and, in certain circumstances, the Adviser may only be able to terminate the Investment Advisory Agreement upon days written notice. 
 Under the terms of the Investment Advisory Agreement, the Company will pay the Adviser a base management fee and may also pay a performance based incentive fee. The cost of both the management fee and the incentive fee will ultimately be borne by the Company s shareholders. 
 The management fee is payable quarterly in arrears at an annual rate of of the average value of the Company s gross assets, excluding cash and cash-equivalents but including assets purchased with borrowed amounts at the end of the two most recently completed calendar quarters. The management fee for any partial quarter is appropriately prorated. The determination of gross assets reflects changes in the fair value of the Company s portfolio investments. The fair value of derivatives and swaps held in the Company s portfolio, which will not necessarily equal the notional value of such derivatives and swaps, is included in the calculation of gross assets. 
 For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company incurred management fees of approximately million and million, respectively. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, the Company incurred management fees of approximately million and million, respectively. 
 The incentive fee consists of components that are independent of each other, with the result that one component may be payable even if the other is not. A portion of the incentive fee will be based on the Company s pre-incentive fee net investment income and a portion will be based on the Company s capital gains. The portion of the incentive fee based on pre-incentive fee net investment income is determined and paid quarterly in arrears and equals (a) of the pre-incentive fee net investment income between quarterly preferred return, and , referred to as the upper level breakpoint, of adjusted capital, plus (b) of pre-incentive fee net investment income in excess of of adjusted capital. Adjusted capital is defined as cumulative proceeds generated from sales of the Company s common stock, including proceeds from the Company s distribution reinvestment plan, net of sales load (upfront selling commissions and upfront dealer manager fees) reduced for (i) distributions paid to the Company s shareholders that represent a return of capital on a tax basis and (ii) amounts paid for share repurchases pursuant to the Company s share repurchase program, if any, measured as of the end of the immediately preceding calendar quarter. The quarterly preferred return of and upper level breakpoint of are also adjusted for the actual number of days in each calendar quarter. 
 For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company incurred net investment income based incentive fees of million and million, respectively. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, the Company incurred net investment income based incentive fees of million and million, respectively. 
 The second component of the incentive fee, the capital gains incentive fee, is payable at the end of each calendar year in arrears, and equals of cumulative realized capital gains from inception through the end of each calendar year, less cumulative realized capital losses and unrealized capital depreciation on a cumulative basis from inception through the end of such calendar year, less the aggregate amount of any previously paid capital gains incentive fee for prior periods. In no event will the capital gains incentive fee payable pursuant to the Investment Advisory Agreement be in excess of the amount permitted by the Advisers Act, including Section 205 thereof. 
 While the Investment Advisory Agreement neither includes nor contemplates the inclusion of unrealized gains in the calculation of the capital gains incentive fee, as required by U.S. GAAP, the Company accrues capital gains incentive fees on unrealized gains. This accrual reflects the incentive fees that would be payable to the Adviser if the Company s entire investment portfolio was liquidated at its fair value as of the balance sheet date even though the Adviser is not entitled to an incentive fee with respect to unrealized gains unless and until such gains are actually realized. 
 For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the Company did t incur capital gains based incentive fees. 
 Under the terms of the Investment Advisory Agreement, the Adviser is entitled to receive up to of gross offering proceeds raised in the continuous public offering until all organization and offering costs paid by the Adviser or its affiliates have been recovered. The Company bears all other expenses of its operations and transactions including, without limitation, those relating to: expenses deemed to be organization and offering expenses for purposes of Financial Industry Regulatory Authority FINRA Conduct Rule 2310(a)(12) (exclusive of commissions, the dealer manager fee, any discounts and other similar expenses paid by investors at the time of sale of the Company s stock); the cost of corporate and organizational expenses relating to offerings of shares of common stock, subject to limitations included in the Investment Advisory Agreement; the cost of calculating the Company s net asset value, including the cost of any third-party valuation services; the cost of effecting any sales and repurchases of the common stock and other securities; fees and expenses payable under any dealer manager agreements, if any; debt service and other costs of borrowings or other financing arrangements; costs of hedging; expenses, including travel expense, incurred by the Adviser, or members of the Investment Team, or payable to third parties, performing due diligence on prospective portfolio companies and, if necessary, enforcing the Company s rights; escrow agent, transfer agent and custodial fees and expenses; fees and expenses associated with marketing efforts; federal and state registration fees, any stock exchange listing fees and fees payable to rating agencies; federal, state and local taxes; independent directors fees and expenses, including certain travel expenses; costs of preparing financial

 of the aggregate gross offering proceeds, without recourse against or reimbursement by the Company. 
 From time to time, the Adviser may pay amounts owed by the Company to third-party providers of goods or services, including the Board, and the Company will subsequently reimburse the Adviser for such amounts paid on its behalf. Amounts payable to the Adviser are settled in the normal course of business without formal payment terms. 
 Affiliated Transactions 
 The Company may be prohibited under the 1940 Act from participating in certain transactions with its affiliates without prior approval of the directors who are not interested persons, and in some cases, the prior approval of the SEC. The Company, the Adviser and certain of their affiliates have been granted an order for exemptive relief (as amended, the Order by the SEC for the Company to co-invest with other funds managed by the Adviser or certain affiliates, in a manner consistent with the Company s investment objective, positions, policies, strategies and restrictions as well as regulatory requirements and other pertinent factors. Pursuant to the Order, the Company generally is permitted to co-invest with certain of its affiliates if a required majority (as defined in Section 57(o) of the 1940 Act) of the Board make certain conclusions in connection with a co-investment transaction, including that (1) the terms of the transaction, including the consideration to be paid, are reasonable and fair to the Company and its shareholders and do not involve overreaching by the Company or its shareholders on the part of any person concerned, (2) the transaction is consistent with the interests of the Company s shareholders and is consistent with its investment objective and strategies, (3) the investment by its affiliates would not disadvantage the Company, and the Company s participation would not be on a basis different from or less advantageous than that on which its affiliates are investing and (4) the proposed investment by the Company would not benefit the Advisers or its affiliates or any affiliated person of any of them (other than the parties to the transaction), except to the extent permitted by the Order and applicable law, including the limitation set forth in Section 57(k) of the 1940 Act. In addition, the Order permits the Company to participate in follow-on investments in its existing portfolio companies with certain affiliates that are private funds if such private funds did not have an investment in such existing portfolio company. 
 The Adviser is affiliated with Blue Owl Technology Credit Advisors LLC OTCA ), Blue Owl Credit Private Fund Advisors LLC OPFA ), Blue Owl Technology Credit Advisors II LLC OTCA II and Blue Owl Diversified Credit Advisors LLC ODCA together with OTCA, OPFA, OTCA II and the Adviser, the Blue Owl Credit Advisers ), which are also investment advisers.

 Expense Support and Conditional Reimbursement Agreement 
 On February 6, 2017, the Company entered into an Expense Support and Conditional Reimbursement Agreement (the Expense Support Agreement with the Adviser, the purpose of which was to ensure that no portion of the Company s distributions to shareholders will represent a return of capital for U.S. federal income tax purposes. The Expense Support Agreement became effective as of April 4, 2017, the date that the Company met the minimum offering requirement and was terminated on November 7, 2023. 
 Pursuant to the Expense Support Agreement, prior to its termination on November 7, 2023, on a quarterly basis, the Adviser reimbursed the Company for Operating Expenses (as defined below) in an amount equal to the excess of the Company s cumulative distributions paid to the Company s shareholders in each quarter over Available Operating Funds (as defined below) received by the

 The fair value of the Company s performing Level 3 debt investments is typically determined utilizing a yield analysis. In a yield analysis, a price is ascribed for each investment based upon an assessment of current and expected market yields for similar investments and risk profiles. Additional consideration is given to the expected life, portfolio company performance since close, and other terms and risks associated with an investment. Among other factors, a determinant of risk is the amount of leverage used by the portfolio company relative to its total enterprise value, and the rights and remedies of the Company s investment within the portfolio company s capital structure. 
 When the debtor is not performing or when there is insufficient value to cover the investment, the Company may utilize a net recovery approach to determine the fair value of debt investments in subject companies. A net recovery analysis typically consists of two steps. First, the total enterprise value for the subject company is estimated using standard valuation approaches, most commonly the market approach. Second, the fair value for each investment in the subject company is then estimated by allocating the subject company s total enterprise value to the outstanding securities in the capital structure based upon various factors, including seniority, preferences, and other features if deemed relevant to each security in the capital structure. 
 Significant unobservable quantitative inputs typically used in the fair value measurement of the Company s Level 3 debt investments primarily include current market yields, including relevant market indices, but may also include quotes from brokers, dealers, and pricing services as indicated by comparable investments. For the Company s Level 3 equity investments, a market approach, based on comparable financial performance multiples such as publicly-traded company and comparable market transaction multiples of revenues, earnings before income taxes, depreciation and amortization EBITDA ), or some combination thereof and comparable market transactions typically would be used.

 With respect to distributions, the Company has adopted an opt-in dividend reinvestment plan for common shareholders pursuant to which shareholders that have opted-in may have the full amount of any cash distribution reinvested in additional shares of the Company s common stock based on the net offering price per share calculated as if the Company s offering had not been terminated. As a result, in the event of a declared distribution, each shareholder that has not opted-in to the dividend reinvestment plan will have their dividends or distributions automatically received in cash rather than reinvested in additional shares of the Company s common

 from the date of payment. The purpose of this arrangement was to avoid distributions being characterized as a return of capital for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Shareholders should understand that any such distribution was not based on the Company s investment performance, and can only be sustained if the Company achieves positive investment performance in future periods and/or the Adviser continued to provide expense support. Shareholders should also understand that the Company s repayments of expense support reduced the distributions that they would have otherwise received. There can be no assurance that the Company will achieve the performance necessary to sustain these distributions, or be able to pay distributions at all. 
 Sources of distributions, other than net investment income and realized gains on a U.S. GAAP basis, include required adjustments to U.S. GAAP net investment income in the current period to determine taxable income available for distributions.

 In the third quarter of 2017, the Company began offering, and on a quarterly basis, intends to continue offering, to repurchase shares of the Company s common stock on such terms as may be determined by the Board in its complete discretion.

At the discretion of the Board, the Company may use cash on hand, cash available from borrowings, and cash from the sale of investments as of the end of the applicable period to repurchase shares. 
 All shares purchased by the Company pursuant to the terms of each offer to repurchase will be retired and thereafter will be authorized and unissued shares.

 Overview 
 Blue Owl Capital Corporation II (the Company , we , us , or our is an externally managed, non-diversified closed-end management investment company that has elected to be treated as a business development company BDC under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the 1940 Act ). Formed as a Maryland corporation on October 15, 2015, we are externally managed by Blue Owl Credit Advisors LLC (the Adviser , our Adviser or OCA which is responsible for sourcing potential investments, conducting due diligence on prospective investments, analyzing investment opportunities, structuring investments and monitoring our portfolio on an ongoing basis. We have elected to be treated as a regulated investment company RIC under Subchapter M of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the Code ), and we intend to operate in a manner so as to continue to qualify for the tax treatment applicable to RICs. On February 28, 2017, we formed a wholly-owned subsidiary, OR Lending II LLC, a Delaware limited liability company, which holds a California finance lenders license. OR Lending II LLC makes loans to borrowers headquartered in California. 
 Our Adviser is registered with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission SEC as an investment adviser under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, as amended (the Advisers Act ), an indirect affiliate of Blue Owl Capital Inc. Blue Owl (NYSE: OWL) and part of Blue Owl s Credit platform, which focuses on direct lending. Subject to the overall supervision of our Board, our Adviser manages the day-to-day operations of, and provides investment advisory and management services, to us. The Adviser or its affiliates may engage in certain origination activities and receive attendant arrangement, structuring or similar fees. Our Adviser is responsible for managing our business and activities, including sourcing investment opportunities, conducting research, performing diligence on potential investments, structuring our investments, and monitoring our portfolio companies on an ongoing basis through a team of investment professionals. 
 In April 2017, we commenced our continuous public offering, commenced operations and made our first portfolio company investment. We terminated our continuous public offering as of April 30, 2021. Prior to the termination of our continuous public offering, we issued 151,364,239 shares of our common stock for gross proceeds of approximately 1.39 billion, including seed capital contributed by our Adviser in September 2016 and approximately 10.0 million in gross proceeds raised in the private placement from certain individuals and entities affiliated with our Adviser. 
 Our Adviser also serves as investment adviser to Blue Owl Capital Corporation and Blue Owl Credit Income Corp. 
 Blue Owl consists of three investment platforms: (1) Credit, which focuses on direct lending, (2) GP Strategic Capital, which focuses on acquiring equity stakes in and providing debt financing to institutional alternative asset managers and (3) Real Estate, which focuses on triple net lease real estate strategies and real estate credit. Blue Owl s Credit platform is comprised of Blue Owl Technology Credit Advisors LLC OTCA ), Blue Owl Credit Private Fund Advisors LLC OPFA ), Blue Owl Technology Credit Advisors II LLC OTCA II and Blue Owl Diversified Credit Advisors LLC ODCA and together with OTCA, OPFA, OTCA II and the Adviser, the Blue Owl Credit Advisers ), which also are investment advisers. As of September 30, 2024, the Adviser and its affiliates had 128.4 billion of assets under management across Blue Owl s Credit platform. 
 The management of our investment portfolio is the responsibility of the Adviser and the Diversified Lending Investment Committee. The Investment Team is led by Douglas I. Ostrover, Marc S. Lipschultz and Craig W. Packer and is supported by certain members of the Adviser s senior executive team and Blue Owl s Credit platform s investment committees. Blue Owl s Credit platform has four investment committees each of which focuses on a specific investment strategy (Diversified Lending, Technology Lending, First Lien Lending and Opportunistic Lending). Douglas I. Ostrover, Marc S. Lipschultz, Craig W. Packer and Alexis Maged sit on each of Blue Owl s Credit platform s investment committees. In addition to Messers. Ostrover, Lipschultz, Packer and Maged, the Diversified Lending Investment Committee is comprised of Patrick Linnemann, Meenal Mehta and Logan Nicholson. We consider the individuals on the Diversified Lending Investment Committee to be our portfolio managers. The Investment Team, under the Diversified Lending Investment Committee s supervision, sources investment opportunities, conducts research, performs due diligence on potential investments, structures our investments and will monitor our portfolio companies on an ongoing basis. 
 
 81 

The Diversified Lending Investment Committee meets regularly to consider our investments, direct our strategic initiatives and supervise the actions taken by the Adviser on our behalf. In addition, the Diversified Lending Investment Committee reviews and determines whether to make prospective investments (including approving parameters or guidelines pursuant to which investments in broadly syndicated loans may be bought and sold), structures financings and monitors the performance of the investment portfolio. Each investment opportunity requires the approval of a majority of the Diversified Lending Investment Committee. Follow-on investments in existing portfolio companies may require the Diversified Lending Investment Committee's approval beyond that obtained when the initial investment in the portfolio company was made. In addition, temporary investments, such as those in cash equivalents, U.S. government securities and other high quality debt investments that mature in one year or less, may require approval by the Diversified Lending Investment Committee. The compensation packages of certain Diversified Lending Investment Committee members from the Adviser include various combinations of discretionary bonuses and variable incentive compensation based primarily on performance for services provided and may include shares of Blue Owl. 
 We may be prohibited under the 1940 Act from participating in certain transactions with our affiliates without the prior approval of our directors who are not interested persons and, in some cases, the prior approval of the SEC. We, our Adviser and certain affiliates, have been granted an order for exemptive relief (as amended, the Order by the SEC to permit us to co-invest with other funds managed by our Adviser or certain of its affiliates, in a manner consistent with our investment objective, positions, policies, strategies and restrictions as well as regulatory requirements and other pertinent factors. Pursuant to the Order, we generally are permitted to co-invest with certain of our affiliates if a required majority (as defined in Section 57(o) of the 1940 Act of our independent directors make certain conclusions in connection with a co-investment transaction, including that (1) the terms of the transactions, including the consideration to be paid, are reasonable and fair to us and our shareholders and do not involve overreaching by us or our shareholders on the part of any person concerned, (2) the transaction is consistent with the interests of our shareholders and is consistent with our investment objective and strategies, (3) the investment by our affiliates would not disadvantage us, and our participation would not be on a basis different from or less advantageous than that on which our affiliates are investing and (4) the proposed investment by us would not benefit our Adviser or its affiliates or any affiliated person of any of them (other than the parties to the transaction), except to the extent permitted by the Order and applicable law, including the limitations set forth in Section 57(k) of the 1940 Act. 
 In addition, the Order permits us to continue to co-invest in our existing portfolio companies with certain affiliates that are private funds if such private funds did not have an investment in such existing portfolio company. The Blue Owl Credit Advisers investment allocation policy seeks to ensure equitable allocation of investment opportunities over time between us and other funds managed by our Adviser or its affiliates. As a result of the Order, there could be significant overlap in our investment portfolio and the investment portfolio of the BDCs, private funds and separately managed accounts managed by the Blue Owl Credit Advisers (collectively, the Blue Owl Credit Clients and/or other funds managed by the Adviser or its affiliates that could avail themselves of the Order and that have an investment objective similar to ours. 
 From time to time, we may form wholly-owned subsidiaries to facilitate our normal course of business. 
 Certain of our consolidated subsidiaries are subject to U.S. federal and state corporate-level income taxes. 
 We have elected to be regulated as a BDC under the 1940 Act and as a RIC for tax purposes under the Code. As a result, we are required to comply with various statutory and regulatory requirements, such as: 
 the requirement to invest at least 70 of our assets in qualifying assets , as such term is defined in the 1940 Act; 
 source of income limitations; 
 asset diversification requirements; and 
 the requirement to distribute (or be treated as distributing) in each taxable year at least the sum of 90 of our investment company taxable income and tax-exempt interest for that taxable year.

Key Components of Our Results of Operations 
 Investments 
 We focus primarily on the direct origination of loans to middle-market companies domiciled in the United States. 
 Our level of investment activity (both the number of investments and the size of each investment) can and will vary substantially from period to period depending on many factors, including the amount of debt and equity capital available to middle-market companies, the level of merger and acquisition activity for such companies, the general economic environment and the competitive environment for the types of investments we make. 
 In addition, as part of our risk strategy on investments, we may reduce the levels of certain investments through partial sales or syndication to additional lenders. 
 Revenues 
 We generate revenues primarily in the form of interest income from the investments we hold. In addition, we may generate income from dividends on either direct equity investments or equity interests obtained in connection with originating loans, such as options, warrants or conversion rights. Our debt investments typically have a term of three to ten years. As of September 30, 2024, 97.0 of our debt investments based on fair value bear interest at a floating rate, subject to interest rate floors in certain cases. Interest on our debt investments is generally payable either monthly or quarterly. 
 
 83 

Our investment portfolio consists primarily of floating rate loans, and our credit facilities bear interest at floating rates. Macro trends in base interest rates like the Secured Overnight Financing Rate SOFR and any alternative reference rates may affect our net investment income over the long term. However, because we generally originate loans to a small number of portfolio companies each quarter, and those investments vary in size, our results in any given period, including the interest rate on investments that were sold or repaid in a period compared to the interest rate of new investments made during that period, often are idiosyncratic, and reflect the characteristics of the particular portfolio companies that we invested in or exited during the period and not necessarily any trends in our business or macro trends. Generally, because our portfolio consists primarily of floating rate loans, we expect our earnings to benefit from a prolonged higher rate environment. 
 Loan origination fees, original issue discount and market discount or premium are capitalized, and we accrete or amortize such amounts under generally accepted accounting principles U.S. GAAP as interest income using the effective yield method for term instruments and the straight-line method for revolving or delayed draw instruments. Repayments of our debt investments can reduce interest income from period to period. The frequency or volume of these repayments may fluctuate significantly. We record prepayment premiums on loans as interest income. We may also generate revenue in the form of commitment, loan origination, structuring, or due diligence fees, fees for providing managerial assistance to our portfolio companies and possibly consulting fees. 
 Dividend income on equity investments is recorded on the record date for private portfolio companies or on the ex-dividend date for publicly traded companies. 
 Our portfolio activity also reflects the proceeds from sales of investments. We recognize realized gains or losses on investments based on the difference between the net proceeds from the disposition and the amortized cost basis of the investment without regard to unrealized gains or losses previously recognized. We record current period changes in fair value of investments that are measured at fair value as a component of the net change in unrealized gains (losses) on investments in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. 
 Expenses 
 Our primary operating expenses include the payment of the management fee, performance based incentive fee, expenses reimbursable under the Administration Agreement and Investment Advisory Agreement, legal and professional fees, interest and other debt expenses and other operating expenses. The management fee and performance based incentive fee compensate our Adviser for work in identifying, evaluating, negotiating, closing, monitoring and realizing our investments. 
 Except as specifically provided below, all investment professionals and staff of the Adviser, when and to the extent engaged in providing investment advisory and management services to us, and the base compensation, bonus and benefits, and the routine overhead expenses, of such personnel allocable to such services, are provided and paid for by the Adviser. We bear our allocable portion of the compensation paid by the Adviser (or its affiliates) to our Chief Compliance Officer and Chief Financial Officer and their respective staffs (based on a percentage of time such individuals devote, on an estimated basis, to our business affairs). We bear all other costs and expenses of our operations, administration and transactions, including, but not limited to (i) investment advisory fees, including management fees and incentive fees, to the Adviser, pursuant to the Investment Advisory Agreement; (ii) our allocable portion of overhead and other expenses incurred by the Adviser in performing its administrative obligations under the Administration Agreement; and (iii) all other expenses of our operations and transactions including, without limitation, those relating to: 
 expenses deemed to be organization and offering expenses for purposes of FINRA Conduct Rule 2310(a)(12) (exclusive of commissions, the dealer manager fee, any discounts and other similar expenses paid by investors at the time of sale of our stock); 
 the cost of corporate and organizational expenses relating to offerings of shares of our common stock; 
 the cost of calculating our net asset value, including the cost of any third-party valuation services; 
 the cost of effecting any sales and repurchases of our common stock and other securities; 
 fees and expenses payable under any dealer manager agreements, if any; 
 debt service and other costs of borrowings or other financing arrangements; 
 costs of hedging; 
 expenses, including travel expense, incurred by the Adviser, or members of the investment team, or payable to third parties, performing due diligence on prospective portfolio companies and, if necessary, enforcing our rights; 
 escrow agent, transfer agent and custodial fees and expenses; 
 fees and expenses associated with marketing efforts; 
 federal and state registration fees, any stock exchange listing fees and fees payable to rating agencies; 
 federal, state and local taxes; 
 independent directors fees and expenses, including certain travel expenses; 
 costs of preparing financial statements and maintaining books and records and filing reports or other documents with the SEC (or other regulatory bodies) and other reporting and compliance costs, including registration fees, listing fees and licenses, and the compensation of professionals responsible for the preparation of the foregoing; 
 the costs of any reports, proxy statements or other notices to our shareholders (including printing and mailing costs); 
 the costs of any shareholder or director meetings and the compensation of personnel responsible for the preparation of the foregoing and related matters; 
 84 

commissions and other compensation payable to brokers or dealers; 
 research and market data; 
 fidelity bond, directors and officers errors and omissions liability insurance and other insurance premiums; 
 direct costs and expenses of administration, including printing, mailing, long distance telephone and staff; 
 fees and expenses associated with independent audits, outside legal and consulting costs; 
 costs of winding up; 
 costs incurred in connection with the formation or maintenance of entities or vehicles to hold our assets for tax or other purposes; 
 extraordinary expenses (such as litigation or indemnification); and 
 costs associated with reporting and compliance obligations under the 1940 Act and applicable federal and state securities laws. 
 We expect, but cannot assure, that our general and administrative expenses will increase in dollar terms during periods of asset growth, but will decline as a percentage of total assets during such periods. 
 Expense Support and Conditional Reimbursement Agreement 
 On February 6, 2017, we entered into an Expense Support and Conditional Reimbursement Agreement (the Expense Support Agreement with the Adviser, the purpose of which was to ensure that no portion of our distributions to shareholders will represent a return of capital for U.S. federal income tax purposes. The Expense Support Agreement became effective as of April 4, 2017, the date that the Company met the minimum offering requirement and was terminated on November 7, 2023. 
 Pursuant to the Expense Support Agreement, prior to its termination on November 7, 2023, on a quarterly basis, the Adviser reimbursed us for Operating Expenses (as defined below) in an amount equal to the excess of our cumulative distributions paid to our shareholders in each quarter over Available Operating Funds (as defined below) received by us on account of our investment portfolio during such quarter. Any payments required to be made by the Adviser pursuant to the preceding sentence are referred to herein as an Expense Payment . 
 Pursuant to the Expense Support Agreement, Operating Expenses was defined as all of our operating costs and expenses incurred, as determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles for investment companies. Available Operating Funds means the sum of (i) our estimated investment company taxable income (including realized net short-term capital gains reduced by realized net long-term capital losses), (ii) our realized net capital gains (including the excess of realized net long-term capital gains over realized net short-term capital losses) and (iii) dividends and other distributions paid to us on account of preferred and common equity investments in portfolio companies, if any (to the extent such amounts listed in clause (iii) are not included under clauses (i) and (ii) above). 
 Following any quarter in which Available Operating Funds exceed the cumulative distributions paid by us in respect of such quarter (the amount of such excess being hereinafter referred to as Excess Operating Funds ), we will pay such Excess Operating Funds, or a portion thereof, in accordance with the stipulations below, as applicable, to the Adviser, until such time as all Expense Payments made by the Adviser to us within three years prior to the last business day of such quarter have been reimbursed. Any payments required to be made by us are referred to as a Reimbursement Payment . 
 Prior to the termination of the Expense Support Agreement, the amount of Expense Support Payments provided by the Adviser since inception was 32.8 million. As of March 31, 2024, all Expense Support Payments made by the Adviser to the Company had either been recouped by the Adviser or expired. 
 Reimbursement of Administrative Services 
 We will reimburse our Adviser for the administrative expenses necessary for its performance of services to us. However, such reimbursement will be made at an amount equal to the lower of our Adviser s actual costs or the amount that we would be required to pay for comparable administrative services in the same geographic location. Also, such costs will be reasonably allocated to us on the basis of assets, revenues, time records or other reasonable methods. We will not reimburse our Adviser for any services for which it receives a separate fee, for example rent, depreciation, utilities, capital equipment or other administrative items allocated to a controlling person of our Adviser. 
 
 85 

Leverage 
 The amount of leverage we use in any period depends on a variety of factors, including cash available for investing, the cost of financing and general economic and market conditions. Generally, our total borrowings are limited so that we cannot incur additional borrowings, including through the issuance of additional debt securities, if such additional indebtedness would cause our asset coverage ratio to fall below 200 , as defined in the 1940 Act; however, recent legislation has modified the 1940 Act by allowing a BDC to increase the maximum amount of leverage it may incur from an asset coverage ratio of 200 to an asset coverage ratio of 150 , if certain requirements are met. The reduced asset coverage requirement would permit a BDC to double the amount of leverage it could incur. We are permitted to increase our leverage capacity if shareholders representing at least a majority of the votes cast, when quorum is met, approve a proposal to do so. If we receive such shareholder approval, we would be permitted to increase our leverage capacity on the first day after such approval. Alternatively, we may increase the maximum amount of leverage we may incur to an asset coverage ratio of 150 if the required majority (as defined in Section 57(o) of the 1940 Act) of the independent members of our Board approves such increase with such approval becoming effective after one year. In either case, we would be required to extend to our shareholders, as of the date of such approval, the opportunity to sell the shares of common stock that they hold and we would be required to make certain disclosures on our website and in SEC filings regarding, among other things, the receipt of approval to increase our leverage, our leverage capacity and usage, and risks related to leverage. For shareholders accepting such an offer, the Company would be required to repurchase 25 of such shareholders eligible shares in each of the four calendar quarters following the calendar quarter in which the approval occurs. In addition, before incurring any such additional leverage, we would have to renegotiate or receive a waiver from the contractual leverage limitations under our existing credit facilities and notes. Our current target leverage ratio is 0.75x. 
 In any period, our interest expense will depend largely on the extent of our borrowings and we expect interest expense will increase as we increase our leverage over time subject to the limits of the 1940 Act. In addition, we may dedicate assets to financing facilities. 
 Market Trends 
 We believe the middle-market lending environment provides opportunities for us to meet our goal of making investments that generate attractive risk-adjusted returns based on a combination of the following factors. 
 Limited Availability of Capital for Middle-Market Companies. The middle-market is a large addressable market. According to GE Capital s National Center for the Middle Market Mid-Year 2024 Middle Market Indicator, there are approximately 200,000 U.S. middle-market companies, which have approximately 48 million aggregate employees. Moreover, the U.S. middle-market accounts for one-third of private sector gross domestic product GDP ). GE defines U.S. middle-market companies as those between 10 million and 1 billion in annual revenue, which we believe has significant overlap with our definition of U.S. middle-market companies. We believe U.S. middle-market companies will continue to require access to debt capital to refinance existing debt, support growth and finance acquisitions. We believe that regulatory and structural factors, industry consolidation and general risk aversion, limit the amount of traditional financing available to U.S. middle-market companies. We believe that many commercial and investment banks have, in recent years, de-emphasized their service and product offerings to middle-market businesses in favor of lending to large corporate clients and managing capital markets transactions. In addition, these lenders may be constrained in their ability to underwrite and hold bank loans and high yield securities for middle-market issuers as they seek to meet existing and future regulatory capital requirements. We also believe that there is a lack of market participants that are willing to hold meaningful amounts of certain middle-market loans. As a result, we believe our ability to minimize syndication risk for a company seeking financing by being able to hold its loans without having to syndicate them, coupled with reduced capacity of traditional lenders to serve the middle-market, present an attractive opportunity to invest in middle-market companies. 
 Capital Markets Have Been Unable to Fill the Void in U.S. Middle-Market Finance Left by Banks . Access to underwritten bond and syndicated loan markets is challenging for middle-market companies due to loan issue size and liquidity. For example, high yield bonds are generally purchased by institutional investors, such as mutual funds and exchange traded funds ETFs who, among other things, are focused on the liquidity characteristics of the bond being issued in order to fund investor redemptions and/or comply with regulatory requirements. Accordingly, the existence of an active secondary market for bonds is an important consideration in these entities initial investment decision. 
 Syndicated loans arranged through a bank are done either on a best efforts basis or are underwritten with terms plus provisions that permit the underwriters to change certain terms, including pricing, structure, yield and tenor, otherwise known as flex , to successfully syndicate the loan, in the event the terms initially marketed are insufficiently attractive to investors. Furthermore, banks are generally reluctant to underwrite middle-market loans because the arrangement fees they may earn on the placement of the debt generally are not sufficient to meet the banks return hurdles. Loans provided by companies such as ours provide certainty to issuers in that we have a more stable capital base and have the ability to invest in illiquid assets, and we can commit to a given amount of debt on specific terms, at stated coupons and with agreed upon fees. As we are the ultimate holder of the loans, we do not require market flex or other arrangements that banks may require when acting on an agency basis. In addition, our Adviser has teams focused on both liquid credit and private credit and these teams are able to collaborate with respect to syndicated loans. 
 86 

Secular Trends Supporting Growth for Private Credit. We believe that periods of market volatility, such as the current period of market volatility caused, in part, by uncertainty regarding inflation and interest rates, and current geopolitical conditions, have accentuated the advantages of private credit. The availability of capital in the liquid credit market is highly sensitive to market conditions whereas we believe private lending has proven to be a stable and reliable source of capital through periods of volatility. We believe the opportunity set for private credit will continue to expand even as the public markets remain open. Financial sponsors and companies today are familiar with direct lending and have seen firsthand the strong value proposition that a private solution can offer. Scale, certainty of execution and flexibility all provide borrowers with a compelling alternative to the syndicated and high yield markets. Based on our experience, there is an emerging trend where higher quality credits that have traditionally been issuers in the syndicated and high yield markets are increasingly seeking private solutions independent of credit market conditions. In our view, this is supported by financial sponsors wanting to work with collaborative financing partners that have scale and breadth of capabilities. We believe the large amount of uninvested capital held by funds of private equity firms broadly, estimated by Preqin Ltd., an alternative assets industry data and research company, to be 2.7 trillion as of December 31, 2023, will continue to drive deal activity. We expect that private equity sponsors will continue to pursue acquisitions and leverage their equity investments with secured loans provided by companies such as us. 
 Attractive Investment Dynamics. An imbalance between the supply of, and demand for, middle-market debt capital creates attractive pricing dynamics. We believe the directly negotiated nature of middle-market financings also generally provides more favorable terms to the lender, including stronger covenant and reporting packages, better call protection, and lender-protective change of control provisions. Additionally, we believe BDC managers expertise in credit selection and ability to manage through credit cycles has generally resulted in BDCs experiencing lower loss rates than U.S. commercial banks through credit cycles. Further, we believe that historical middle-market default rates have been lower, and recovery rates have been higher, as compared to the larger market capitalization, broadly distributed market, leading to lower cumulative losses. Lastly, we believe that in the current environment, lenders with available capital may be able to take advantage of attractive investment opportunities and may be able to achieve improved economic spreads and documentation terms. 
 Conservative Capital Structures. Following the global credit crisis, which we define broadly as occurring between mid-2007 and mid-2009, lenders have generally required borrowers to maintain more equity as a percentage of their total capitalization, specifically to protect lenders during economic downturns. With more conservative capital structures, U.S. middle-market companies have exhibited higher levels of cash flows available to service their debt. In addition, U.S. middle-market companies often are characterized by simpler capital structures than larger borrowers, which facilitates a streamlined underwriting process and, when necessary, restructuring process. 
 Attractive Opportunities in Investments in Loans. We invest in senior secured or unsecured loans, subordinated loans or mezzanine loans and, to a lesser extent, equity and equity-related securities. We believe that opportunities in senior secured loans are significant because of the floating rate structure of most senior secured debt issuances and because of the strong defensive characteristics of these types of investments. We believe that debt issues with floating interest rates offer a superior return profile as compared with fixed-rate investments, since floating rate structures are generally less susceptible to declines in value experienced by fixed-rate securities in a rising interest rate environment. Senior secured debt also provides strong defensive characteristics. Senior secured debt has priority in payment among an issuer s security holders whereby holders are due to receive payment before junior creditors and equity holders. Further, these investments are secured by the issuer s assets, which may provide protection in the event of a default. 
 
 Portfolio and Investment Activity 
 As of September 30, 2024, based on fair value, our portfolio consisted of 80.3 first lien senior secured debt investments (of which 49 we consider to be unitranche debt investments (including last-out portions of such loans)), 9.9 second-lien senior secured debt investments, 1.7 unsecured investments, 2.9 preferred equity investments, 5.2 common equity investments and 0.0 joint venture investments. 
 As of September 30, 2024, our weighted average total yield of the portfolio at fair value and amortized cost was 11.5 and 11.5 , respectively, and our weighted average yield of accruing debt and income producing securities at fair value and amortized cost was 11.8 and 11.9 , respectively. 
 As of September 30, 2024, we had investments in 183 portfolio companies with an aggregate fair value of 2.1 billion. As of September 30, 2024, we had net leverage of 0.77x debt-to-equity. 
 In the current lending environment, public loan markets have remained active while merger and acquisition activity remains below historical levels; however, our platform continues to find attractive investment opportunities for deployment, predominantly in first lien originations. In addition, a large portion of our originations across the platform this quarter were deployed into existing borrowers as part of add-on transactions. 
 
 87 

The credit quality of our portfolio has been consistent. We continue to focus on investing in industries we view as recession resistant and that we are familiar with, including service-oriented sectors such as software and healthcare, all of which serve diversified and durable end markets. Blue Owl serves as the administrative agent on many of our investments and the majority of our investments are supported by sophisticated financial sponsors who provide operational and financial resources. Our borrowers have a weighted average EBITDA of 177 million and we believe this scale contributes to the durability of our borrowers and their ability to adapt to different economic environments. In addition, Blue Owl continues to invest in, and is often the lead lender or administrative agent on, transactions in excess of 1 billion in size, which gives us the ability to structure the terms of such deals to maximize deal economics and credit protection. 
 Many of the companies in which we invest are continuing to see modest growth in both revenues and EBITDA. However, in the event of further geopolitical, economic and financial market instability, in the U.S. and elsewhere, it is possible that the results of some of the middle-market companies similar to those in which we invest could be challenged. While we are not seeing signs of an overall, broad deterioration in our results or those of our portfolio companies at this time, there can be no assurance that the performance of certain of our portfolio companies will not be negatively impacted by economic conditions, which could have a negative impact on our future results. 
 We have also continued to invest in Credit SLF and specialty financing portfolio companies, including AAM Series 1.1 Rail and Domestic Intermodal Feeder, LLC and AAM Series 2.1 Aviation Feeder, LLC (collectively, Amergin AssetCo ), Amergin Asset Management LLC, Fifth Season Investments LLC Fifth Season and LSI Financing 1 DAC LSI Financing ). In the future we may invest through additional specialty finance portfolio companies, joint ventures, partnerships or other special purpose vehicles. These companies may use our capital to support acquisitions which could lead to increased dividend income across well-diversified underlying portfolios. See Specialty Finance Portfolio Companies .

 The weighted average yield of our accruing debt and income producing securities is not the same as a return on investment for our shareholders but, rather, relates to a portion of our investment portfolio and is calculated before the payment of all of our and our subsidiaries fees and expenses. The weighted average yield was computed using the effective interest rates as of each respective date, including accretion of original issue discount and loan origination fees, but excluding investments on non-accrual status, if any. There can be no assurance that the weighted average yield will remain at its current level. 
 Our Adviser monitors our portfolio companies on an ongoing basis. It monitors the financial trends of each portfolio company to determine if they are meeting their respective business plans and to assess the appropriate course of action with respect to each portfolio company. Our Adviser has several methods of evaluating and monitoring the performance and fair value of our investments, which may include the following: 
 assessment of success of the portfolio company in adhering to its business plan and compliance with covenants; 
 periodic and regular contact with portfolio company management and, if appropriate, the financial or strategic sponsor, to discuss financial position, requirements and accomplishments; 
 comparisons to other companies in the portfolio company s industry; and 
 review of monthly or quarterly financial statements and financial projections for portfolio companies. 
 An investment will be placed on the Adviser's credit watch list when select events occur and will only be removed from the watch list with the oversight of the Diversified Lending Investment Committee and/or other Blue Owl agent. Once an investment is on the credit watch list, the Adviser works with the borrower to resolve any financial stress through amendments, waivers or other alternatives. If a borrower defaults on its payment obligations, the Adviser's focus shifts to capital recovery. If an investment needs to be restructured, the Adviser's workout team partners with the investment team and all material amendments, waivers and restructurings require the approval of a majority of the Diversified Lending Investment Committee.

As part of the monitoring process, our Adviser employs an investment rating system to categorize our investments. In addition to various risk management and monitoring tools, our Adviser rates the credit risk of all investments on a scale of 1 to 5. This system is intended primarily to reflect the underlying risk of a portfolio investment relative to our initial cost basis in respect of such portfolio investment (i.e., at the time of origination or acquisition), although it may also take into account the performance of the portfolio company s business, the collateral coverage of the investment and other relevant factors. The rating system is as follows: 
 Investment Rating Description 1 Investments rated 1 involve the least amount of risk to our initial cost basis. The borrower is performing above expectations, and the trends and risk factors for this investment since origination or acquisition are generally favorable; 
 2 Investments rated 2 involve an acceptable level of risk that is similar to the risk at the time of origination or acquisition. The borrower is generally performing as expected and the risk factors are neutral to favorable. All investments or acquired investments in new portfolio companies are initially assessed a rating of 2; 
 3 Investments rated 3 involve a borrower performing below expectations and indicates that the loan s risk has increased somewhat since origination or acquisition; 
 4 Investments rated 4 involve a borrower performing materially below expectations and indicates that the loan s risk has increased materially since origination or acquisition. In addition to the borrower being generally out of compliance with debt covenants, loan payments may be past due (but generally not more than 120 days past due); and 
 5 Investments rated 5 involve a borrower performing substantially below expectations and indicates that the loan s risk has increased substantially since origination or acquisition. Most or all of the debt covenants are out of compliance and payments are substantially delinquent. Loans rated 5 are not anticipated to be repaid in full and we will reduce the fair market value of the loan to the amount we anticipate will be recovered. 
 Our Adviser rates the investments in our portfolio at least quarterly and it is possible that the rating of a portfolio investment may be reduced or increased over time. For investments rated 3, 4 or 5, our Adviser enhances its level of scrutiny over the monitoring of such portfolio company. 
 The Adviser has built out its portfolio management team to include workout experts who closely monitor our portfolio companies and who, on at least a quarterly basis, assess each portfolio company s operational and liquidity exposure and outlook to understand and mitigate risks; and, on at least a monthly basis, evaluates existing and newly identified situations where operating results are deviating from expectations. As part of its monitoring process, the Adviser focuses on projected liquidity needs and where warranted, re-underwriting credits and evaluating downside and liquidation scenarios. 
 The Adviser focuses on downside protection by leveraging existing rights available under our credit documents; however, for investments that are significantly underperforming or which may need to be restructured, the Adviser s workout team partners with the investment team and all material amendments, waivers and restructurings require the approval of a majority of the Diversified Lending Investment Committee. 
 The table below shows the composition of our portfolio on the 1 to 5 rating scale as of the following periods:

The table below shows the amortized cost of our performing and non-accrual debt investments as of the following periods: 
 September 30, 2024 December 31, 2023 in thousands) Amortized Cost Percentage Amortized Cost Percentage Performing 1,887,736 98.5 1,892,893 99.4 Non-accrual 29,372 1.5 11,761 0.6 Total 1,917,108 100.0 1,904,654 100.0 
 Loans are generally placed on non-accrual status when there is reasonable doubt that principal or interest will be collected in full. Accrued interest is generally reversed when a loan is placed on non-accrual status. Interest payments received on non-accrual loans may be recognized as income or applied to principal depending upon management s judgment regarding collectability. Non-accrual loans are restored to accrual status when past due principal and interest is paid current and, in management s judgment, are likely to remain current. Management may make exceptions to this treatment and determine to not place a loan on non-accrual status if the loan has sufficient collateral value and is in the process of collection.

Results of Operations 
 The table below represents the operating results for the following periods:

 Net increase (decrease) in net assets resulting from operations can vary from period to period as a result of various factors, including the level of new investment commitments, expenses, the recognition of realized gains and losses and changes in unrealized appreciation and depreciation on the investment portfolio. For the period ended September 30, 2024, our net asset value per share decreased, primarily driven by decreases in the fair value of certain debt investments. 
 Investment Income 
 The table below presents the investment income for the following periods: 
 
 Three Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30, in thousands) 2024 2023 2024 2023 Interest income from investments 52,660 57,569 158,578 168,776 Payment-in-kind interest income 7,179 6,195 20,875 20,656 Dividend income 3,718 4,021 12,458 11,876 Other income 1,018 403 3,092 1,861 Total investment income 64,575 68,188 195,003 203,169 
 For the Three Months Ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 
 Investment income decreased to 64.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 from 68.2 million for the same period in prior year primarily due to a decrease in interest income as a result of a decline in weighted average yield from 12.3 to 11.5 , while our debt portfolio at par decreased from 2.0 billion to 1.9 billion period over period. Included in interest income are other fees such as prepayment fees and accelerated amortization of upfront fees from unscheduled paydowns, which are non-recurring in nature and remained flat at 1.0 million period over period. For the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, PIK income represented 13.1 and 11.2 of investment income, respectively. Other income increased period-over-period due to an increase in incremental fee income, which are fees that are generally available to us as a result of closing investments and generally paid at the time of closing. We expect that investment income will vary based on a variety of factors, including the pace of our originations and repayments. 
 For the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 
 Investment income decreased to 195.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from 203.2 million for the same period in prior year primarily due to a decrease in interest income as a result of a decline in weighted average yield from 12.3 to 11.5 while our debt portfolio at par decreased from 2.0 billion to 1.9 billion. Included in interest income are other fees such as prepayment fees and accelerated amortization of upfront fees from unscheduled paydowns, which are non-recurring in nature and increased from 2.3 million to 4.7 million period over period due to an increase in repayment activity. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, PIK income represented 12.8 and 12.3 of investment income, respectively. Other income increased period-over-period due to an increase in incremental fee income, which are fees that are generally available to us as a result of closing investments and generally paid at the time of closing. We expect that investment income will vary based on a variety of factors, including the pace of our originations and repayments.

 For the Three Months Ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 
 Net operating expenses increased to 40.2 million for the three month ended September 30, 2024 from 33.7 million for the same period ended September 30, 2023 primarily due to increases in interest expense and other general and administrative expenses, partially offset by decreases in management and performance based incentive fees. The increase in interest expense of 8.8 million was driven by the acceleration of SPV Asset Facility II s deferred financing costs upon termination and an increase in our weighted average interest rate from 6.4 to 8.2 (including the impact of fees on undrawn portions of our credit facilities) period over period. The decrease in management fees of 0.3 million is due to a decrease in average gross assets driven by sales and repayments of portfolio investments. The decrease in incentive fees is due to a decrease in investment income period over period. 
 For the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 
 Net operating expenses remained flat at 112.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 for the same period ended September 30, 2023 primarily due to decreases in recoupment of expense support, management fees and incentive fees, offset by an increase in interest expense. The increase in interest expense of 16.7 million was driven by the acceleration of SPV Asset Facility II s deferred financing costs upon termination and an increase in our weighted average interest rate from 6.2 to 8.4 (including the impact of fees on undrawn portions of our credit facilities) period over period. The decrease in recoupment of expense support is due to the termination of the Expense Support Agreement on November 7, 2023. The decrease in management fees of 1.7 million is due to a decrease in average gross assets driven by sales and repayments of portfolio investments. The decrease in incentive fees is due to a decrease in investment income period over period. 

Net Unrealized Gain (Loss)

 96 

For the Three Months Ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 
 For the three months ended September 30, 2024, the net unrealized gain was primarily driven by a reversal of a prior period unrealized loss that was realized during the period in connection with the restructuring of a debt investment and increases in the fair value of certain equity investments, partially offset by decreases in the fair value of certain debt investments as further detailed below.

For the three months ended September 30, 2023, net appreciation on investments was primarily driven by an increase in the fair value of our debt portfolio as compared to June 30, 2023. As of September 30, 2023, the fair value of our debt investments as a percentage of principal was 97.6 as compared to 97.3 as of June 30, 2023. The primary driver of our portfolio s net unrealized gain was due to the current market conditions and credit improvements.

 For the nine months ended September 30, 2023, the net appreciation on investment was primarily driven by a increase in the fair value of our debt investments as compared to December 31, 2022. As of September 30, 2023, the fair value of our debt investments as a percentage of principal was 97.6 as compared to 96.9 as of December 31, 2022. The primary driver of our portfolio s net unrealized gain for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 was due to market conditions, including credit spreads tightening, and reversals of prior period unrealized losses that were realized during the period in connection with the restructuring of certain debt investments.

Realized Gross Internal Rate of Return 
 Since we began investing in 2017 through September 30, 2024, our exited investments have resulted in an aggregate cash flow realized gross internal rate of return to us of approximately 9.4 (based on total capital invested of 2.5 billion and total proceeds from these exited investments of 3.0 billion). 
 IRR is a measure of our discounted cash flows (inflows and outflows). Specifically, IRR is the discount rate at which the net present value of all cash flows is equal to zero. That is, IRR is the discount rate at which the present value of total capital invested in each of our investments is equal to the present value of all realized returns from that investment. Our IRR calculations are unaudited. 
 Capital invested, with respect to an investment, represents the aggregate cost basis allocable to the realized or unrealized portion of the investment, net of any upfront fees paid at closing for the term loan portion of the investment. 
 Realized returns, with respect to an investment, represents the total cash received with respect to each investment, including all amortization payments, interest, dividends, prepayment fees, upfront fees (except upfront fees paid at closing for the term loan portion of an investment), administrative fees, agent fees, amendment fees, accrued interest, and other fees and proceeds. 
 Gross IRR, with respect to an investment, is calculated based on the dates that we invested capital and dates we received distributions, regardless of when we made distributions to our shareholders. Initial investments are assumed to occur at time zero. 
 Gross IRR reflects historical results relating to our past performance and is not necessarily indicative of our future results. In addition, gross IRR does not reflect the effect of management fees, expenses, incentive fees or taxes borne, or to be borne, by us or our shareholders, and would be lower if it did. 
 Aggregate cash flow realized gross IRR on our exited investments reflects only invested and realized cash amounts as described above and does not reflect any unrealized gains or losses in our portfolio. 
 
 Financial Condition, Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 Our liquidity and capital resources are generated primarily from the net proceeds of any offering of our common stock and from cash flows from interest, dividends and fees earned from our investments and principal repayments and proceeds from sales of our 
 99 

investments. The primary uses of our cash are for (i) investments in portfolio companies and other investments and to comply with certain portfolio diversification requirements, (ii) the cost of operations (including paying our Adviser), (iii) debt service, repayment and other financing costs of any borrowings and (iv) cash distributions to the holders of our shares. 
 We may from time to time enter into additional credit facilities, increase the size of our existing credit facilities or issue additional debt securities. Any such incurrence or issuance would be subject to prevailing market conditions, our liquidity requirements, contractual and regulatory restrictions and other factors. In accordance with the 1940 Act, with certain limited exceptions, we are only allowed to incur borrowings, issue debt securities or issue preferred stock, if immediately after the borrowing or issuance, the ratio of total assets (less total liabilities other than indebtedness) to total indebtedness plus preferred stock, is at least 200 (or 150 if certain conditions are met). In addition, from time to time, we may seek to retire, repurchase, or exchange debt securities in open market purchases or by other means, including privately negotiated transactions, in each case dependent on market conditions, liquidity, contractual obligations, and other matters. The amounts involved in any such transactions, individually or in the aggregate, may be material. 
 As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, our asset coverage ratios were 220 and 239 , respectively. We seek to carefully consider our unfunded commitments for the purpose of planning our ongoing financial leverage. Further, we maintain sufficient borrowing capacity within the 200 (or 150 if certain conditions are met) asset coverage limitation to cover any outstanding unfunded commitments we are required to fund. 
 Cash as of September 30, 2024, taken together with our available debt of 125.3 million, is expected to be sufficient for our investing activities and to conduct our operations in the near term. Our long-term cash needs will include principal payments on outstanding indebtedness and funding of additional portfolio investments. Funding for long-term cash needs will come from unused net proceeds from financing activities. We believe that our liquidity and sources of capital are adequate to satisfy our short and long-term cash requirements. We cannot, however, be certain that these sources of funds will be available at a time and upon terms acceptable to us in sufficient amounts in the future. 
 
 As of September 30, 2024, we had 62.6 million in cash. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, cash provided by operating activities was 61.2 million, primarily as a result of selldowns and repayments of portfolio investments of 539.2 million and other operating activities of 52.5 million, partially offset by funding portfolio investments of 530.5 million. Lastly, we used 124.9 million of cash for financing activities during the period, as a result of distributions paid of 45.6 million and repurchased shares of 125.6 million, partially offset by net borrowings of 52.7 million, net of deferred financing costs of 6.4 million.

Distributions 
 Our Board has authorized and declared weekly distribution amounts per share of common stock through June 30, 2021, and monthly and/or quarterly distribution amounts per share of common stock thereafter, in each case payable monthly and/or quarterly in arrears. The following table presents cash distributions per share that were declared for the following periods:

 During certain periods, our distributions may exceed our earnings. As a result, it is possible that a portion of the distributions we make may represent a return of capital. A return of capital generally is a return of a shareholder s investment rather than a return of earnings or gains derived from our investment activities. Each year a statement on Form 1099-DIV identifying the tax character of the distributions will be mailed to our shareholders. The tax character of the distributions are not determined until the Company s taxable year end.

 With respect to distributions, we have adopted an opt-in dividend reinvestment plan for common shareholders. As a result, in the event of a declared distribution, each shareholder that has not opted-in to the dividend reinvestment plan will have their 
 103 

dividends or distributions automatically received in cash rather than reinvested in additional shares of our common stock. Shareholders who receive distributions in the form of shares of common stock will be subject to the same U.S. federal, state and local tax consequences as if they received cash distributions. 
 We may fund our cash distributions to shareholders from any source of funds available to us, including but not limited to offering proceeds, net investment income from operations, capital gains proceeds from the sale of assets, dividends or other distributions paid to us on account of preferred and common equity investments in portfolio companies and, prior to November 7, 2023, expense support from the Adviser. In no event, however, will funds be advanced or borrowed for purpose of distributions, if the amount of such distributions would exceed our accrued and received net revenues for the previous four quarters, less paid and accrued operating expenses with respect to such revenues and costs. 
 Through November 7, 2023, the termination date of the Expense Support Agreement by the Adviser, a portion of our distributions resulted from expense support from the Adviser which were subject to repayment by us within three years from the date of payment. The purpose of this arrangement was to avoid distributions being characterized as a return of capital for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Shareholders should understand that any such distributions were not based on our investment performance and can only be sustained if we achieve positive investment performance in future periods and/or the Adviser continues to provide expense support. Shareholders should also understand that our future repayments of expense support will reduce the distributions that they would otherwise receive. There can be no assurance that we will achieve the performance necessary to sustain these distributions or be able to pay distributions at all. 
 Sources of distributions, other than net investment income and realized gains on a U.S. GAAP basis, include required adjustments to U.S. GAAP net investment income in the current period to determine taxable income available for distributions. The tables below reflect the sources of cash distributions on a U.S. GAAP basis that we have declared on our shares of common stock during the following periods: 
 Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 Source of Distribution Per Share Amount Percentage in thousands, except per share amounts) Net investment income 0.59 80,286 96.5 Net realized gain on investments Distributions in excess of (undistributed) net investment income and realized gains 0.02 2,899 3.5 Total 0.61 83,185 100.0

 Share Repurchases 
 In the third quarter of 2017, we began offering, and on a quarterly basis, intend to continue offering, to repurchase shares of our common stock on such terms as may be determined by our Board in its complete discretion. The Board has complete discretion to determine whether we will engage in any share repurchase, and if so, the terms of such repurchase. At the discretion of our Board, we may use cash on hand, cash available from borrowings, and cash from the sale of our investments as of the end of the applicable period to repurchase shares. 
 All shares purchased by us pursuant to the terms of each offer to repurchase will be retired and thereafter will be authorized and unissued shares. 
 
 104 

Any periodic repurchase offers are subject in part to our available cash and compliance with the BDC and RIC qualification and diversification rules promulgated under the 1940 Act and the Code, respectively. While we intend to continue to conduct quarterly tender offers as described above, we are not required to do so and may suspend or terminate the share repurchase program at any time.

 Total Return Since Inception 
 Cumulative total return for the period April 4, 2017 to September 30, 2024 was 72.9 (without upfront sales load) and 64.3 (with maximum upfront sales load). The following table presents cumulative total returns for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, rolling 1-year, 3-year and 5-year periods and since inception.

 ______________ 
 (1) Compounded monthly. 
 (2) Unless otherwise indicated, total return is calculated as the change in net asset value NAV per share (assuming dividends and distributions, if any, are reinvested in accordance with the Company s dividend reinvestment plan), if any, divided by the beginning NAV per share. 
 (3) For the purposes of calculating total return for periods starting prior to the termination of our continuous public offering on April 30, 2021, beginning NAV is equal to the net offering price in effect at that time . 
 Past performance does not guarantee future results. Returns reflect reinvestment of distributions and the deduction of ongoing expenses that are borne by investors, such as management fees, incentive fees, interest expense, offering costs, professional fees, director fees and other general and administrative expenses. An investment in the Company is subject to a maximum upfront sales load of 5 of the offering price, which will reduce the amount of capital available for investment. Operating expenses may vary in the future based on the unpredictable variables.

(6) SPV Asset Facility II was terminated in 2024. 
 
 SPV Asset Facilities 
 Certain of our wholly owned subsidiaries are parties to credit facilities (the SPV Asset Facilities ). Pursuant to the SPV Asset Facilities, we sell and contribute certain investments to these wholly owned subsidiaries pursuant to sale and contribution agreements by and between us and the wholly owned subsidiaries. No gain or loss is recognized as a result of these contributions. Proceeds from the SPV Asset Facilities are used to finance the origination and acquisition of eligible assets by the wholly owned subsidiary, including the purchase of such assets from us. We retain a residual interest in assets contributed to or acquired to the wholly owned subsidiary through our ownership of the wholly owned subsidiary. 
 The SPV Asset Facilities are secured by a perfected first priority security interest in the assets of these wholly owned subsidiaries and on any payments received by such wholly owned subsidiaries in respect of those assets. Assets pledged to lenders under the SPV Asset Facilities will not be available to pay our debts. 
 The SPV Asset Facilities contain customary covenants, including certain limitations on the incurrence by us of additional indebtedness and on our ability to make distributions to our shareholders, or redeem, repurchase or retire shares of stock, upon the occurrence of certain events, and customary events of default (with customary cure and notice provisions).

The Adviser will serve as collateral manager for the CLO XIII Issuer under a collateral management agreement dated as of the CLO XIII Closing Date (the CLO XIII Collateral Management Agreement ). The Adviser is entitled to receive fees for providing these services. The Adviser has waived its right to receive such fees but may rescind such waiver at any time; provided, however, that if the Adviser rescinds such waiver, the management fee payable to the Adviser pursuant to the Investment Advisory Agreement will be offset by the amount of the collateral management fee attributable to the CLO XIII Issuer s equity or notes owned by us. For further details, see ITEM 1. Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements Note 5. Debt.

 Related Party Transactions 
 We have entered into a number of business relationships with affiliated or related parties, including the following: 
 the Investment Advisory Agreement; 
 the Administration Agreement; 
 the Expense Support Agreement; and 
 the License Agreement. 
 In addition to the aforementioned agreements, we, our Adviser and certain of our Adviser s affiliates have been granted exemptive relief by the SEC to permit us to co-invest with other funds managed by the Adviser or its affiliates in a manner consistent with our investment objective, positions, policies, strategies and restrictions as well as regulatory requirements and other pertinent factors. See ITEM 1. Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements Note 3. Agreements and Related Party Transaction s for further details. 
 
 We invest in Credit SLF, a controlled affiliated investment, as defined in the 1940 Act. See ITEM 1. - Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements - Note 3. Agreements and Related Party Transactions for further details. 

Critical Accounting Policies 
 The preparation of the consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses. Changes in the economic environment, financial markets, and any other parameters used in determining such estimates could cause actual results to differ. Our critical accounting policies should be read in connection with our risk factors as disclosed in our Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023 in ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS . 
 Investments at Fair Value 
 Investment transactions are recorded on the trade date. Realized gains or losses are measured by the difference between the net proceeds received (excluding prepayment fees, if any) and the amortized cost basis of the investment using the specific identification method without regard to unrealized gains or losses previously recognized, and include investments charged off during the period, net of recoveries. The net change in unrealized gains or losses primarily reflects the change in investment values, including the reversal of previously recorded unrealized gains or losses with respect to investments realized during the period. 
 Rule 2a-5 under the 1940 Act establishes requirements for determining fair value in good faith for purposes of the 1940 Act. Pursuant to Rule 2a-5, the Board designated the Adviser as our valuation designee to perform fair value determinations relating to the value of assets we held for which market quotations are not readily available. 
 Investments for which market quotations are readily available are typically valued at the average bid price of those market quotations. To validate market quotations, we utilize a number of factors to determine if the quotations are representative of fair value, including the source and number of the quotations. Debt and equity securities that are not publicly traded or whose market prices are not readily available, as is the case for substantially all of our investments, are valued at fair value as determined in good faith by our Adviser, as valuation designee, based on, among other things, the input of the independent third-party valuation firm(s) engaged at the direction of our Adviser. 
 
 118 

As part of the valuation process, our Adviser, as valuation designee, takes into account relevant factors in determining the fair value of our investments, including: the estimated enterprise value of a portfolio company (i.e., the total fair value of the portfolio company s debt and equity), the nature and realizable value of any collateral, the portfolio company s ability to make payments based on its earnings and cash flow, the markets in which the portfolio company does business, a comparison of the portfolio company s securities to any similar publicly traded securities, and overall changes in the interest rate environment and the credit markets that may affect the price at which similar investments may be made in the future. When an external event such as a purchase transaction, public offering or subsequent equity sale occurs, the Board considers whether the pricing indicated by the external event corroborates its valuation. 
 Our Adviser, as valuation designee, undertakes a multi-step valuation process, which includes, among other procedures, the following: 
 With respect to investments for which market quotations are readily available, those investments will typically be valued at the average bid price of those market quotations; 
 With respect to investments for which market quotations are not readily available, the valuation process begins with the independent valuation firm(s) providing a preliminary valuation of each investment to the Adviser s valuation committee; 
 Preliminary valuation conclusions are documented and discussed with the Adviser s valuation committee; and 
 Our Adviser, as the valuation designee, reviews the recommended valuations and determines the fair value of each investment; 
 Each quarter, our Adviser, as the valuation designee, provides the Audit Committee a summary or description of material fair value matters that occurred in the prior quarter and on an annual basis, our Adviser, as the valuation designee, will provide the Audit Committee with a written assessment of the adequacy and effectiveness of its fair value process; and 
 The Audit Committee oversees the valuation designee and will report to the Board on any valuation matters requiring the Board s attention. 
 We conduct this valuation process on a quarterly basis. 
 We apply Financial Accounting Standards Board Accounting Standards Codification 820, Fair Value Measurements ASC 820 ), as amended, which establishes a framework for measuring fair value in accordance with U.S. GAAP and required disclosures of fair value measurements. ASC 820 determines fair value to be the price that would be received for an investment in a current sale, which assumes an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. Market participants are defined as buyers and sellers in the principal or most advantageous market (which may be a hypothetical market) that are independent, knowledgeable, and willing and able to transact. In accordance with ASC 820, we consider its principal market to be the market that has the greatest volume and level of activity. ASC 820 specifies a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes and ranks the level of observability of inputs used in determination of fair value. In accordance with ASC 820, these levels are summarized below: 
 Level 1 Valuations based on quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that we have the ability to access. 
 Level 2 Valuations based on quoted prices in markets that are not active or for which all significant inputs are observable, either directly or indirectly. 
 Level 3 Valuations based on inputs that are unobservable and significant to the overall fair value measurement. 
 Transfers between levels, if any, are recognized at the beginning of the period in which the transfer occurred. In addition to using the above inputs in investment valuations, we apply the valuation policy approved by our Board that is consistent with ASC 820. Consistent with the valuation policy, our Adviser, as the valuation designee, evaluates the source of the inputs, including any markets in which our investments are trading (or any markets in which securities with similar attributes are trading), in determining fair value. When an investment is valued based on prices provided by reputable dealers or pricing services (that is, broker quotes), our Adviser, as the valuation designee, subjects those prices to various criteria in making the determination as to whether a particular investment would qualify for treatment as a Level 2 or Level 3 investment. For example, our Adviser, as the valuation designee, or the independent valuation firm(s), reviews pricing support provided by dealers or pricing services in order to determine if observable market information is being used, versus unobservable inputs. 
 The Company applies the practical expedient provided by the ASC Topic 820 relating to investments in certain entities that calculate net asset value per share (or its equivalent). ASC Topic 820 permits an entity holding investments in certain entities that either are investment companies, or have attributes similar to an investment company, and calculate NAV per share or its equivalent for which the fair value is not readily determinable, to measure the fair value of such investments on the basis of that NAV per share, or its equivalent, without adjustment. Investments which are valued using NAV per share as a practical expedient are not categorized within the fair value hierarchy as per ASC Topic 820. 
 Due to the inherent uncertainty of determining the fair value of investments that do not have a readily available market value, the fair value of our investments may fluctuate from period to period. Additionally, the fair value of such investments may differ 
 119 

significantly from the values that would have been used had a ready market existed for such investments and may differ materially from the values that may ultimately be realized. Further, such investments are generally less liquid than publicly traded securities and may be subject to contractual and other restrictions on resale. If we were required to liquidate a portfolio investment in a forced or liquidation sale, we could realize amounts that are different from the amounts presented and such differences could be material. 
 In addition, changes in the market environment and other events that may occur over the life of the investments may cause the gains or losses ultimately realized on these investments to be different than the unrealized gains or losses reflected herein. 
 Financial and Derivative Instruments 
 Rule 18f-4 requires BDCs that use derivatives to, among other things, comply with a value-at-risk leverage limit, adopt a derivatives risk management program, and implement certain testing and board reporting procedures. Rule 18f-4 exempts BDCs that qualify as limited derivatives users from the aforementioned requirements, provided that these BDCs adopt written policies and procedures that are reasonably designed to manage the BDC s derivatives risks and comply with certain recordkeeping requirements. Rule 18f-4 provides that a BDC may enter into an unfunded commitment agreement that is not a derivatives transaction, such as an agreement to provide financing to a portfolio company, if the BDC has, among other things, a reasonable belief, at the time it enters into such an agreement, that it will have sufficient cash and cash equivalents to meet its obligations with respect to all of its unfunded commitment agreements, in each case as it becomes due. Pursuant to Rule 18f-4, when we trade reverse repurchase agreements or similar financing transactions, including certain tender option bonds, we need to aggregate the amount of any other senior securities representing indebtedness (e.g., bank borrowings, if applicable) when calculating our asset coverage ratio. The Company currently qualifies as a limited derivatives user and expects to continue to do so. The Company has adopted a derivatives policy and complies with the recordkeeping requirements of Rule 18f-4. 
 Interest and Dividend Income Recognition 
 Interest income is recorded on the accrual basis and includes accretion and amortization of discounts or premiums. Certain investments may have contractual PIK interest or dividends, the majority of which is structured at initial underwriting. PIK interest or dividends represent accrued interest or dividends that are added to the principal amount or liquidation amount of the investment on the respective interest or dividend payment dates rather than being paid in cash and generally becomes due at maturity or at the occurrence of a liquidation event. Discounts and premiums to par value on securities purchased are accreted or amortized into interest income over the contractual life of the respective security using the effective yield method. The amortized cost of investments represents the original cost adjusted for the accretion or amortization of discounts or premiums, if any. Upon prepayment of a loan or debt security, any prepayment premiums, unamortized upfront loan origination fees and unamortized discounts are recorded as interest income in the current period. 
 Loans are generally placed on non-accrual status when there is reasonable doubt that principal or interest will be collected in full. Accrued interest is generally reversed when a loan is placed on non-accrual status. Interest payments received on non-accrual loans may be recognized as income or applied to principal depending upon management s judgment regarding collectability. If at any point we believe PIK interest or dividends are not expected to be realized, the investment generating PIK interest or dividends will be placed on non-accrual status. When a PIK investment is placed on non-accrual status, the accrued, uncapitalized interest or dividends are generally reversed through interest income. Non-accrual loans are restored to accrual status when past due principal and interest is paid current and, in management s judgment, are likely to remain current. Management may make exceptions to this treatment and determine to not place a loan on non-accrual status if the loan has sufficient collateral value and is in the process of collection. 
 Dividend income on preferred equity securities is recorded on the accrual basis to the extent that such amounts are payable by the portfolio company and are expected to be collected. Dividend income on common equity securities is recorded on the record date for private portfolio companies or on the ex-dividend date for publicly-traded portfolio companies.

Distributions 
 We have elected to be treated for U.S. federal income tax purposes, and intend to qualify annually, as a RIC under Subchapter M of the Code. To obtain and maintain our tax treatment as a RIC, we must distribute (or be deemed to distribute) in each taxable year distributions for tax purposes equal to at least the sum of : 
 90 of our investment company taxable income (which is generally our ordinary income plus the excess of realized short-term capital gains over realized net long-term capital losses), determined without regard to the deduction for dividends paid, for such taxable year; and 
 90 of our net tax-exempt interest income (which is the excess of our gross tax exempt interest income over certain disallowed deductions) for such taxable year. 
 As a RIC, we (but not our shareholders) generally will not be subject to U.S. federal tax on investment company taxable income and net capital gains that we distribute to our shareholders. 
 We intend to distribute annually all or substantially all of such income. To the extent that we retain our net capital gains or any investment company taxable income, we generally will be subject to U.S. federal income tax at corporate rates. We can be expected to carry forward our net capital gains or any investment company taxable income in excess of current year dividend distributions and pay the U.S. federal excise tax as described below. 
 Amounts not distributed on a timely basis in accordance with a calendar year distribution requirement are subject to a nondeductible 4 U.S. federal excise tax payable by us. We may be subject to a nondeductible 4 U.S. federal excise tax if we do not distribute (or are treated as distributing) during each calendar year an amount at least equal to the sum of: 
 98 of our net ordinary income excluding certain ordinary gains or losses for that calendar year; 
 98.2 of our capital gain net income, adjusted for certain ordinary gains and losses, recognized for the twelve-month period ending on October 31 of that calendar year; and 
 100 of any income or gains recognized, but not distributed, in preceding years. 
 While we intend to distribute any income and capital gains in the manner necessary to minimize imposition of the 4 U.S. federal excise tax, sufficient amounts of our taxable income and capital gains may not be distributed and as a result, in such cases, the excise tax will be imposed. In such an event, we will be liable for this tax only on the amount by which we do not meet the foregoing distribution requirement. 
 We intend to pay monthly distributions to our shareholders out of assets legally available for distribution. All distributions will be paid at the discretion of our Board and will depend on our earnings, financial condition, maintenance of our tax treatment as a RIC, compliance with applicable BDC regulations and such other factors as our Board may deem relevant from time to time. 
 To the extent our current taxable earnings for a year fall below the total amount of our distributions for that year, a portion of those distributions may be deemed a return of capital to our shareholders for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Thus, the source of a distribution to our shareholders may be the original capital invested by the shareholder rather than our income or gains. Shareholders should read written disclosure carefully and should not assume that the source of any distribution is our ordinary income or gains. 
 With respect to distributions, the Company has adopted an opt-in dividend reinvestment plan for common shareholders. As a result, in the event of a declared distribution, each shareholder that has not opted-in to the dividend reinvestment plan will have their dividends or distributions automatically received in cash rather than reinvested in additional shares of our common stock. Shareholders who receive distributions in the form of shares of common stock will be subject to the same U.S. federal, state and local tax consequences as if they received cash distributions. 
 Income Taxes 
 We have elected to be treated as a BDC under the 1940 Act. We have also elected to be treated as a RIC under the Code beginning with our taxable year ended December 31, 2017 and intend to continue to qualify for tax treatment as a RIC. So long as we maintain our tax treatment as a RIC, we generally will not pay U.S. federal income taxes at corporate rates on any ordinary income or capital gains that we distribute at least annually to our shareholders as distributions. Rather, any tax liability related to income earned and distributed by us represents obligations of our investors and will not be reflected in our consolidated financial statements. 
 
 121 

To qualify as a RIC, we must, among other things, meet certain source-of-income and asset diversification requirements. In addition, to qualify for RIC tax treatment, we generally must distribute to our shareholders, for each taxable year, at least 90 of our investment company taxable income for that year, which is generally our ordinary income plus the excess of our realized net short-term capital gains over our realized net long-term capital losses. In addition, a RIC may, in certain cases, satisfy this distribution requirement by distributing dividends relating to a taxable year after the close of such taxable year under the spillover dividend provisions of Subchapter M. In order for us to not be subject to U.S. federal excise taxes, we must distribute annually an amount at least equal to the sum of (i) 98 of our net ordinary income (taking into account certain deferrals and elections) for the calendar year, (ii) 98.2 of our capital gains in excess of capital losses for the one-year period ending on October 31 of the calendar year and (iii) any net ordinary income and capital gains in excess of capital losses for preceding years that were not distributed during such years. We, at our discretion, may carry forward taxable income in excess of calendar year dividends and pay a 4 nondeductible U.S. excise tax on this income. 
 Certain of our consolidated subsidiaries are subject to U.S. federal and state corporate-level income taxes. 
 We evaluate tax positions taken or expected to be taken in the course of preparing our consolidated financial statements to determine whether the tax positions are more-likely-than-not to be sustained by the applicable tax authority. Tax positions not deemed to meet the more-likely-than-not threshold are reserved and recorded as a tax benefit or expense in the current year. All penalties and interest associated with income taxes are included in income tax expense. Conclusions regarding tax positions are subject to review and may be adjusted at a later date based on factors including, but not limited to, on-going analyses of tax laws, regulations and interpretations thereof. There were no material uncertain tax positions through December 31, 2023. As applicable, our prior three tax years remain subject to examination by U.S. federal, state and local tax authorities.

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk. 
 We are subject to financial market risks, including valuation risk, interest rate risk, currency risk, credit risk and inflation risk. 
 Valuation Risk 
 We have invested, and plan to continue to invest, primarily in illiquid debt and equity securities of private companies. Most of our investments will not have a readily available market price, and we value these investments at fair value as determined in good faith by our Adviser, as our valuation designee, based on, among other things, the input of independent third-party valuation firm(s) engaged at the direction of our Adviser, as our valuation designee, and in accordance with our valuation policy. There is no single standard for determining fair value. As a result, determining fair value requires that judgment be applied to the specific facts and circumstances of each portfolio investment while employing a consistently applied valuation process for the types of investments we make. If we were required to liquidate a portfolio investment in a forced or liquidation sale, we may realize amounts that are different from the amounts presented and such differences could be material. 
 Interest Rate Risk 
 Interest rate sensitivity refers to the change in earnings that may result from changes in the level of interest rates. We intend to fund portions of our investments with borrowings, and at such time, our net investment income will be affected by the difference between the rate at which we invest and the rate at which we borrow. Accordingly, we cannot assure you that a significant change in market interest rates will not have a material adverse effect on our net investment income. 
 In a low interest rate environment, the difference between the total interest income earned on interest earning assets and the total interest expense incurred on interest bearing liabilities may be compressed, reducing our net income and potentially adversely affecting our operating results. Conversely, in a rising interest rate environment, such difference could potentially increase thereby increasing our net income as indicated per the table below. 
 As of September 30, 2024, 97.0 of our debt investments based on fair value in our portfolio were at floating rates. Additionally, the weighted average SOFR floor, based on fair value, of our debt investments was 0.8 . The Revolving Credit Facility, SPV Asset Facility, and CLO XIII bear interest at variable rates with interest floors of 0.0 . The 2024 Notes and 2026 Notes bear interest at fixed rate. 
 Based on our Consolidated Statements of Assets and Liabilities as of September 30, 2024, the following table shows the annualized impact on net income of hypothetical base rate changes in interest rates on our debt investments (considering interest rate floors for floating rate instruments) assuming each floating rate investment is subject to 3 month reference rate election and there are no changes in our investment and borrowing structure. 
 in millions) Interest Income Interest Expense Net Income (1) 
 Up 300 basis points 55.5 (14.9) 40.6 Up 200 basis points 37.0 (10.0) 27.0 Up 100 basis points 18.5 (5.0) 13.5 Down 100 basis points (18.5) 5.0 (13.5) Down 200 basis points (37.0) 10.0 (27.0) Down 300 basis points (55.5) 14.9 (40.6) 
 _____________________ 
 (1) Excludes the impact of income based fees. See Note 3 of our consolidated financial statements for more information on the income based fees. 
 We may hedge against interest rate fluctuations by using hedging instruments such as additional interest rate swaps, futures, options, and forward contracts. While hedging activities may mitigate our exposure to adverse fluctuations in interest rates, certain hedging transactions, such as interest rate swap agreements, may also limit our ability to participate in the benefits of lower interest rates. 
 
 123 

Currency Risk 
 From time to time, we may make investments that are denominated in a foreign currency, borrow in certain foreign currencies under our credit facilities or issue notes in certain foreign currencies. These investments, borrowings and issuances are translated into U.S. dollars at each balance sheet date, exposing us to movements in foreign exchange rates. We may employ hedging techniques to minimize these risks, but we cannot assure you that such strategies will be effective or without risk to us. We may utilize instruments such as, but not limited to, forward contracts or cross currency swaps to seek to hedge against fluctuations in the relative values of our portfolio positions from changes in currency exchange rates. Instead of entering into a foreign currency forward contract in connection with loans or other investments denominated in a foreign currency, we may borrow in that currency to establish a natural hedge against our loan, issuance or investment. To the extent the loan,issuance or investment is based on a floating rate other than a rate under which we can borrow under our credit facilities, we may utilize interest rate derivatives to hedge our exposure to changes in the associated rate. 
 Credit Risk 
 We generally endeavor to minimize our risk of exposure by limiting to reputable financial institutions the counterparties with which we enter into financial transactions. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we held the majority of our cash 
 balances with a single highly rated money center bank and such balances are in excess of Federal Deposit Insurance 
 Corporation insured limits. We seek to mitigate this exposure by monitoring the credit standing of these financial institutions. 
 Inflation Risk 
 Inflation is likely to continue in the near to medium-term, particularly in the United States, with the possibility that monetary policy may continue to tighten in response. Persistent inflationary pressures could affect our portfolio companies profit margins. 
 
 Item 4. Controls and Procedures 
 (a) Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 In accordance with Rules 13a-15(b) and 15d-15(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the Exchange Act ), as amended, we, under the supervision and with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, carried out an evaluation of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) and Rule 15d-15(e) of the Exchange Act) as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and determined that our disclosure controls and procedures are effective as of the end of the period covered by the Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. 
 (b) Changes in Internal Controls Over Financial Reporting 
 There have been no changes in our internal controls over financial reporting that occurred during the quarter ended September 30, 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 

124 

PART II. OTHER INFORMATION 
 
 Item 1. Legal Proceedings 
 Neither we nor the Adviser are currently subject to any material legal proceedings, nor, to our knowledge, are any material legal proceeding threatened against us. From time to time, we may be a party to certain legal proceedings in the ordinary course of business, including proceedings relating to the enforcement of our rights under contracts with our portfolio companies. Our business is also subject to extensive regulation, which may result in regulatory proceedings against us. While the outcome of any such future legal or regulatory proceedings cannot be predicted with certainty, we do not expect that any such future proceedings will have a material effect upon our financial condition or results of operations. 
 
 Item 1A. Risk Factors. 
 In addition to the other information set forth in this report, you should carefully consider the risk factors discussed in Part I, ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023, which could materiality affect our business, financial condition and/or operating results. The risks described in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023 are not the only risks facing us. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial also may materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and/or operating results. 

Item 2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds. 
 In order to satisfy the reinvestment portion of our dividends for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we issued the following shares of common stock to stockholders of record on the dates noted below. These issuances were not subject to the registration requirements of the Securities Act. 
 Date of Issuance Record Date Number of Shares Purchase Price per Share January 30, 2024 December 31, 2023 213,228 9.03 January 31, 2024 January 30, 2024 431,463 9.01 February 28, 2024 February 27, 2024 431,753 9.01 March 27, 2024 March 26, 2024 420,004 9.01 May 1, 2024 April 30, 2024 420,937 8.99 May 13, 2024 March 31, 2024 209,715 8.99 May 29, 2024 May 28, 2024 424,861 8.99 June 26, 2024 June 25, 2024 425,419 9.00 July 31, 2024 July 30, 2024 417,972 8.91 August 13, 2024 June 30, 2024 139,068 8.90 August 28, 2024 August 27, 2024 421,784 8.91 September 25, 2024 September 24, 2024 414,999 8.85 
 In the third quarter of 2017, we began offering, and on a quarterly basis, intend to continue offering, to repurchase shares of our common stock on such terms as may be determined by our Board in its complete discretion. The Board has complete discretion to determine whether we will engage in any share repurchase, and if so, the terms of such repurchase. At the discretion of our Board, the Company may use cash on hand, cash available from borrowings, and cash from the sale of our investments as of the end of the applicable period to repurchase shares. The purpose of the offers to repurchase is to provide shareholders with the potential for a measure of liquidity since there is otherwise no public market for shares of our common stock. 
 All shares purchased by us pursuant to the terms of each offer to repurchase will be retired and thereafter will be authorized and unissued shares. 
 125 

Any periodic repurchase offers are subject in part to our available cash and compliance with the BDC and RIC qualification and diversification rules promulgated under the 1940 Act and the Code, respectively. While we intend to continue to conduct quarterly tender offers as described above, we are not required to do so and may suspend or terminate the share repurchase program at any time. 
 The following provides information regarding repurchases of our shares:
