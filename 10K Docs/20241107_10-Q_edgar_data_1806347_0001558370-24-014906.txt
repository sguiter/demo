 CAUTIONARY NOTE REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q includes forward-looking statements as defined under U.S. federal securities laws. Forward-looking statements include all statements that are not historical statements of fact and statements including, but not limited to, the following statements regarding our expectations, hopes, beliefs, intentions or strategies regarding the future, our expectations regarding the build-out of operations and commercialization of customers within the anticipated time frame of our Conway, Arkansas facility and our ability to sell or commit capacity; our expectations regarding capital expenditures; our future liquidity needs and access to capital; and our expectations regarding remediation of the material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting. In addition, any statements that refer to projections, forecasts, or other characterizations of future events or circumstances, including any underlying assumptions, are forward-looking statements. The words anticipate, believe, could, estimate, expect, intend, may, might, plan, possible, potential, predict, project, would, and similar expressions may identify forward-looking statements, but the absence of these words does not mean that a statement is not forward-looking. Forward-looking statements are predictions, projections and other statements about future events that are based on current expectations and assumptions and, as a result, are subject to significant risks and uncertainties. Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date they are made. Readers are cautioned not to put undue reliance on forward-looking statements, and we assume no obligation and do not intend to update or revise these forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events, or otherwise. There are or will be important factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those indicated in these forward-looking statements, including, but not limited to, risks related to the following: the fact that we have incurred net losses in the past, may incur net losses in the future, and may not achieve profitability; risks associated with operating a coffee trading business and a coffee exporting business; the volatility and increases in the cost of green coffee, tea and other ingredients and packaging, and our inability to pass these costs on to customers; our inability to secure an adequate supply of key raw materials, including green coffee and tea, or disruption in our supply chain; deterioration in general macroeconomic conditions and/or decreases in consumer spending on discretionary items; disruption in operations at any of our, our suppliers or our co-manufacturers production, distribution or manufacturing facilities or other loss of manufacturing capacity; our inability to anticipate customer preferences and successfully develop new products; climate change, which may increase commodity costs, damage our facilities and disrupt our production capabilities and supply chain; failure to retain key personnel or recruit qualified personnel; our inability to hedge commodity risks; consolidation among our distributors and customers or the loss of any key customer; complex and evolving U.S. and international laws and regulations, and noncompliance therewith subjecting us to criminal or civil liability; future acquisitions of businesses, which may divert our management s attention, prove difficult to effectively integrate and fail to achieve their projected benefits; our inability to effectively manage the growth and increased complexity of our business; our inability to maintain or grow market share through continued differentiation of our product and competitive pricing; our inability to secure the additional capital needed to operate and grow our business; our inability to successfully execute our remediation plans with regards to the material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting; future litigation or legal disputes, which could lead us to incur significant liabilities and costs or harm our reputation; a material failure, inadequacy or interruption of our information technology systems;

 the unauthorized access, theft, use or destruction of personal, financial or other confidential information relating to our customers, suppliers, employees or business; our future level of indebtedness, which may reduce funds available for other business purposes and reduce our operational flexibility; our inability to comply with the financial covenants in our credit agreement; our inability to successfully build out operations, commercialize customers, and generate positive operating cash flows within the anticipated time frame following the recent opening of our new facility in Conway, Arkansas or incurring additional expenses in the process; our corporate structure and organization, which may prevent or delay attempts to acquire a controlling interest in the Company; the fact that our largest shareholders (and certain members of our management team) own a significant percentage of our stock and will be able to exert significant control over matters subject to shareholder approval; the impact of current global economic conditions, including those caused by economic slowdowns or recessions, changes in political, economic or industry conditions, global conflicts (including the ongoing conflicts in Europe, the Middle East and Latin America), inflation, the interest rate environment, U.S. government shutdowns, downgrades to the U.S. government s sovereign credit rating or other conditions affecting the global financial and capital markets, and epidemic, pandemic or other health issues; and other risks, uncertainties and factors set forth in the Business and Risk Factors sections in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission SEC on March 15, 2024 Annual Report and in the Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and Risk Factors sections of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, as well as those described from time to time in our future reports filed with the SEC. The foregoing factors should not be construed as exhaustive and should be read together with the other cautionary statements included in the Annual Report or in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. If one or more events related to these or other risks or uncertainties materialize, or if our underlying assumptions prove to be incorrect, actual results may differ materially from what we anticipate. Many of the important factors that will determine these results are beyond our ability to control or predict. Accordingly, you should not place undue reliance on any such forward-looking statements. Any forward-looking statement speaks only as of the date on which it is made, and, except as otherwise required by law, we do not undertake any obligation to publicly update or review any forward-looking statement, whether as a result of new information, future developments or otherwise. New factors emerge from time to time, and it is not possible for us to predict which will arise. In addition, we cannot assess the impact of each factor on our business or the extent to which any factor, or combination of factors, may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statements.

Beverage Solutions: Through this segment, we combine our product innovation and customer insights to provide value-added beverage solutions, including coffee, tea, flavors, extracts and ingredients. We provide products in a variety of packaging, including branded and private label coffee in bags, fractional packs, and single serve cups, as well as extract solutions to be used in products such as cold brew and ready-to-drink offerings. Currently, we serve customers in the United States, Europe and Asia, through the retail, food service and restaurant, convenience store and travel center, non-commercial account, CPG, and hospitality industries.

Revenues primarily relate to the physical delivery and settlement of forward sales contracts for green coffee. of the equity interests of Falcon Coffees Limited Falcon that it did not previously own, resulting in Falcon becoming a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company. Aggregate consideration paid for the interest totaled million and included million in cash and shares of common stock, par value per share, of the Company Common Shares ). Due to the Company s controlling financial interest in Falcon prior to the purchase, the transaction was accounted for as an equity transaction. For periods prior to April 3, 2023, equity interests not owned by us are reflected as non-controlling interests. In the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations, we allocate net income (loss) attributable to non-controlling interest to arrive at net income (loss) attributable to common shareholders based on their proportionate share. Falcon operates our trading business and is reported within our Sustainable Sourcing Traceability segment. The interim financial information is unaudited but, in the opinion of management, all adjustments (consisting of normal recurring accruals) considered necessary for fair statement of results for the interim periods have been included. Operating results from any interim period are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the full fiscal year. The Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements and related notes should be read in conjunction with the audited December 31, 2023 consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission SEC on March 15, 2024. Accordingly, certain significant accounting policies and other disclosures normally provided have been omitted from the accompanying Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements and related notes since such items are disclosed in our audited financial statements.

 million and net cash outflows from operating activities of million. If we are unable to achieve our profitability growth projections and maintain our covenant leverage ratio and minimum liquidity requirements, as a result of, for example, experiencing any adverse impact of changes or further delays in the estimated timing and volume of products to be commercialized in our Conway Facility over the next twelve months, and generate sufficient cash flows from operations, it may restrict our liquidity and capital resources and our ability to maintain compliance with our financial covenants. As management s ability to amend its financial covenants cannot be assured, if necessary, management has committed to delay growth capital expenditures and/or reduce operating expenses, including headcount, salary and/or bonus reductions, all of which are in the Company s control, as necessary, in order to have adequate liquidity and to remain in compliance with its debt covenants. As further discussed in Restructuring Activities below, the Company has recently consolidated its manufacturing operations, signed a purchase and sale agreement of its West Winds facility, and executed a targeted reduction in excess workforce capacity, which were designed to improve operational efficiency. If required, the Company will further reduce operating costs to ensure compliance with its financial covenants. The accompanying Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern, which contemplates the realization of assets and satisfaction of liabilities in the ordinary course of business. to 60 days . A portion of our accounts receivable is not expected to be collected due to non-payment, bankruptcies and deductions. Our accounting policy for the allowance for credit losses requires us to reserve an amount based on the evaluation of the aging of accounts receivable, detailed analysis of high-risk customers accounts, and the overall market and economic conditions of our customers. This evaluation considers the customer demographic, such as large commercial customers as compared to small businesses or individual customers. We consider our accounts

 million, of which million have been incurred during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024. These charges primarily relate to costs to remove and re-install production equipment into other manufacturing facilities. At September 30, 2024 , the Company classified approximately million of land and buildings as held-for-sale, which are reported within prepaid expenses and other current assets on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company incurred impairment charges of approximately million and million, respectively, on equipment associated with the plant consolidations, which is reported within impairment charges on the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations. The Company is continuing to evaluate which plant assets will be moved to other manufacturing facilities and which plant assets will be disposed of; therefore, there may be additional impairment charges in the future related to the consolidation of our manufacturing facilities. In addition, during the second quarter of 2024, the Company committed to targeted restructuring activities to improve operational efficiency by reducing excess workforce capacity. As a result of this reduction, and the impacts of the consolidation of manufacturing facilities noted above, the Company recognized approximately million of one-time employee severance costs during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, which are recorded in transaction, restructuring and integration expense in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations. At September 30, 2024, approximately million of such termination benefits were accrued for within accrued expenses and other current liabilities in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets.

The Company s effective tax rate for the current period differs from the federal statutory rate primarily due to an increase in the valuation allowance against domestic deferred tax assets. The effective tax rate for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 differs from the effective tax rate for the same period in 2023 primarily due to the Company s full year forecasted ordinary income (loss) in the periods and the permanent difference for changes in the fair value of warrants. On December 20, 2021, the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development ("OECD") released Pillar Two Model Rules, which provide for a global minimum tax of 15 on multinational entities. Although the United States has not yet adopted the Pillar Two Model Rules, several foreign countries enacted Pillar Two legislation in 2023 with an initial effective date of January 1, 2024. The impact of Pillar Two legislation on the Company's 2024 effective tax rate is expected to be minimal. Management will continue to monitor future Pillar Two legislation in relevant jurisdictions for any impacts to the Company's effective tax rate.

Contract Estimates The nature of the Company s contracts gives rise to variable consideration including cash discounts, volume-based rebates, point of sale promotions, and other promotional discounts to certain customers. For all promotional programs and discounts, the Company estimates the rebate or discount that will be granted to the customer and records an accrual upon invoicing. These estimated rebates or discounts are included in the transaction price of the Company s contracts with customers as a reduction to net revenues and are included as accrued sales incentives in accrued expenses and other current liabilities in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. Accrued sales incentives were million and million at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. Other accrued deductions were million and million at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively, and are included as a reduction to accounts receivable, net in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. We do not disclose the value of unsatisfied performance obligations for contracts (i) with an original expected length of one year or less or (ii) for which the Company recognizes revenue at the amount in which it has the right to invoice as the product is delivered. Contract Balances Contract balances relate primarily to advances received from the Company s customers before revenue is recognized. The Company does not have any material contract liabilities as of September 30, 2024 or December 31, 2023.

As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, costs were capitalized as all arrangements were less than a year.

 Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations The following Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations describes the principal factors affecting the results of operations, financial condition, and changes in financial condition for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024. This discussion should be read in conjunction with the accompanying Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements, and the notes thereto set forth in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and our December 31, 2023 Audited Consolidated Financial Statements and notes thereto included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission SEC on March 15, 2024. Overview Westrock Coffee Company, a Delaware corporation (the Company, Westrock, we, us, or our ), is a leading integrated coffee, tea, flavors, extracts, and ingredients solutions provider in the United States, providing coffee sourcing, supply chain management, product development, roasting, packaging, and distribution services to the retail, food service and restaurant, convenience store and travel center, non-commercial account, CPG, and hospitality industries around the world. Our platform is built upon four fundamental pillars that enable us to positively impact the coffee, tea, flavors, extracts, and ingredients ecosystems from crop to cup: (i) we operate a fully transparent supply chain, (ii) we develop innovative beverage solutions tailored to our customers specific needs, (iii) we deliver a high quality and comprehensive set of products to our customers, and (iv) we leverage our scaled international presence to serve our blue-chip customer base. These four tenets comprise the backbone of our platform and position us as a leading provider of value-added beverage solutions. By partnering with Westrock, our customers also benefit from the benchmark-setting responsible sourcing policies and strong Environmental, Social, and Governance focus surrounding our products, top tier consumer insights, and a differentiated product ideation process. Leading brands choose us because we are singularly positioned to meet their needs, while simultaneously driving a new standard for sustainably and responsibly sourced products. We operate our business in two segments: Beverage Solutions and Sustainable Sourcing Traceability SS T ). Beverage Solutions : Through this segment, we combine our product innovation and customer insights to provide value-added beverage solutions, including coffee, tea, flavors, extracts, and ingredients. We provide products in a variety of packaging, including branded and private label coffee in bags, fractional packs, and single serve cups, as well as extract solutions to be used in products such as cold brew and ready-to-drink offerings. Currently, we serve customers in the United States, Europe, and Asia through the retail, food service and restaurant, convenience store and travel center, non-commercial account, CPG and hospitality industries. Sustainable Sourcing Traceability : Through this segment, we utilize our proprietary technology and digitally traceable supply chain to directly impact and improve the lives of our farming partners, tangible economic empowerment and an emphasis on environmental accountability and farmer literacy. Revenues primarily relate to the physical delivery and settlement of forward sales contracts for green coffee. Key Business Metrics We use Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA to evaluate our performance, identify trends, formulate financial projections, and to make strategic decisions. Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA We refer to EBITDA and Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA in our analysis of our results of operations, which are not required by, or presented in accordance with, accounting principles generally accepted in the United States GAAP ). While we believe that net (loss) income, as defined by GAAP, is the most appropriate earnings measure, we also believe that EBITDA and Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA are important non-GAAP supplemental measures of operating performance as they contribute to a meaningful evaluation of the Company s future operating performance and comparisons to the Company s past operating performance. The Company believes that providing these non-GAAP 

 41 

Table of Contents 
 financial measures helps investors evaluate the Company s operating performance, profitability and business trends in a way that is consistent with how management evaluates such performance. We define EBITDA as net (loss) income, as defined by GAAP, before interest expense, provision for income taxes and depreciation and amortization. We define Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA as EBITDA before equity-based compensation expense and the impact, which may be recurring in nature, of transaction, restructuring and integration related costs, including management services and consulting agreements entered into in connection with the acquisition of S D Coffee, Inc., impairment charges, changes in the fair value of warrant liabilities, non-cash mark-to-market adjustments, certain non-capitalizable costs necessary to place the Conway extract and ready-to-drink facility into commercial production, the write off of unamortized deferred financing costs, costs incurred as a result of the early repayment of debt, gains or losses on dispositions, and other similar or infrequent items (although we may not have had such charges in the periods presented). We believe EBITDA and Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA are important supplemental measures to net (loss) income because they provide additional information to evaluate our operating performance on an unleveraged basis. Since EBITDA and Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA are not measures calculated in accordance with GAAP, they should be viewed in addition to, and not be considered as alternatives for, net (loss) income determined in accordance with GAAP. Further, our computations of EBITDA and Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA may not be comparable to that reported by other companies that define EBITDA and Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA differently than we do. The reconciliation of our net (loss) income to EBITDA and Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 is as follows:

 The Company presents Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA as excluding certain Conway extract and ready-to-drink facility start-up costs Conway Start-up Costs ). Prior to the third quarter of 2024, Conway Start-up Costs included two categories: (i) non-capitalizable costs necessary to place production and packaging capabilities into commercial production pre-production costs ), and (ii) recurring operating costs incurred once a capability is placed into commercial production but before completion of the production scale up scale up operating costs ). Beginning in the third quarter of 2024, the Company no longer excludes scale up operating costs in the determination of Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA. Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA for the three and six months ended June 30, 2024 has been revised to exclude the impact of scale up operating costs, as follows:

The increase is primarily due to a 28.7 million increase in expenses associated with the start-up of our extract and ready-to-drink facility in Conway, Arkansas. In our SS T segment, selling, general and administrative costs were relatively unchanged compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Transaction, Restructuring and Integration Expense Transaction, restructuring and integration expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 were 9.9 million, approximately 3.5 million of which related to severance and other employee termination and benefit costs associated with the elimination of various positions as part of cost reduction objectives, 2.4 million of which related to the establishment of our at-the-market common stock offering program and 1.4 million of which related to professional and legal costs associated with the Westrock Warrant exchange. During the nine months ended September 30, 2023, we incurred 12.7 million of transaction, restructuring and integration expenses, approximately 9.7 million of which related to the costs associated with the integration of our new enterprise resource planning system, including internal and external costs related to post go-live system support and duplicative system costs and 2.0 million of non-capitalizable costs associated with acquisitions and registration statements.

 interest for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Furthermore, during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company capitalized approximately 11.1 million of interest costs associated with the build-out of our extract and ready-to-drink facility in Conway, Arkansas, compared to 1.0 million of such interest for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Change in Fair Value of Warrant Liabilities The change in fair value of warrant liabilities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 resulted in recognition of 7.1 million of gains compared to recognition of 18.8 million of gains during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Income Tax Expense (Benefit) Income tax expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 1.3 million, resulting in an effective tax rate of (2.3 ). The effective tax rate for the current period differs from the federal statutory rate primarily due to an increase in the valuation allowance against domestic deferred tax assets. Income tax benefit for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 was 3.3 million, resulting in an effective tax rate of 18.7 . Critical Accounting Estimates We make certain judgements and use certain estimates and assumptions when applying accounting principles in the preparation of our financial statements. The nature of those estimates and assumptions are material due to the levels of subjectivity and judgment necessary to account for highly uncertain factors or the susceptibility of such factors to change. We believe the current assumptions and other considerations used to estimate amounts reflected in our financial statements are appropriate. However, if actual experience differs from the assumptions and other considerations used in estimating amounts reflected in our financial statements, the resulting changes could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and, in certain situations, could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition. For further information on our critical accounting estimates, see Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and the notes to our audited financial statements included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC on March 15, 2024. As of September 30, 2024, there have been no material changes to these estimates. Liquidity and Capital Resources Our principal liquidity needs are to fund operating expenses, meet debt service obligations, and fund investment activities, which include capital expenditures. Our primary sources of liquidity and capital resources are cash on hand, cash provided by operating activities, and available borrowings under our Credit Agreement (as defined herein). Our ability to generate cash provided by operating activities is dependent on several factors, including our ability to generate net sales and manage costs in line with our expectations. Failure to meet our financial targets, including any adverse impact from changes or further delays in the estimated timing and volume of products to be commercialized in our extract and ready-to-drink manufacturing facility in Conway, Arkansas, may restrict our liquidity and capital resources and our ability to maintain compliance with our financial covenants and may require us to modify, delay, or abandon some of our planned future expansion or development, or to otherwise enact operating cost reductions, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, financial condition, covenant compliance and ability to achieve our intended business objectives. Where possible, we seek to recover inflation-impacted costs by passing these costs onto our customers through periodic pricing increases. However, our pricing increases often lag our cost increases, including increases in commodity costs. The persistence of these negative effects on our business could adversely impact our ability to reach our revenue and other financial targets.

 Credit Agreement The Company is party to a credit agreement (the Credit Agreement among the Company, Westrock Beverage Solutions, LLC, as the borrower (the Borrower ), Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., as administrative agent, collateral agent, and swingline lender, Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, as sustainability structuring agent, and each issuing bank and lender party thereto. The Credit Agreement includes (a) a senior secured first lien revolving credit facility in an initial aggregate principal amount of 175.0 million (the Revolving Credit Facility ), (b) a senior secured first lien term loan facility in an initial aggregate principal amount of 175.0 million (the Term Loan Facility ), and (c) incremental term loan commitments in the form of a senior secured delayed draw term loan credit facility (the Delayed Draw Term Loan Facility in the aggregate principal amount of 50.0 million. The Revolving Credit Facility, the Term Loan Facility and the Delayed Draw Term Loan Facility will mature on August 29, 2027. All obligations under the Credit Agreement are guaranteed by the Company and each of the Borrower s domestic subsidiaries, which comprise our Beverage Solutions segment, and are secured by substantially all of the Company s assets. Borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility, the Term Loan Facility and the Delayed Draw Term Loan Facility will bear interest, at the Borrower s option, initially at an annual rate equal to (a) term SOFR plus a credit spread adjustment of 0.10 for loans with an interest period of one month, 0.15 for loans with an interest period of three months and 0.25 for loans with an interest period of six months, as applicable, (the Adjusted Term SOFR or (b) the base rate (determined by reference to the greatest of (i) the rate of interest last quoted by The Wall Street Journal in the United States as the prime rate in effect, (ii) the NYFRB Rate from time to time plus 0.50 and (iii) the Adjusted Term SOFR for a one month interest period plus 1.00 , (the Base Rate )), in each case plus an applicable margin. At September 30, 2024, we had 107.5 million of outstanding borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility, with a weighted average interest rate of 8.8 and we had 2.6 million of standby letters of credit outstanding. At September 30, 2024 the interest rate applicable to our Term Loan Facility was 8.0 and the interest rate applicable to our Delayed Draw Term Loan Facility was 8.9 . On February 15, 2024, the Borrower entered into Amendment No. 3 (the Third Amendment to the Credit Agreement. The Third Amendment modified the existing covenant relief period (the Covenant Relief Period ), which commenced on June 30, 2023 and will end on the earlier to occur of (i) April 1, 2026 and (ii) any date following June 30, 2024, on which the Borrower elects to terminate the Covenant Relief Period subject to satisfaction of certain conditions. During the Covenant Relief Period, the Company s ability to incur additional indebtedness and make investments, restricted payments and junior debt restricted payments will be more limited. The Third Amendment permits the Company to issue convertible notes, including the Convertible Notes (as defined herein). During the Covenant Relief Period, the applicable margin for any term SOFR rate loan will range from 3.00 to 4.00 and for any ABR loan will range from 2.00 to 3.00 , in each case depending on the secured net leverage ratio. After the Covenant Relief Period, the applicable margin for any term SOFR rate loan will range from 2.00 to 3.00 and for any ABR loan will range from 1.00 to 2.00 , in each case depending on the secured net leverage ratio. The Credit Agreement, as amended, requires the Borrower to maintain compliance with (i) a secured net leverage ratio at levels ranging from 4.50:1.00 to 6.25:1.00 and stepping down to 4.50:1.00 by April 2026 and (ii) an interest coverage ratio of at least 1.50:1.00 on and prior to September 30, 2025 and at least 2.00:1.00 on December 31, 2025 and thereafter. The Credit Agreement, as amended, also includes (i) a minimum liquidity covenant requiring the Borrower not to permit its liquidity, measured as of the last business day of each calendar month commencing March 29, 2024, to be less than 15 million and (ii) an anti-cash hoarding covenant, which shall be effective only during the Covenant Relief Period, requiring the Borrower to have no more than 20 million of unrestricted cash on the last day of each calendar month when revolving loans or letters of credit are outstanding or on the date of borrowing of a revolving loan. Failure to comply with these covenants or make payments when due could result in an event of default, which, if not cured or waived, could accelerate our repayment obligations under the Credit Agreement and could result in a default and acceleration under other agreements containing cross-default provisions. Under these circumstances, we might not have sufficient funds or other resources to satisfy all of our obligations. As of the date of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, the Company was in compliance with its financial covenants.

Quarterly payments increase to approximately 4.2 million and 5.6 million (1.875 and 2.5 of the original principal balance) during the final two years of the agreements, respectively. We incurred a total of 2.4 million in financing fees in connection with the Third Amendment. Approximately 1.3 million of the fees were allocated to the Term Loan Facility and are being amortized over the remaining term of the Term Loan Facility utilizing the frozen effective yield method based on the interest rate in place at the issuance of the Term Loan Facility. Approximately 1.0 million of the fees were allocated to the Revolving Credit Facility, are reported within other long-term assets on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets and are being amortized ratably over the remaining term of the Revolving Credit Facility.

The conversion price and conversion rate are subject to customary adjustments. International Debt and Lending Facilities On March 21, 2023, we entered into a 70 million working capital trade finance facility with multiple financial institutions through our subsidiary, Falcon Coffees Limited Falcon ). The facility was set to mature one year from inception.

On August 21, 2024, Falcon amended its working capital trade finance facility. The amendment increased the facility size from 55.0 million to 75.0 million. The interest rates and maturity date were unchanged as a result of the amendment. At September 30, 2024, there was 48.5 million of outstanding borrowings under the facility, which is recorded in short-term debt in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. Falcon s facility contains certain restrictive financial covenants which require Falcon to maintain certain levels of working capital, debt, and net worth. Falcon was in compliance with these financial covenants as of September 30, 2024. On September 28, 2023, we entered into a 5.0 million unsecured working capital trade finance facility with responsAbility Climate Smart Agriculture Food Systems Fund through our subsidiary, Falcon. The facility will mature on December 31, 2026, and requires stepped repayments of 0.5 million on December 31, 2024, 1.0 million on December 31, 2025 and 3.5 million on December 31, 2026. Borrowings under the facility will bear interest at the borrower s option at a rate equal to (a) (i) the most recent applicable Term SOFR for the longest period (for which Term SOFR is available) which is less than the applicable interest period of the loan or (ii) if no such Term SOFR is available for a period which is less than the applicable interest period, SOFR for the day which is two U.S. Government Securities Business Days, as defined in the facility, before the Quotation Day, as defined in the facility; or (b) the most recent applicable Term SOFR (as of the Quotation Day) for the shortest period (for which Term SOFR is available) which exceeds the applicable interest period of that loan, in each case plus the applicable margin.

Westrock Coffee International, LLC, through its subsidiary Rwanda Trading Company, maintains two mortgage and inventory-backed lending facilities with a local bank in Rwanda: (a) a short-term trade finance facility with a balance of 6.6 million at September 30, 2024 and (b) a long-term note payable with a balance of 0.8 million at September 30, 2024. Additionally, Rwanda Trading Company maintains two short-term futures contract-based lending facilities from international institutions with outstanding balances of 0.6 million and 2.4 million at September 30, 2024. Supply Chain Finance Program The Company is party to a supply chain finance program (the Program with a third-party financing provider to provide better working capital usage by deferring payments for certain raw materials. Under the Program, the financing provider remits payment to the Company s suppliers for approved invoices, and the Company repays the financing provider the amount of the approved invoices, plus a financing charge, on 180-day terms. The Program is uncommitted and the financing provider may, at its sole discretion, cancel the Program at any time. The Company may request cancellation of the Program in whole or in respect of one or more approved suppliers. Due to the extension of payment terms beyond the original due date of approved invoices, obligations under the Program are recorded outside of accounts payable, within our supply chain finance program, on our Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. As of September 30, 2024, there were 70.9 million obligations outstanding under the Program. At-the-Market Common Stock Offering Program We have an effective shelf registration statement on file with the SEC (the Registration Statement to offer and sell various securities from time to time. Under the Registration Statement, we have established an at-the-market common stock offering program (the ATM Program to sell shares of common stock not to exceed 5,000,000 Common Shares in the aggregate. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company sold 60,000 Common Shares under the ATM Program, resulting in net proceeds of 0.6 million. This program is intended to provide additional financial

 flexibility and an alternative mechanism to access the capital markets at an efficient cost as and when we need financing, including for acquisitions. Current and Long-Term Liquidity A key component of our long-term growth strategy is to complete the build-out of our extract and ready-to-drink manufacturing facility in Conway, Arkansas, which utilizes state-of-the-art equipment specifically designed to efficiently manufacture and package a wide range of beverages, such as canned or bottled cold brew coffees, lattes, assorted teas, and juice-based products. During the second quarter of 2024, we commenced commercial production in a portion of the facility. We are continuing to build out the remaining portions of the facility and expect that the material capital expenditures related to the facility will be completed by the first quarter of 2025. We believe proceeds from the Delayed Draw Term Loan Facility, Convertible Notes, cash from operations and borrowings available under the Revolving Credit Facility will provide sufficient cash on-hand to fund our near-term growth strategies, which include, (i) extending and enhancing product offerings through innovation, (ii) expanding our customer base, (iii) expanding geographically, (iv) funding accretive acquisitions, (v) continuing to drive margin expansion and (vi) completing the build-out of our extract and ready-to-drink manufacturing facility in Conway, Arkansas. However, the Company will continuously evaluate its liquidity needs, and may seek to opportunistically access additional liquidity, including through either the debt or equity capital markets. If it is determined that we have insufficient liquidity to fund the Conway facility build-out or fund our acquisition strategy, we may delay the build-out of the Conway facility and/or modify the scope of the build-out and we may reprioritize our strategy to focus on organic growth opportunities, which may have an adverse impact on our ability to achieve our growth objectives. Redemptions of Series A Preferred Shares After February 26, 2028, any holder of Series A Preferred Shares may require Westrock to redeem all or any whole number of such holder s Series A Preferred Shares in cash, subject to applicable law and the terms of any credit agreement or similar arrangement pursuant to which a third-party lender provides debt financing to Westrock or its subsidiaries, at a redemption price per share equal to the greater of (a) the liquidation preference and (b) the product of (i) the number of Common Shares that would have been obtained from converting one Series A Preferred Share on the redemption notice date and (ii) the simple average of the daily volume-weighted average price per Common Share for the ten (10) trading days ending on and including the trading day immediately preceding the redemption notice date. Assuming that the liquidation preference of the Series A Preferred Shares remains 11.50 per share and all 23,510,527 Series A Preferred Shares remain outstanding after February 26, 2028, we estimate an aggregate redemption payment of at least approximately 270.4 million. If Westrock was required by the holders to redeem a significant number of Series A Preferred Shares, Westrock may not have enough cash available (including through draws on its credit facility) for other purposes such as paying dividends on the Common Shares, repurchases of Common Shares, financing acquisitions or other expansions, paying employee incentives and executing its business strategy. An outflow of a significant amount of cash from Westrock as a result of redemptions of the Series A Preferred Shares may cause a deterioration in the financial condition of Westrock and our ability to pay our other obligations and/or execute our business strategy. The impact of such redemptions on Westrock will depend, among other things, on the financial condition of Westrock at the time of such redemptions, including the amount of available cash on hand and ability to draw on Westrock s credit facilities or obtain other sources of financing, the business strategies and objectives of Westrock at that time and the magnitude of such redemptions. Additionally, we may reserve cash, refrain from pursuing other business objectives and/or direct cash away from other business objectives to ensure that we have sufficient available cash to satisfy holder redemptions, and this may adversely affect our business and financial condition and ability to execute on our business strategy.

 Contractual and Other Obligations Our material contractual and other obligations include the payment of principal and interest under our debt obligations and future purchase of inventory obligations. Our Term Loan Facility and Delayed Draw Term Loan Facility require quarterly principal payments of 1.25 of the original principal. Quarterly payments increase 1.875 and 2.5 of the original principal balance during the fourth and fifth years of the Credit Agreement, respectively. We have no other material obligations to pay principal amounts of our long-term debt obligations prior to their maturity. Future purchase obligations of 266.8 million as of September 30, 2024 consist of commitments for the purchase of inventory over the next 12 months. These obligations represent the minimum contractual obligations expected under the normal course of business. There are no material purchase obligations beyond 12 months. We have future obligations to repurchase 1.2 million of inventory associated with repurchase agreements in which the Company s SS T segment has sold inventory to a third party and from whom the Company s Beverage Solution segment has an obligation to repurchase. Capital Expenditures We categorize our capital expenditures as (i) growth, (ii) maintenance, (iii) customer beverage equipment or (iv) other. We define growth capital expenditures as investments in our manufacturing facilities that will contribute to revenue growth by increasing production capacity, improving production efficiencies, or related to production of new products. Maintenance capital expenditures are those necessary to keep our existing manufacturing equipment fully operational. Customer beverage equipment represents Company-owned equipment that is deployed in our customers locations. Capital expenditures for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 were as follows: 

Customer Beverage (Thousands) Growth Maintenance Equipment Other Total Nine months ended September 30, 2024 137,977 1,532 745 1,197 141,451 Nine months ended September 30, 2023 113,594 2,531 1,533 3,887 121,545 During the remainder of 2024, we expect to invest approximately 30.0 million to continue the build out of our extract and ready-to-drink product manufacturing facility in Conway, Arkansas. If circumstances warrant, we may need to take measures to conserve cash, which may include a suspension, delay, or reduction in growth and/or maintenance capital expenditures. We continually assess our capital expenditure plans in light of developments impacting our business, including the needs of our customers. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements As of the date of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, we do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements.

 Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk There have been no material changes in the market risks discussed in Item 7A Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk in our Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC on March 15, 2024. Item 4. Controls and Procedures Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures We maintain disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, (the Exchange Act that are designed to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms and to ensure that information required to be disclosed is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Principal Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow for timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Our management, with the participation of our Principal Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer, evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of September 30, 2024, the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Based on this evaluation, our Principal Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of September 30, 2024, due to the material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting, described below. However, after giving full consideration to the material weaknesses, management believes that our condensed consolidated financial statements included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q have been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Our Principal Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer have certified that, based on such officer s knowledge, the consolidated financial statements, and other financial information included in this report, fairly present in all material respects the financial condition, results of operations and cash flows of the Company as of, and for, the periods presented in this report. Material Weaknesses in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of our annual or interim consolidated financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. We have identified the following material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting, which remain outstanding as of September 30, 2024. Westrock did not design and maintain effective controls in response to the risks of material misstatement as changes to existing controls or the implementation of new controls were not sufficient to respond to changes to the risks of material misstatement to financial reporting. This material weakness in risk assessment contributed to the following material weakness: Westrock did not design and maintain effective controls over the period-end financial reporting process to achieve complete and accurate financial accounting, reporting and disclosures, including the presentation and classification of various accounts and the recognition of operating lease right-of-use assets and operating lease liabilities in the consolidated financial statements, which resulted in immaterial adjustments to certain interim and annual periods for the years ending December 31, 2020 through June 30, 2024, and material adjustments to the cash flow presentation of net repayments from repurchase agreements within financing activities within the condensed consolidated statement of cash flows for the six months ended June 30, 2023 and to operating lease right-of-use assets and operating lease liabilities within the consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2023. Additionally, the material weaknesses could result in a misstatement of substantially all of Westrock s accounts or disclosures that would result in a material misstatement to the annual or interim consolidated financial statements that would not be prevented or detected.

 Remediation Activities Westrock has taken and is taking certain measures to remediate the material weaknesses described above, including the following: Hired additional accounting and information technology IT personnel, including a new chief accounting officer hired in May 2021, a new technical accounting resource hired in April 2022, a new IT compliance resource hired in March 2023, a new internal controls resource hired in April 2023 with the appropriate level of knowledge, training, and experience to establish an internal audit function responsible for testing internal controls to improve our internal control over financial reporting and IT capabilities, and a Chief Information Officer in November 2023 with public company IT compliance and cybersecurity experience. Developed and formalized a risk assessment process across the organization to identify risks and design new controls or enhance existing controls responsive to such risks to ensure timely and accurate financial reporting based on criteria established in the COSO Framework. Entity level controls necessary to support management s risk assessment and a process to evaluate the control environment in accordance with the COSO Framework were improved or implemented throughout 2023. Engaged a third party to assist in designing and implementing controls related to period-end financial reporting. Designed and implemented formal accounting procedures and controls during the quarters ended September 30, 2023, December 31, 2023, March 31, 2024 and June 30, 2024 that support Westrock s period-end financial accounting, reporting and disclosures, including controls over close procedures workflow, preparation, review and oversight of account reconciliations and journal entries, presentation and classification, evaluation of internal information for disclosure, recognition of operating lease right-of-use assets and operating lease liabilities, and controls to reconcile financial statement and disclosure information to source documentation. The enhancements are expected to remediate the material weaknesses when they have operated effectively for a sufficient period of time. Remediation of Material Weakness in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting As previously disclosed, Westrock did not design and maintain effective controls related to ensuring appropriate segregation of duties as it relates to the preparation and review of journal entries and account reconciliations, which did not result in adjustments to the consolidated financial statements. To remediate the material weakness, management has taken certain measures including the following: Engaged a third party to assist in designing and implementing controls related to segregation of duties. Designed and implemented controls during the quarters ended June 30, September 30, and December 31, 2023, to formalize roles and review responsibilities to align with Westrock s team s skills and experience and designed and implemented controls over segregation of duties that include documentation, task reassignment, and policies and procedures enhancement around the preparation, review and oversight of account reconciliations and journal entries. During the fourth quarter of 2023 and the three quarters ending September 30, 2024, management completed the testing necessary to conclude that the newly implemented and enhanced controls were appropriately designed, implemented and operating effectively as of September 30, 2024, and concluded that the material weakness related to segregation of duties has been remediated.
