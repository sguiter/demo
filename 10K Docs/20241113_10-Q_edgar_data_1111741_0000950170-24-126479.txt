and were convertible into shares of Series D Senior Convertible Preferred Stock and common stock purchase warrants 2020 warrants at an exercise price of per share, with an expiry of . These 2020 warrants contain anti-dilution provisions. See Note 11. The Company analyzed the conversion features of the promissory notes convertible into Series D Preferred Stock and determined that the 2020 warrants and remaining purchaser warrants issued with such notes qualified as a derivative liability. The fair value was required to be allocated among the notes, the notes conversion features, and the 2020 warrants and remaining purchaser warrants, and then remeasured at each reporting date. The Company performed a valuation of the conversion feature of the 2020 warrants and remaining purchaser warrants. In performing the valuation, the Company applied the guidance in ASC 820, Fair Value Measurements , to nonfinancial assets and liabilities that are recognized or disclosed at fair value on a nonrecurring basis. ASC 820 defines fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date (exit price). To measure fair value, the Company incorporates assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability and utilizes market data to the maximum extent possible. In instances where the determination of the fair value measurement is based on inputs from different levels of the fair value hierarchy, the level in the fair value hierarchy within which the entire fair value measurement falls is based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety. The Company s assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement in its entirety requires judgment and considers factors specific to the asset or liability.

Leases In addition to the surface rights held by DynaM xico pursuant to the Mining Act of M xico and its Regulations Ley Minera y su Reglamento ), DynaMineras maintains access and surface rights to the SJG Project pursuant to a -year Land Lease Agreement. The Year Land Lease Agreement with the Santa Maria Ejido Community surrounding San Jose de Gracia was dated January 6, 2014 and continues through January 2033. It covers an area of 4,399 hectares surrounding the main mineral resource areas of SJG and provides for annual lease payments on January 1 st each year by DynaMineras, in the amount of Pesos (approximately USD) adjusted for inflation based on the Mexico minimum wage increase. Rent was Pesos (approximately USD) for the year ended December 31, 2024. The Land Lease Agreement provides DynaMineras with surface access to the core resource areas of SJG and allows for all permitted mining and exploration activities. The Company leases office space for its corporate headquarters in Irving, Texas. In February 2023, the Company entered into a 52- month extension of the lease with additional office space. As part of the agreement, the lease term commenced and the Company received four months free rent upon completion of the finish out of the new space. The expansion was completed and the Company moved into the office space effective August 1, 2023. The Company makes tiered lease payments on the first of each month. The Company determines if a contract is or contains a lease at inception. As of September 30, 2024, the Company has two operating leases: 52 months lease for office space with a remaining term of 38 months and the twenty-year ground lease in association with its M xico mining operations with a remaining term of 9.25 years. Variable lease costs consist primarily of variable common area maintenance, storage, parking and utilities. The Company s leases do not have any residual value guarantees or restrictive covenants. As the implicit rate is not readily determinable for most of the Company s lease agreements, the Company uses an estimated incremental borrowing rate to determine the initial present value of lease payments. These discount rates for leases are calculated using the Company s interest rate of promissory notes.

(1) Gold concentrate sold during the period is not equal to gold concentrate recovered during the period due to timing of shipments to buyer, and due to buyer s payability discount for the purchase of gold concentrate, and due to any adjustment from dry weight and assay in provisional settlements with buyer. 

Mill tonnage processed, feed grade and recovery rates are estimates based on internal reports of assays and estimated weights of tonnage mined and shipped to the plant. 
 The drop in the feed grade at the pilot plant facility is a result reduction in high-grade or zones in accordance with the mine plan as well as dilution experienced in the test mining activities, and partially due to the increase in test mining tonnage within SJG. To increase the tonnage of test mining material available for test mill processing, the Company opened a test mining area at San Pablo during the fourth quarter of 2023. An additional ore deposit area was opened in May 2024, at La Mochomera, which is an area anticipated to provide higher feed grade material in particular at depth. As well in 2024 and particularly in Q3 2024 increased access to mining faces and currently mined veins will contribute to minning rates going forward. 
 
 2024 HIGHLIGHTS 
 Operational Performance 
 San Jose de Gracia 
 Throughout Q3 2024, the Company has remained focused on developing and implementing the optimization program at the San Jose de Gracia mine aimed at increasing throughput, improving recoveries, and improving maintenance and equipment usage with the goal of improving efficiencies and profit margins at the mine level. 
 Operational results for the quarter demonstrated significantly improved efficiencies as a result of the ongoing optimization program with a steady improvement as the quarter proceeded with metal production of 1,946 ounces of gold in July, 1,601 ounces. in August and 2,092 ounces in September. August production was impacted by the installation of a new vibrating screen and ancillary construction which resulted in a mill shut down for 5 days. In Q3 2024 total metal production of 5,676 ounces of gold was a 9 decrease from 6,231 ounces the previous quarter and a 12 decrease from 6,469 ounces in Q3 2023. 
 Milled throughput for Q3 2024 was 61,900 tons, demonstrating a 7 decrease compared to 66,775 tons in Q2 2024 and a 27 improvement over 48,700 tons in Q3 2023. 
 The decrease in ounces produced was a result of the decrease in feed grade from 3.91 g/t in Q2 2024 to 3.78 g/t in Q3 2024 compared to 5.09 g/t in Q3 2023. 
 This steady increased rate of production makes management confident it will achieve its production target rate of 25,500 tons per month in the fourth quarter 2024. 
 Through significant capital investment made in Q2 and Q3 2024, the Company has made several upgrades to the plant, increased access to working faces and improved the utilization and productivity of current infrastructure. 
 A new vibrating screen was installed in the crushing circuit in August 2024 which has resulted in a more consistent and overall improved mill performance which is demonstrated by September s performance of an average of 770 tons per day produced. Subsequent to quarter end, October production was averaging 825 tons per day with further improvements expected. Improvements to the floatation circuit have led to improvements in grades with steady month over month increases in the metallurgical results achieved. 
 At the plant level, metallurgical test works with new reagents also resulted in an optimized flow sheet and demonstrated the ability to deliver up to a 79 recovery, under certain conditions. The Company is working to improve the consistency of plant recoveries. 
 The near completion of a new drift into a new working mining face that is expected to come into production in the La Mochomera deposit and the improved access to working faces through the completion of an access road to reach the San Pablo deposit have and should continue to contribute to improved throughput rates. This will also have a positive impact on grades as better access to high-grade zones is gained. 
 Detailed activities from the three main deposits include: 
 Tres Amigos 
 At the Tres Amigos vein north zone a new ore drive was completed in the upper levels enabling further access to this high-grade vein via a new mining face. Mining from this face was incorporated into Q3 2024 production and will continue throughout 2024 and into 
 26 

Table of Contents 

2025 as mining this is currently one of the main sources of high-grade ore to the mill. This newly gained access will also enable diamond drilling deeper with a lateral extension toward this untested north and south extension with the goal of increasing inventory. 
 San Pablo Viejo and San Pablo Sur 
 Throughout the 3rd quarter of 2024 the Company continued active mining from multiple faces at the San Pablo deposit while continuing development work on the access to the San Pablo deposit. 
 San Pablo Viejo and San Pablo Sur is planned to be the primary source of gold production throughout 2025 and 2026 and beyond as other areas as south extension 500 level very interesting high grade open potential zone as possible Gold Bonanza in the short to mid-term, mine are prepared for future with the mine focusing on developing new reserves and the addition of La Mochomera vein deeper, the Company is targeting 2024 production in the range of 26,000 -27,000 gold ounces. 
 Mochomera 
 The Mochomera vein is also expected to be an important source of gold production during 2025 and 2026 and with particularly interesting high-grade opportunities at depth which is also open. 
 OUTLOOK (SJG) 
 
 With a successful Q3 2024 demonstrating more normalized, San Jose de Gracia is well positioned for further operational improvements in Q4 2024 and into 2025. This steady increased rate of production throughput makes management confident it will achieve its production throughput target rate of 25,500 tons per month in the fourth quarter 2024. 
 While the Company made significant headway in Q3 2024, the continued effort to optimize operations will remain focused on improving ore to the mill, throughput rates, and recoveries. San Pablo Sur, San Pablo, Mochomera and the Tres Amigos ore bodies will continue to be the main contributors to production in the year ahead and into the near future. The third quarter results discussed demonstrate steady progress due to new investments and operational changes. As a result, the Company anticipates a significant improvement in Q4 2024. 
 As a result of the capital investments made to the mine and mill, exploration expenditure was minimal, limiting available high-grade resources ready for short term mining. In the near term, exploration will drill targets that are expected to continue to grow the existing high-grade ore resources and increase mineable inventory. 
 The Company has continued to invest exploration spending in both near-mine extensions and geological studies and interpretation. The Company plans to complete an NI 43-101 (and SK1300) Mineral Resource Estimate Update in Q4 2024 at San Jose de Gracia to San Pablo Sur, San Pablo, Mochomera and Tres Amigos ore bodies which will include development proposals for additional exploration for ore veins in the short and mid-term. 
 The Company expects to start near-mine extension drilling on the property in November 2024 and expand to surrounding areas by year end. Exploration will focus on growing the known resources at SJG. 
 The Company will prioritize drilling high grade underground targets that can readily be brought into the mine plan as well as the continued regional program to better understand the potential of the significant land package at SJG. Additionally, planning for deeper and lateral drilling in between the San Pablo and Tres Amigos veins has highlighted the potential for extending the high-grade underground resource at SJG, especially in zones that were previously thought to be discontinuous such as near faulting, and has identified the opportunity to develop San Pablo, San Pablo Sur, Mochomera and Tres Amigos exploration potential. At the Mochomera deposit, the Company seeks to explore high grade potential toward south to Palos Chinos and Purisima historical mines which operated over 100 years ago as high-grade mines. 
 A new tailings dam was completed during the quarter with a total estimated storage capacity of 670,751 cubic meters distributed in two stages to hold additional future tailings for approximately 4.5 years. Planning and estimating the third stage of the tailings expansion project is still in process.

The major expenses reported in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 relate to additions to the mill facility and mining infrastructure for the access to an additional test mining area at SJG. 
 EXPLORATION DRILLING: The Company continues exploration drilling program for the purpose of updating the Company s CND NI 43-101 Mineral Resource Estimate. Exploration expenditures for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 were 1,542,316 and 1,694,536.

OTHER INCOME (EXPENSE): Other income (expense) for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was (608,300) and (532,776), respectively. Other income (expense) for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was (247,009) and (906,412), respectively. Included in other income in 2024 was interest expense of (1,305,270), change in derivative of 923,017, currency exchange loss of (244,356) and miscellaneous income of 18,309. The decrease in the derivative liability was primarily due to the decrease in the Company s common stock value. The increase in interest expense was due to the conversion of the Company s ACL to an installment note in December of 2023. Included in other income in 2023 was interest expense of (345,254), change in derivative of (142,802), currency exchange loss of (46,588) and miscellaneous income of 1,848. 
 OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME: Other comprehensive income includes the Company s net income (loss) plus the unrealized currency exchange gain for the period. The Company s other comprehensive income for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 consisted of unrealized currency gains (loss) of (1,243,875) and 141,167, respectively. The Company s other comprehensive income for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 consisted of unrealized currency gains (loss) of (746,323) and (210,050), respectively. The change is due to the variances in the currency exchange rates between the US Dollar and Mexican Peso throughout the two periods. 
 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 As of September 30, 2024, the Company had negative working capital of 17,293,079 comprised of current assets of 11,174,744 and current liabilities of 28,467,823. This represented an increase of 7,031,434 from the negative working capital maintained by the Company of 10,261,645 as of December 31, 2023 as a result of an increase in cash used in operations during the first half of 2024 and an increase in the Company s accounts payable and accrued liabilities as of September 30, 2024. 
 Net cash used in operations for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 9,013,473 compared to a use of 11,477,695 during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease in the cash flow from operations was primarily due to the Company s loss in 2024 primarily attributed to the ongoing expenses of expansion and a decrease in revenue year to date. 
 The Company had investing activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 of 6,755 compared to 115,273 for the prior year. Expenditures reported for the expansion of mining facilities, which totaled 2,447,826 and 1,226,135 during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, would normally have been included in this category but were expensed due to the Company s lack of proven and probable reserves at the SJG Project, which therefore, requires the Company to expense costs as incurred related to expansion of test mining and milling activities. 
 Net cash provided by financing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was 3,978,713 and 3,678,679, respectively. The net cash provided by financing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 consisted of proceeds from sale of equity of 2,500,000, proceeds from borrowing of 4,000,000 net of payments on the RCL of 2,437,500 and operating lease payments. of 83,787. Cash provided by financing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 consists of proceeds from the sale of stock of 5,000,000 less the repurchase of Series A Preferred stock for 1,250,000, acquisition of treasury stock for 60,250 and lease payments of 11,111. 
 
 Through September 30, 2024, the Company s available liquidity and operations have been financed primarily through its operations and the revenue generated from the sale of product and from proceeds from the sales of equity and proceeds from borrowing. 
 
 Although the Company has incurred net losses and net cash outflows from operating activities and investing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, there were many expenses which were made that were not expended for the production of revenue, such as exploration drilling and mine expansion costs. If these expenses had not been made, the Company s net loss would have been minimized. The Company believes its cash and cash receipts from its revenue arrangement, proceeds from the sale of equity and proceeds from borrowing will be sufficient to meet its working capital and capital expenditure needs for at least the next 12 months from the date these financial statements were available for issuance. Additionally, the Company believes its revenue will be greater in the fourth quarter of 2024 due to the recent opening of additional mines and improvements made to the productivity of the milling activities. Future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including the Company s rate of mining, milling and exploration activities and growth. To the extent that existing capital and revenue growth are not sufficient to fund future activities, the Company may need to raise capital through additional equity or debt financings. Additional funds may not be available on terms favorable to the Company or at all. Failure to raise additional capital, if needed, could have a material adverse effect on the Company s financial position, results of operations and cash flows. 
 Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 
 As of September 30, 2024, the Company did not have any off-balance sheet arrangements, which have or are likely to have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or liquidity. 
 Plan of Operation 
 29 

Table of Contents 

The Company s plan of operation for the next twelve months is to continue the improvement and expansion of the test mining and pilot milling activities and exploration drilling at SJG. 
 
 During the fourth quarter of 2024, the Company plans to continue to increase mining and milling to in excess of 800 tons of material a day. The Company opened a second ore deposit in late 2023 and is consistently test mining additional material from this deposit. The Company opened a third ore deposit during May 2024, La Mochomera which is in an area anticipated to provide higher feed grade material at depth. The Company expects to increase efficiency of activities in the fourth quarter of 2024 and is anticipating the ability to extract higher grade ore. 
 
 The Company is currently designing plans to accelerate its exploration drilling program. Management and geologists will make decisions based on the drill results, corporate strategies and market conditions, surface mapping, sampling and target generation. The Company has contracted with a "Qualified Person" within the meaning of subpart 1300 of Regulation S-K and Canadian Standard NI 43-101 to interpret the data collected in order to compile a formal Mineral Resource Estimate update in Q4 2024. 
 
 Capital Expenditures 
 
 The Company s primary capital expenditures relate to the test mining and pilot milling activities of the SJG Project. The Company expanded its pilot milling plant in 2022 and early 2023 with the addition and installation of two ball mills and expanded the tailings pond operation with water being recycled to the plant. The Company has continued to refine the milling process throughout 2024 with the addition of front and back-end concentrators and utilization of the original mills for higher grinding capacity. All capital expenditures are expensed as the Company is an exploration stage issuer under subpart 1300 of Regulation S-K. 
 
 Exploration Stage 
 
 The Company is currently an exploration stage issuer and is reporting all costs of mine operations, improvements, and expansion as expenses in accordance with Section 1300 of Regulation S-K and US GAAP requirements, and therefore the above costs are not reflected as capitalized assets on the Company s balance sheet. The Company has started test mining, milling and extraction activities prior to determining mineral reserves. 
 
 ITEM 3. QUA NTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 
 Not required for smaller reporting companies. 
 ITEM 4. CON TROLS AND PROCEDURES 
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 We carried out an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e)) as of September 30, 2024. This evaluation was accomplished under the supervision and with the participation of our principal executive officer and principal financial officer who concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures are effective as of the end of the period covered by this Form 10-Q. For purposes of this section, the term disclosure controls and procedures means controls and other procedures of an issuer that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the issuer in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the Commission s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 
 We recognize the importance of having effective controls in place to manage risks and ensure the integrity of our financial reporting. We are committed to continuously improving our control environment through ongoing monitoring, testing, and remediation of control deficiencies. Our management team is actively involved in overseeing the effectiveness of our controls, and we have established a culture of accountability and transparency to ensure that all employees understand their roles and responsibilities in maintaining a strong control environment. We are also investing in technology to streamline our control processes and reduce the risk of errors and fraud. We believe that these efforts will enable us to develop a high level of control effectiveness.

PAR T II 
 ITEM 1. LE GAL PROCEEDINGS 
 There were no material developments during the period covered by this report on Form 10-Q in the legal proceedings previously publicly disclosed by the Company. 
 
 From time to time, the Company is involved in legal matters in the ordinary course of its business. The Company intends to defend itself vigorously against any such claims. It is the Company s policy to accrue for amounts related to lawsuits brought against it if it is probable that a liability has been incurred and an amount can be reasonably estimated. Although the outcome of such matters cannot be predicted with certainty and no assurances can be given with respect to such matters, the Company believes that the outcome of those ordinary-course matters in which it is currently involved will not have a materially adverse effect on its results of operations, liquidity, or financial position.
