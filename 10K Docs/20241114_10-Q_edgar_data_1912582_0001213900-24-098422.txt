was ) and , respectively. The working capital excluded the non-cash items, which are prepaid expenses for the Forward
Purchase Agreement, deferred offering costs and advance of subscription fees from shareholders. These conditions raised substantial doubts
about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. 

The
Company s liquidity is based on its ability to generate cash from operating activities, obtain capital financing from equity interest
investors and borrow funds on favorable economic terms to fund its general operations and capital expansion needs. The Company s
ability to continue as a going concern is dependent on management s ability to successfully raise more capitals and execute its
business plan, which includes increasing revenue while controlling operating cost and expenses to generate positive operating cash flows
and obtaining funds from outside sources of financing to generate positive financing cash flows. Currently, the Company is working to
improve its liquidity and capital sources mainly through borrowing from related parties and obtaining financial support from its principal
shareholder who has agreed to continue providing funds for the Company s working capital needs whenever needed. 

In
addition, in order to fully implement its business plan and sustain continued growth, the Company is also actively seeking financing
from outside investors, borrowings from related parties and financial institutions. However, there can be no assurance that these plans
and arrangements will be sufficient to fund the Company s ongoing capital expenditure, working capital, and other requirements.

considers those renewal or termination options that are reasonably certain to be exercised in the determination of the lease term and
initial measurement of right of use assets and lease liabilities. Lease expense for lease payment is recognized on a straight-line basis
over the lease term. 

The
Company determines whether a contract is or contains a lease at inception of the contract and whether that lease meets the classification
criteria of a finance or operating lease. When available, the Company uses the rate implicit in the lease to discount lease payments
to present value; however, most of the leases do not provide a readily determinable implicit rate. Therefore, the Company discounts lease
payments based on an estimate of the incremental borrowing rate. 

For
operating leases that include rent holidays and rent escalation clauses, the Company recognizes lease expense on a straight-line basis
over the lease term from the date it takes possession of the leased property. The Company records the straight-line lease expense and
any contingent rent, if applicable, in general and administrative expenses on the unaudited condensed consolidated statements of income
and comprehensive income. 

The
lease agreements do not contain any material residual value guarantees or material restrictive covenants. 

For
short-term leases, the Company records operating lease expense in its unaudited condensed consolidated statements of income and comprehensive
income on a straight-line basis over the lease term and record variable lease payments as incurred.

Item 2. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS
OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 

You should read the following
discussion and analysis of the Company s financial condition and results of operations in conjunction with the Company s unaudited
condensed consolidated financial statements and the related notes included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report. This discussion contains
forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. The Company s actual results and the timing of events could differ
materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of various factors, including those set forth under
 Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements and elsewhere in this Quarterly Report. 

Overview 

Our mission is to power the
future of sustainable transportation by creating stylish, innovative and cost-efficient premium electric vehicles centered around differentiated
designs and solutions tailored for every lifestyle. We are a technology innovator and a developer of premium electric vehicles EVs ).
We have developed several proprietary technologies which are the building blocks of the Thunder Power family of EVs. 

We focus on the development
and manufacturing of premium EVs with differentiated designs and solutions for every lifestyle. Four models are currently featured in
our phased development and roll-out strategy: the limited-edition coupe, (the Coupe or 488 ), long-range Sedan
(the Sedan ), compact city car (the City Car or Chloe and the long-range SUV (the SUV ,
and together with the Coupe, Sedan, and City Car, the Models ). We intend to target not just consumers who desire EVs, but
consumers who desire practical and innovative EVs, as well as consumers who seek a luxury experience. We believe that by leveraging our
modular integration concept starting with the modularized chassis system patented by us, we are creating a family of EVs (excluding the
City Car) which share common parts and modules which we believe requires lower investment and reduced design and production time as opposed
to those of traditional automotive manufacturers. We intend to first create the initial design for our Sedan, and then scale upwards to
create the Coupe and scale downward to create the City Car. In time, we expect to round off our offering with the SUV. 

We expect to offer to the
market eco-friendly, premium EVs positioned to earn market share based on design, quality, comfort, range, and price. Among other advantages,
we believe that our proprietary technologies will significantly increase the driving range for our EVs while allowing for faster recharging
and lower costs of ownership. 

Business Combination 

On June 21, 2024, Feutune
Light Acquisition Corporation FLFV consummated the business combination with Thunder
Power Holdings Limited TP Holdings ), pursuant to the Merger Agreement (the Business Combination ).
Following the Business Combination, the combined company changed its name to Thunder Power Holdings, Inc. (the Company ),
which is organized under the laws of the State of Delaware. 

Upon consummation of the
Business Combination, FLFV acquired all of the issued and outstanding securities of TP Holdings in exchange for (i) 40,000,000 shares
of common stock, and (ii) earn out payments consisting of up to an additional 20,000,000 shares of common stock (the Earnout
Shares if the Company met certain revenue performance target in the following years through December 31, 2026 (see Note
11 Contingent Consideration ). 

Immediately after giving
effect to the Business Combination, there were (i) 46,859,633 shares of common stock of the Company, 0.0001 par value per share,
issued and outstanding (without taking into account the Earnout Shares), (ii) 10,537,475 warrants to purchase 10,537,475 shares of common
stock outstanding, and (iii) 20,000,000 shares of common stock placed in an Earnout Escrow Account with Continental Stock Transfer 
Trust CST ). 

We have also capitalized
offering cost of 1,491,495, which was recorded as reduction against additional paid-in capital. 

Following the consummation
of the Business Combination, the combined Company s common stock began trading on the Nasdaq Global Market (the Nasdaq under the symbol AIEV on June 24, 2024. 

25 

The reverse recapitalization
is equivalent to the issuance of securities by TP Holdings for the net monetary assets of FLFV, accompanied by a recapitalization. The
Company debited equity for the fair value of the net liabilities of FLFV. In the subsequent financial statements after the Business Combination,
the amounts of assets and liabilities for the period before the reverse recapitalization in financial statements, are presented as those
of TP Holdings and recognized and measured at their pre-combination carrying amounts. 

General Factors Affecting Our Results of Operations 

Without limitation, the demand
for our EVs is affected by the following general factors. Changes in any of these general industry conditions could affect our business
and results of operations: 

The global growth of EV market, especially in the U.S., where we intend to build our first production facility, and for the strong demand for our brand, especially in the premium segment; 

Penetration rate of our EVs in the U.S. and across the globe, which is further affected by the following factors relating to EVs, among others, (i) overall production costs and ownership costs, (ii) functionality, performance and user experience, (iii) development of technology and level of intelligent and smart features on EV, and (iv) coverage of the charging network; 

Laws, regulations, and government policies for EVs and smart technology functions, including tax incentives, subsidies for EV production and purchases, government grants for EV manufacturers, as well as infrastructure support on expansion of the charging network; 

Macro factors that influence supply chain, Original Equipment Manufacturing OEM arrangements, material costs, manufacturing costs, delivery expense and normal operations associated with EV manufacturers; 

Proposed changes regarding key components, primarily the origin of batteries used on EVs; and 

Global customers acceptance of new technologies and brands, especially our brand. 

Specific Key Factors Affecting Our Results of Operations 

We believe that our performance
and future success will depend on several Company specific factors, including those key factors discussed below and other factors in the
section under the heading Risk Factors of the registration statement on Form S-4 filed with the Securities and Exchange
Commission (the SEC on December 7, 2023, as amended from time to time. 

Our ability to evaluate our business
and future prospects 

We are an early-stage company
with an early stage/limited operating history, operating in a rapidly evolving and highly regulated market. Furthermore, we have not released
any commercially available vehicle, and we have no experience manufacturing or selling a commercial product at scale. Because we have
not generated revenue from the sale of EVs, and because of the capital-intensive nature of our business, we expect to continue to incur
substantial operating losses for the foreseeable future. 

Our ability to develop different
models of vehicles 

We currently have four models
featured in our phased development strategy and our revenue in the foreseeable future will be significantly dependent on a limited number
of models. Although we have other vehicle models on our product roadmap, we currently do not expect to introduce another vehicle model
until at least 2030. We expect to rely on sales from the Coupe, the Sedan, the City Car, and the SUV, among other sources of financing,
for the capital that will be required to develop and commercialize future models. To the extent that production of the models is delayed,
reduced or is not well-received by the market for any reason, our revenue and cash flow would be adversely affected, we may need to seek additional financing earlier
than we expect, and such financing may not be available to us on commercially reasonable terms, or at all. 

26 

Our ability to control the substantial
costs associated with our operations 

We will require significant
capital to develop and grow our business. We have incurred and expect to continue to incur significant expenses as we build our brand
and develop and market our vehicles; expenses relating to developing and manufacturing our vehicles, tooling and expanding our manufacturing
facilities; research and development expenses (including expenses related to the development of the current and future products), raw
material procurement costs; and general and administrative expenses as we scale our operations. As a company, we do not have historical
experience forecasting and budgeting for any of these expenses, and these expenses could be significantly higher than we currently anticipate.
In addition, any disruption to our manufacturing operations, obtaining necessary equipment or supplies, expansion of our manufacturing
facilities, or the procurement of permits and licenses relating to our expected manufacturing, sales and distribution model could significantly
increase our expenses. 

Our ability to develop a third-party
retail product distribution and a full-service network 

We anticipate utilizing third-party
retail product distribution and full-service networks to execute on such plans in all markets. If our use of third-party retail production
and full-service networks is not effective, our results of operations and financial conditions could be adversely affected. 

Key Components of Results of Operations 

The following section presents
the key components of our results of operations by the nature of corresponding operating activities for the periods indicated. You should
read this financial information in conjunction with those presented elsewhere in this Quarterly Report including our financial statements
and notes to our financial statements. 

Revenues 

We have not generated revenue
from the sale of EVs. We expect to generate revenue from the sale of our EV models, the sale and/or licensing of our technologies, and
from research and development services. 

Cost of revenues 

Although we have no revenue,
we have incurred costs associated with trying to generate revenue such as research and development, general and administrative expenses,
liquidity and financing expenses and other operating activities as further described below. 

General and administrative expenses 

General and administrative
expenses primarily consist of personnel salary and welfare expenses and professional and consulting expenses. Over the next several years,
we anticipate an increase in our general and administrative expenses with our launch of production lines of our EV cars. Additionally,
we expect to incur higher costs related to professional and consulting expenses associated with being a publicly traded company. 

Taxation 

The Company is incorporated
in the State of Delaware and is required to pay franchise taxes to the State of Delaware on an annual basis. The Company is also registered
as a foreign corporation with the State of New Jersey Department of the Treasury. The Company would be subject to income tax under New
Jersey state tax laws if it has operations in New Jersey. 

On August 16, 2022,
the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (the IRA was signed into federal law. The IRA provides for, among other things, a new
U.S. federal 1 excise tax on certain repurchases (including redemptions) of stock by publicly traded domestic (i.e., U.S.) corporations
and certain domestic subsidiaries of publicly traded foreign corporations. The excise tax is imposed on the repurchasing corporation itself,
not its shareholders from which shares are repurchased. The amount of the excise tax
is generally 1 of the fair market value of the shares repurchased at the time of the repurchase. However, for purposes of calculating
the excise tax, repurchasing corporations are permitted to net the fair market value of certain new stock issuances against the fair market
value of stock repurchases during the same taxable year. In addition, certain exceptions apply to the excise tax. The U.S. Department
of the Treasury (the Treasury has been given authority to provide regulations and other guidance to carry out and prevent
the abuse or avoidance of the excise tax. The IRA applies only to repurchases that occur after December 31, 2022.

General and administrative
expenses. For the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, our general
and administrative expenses were approximately 0.9 million and 0.6 million, respectively. The changes was primarily attributed to an
increase of professional expenses of approximately 0.4 million with the closing of Business Combination and an increase of approximately
 0.1 million in insurance expenses for the management of the Company after the business combination, partially net off against a decrease
of share-based compensation expenses of approximately 0.2 million. 

Net loss. As a result of the foregoing, we incurred a net loss of approximately
 0.9 million and 0.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively.

General and administrative
expenses. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, our general
and administrative expenses were approximately 2.5 million and 1.6 million, respectively. The increase in general and administrative
expenses was primarily due to an increase of approximately 0.5 million in professional expenses which were incurred to support the closing
of business combination, an increase of approximately 0.1 million in insurance expenses for the management of the Company after the Business
Combination, and an increase of share-based compensation of approximately 0.7 million as we issued 90,000 shares of common stock to three
independent directors of FLFV at the consummation of the Business Combination, partially offset by a decrease of share-based settlement
expenses of approximately 0.5 million. 

Net loss. As a result of the foregoing, we incurred a net loss of approximately
 2.5 million and 1.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. 

Liquidity and Capital Resources 

To date, we have financed
our operating activities primarily through cash raised in loans from related parties (see Note 9 Related Party Transactions
and Balances ), and equity financing including private placements. As of September 30, 2024, our cash was 33,636. 

We have been incurring losses from operations since inception. Accumulated
loss amounted to approximately 36.9 million and 34.4 million as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. Net cash
used in operating activities were approximately 0.9 million and 0.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. As
of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the working capital was approximately (6.6) million and 0.7 million, respectively. The
working capital excluded the non-cash items, which are prepaid expenses for the certain forward purchase agreement entered into on June
11, 2024, by and among FLFV, the Company and certain investors (the Forward Purchase Agreement ), deferred offering costs
and advance of subscription fees from shareholders. These conditions raised substantial doubts about the Company s ability to continue
as a going concern. 

Our liquidity is based on
our ability to generate cash from operating activities, obtain capital financing from equity interest investors and borrow funds on favorable
economic terms to fund our general operations and capital expansion needs. Our ability to continue as a going concern is dependent on
management s ability to successfully execute our business plan, which includes increasing revenue while controlling operating cost
and expenses to generate positive operating cash flows and obtaining funds from outside sources of financing to generate positive financing
cash flows. Currently, we are working to improve our liquidity and capital sources mainly through borrowing from related parties by obtaining
financial support from our principal shareholder who has committed to continue providing funds for our working capital needs whenever
needed. 

In addition, in order to
fully implement our business plan and sustain continued growth, we are also actively seeking private equity financing from outside investors.
However, there can be no assurance that these plans and arrangements will be sufficient to fund our ongoing capital expenditure, working
capital, and other requirements.

our controlling shareholder, and proceeds of approximately 0.2 million from investors pursuant to Forward Purchase Agreement, partially
offset by payment of offering cost of approximately 0.9 million and payment of approximately 0.4 million of extension loans on behalf
of Feutune Light Sponsor LLC (the Sponsor ). 

For the nine months ended
September 30, 2023, we reported cash provided by financing activities of approximately 0.7 million, which was primarily provided by proceeds
of 1.2 million from private placements, partially net off by return of subscription fee of approximately 0.1 million and payment of
approximately 0.3 million as extension loans on behalf of the Sponsor of FLFV. 

30 

Commitment and Contingencies 

On June 21, 2024, the Company
entered into an escrow agreement (the Escrow Agreement with Mr. Wellen Sham, Yuanmei Ma and CST, pursuant to which, among
other things, (1) CST will act as the escrow agent under the Escrow Agreement; (2) at the closing of the Business Combination, the Company
deposited with CST 20,000,000 shares of common stock as Earnout Shares, to be held by CST in a segregated escrow account Earnout
Escrow Account and (3) if any portion of the Earnout Shares becomes eligible for release in accordance with the terms of the
Escrow Agreement, CST will release the applicable portion of the Earnout Shares from the Earnout Escrow Account in accordance with the
terms of the Escrow Agreement and disburse to each eligible recipient the applicable portion of Earnout Shares therefrom. 

The Earnout Shares shall
be released or otherwise forfeited as follows: (i) an aggregate of 5,000,000 Earnout Shares (the Tranche 1 Earnout Shares will be vested, if and only if, on the occurrence that the amount of sales/revenues of the Company for any of the fiscal years (such fiscal
year is referred to as Tranche 1 Fiscal Year ending from December 31, 2023 to December 31, 2025 is no less than 42,200,000
as evidenced by the audited financial statements of the Company prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP for the Tranche 1 Fiscal Year that
is contained in an annual report on Form 10-K filed by the Company with the SEC (the Tranche 1 Annual Report (ii) an aggregate
of 15,000,000 Earnout Shares (the Tranche 2 Earnout Shares will be vested, if and only if, on the occurrence that the amount
of sales/revenues of the Company for any of the fiscal years (such fiscal year is referred to as Tranche 2 Fiscal Year ending from December 31, 2023 to December 31, 2026 is no less than 415,000,000 as evidenced by the audited financial statements of the
Company prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP for the Tranche 2 Fiscal Year that is contained in an annual report on Form 10-K filed by
the Company with the SEC (the Tranche 2 Annual Report (iii) Within five (5) business days following the determination
that all or any portion of the Tranche 1 Earnout Shares or Tranche 2 Earnout Shares become vested, the Company, together with Mr. Sham
and Ms. Ma, shall instruct the Escrow Agent to irrevocably and unconditionally release the vested tranche of Earnout Shares from the Escrow
Account in accordance with the terms of the Escrow Agreement to certain of the Company s shareholders. Each tranche of Earnout Shares
may be released only once, but more than one tranche can be released in any year in accordance with the Escrow Agreement. 

The Earnout Shares are determined
as contingent consideration in connection with the reverse recapitalization. In addition, the issuance of Earnout Shares does not meet
any condition to be classified as a liability under ASC 815, thus it should be classified as an equity financial instrument, and measure
at fair value using the quoted market price on grant date, June 11, 2024, which was 2.56 per share. 

For the nine months ended
September 30, 2024, the sales/revenue condition described above was not met based on the consolidated statements of income. Currently
the Company could not reasonably assess the performance condition for the year ending December 31, 2024 and thereafter. 

Other than the above, in
the normal course of business, we are subject to loss contingencies, such as certain legal proceedings, claims and disputes. We record
a liability for such loss contingencies when the likelihood of an unfavorable outcome is probable and the amount of loss can be reasonably
estimated. 

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 

We have not entered into
any financial guarantees or other commitments to guarantee the payment obligations of any third parties. In addition, we have not entered
into any derivative contracts that are indexed to the shares of our common stock and classified as shareholder s equity or that
are not reflected in our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements. Furthermore, we do not have any retained or contingent
interest in assets transferred to an unconsolidated entity that serves as credit, liquidity or market risk support to such entity. We
do not have any variable interest in any unconsolidated entity that provides financing, liquidity, market risk or credit support to us
or engages in product development services with us. 

31 

Research and Development 

We have incurred minimal
research and development expenses for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. The researched and development expenses
were recorded in general and administrative expenses in the unaudited condensed consolidated statements of operations. 

Critical Accounting Estimates 

We prepare our financial
statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP, which requires our management to make judgments, estimates and assumptions that affect the
reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities on the date of the consolidated financial
statements, and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. We continually evaluate these judgments, estimates
and assumptions based on our own historical experience, knowledge and assessment of current business and other conditions, our expectations
regarding the future based on available information and various assumptions that we believe to be reasonable, which together form our
basis for making judgments about matters that are not readily apparent from other sources. Since the use of estimates is an integral component
of the financial reporting process, our actual results could differ from those estimates. Some of our accounting policies require a higher
degree of judgment than others in their application. 

The selection of critical
accounting policies, the judgments and other uncertainties affecting application of those policies and the sensitivity of reported results
to changes in conditions and assumptions are factors that should be considered when reviewing our financial statements. We believe the
following accounting policies involve the most significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements.
You should read the description of critical accounting policies, judgments and estimates in conjunction with our unaudited condensed consolidated
financial statements and other disclosures included in this Quarterly Report. 

We do not have critical accounting
estimates that are related to us. A list of accounting policies, judgements and estimates that are relevant to us is included in notes
to our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report (see Note 2 
Summary of Significant Accounting Policies ). 

Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements 

The Company has evaluated
all recently issued accounting pronouncements and believes such pronouncements do not have a material effect on the Company s condensed
consolidated financial statements. A list of recently issued accounting pronouncements that are relevant to us is included in the notes
to our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report (see Note 2 
Summary of Significant Accounting Policies ).

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 

As a smaller reporting company,
the Company is not required to provide the information required by this Item. 

Item 4. Controls and Procedures 

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

Disclosure controls and procedures
(as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) are controls and other procedures that are designed with the objective
of ensuring that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed under the Exchange Act, such as this Quarterly Report, is recorded,
processed, summarized, and reported within the time period specified in the SEC s rules and forms, and that such information is
collected and communicated to management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow
timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 

Our management evaluated,
with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer (the principal executive officer) and our Chief Financial Officer (the principal
financial officer), the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the
Exchange Act) as of September 30, 2024. Based upon the evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that
the Company s disclosure controls and procedures were not effective, at the reasonable assurance level, as of September 30, 2024,
we identified the material weakness that we are lack of sufficient financial reporting and accounting personnel with appropriate knowledge
of U.S. GAAP and SEC reporting requirements to properly address complex U.S. GAAP technical accounting issues and prepare and review financial
statements and related disclosures in accordance with U.S. GAAP and reporting requirements set forth by the SEC. Our management is currently
in the process of evaluating the steps necessary to remediate the ineffectiveness, such as (i) hiring a consulting firm with U.S. GAAP
experience to strengthen our financial reporting function; (ii) establishing an ongoing program to provide sufficient and appropriate
training for financial reporting and accounting personnel, especially training related to U.S. GAAP and SEC reporting requirement. 

Limitations on Controls and Procedures 

We do not expect that our
disclosure controls and procedures will prevent all errors and all instances of fraud. Disclosure controls and procedures, no matter how
well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the disclosure controls and procedures
are met. Further, the design of disclosure controls and procedures must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the
benefits must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all disclosure controls and procedures, no
evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures can provide absolute assurance that we have detected all our control deficiencies and
instances of fraud, if any. The design of disclosure controls and procedures also is based partly on certain assumptions about the likelihood
of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future
conditions. 

This Quarterly Report does
not include an attestation report of internal controls from our independent registered public accounting firm due to our status as an
emerging growth company under the JOBS Act. 

Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 

There were no changes in
our internal control over financial reporting during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, which were identified in connection
with management s evaluation required by paragraph (d) of Rules 13a-15 and 15d-15 under the Exchange Act, that have materially affected,
or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

PART II: OTHER INFORMATION 

Item 2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of

On August 20,
2024, the Company entered into certain a Common Stock Purchase Agreement (the Purchase Agreement and a Registration Rights
Agreement (the Registration Rights Agreement , collectively with the Purchase Agreement, the Agreements with
Westwood Capital Group LLC, a Delaware limited liability company Westwood ). Pursuant to the Agreements, the Company has
paid Westwood a commitment fee valued at 1,500,000 in the form of 150,000 shares of common stock (each a Commitment Share ,
