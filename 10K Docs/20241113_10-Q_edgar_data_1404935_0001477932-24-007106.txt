Corporate History THC Therapeutics, Inc., was incorporated in the State of Nevada on May 1, 2007, as Fairytale Ventures, Inc., and later changed its name to Aviation Surveillance Systems, Inc. and Harmonic Energy, Inc. On January 23, 2017, the Company changed its name to THC Therapeutics, Inc. On January 17, 2018, the Company changed its name to Millennium BlockChain Inc. On September 28, 2018, the Company changed its name back to THC Therapeutics, Inc.

Description of Business The Company is focused on operations in the wellness industry. The Company is developing a sanitizing herb dryer, the dHydronator , with multiple design, function, and usage patents. This innovative, laboratory-proven product is specifically designed for the drying and sanitizing (i.e., reducing the bacterial count by using ultraviolet light) of freshly harvested cannabis, and other herbs, flowers, and tea leaves. The dHydronator can reduce moisture content of cannabis to 10-15 in only 10-14 hours. Traditional herbal drying times can take up to two weeks. 16 Table of Contents Wellness Operations THC Therapeutics is focused on the wellness industry, with plans to develop a patented herb dryer. The Company is developing a sanitizing herb dryer, the dHydronator , with multiple design, function, and usage patents. This innovative, laboratory-proven 1 product is specifically designed for the drying and sanitizing (i.e., reducing the bacterial count by using ultraviolet light) of freshly harvested cannabis, and other herbs, flowers, and tea leaves. The dHydronator can reduce moisture content of cannabis to 10-15 in only 10-14 hours. Traditional herbal drying times can take up to two weeks. The dHydronator can also significantly reduce the bacterial count of the cannabis during the drying process, but it will not eliminate all bacteria from the cannabis or other plant materials. The Company has a functioning prototype of the dHydronator similar in design to that shown below, which is now protected by a patent with the United States Patent and Trademark Office (see Patent, Trademark, License Franchise Restrictions and Contractual Obligations Concessions below), and once the Company has sufficient funds available, the Company plans to source parts for serial manufacturing and negotiate and secure serial manufacturing and assembly. The Company also plans to hire sales and marketing staff as funds are available. More specifically, once we have at least 2,000,000 in in available cash flow or funds from other operations and if we receive the patent, we intend to engage in further development efforts as follows: (i) finalizing case design, with an estimated tooling expense of approximately 300,000- 500,000; manufacturing pre-production units for field testing and presentation to potential partners and distributors, with an estimated expense of 250,000; (iii) hiring a subject-matter expert and consultants or employees in the home herb garden and legal cannabis marketplace to manage the development and sales of herb dryer, with an estimated expense of 400,000 for 12 months; (iv) engaging in further detailed laboratory of our herb drying with respect to cannabis plants and home herb garden plants, with an estimated expense of 50,000 to 100,000 for 12 months; (v) establishing a relationship with a market research and/or marketing company to explore creative strategies, advertising concepts, and consumer opinion, explore applications of our intellectual property in the existing wholesale and retail distribution channels for home herb, garden products and legal cannabis markets, and determine the best path for sales, distribution and licensing of our intellectual property, with an estimated expense of 1,000,000 for 12 months. 1 Tests were conducted in 2016-2017 by independent cannabis-testing labs: first by CannLabs on the first-generation dHydronator prototype, and later by Digipath Labs on the second-generation prototype. Optimal cannabis moisture content is 8-12 . The initial testing by CannLabs showed that (i) moisture content across five wet cannabis samples was reduced to an average moisture content of 13.81 with a standard deviation of 4.04 after 12 hours of drying, and 8.86 with a standard deviation of 2.25 after 16 hours of drying, and (ii) after autoclaving cannabis flowers to ensure sterility and then spiking multiple samples with 100 CFU of E. Coli and Salmonella bacteria and Aspergillus niger mold, testing for the presence of the bacteria and mold by both quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) and traditional plating methods, which testing concluded that the dHydronator prototype eliminated or reduced the bacteria and mold contamination, but did not quantify the results. The subsequent testing by Digipath Labs on the second-generation prototype covered multiple strains and independent tests to confirm the prior findings. The strains tested were Lucy Diamond, Cotton Candy, Blue Dream, Kings Cut, Pot of Gold and Diablo. The optimal drying time was determined to be 10-14 hours in the first test. The Company s proprietary sanitizing technology brought the failing TAC (total aerobic count) from over 300,000 CFU/g down to 78,000 CFU/g (anything less than 100,000 CFU/g is considered passing in the second test. In the third test, after drying 14 hours and 15.5 hours in the dHydronator and using the Company s proprietary sanitizing technology for a longer period than required, the moisture content had been reduced from 80 (at 0 hours) to 10.89 (at 14 hours) and 8.83 (at 15.5 hours), the THCA had been reduced from 21.2 (at 0 hours) to 17.26 (at 14 hours) and 18.26 (at 15.5 hours), and the TAC had been reduced from 210,000 CFU/g (at 0 hours) to 1,500 CFU/g (at 14 hours) and 500 CFU/g (at 15.5 hours). In the fourth experiment, after 12 hours and 15.5 hours of drying in the dHydronator and using the proprietary sanitizing technology for a longer period than required, the moisture content had reduced from 80 to 12.00 (at 12 hours) and 7.44 (at 15.5 hours), the THCA had been reduced from 21.2 to 20.08 (at 12 hours) and 19.43 (at 15.5 hours), and the TAC had been reduced from 190,000 CFU/g to 51,000 CFU/g (at 12 hours) and 2,300 CFU/g (at 15.5 hours). After 14 hours of drying, the moisture content had been reduced to 8.15 , the THCA had been reduced to 19.82 , and the TAC had been reduced to 21,000 CFU/g. In the fifth test, prior moisture and THCA results were tested, but this time using the Company s proprietary sanitizing technology for a much shorter time period, using two samples of a different cannabis strain, and testing the expanded cannabinoid profile data of each sample, and after 12 hours of drying two different samples, moisture content for the two samples decreased from 74 and 74 to 9.17 and 9.90 , respectively, and THCA increased from 14.45 and 14.94 before drying to 16.81 and 17.2 , respectively, after 12 hours of drying. Test six was a test of the same strain as test five but using a different lot of plant material, and moisture content decreased from 81 to 11.5 after 12 hours of drying, while TCHA increased from 21.28 to 22.6 after 12 hours of drying. The seventh through ninth tests confirmed prior results. 17 Table of Contents Competition There are a number of commercial herb dryers sold by competitors, including Yofumo Technologies, which are already commercially available, and which have significant market share. There is no assurance that we will be able to compete effectively with any of these competitors. Market Opportunity The Company s herb dryer, the dHydronator , safely lowers moisture content and sanitizes without harm to the integrity of the plant. Our test results have been proven to dry cannabis in less than 14 hours verses up to 14 days using traditional drying methods. Test results indicate the removal of many surface germs and bacteria including powder mold, dust mites and spider mites from herbs, plants, the surface of glass or ceramic herbal tea accessories, and any other object that fits safely in the drying chamber. Therefore, we believe that our product will be attractive to the cannabis and home herb and garden product markets. Marketing Strategy We plan to attend regional cannabis-related trade shows and offer field testing to legal cannabis growers and suppliers in the United States and Canada initially, and throughout the world once the technology has been adopted in the regional market. We also plan to establish a relationship with a market research and marketing company to explore creative strategies, advertising concepts, consumer opinion, existing distribution and sales channels and potential licensing of our intellectual property, to determine the best path for sales and distribution. We also intend to hire subject matter expert consultants or employees in the legal cannabis and home herb marketplace to manage the development and sales of our products. Once our marketing experts identify an herbal or commercial agriculture niche or venue to enter or solicit, we will market to distributors and retailers via trade shows and direct contact. Customers Due to the nature of its business and its focus on development of its patent-pending herb dryer, the Company does not currently have any customers.

Results of Operations The following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and notes thereto for the three months ended April 30, 2024, and related management discussion herein. Our financial statements are stated in U.S. Dollars and are prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles of the United States GAAP ). Going Concern Qualification Several conditions and events cast substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. The Company has incurred cumulative net losses of 38,953,783 since its inception and requires capital for its contemplated operational and marketing activities to take place. The Company s ability to raise additional capital through the future issuances of common stock is unknown. The obtainment of additional financing, the successful development of the Company s contemplated plan of operations, and its transition, ultimately, to the attainment of profitable operations are necessary for the Company to continue operations. The ability to successfully resolve these factors raise substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. For the Three Months Ended April 30, 2024 and 2023: Our operating results for the three months ended April 30, 2024 and 2023, and the changes between those periods for the respective items are summarized as follows: Three months ended April 30, Change 2024 2023 Amount Percentage Operating loss (379,698 (58,020 (321,678 554 Other income 484,320 152,375 331,945 (218 Net income (loss) 104,622 94,355 10,267 11 Revenues We did not earn any revenues during the three months ending April 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively.

We intend to fund operations through sales of our herb dryer and debt and/or equity financing arrangements, which may be insufficient to fund expenditures or other cash requirements. We plan to seek additional financing in a private equity offering to secure funding for operations. There can be no assurance that we will be successful in raising additional funding. If we are not able to secure additional funding, the implementation of our business plan will be impaired. There can be no assurance that such additional financing will be available to us on acceptable terms or at all.

QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK. Not Applicable. ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES. Disclosure Controls and Procedures The Securities and Exchange Commission defines the term disclosure controls and procedures to mean the company s controls and other procedures of an issuer that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports that it files or submits under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by an issuer in the reports that it files or submits under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is accumulated and communicated to the issuer s management, including its principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. The Company maintains such a simple system of controls and procedures in an effort to ensure that all information which it is required to disclose in the reports it files under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified under the SEC s rules and forms and that information required to be disclosed is accumulated and communicated to principal executive and principal financial officers to allow timely decisions regarding disclosure. As of the end of the period covered by this report, we carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures. Based on this evaluation, our chief executive officer and chief financial officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective to provide reasonable assurance of achieving the objectives of timely alerting them to material information required to be included in our periodic SEC reports and of ensuring that such information is recorded, processed, summarized and reported with the time periods specified. Our chief executive officer and chief financial officer also concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of the end of the period covered by this report to provide reasonable assurance of the achievement of these objectives. Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting There were no changes in the Company s internal control over financial reporting identified in connection with the evaluation required by paragraph (d) of Rule 13a-15 or 15d-15 of the Exchange Act that occurred during the quarter ended April 30, 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company s internal control over financial reporting. 22 Table of Contents PART II - OTHER INFORMATION ITEM 1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS. From time to time, we may become involved in various lawsuits and legal proceedings which arise in the ordinary course of business. However, litigation is subject to inherent uncertainties, and an adverse result in these or other matters may arise from time to time that may harm our business. We are not presently a party to any material litigation, nor to the knowledge of management is any litigation threatened against us, which may materially affect us, other than as set forth herein. On or about January 5, 2021, another Company lender, Iliad Research and Trading, L.P. Iliad ), sent a demand letter to the Company regarding the Company s alleged default under its promissory note issued to Iliad. The Company retained litigation counsel in Nevada and responded, and Iliad sued the Company in the fall of 2021 in Utah, where Iliad is domiciled (case no. 210000342 filed in the Third Judicial Court of Salt Lake City, Utah). In December of 2021, the Company was improperly served, Iliad subsequently received a default judgment, and the Company then filed a motion to set aside the judgment, which motion was granted by the court on or about May 9, 2022. The Company intends to vigorously defend the action, and on or about May 31, 2022, removed the case to United States District Court for the District of Utah (case no. 2:22-cv-00367-DAO). The Company subsequently filed a motion to stay arbitration as demanded by Iliad and filed an Answer and Counterclaim against Iliad. The case was later remanded back to Utah state court, and the judge ordered the matter to be arbitrated. In 2023, the parties agreed to have Paul Moxley arbitrate the dispute. In the arbitration, the Company is both defending against Iliad s claims and pursuing counterclaims against Iliad. The matter was previously scheduled for trial in February 2024, but the parties are in the process of identifying new 2024 trial dates. The Company also filed a renewed motion to stay arbitration. On January 31, 2024, the Company and Iliad entered into a Settlement Agreement and Mutual Release to fully settle all disputes related to the Case and the Arbitration. ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS.
