 NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 

 (UNAUDITED) 

per share (the Common Stock ), in conjunction with terminating the Company s public company reporting obligations and delisting the Common Stock from the Nasdaq Capital Market, subject to obtaining the requisite approval of the Company s stockholders at the Company s 2024 Annual Meeting of Stockholders to be held on November 25, 2024 (the Annual Meeting ). 

Specifically, the participating members of the Board recommended and approved a transaction whereby the Company would effect a reverse stock split of the Common Stock at a ratio not less than 1-for- and not greater than 1-for- (the Reverse Stock Split ), followed immediately by a forward stock split of the Common Stock at the same ratio but inverse (i.e., if the Reverse Stock Split were 1-for-5,000, then the Forward Stock Split would be 5,000-for-1) (the Forward Stock Split, and together with the Reverse Stock Split, the Stock Split ). Stockholders owning fewer shares of Common Stock than the Reverse Stock Split ratio denominator at the effective time of the Reverse Stock Split would be converted into the right to receive in cash, without interest, for each share of Common Stock held by them at the effective time of the Reverse Stock Split, and thereafter they would no longer be stockholders of the Company. Stockholders owning more shares of Common Stock than the Reverse Stock Split ratio denominator at the effective time of the Reverse Stock Split Continuing Stockholders would not be entitled to receive any cash for their fractional share interests resulting from the Reverse Stock Split, if any. The Forward Stock Split, which would immediately follow the Reverse Stock Split, would reconvert whole shares and fractional share interests held by the Continuing Stockholders back into the same number of shares of the Common Stock held by such Continuing Stockholders immediately before the effective time of the Reverse Stock Split. As a result of the Forward Stock Split, the total number of shares of Common Stock held by a Continuing Stockholder would not change as a result of the Reverse Stock Split. The Company estimates that as of October 8, 2024, based on a mid-point Reverse Stock Split ratio of 1-for- , approximately million shares of Common Stock (or approximately of the Common Stock currently outstanding) would be cashed out in the Transaction (as defined below) and the aggregate cost to the Company of the Transaction would be approximately million, plus transaction expenses, which are estimated to be approximately . The Company expects to fund such costs using the proceeds from the Stock Sale (defined below) and cash-on-hand. 

On August 12, 2024, in connection with the Transaction, the Company entered into a stock purchase agreement (the Purchase Agreement, and the Purchase Agreement, including the transactions contemplated thereby, the Stock Split and the subsequent delisting and deregistration of the Company s common stock as described herein, collectively, the Transaction with 3K Limited Partnership, a Delaware limited partnership 3K and together with Mr. Kamin, the Investors ), Peter H. Kamin, a natural person in his individual capacity Mr. Kamin ), the Peter H. Kamin Revocable Trust dated February 2003 (the 2003 Trust ), the Peter H. Kamin Children s Trust dated March 1997 (the 1997 Trust ), the Peter H. Kamin GST Trust (the GST and the Peter H. Kamin Family Foundation (the Foundation ). Pursuant to the Purchase Agreement, the Investors have agreed to purchase, subject to the terms and conditions thereof, up to shares (the Shares of the Company s Common Stock, at a purchase price of per share, for an aggregate purchase price of up to (the Stock Sale ). The Company intends to use the proceeds from the Stock Sale to purchase fractional shares of Common Stock resulting from the proposed Reverse Stock Split and for working capital and general corporate purposes. Prior to the closing of the Stock Sale (the Closing Date ), the Company will determine the number of Shares to be issued (not to exceed shares) so as to provide the Company with (i) proceeds sufficient to purchase the fractional shares of Common Stock resulting from the proposed Reverse Stock Split and (ii) an additional designated for working capital and general corporate purposes. The consummation of the Stock Sale is subject to the satisfaction of customary closing conditions, including receiving the requisite approval by the Company s stockholders at the Annual Meeting of (i) the terms and conditions of the Purchase Agreement and the proposed Reverse Stock Split and (ii) the filing of a certificate of amendment to the Company s amended and restated certificate of incorporation to effect the Reverse Stock Split on the basis of the final split ratio, which final split ratio will be determined by the Board prior to the closing. In addition, under the terms of the Purchase Agreement, in connection with each annual or special meeting of stockholders of the Company occurring after the Closing Date at which directors of the Company are to be elected, (i) the Company shall include two individuals designated by 3K and satisfying certain eligibility criteria (each, a 3K Director Nominee as nominees for election to the Company s board of directors (the Board in its proxy materials and (ii) the Board shall recommend to the stockholders of the Company the election of such 3K Director Nominees to the Board in the same manner as it recommends the election of the Company s other director nominees. Additionally, pursuant to the terms of the Purchase Agreement, from and after the Closing Date, the Company shall not, without 3K s prior written consent, increase the size of the Board to more than five directors. In the event the Company s stockholders are permitted to elect directors by action by written consent pursuant to the Company s bylaws and applicable law, the foregoing provisions shall be applied mutatis mutandis in connection with any such action. The Company has also granted the Investors certain indemnification rights with respect to the transactions contemplated by the Purchase Agreement. The Shares will be issued and sold without registration under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the Securities Act ), in reliance on the exemptions provided by Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act and/or Regulation D promulgated thereunder and in reliance on similar exemptions under applicable state laws. 

The Company is taking these steps to avoid the substantial cost and expense of being a public reporting company and to focus the Company's resources on enhancing long-term stockholder value. The Company anticipates savings of approximately on an annual basis as a result of the Transaction. 

The Board has determined the Transaction is in the best interests of all of the Company s stockholders. The Company currently realizes none of the traditional benefits of public company status, yet incurs all of the significant annual expenses and indirect costs associated with being a public company. Without its public company status, the Company would have an ongoing cost structure befitting its current and foreseeable scale of operations and its management would be able to have an increased focus on core operations. 

On October 18, 2024, the Company filed a definitive proxy statement that includes important information regarding the foregoing. Subject to stockholder approval of the Transaction at the Annual Meeting, it is anticipated that the Transaction would become effective after the Annual Meeting. Subject to receiving such stockholder approval, as soon as practicable after the Annual Meeting, the Company expects to terminate the registration of its Common Stock with the SEC and de-list its Common Stock from the Nasdaq Capital Market. As a result, at such time, (i) the Company would cease to file annual, quarterly, current, and other reports and documents with the SEC, and stockholders would cease to receive annual reports and proxy statements, and (ii) the Company s Common Stock would no longer be listed on the Nasdaq Capital Market. Notwithstanding the foregoing, our duty to file periodic and current reports with the SEC will not be suspended with respect to the current fiscal year due to our existing registration statements filed under the Securities Act, including the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2024. 

The Board may abandon the Transaction and terminate the Purchase Agreement at any time prior to the filing and effectiveness of the applicable amendments to the Company s amended and restated certificate of incorporation, even after stockholder approval. 

million of cash on hand. As of the date of this report, management currently believes that such funds, together with future operating profits and additional cash proceeds from the Transaction, should be adequate to fund anticipated working capital requirements, including debt obligations, and capital expenditures for at least the next 12 months. However, the terms of our existing equipment financing do not provide for future borrowings, and other than cash infusion contemplated by the Purchase Agreement, we have no existing line of credit or other fixed source of capital reserves. Depending upon our results of operations, our future capital needs, and available marketing opportunities, we may be required to seek various financing sources to raise additional funds. Such sources could include but are not limited to, additional issuance of common stock or debt financing, lines of credit, equipment leasing or a strategic transaction although there is no assurance that such financings will be available to us on terms we deem acceptable, if at all. If we are unable to maintain sufficient financial resources, our business, financial condition and results of operations would be materially adversely affected. 

Accounts Receivable 

The Company believes its allowance for credit losses related to its accounts receivable remained adequate as of September 30, 2024, due to the diversity of its large customer base. While the Company anticipates there could be an increase in the aging of its accounts receivable, the Company does not anticipate a significant increase in default risk. 

Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements 

In November 2023, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update ASU No. 2023-07, Segment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures. The ASU requires disclosures to include significant segment expenses that are regularly provided to the chief operating decision maker, among other provisions. The ASU is effective for fiscal year periods beginning after December 15, 2023, and interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024. Early adoption is permitted and the ASU requires retrospective application to all prior periods presented in the financial statements. We are currently evaluating the standard to determine the impact of adoption to our consolidated financial statements and disclosures. 

In December 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-09, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Improvement to Income Tax Disclosures to enhance the transparency and decision usefulness of income tax disclosures. The ASU primarily enhances and expands both the income tax rate reconciliation disclosure and the income taxes paid disclosure. The ASU is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2024 on a prospective basis. Early adoption is permitted. We are currently evaluating the standard to determine the impact of adoption to our consolidated financial statements and disclosures. 

In November 2024, the FASB issued ASU No. 2024-03, Income Statement- Reporting Comprehensive Income- Expense Disaggregation Disclosures (Subtopic 220-40), requiring public business entities to disclose additional information about specific expense categories in the notes to financial statements at interim and annual reporting periods. ASU 2024-03 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2026, and interim reporting periods beginning after December 15,2027, with early adoption permitted. The disclosures required under the guidance can be applied either prospectively to financial statements issued for reporting periods after the effective date or retrospectively to any or all periods presented in the financial statements. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of adopting this guidance on its consolidated financial statements and disclosures.

Item 2. 

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 

FACTORS THAT MAY AFFECT FUTURE RESULTS 

From time to time, information provided by the Company or statements made by its employees may contain forward-looking information that involves risks and uncertainties. In particular, statements contained in this report that are not historical facts (including but not limited to statements concerning earnings, earnings per share, revenues, cash flows, dividends, future business, growth opportunities, profitability, pricing, new accounts, customer base, market share, test volume, sales and marketing strategies, market demand for drug testing services in the U.S. and foreign drug testing laws and regulations, required investments in plant, equipment, and people and new test development, the perceived benefits and costs of the Transaction (as defined below), the number of fractional shares of the Company s Common Stock that are expected to be cashed out in the Transaction, the timing and stockholder approval of the Transaction, the timing and closing of the transactions contemplated by the Purchase Agreement (as defined below) and the Company s intended use of proceeds from the Purchase Agreement) may be forward looking statements. Actual results may differ from those stated in any forward-looking statements. Factors that may cause such differences include but are not limited to risks associated with the changes in U.S. and foreign government regulations, including but not limited to FDA regulations, R D spending, competition (including, without limitation, competition from other companies pursuing the same growth opportunities), the Company s ability to maintain its reputation and brand image, the ability of the Company to achieve its business plans, cost controls, the continued labor shortage, leveraging of its global operating platform, risks of information technology system failures and data security breaches, the uncertain global economy, the Company s ability to attract, develop and retain executives and other qualified employees and independent contractors, including distributors, the Company s ability to obtain and protect intellectual property rights, litigation risks, and general economic conditions. In addition, the forward-looking statements relating to the Transaction discussed below are based on the Company s current expectations, assumptions, estimates and projections about the Company and involve significant risks and uncertainties, including the many variables that may impact the Company s projected cost savings, variables and risks related to consummation of the Transaction, regulatory review of the Company s filings related to the Transaction by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC ), the potential failure to satisfy the conditions to the consummation of the Transaction, including obtaining stockholder approval, and the continuing determination of the Board and Transaction Committee (as defined below) that the Transaction is in the best interests of all stockholders. 

Given these uncertainties, you should not place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements represent the Company s estimates and assumptions only as of the filing date of this Report. The Company expressly disclaims any duty to provide updates to forward-looking statements, and the estimates and assumptions associated with them, after the filing date of this Report, in order to reflect changes in circumstances or expectations, or the occurrence of unanticipated events, except to the extent required by applicable securities laws. All of the forward-looking statements are qualified in their entirety by reference to the factors discussed above and under Risk Factors set forth in Part I Item 1A of the 10-K, as well as the risks and uncertainties discussed elsewhere in this Report. The Company qualifies all of its forward-looking statements with these cautionary statements. The Company cautions you that these risks are not exhaustive. The Company operates in a continually changing business environment and new risks emerge from time to time.

Kamin and Darius Nevin, each a director of the Company, who were not in attendance and had recused themselves from the meeting) (the Board ), upon the recommendation of a transaction committee of the Board consisting of independent directors (the Transaction Committee ), unanimously approved a transaction whereby the Company would effect a reverse/forward stock split of the Company s common stock, par value 0.005 per share (the Common Stock ), in conjunction with terminating the Company s public company reporting obligations and delisting the Common Stock from the Nasdaq Capital Market, subject to obtaining the requisite approval of the Company s stockholders at the Company s 2024 Annual Meeting of Stockholders to be held on November 25, 2024 (the Annual Meeting ). 

Specifically, the participating members of the Board recommended and approved a transaction whereby the Company would effect a reverse stock split of the Common Stock at a ratio not less than 1-for-4,000 and not greater than 1-for-6,000 (the Reverse Stock Split ), followed immediately by a forward stock split of the Common Stock at the same ratio but inverse (i.e., if the Reverse Stock Split were 1-for-5,000, then the Forward Stock Split would be 5,000-for-1) (the Forward Stock Split, and together with the Reverse Stock Split, the Stock Split ). Stockholders owning fewer shares of Common Stock than the Reverse Stock Split ratio denominator at the effective time of the Reverse Stock Split would be converted into the right to receive 2.35 in cash, without interest, for each share of Common Stock held by them at the effective time of the Reverse Stock Split, and thereafter they would no longer be stockholders of the Company. Stockholders owning more shares of Common Stock than the Reverse Stock Split ratio denominator at the effective time of the Reverse Stock Split Continuing Stockholders would not be entitled to receive any cash for their fractional share interests resulting from the Reverse Stock Split, if any. The Forward Stock Split, which would immediately follow the Reverse Stock Split, would reconvert whole shares and fractional share interests held by the Continuing Stockholders back into the same number of shares of the Common Stock held by such Continuing Stockholders immediately before the effective time of the Reverse Stock Split. As a result of the Forward Stock Split, the total number of shares of Common Stock held by a Continuing Stockholder would not change as a result of the Reverse Stock Split. The Company estimates that as of October 8, 2024, based on a mid-point Reverse Stock Split ratio of 1-for-5,000, approximately 1.3 million shares of Common Stock (or approximately 21 of the Common Stock currently outstanding) would be cashed out in the Transaction (as defined below) and the aggregate cost to the Company of the Transaction would be approximately 3.0 million, plus transaction expenses, which are estimated to be approximately 700,000. The Company expects to fund such costs using the proceeds from the Stock Sale (defined below) and cash-on-hand. 

On August 12, 2024, in connection with the Transaction, the Company entered into a stock purchase agreement (the Purchase Agreement, and the Purchase Agreement, including the transactions contemplated thereby, the Stock Split and the subsequent delisting and deregistration of the Company s common stock as described herein, collectively, the Transaction with 3K Limited Partnership, a Delaware limited partnership 3K and together with Mr. Kamin, the Investors ), Peter H. Kamin, a natural person in his individual capacity Mr. Kamin ), the Peter H. Kamin Revocable Trust dated February 2003 (the 2003 Trust ), the Peter H. Kamin Children s Trust dated March 1997 (the 1997 Trust ), the Peter H. Kamin GST Trust (the GST and the Peter H. Kamin Family Foundation (the Foundation ). Pursuant to the Purchase Agreement, the Investors have agreed to purchase, subject to the terms and conditions thereof, up to 1,595,744 shares (the Shares of the Company s Common Stock, at a purchase price of 2.35 per share, for an aggregate purchase price of up to 3,750,000 (the Stock Sale ). The Company intends to use the proceeds from the Stock Sale to purchase fractional shares of Common Stock resulting from the proposed Reverse Stock Split and for working capital and general corporate purposes. Prior to the closing of the Stock Sale (the Closing Date ), the Company will determine the number of Shares to be issued (not to exceed 1,595,744 shares) so as to provide the Company with (i) proceeds sufficient to purchase the fractional shares of Common Stock resulting from the proposed Reverse Stock Split and (ii) an additional 500,000 designated for working capital and general corporate purposes. The consummation of the Stock Sale is subject to the satisfaction of customary closing conditions, including receiving the requisite approval by the Company s stockholders at the Annual Meeting of (i) the terms and conditions of the Purchase Agreement and the proposed Reverse Stock Split and (ii) the filing of a certificate of amendment to the Company s amended and restated certificate of incorporation to effect the Reverse Stock Split on the basis of the final split ratio, which final split ratio will be determined by the Board prior to the closing. 

In addition, under the terms of the Purchase Agreement, in connection with each annual or special meeting of stockholders of the Company occurring after the Closing Date at which directors of the Company are to be elected, (i) the Company shall include two individuals designated by 3K and satisfying certain eligibility criteria (each, a 3K Director Nominee as nominees for election to the Company s board of directors (the Board in its proxy materials and (ii) the Board shall recommend to the stockholders of the Company the election of such 3K Director Nominees to the Board in the same manner as it recommends the election of the Company s other director nominees. Additionally, pursuant to the terms of the Purchase Agreement, from and after the Closing Date, the Company shall not, without 3K s prior written consent, increase the size of the Board to more than five directors. In the event the Company s stockholders are permitted to elect directors by action by written consent pursuant to the Company s bylaws and applicable law, the foregoing provisions shall be applied mutatis mutandis in connection with any such action. The Company has also granted the Investors certain indemnification rights with respect to the transactions contemplated by the Purchase Agreement. The Shares will be issued and sold without registration under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the Securities Act ), in reliance on the exemptions provided by Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act and/or Regulation D promulgated thereunder and in reliance on similar exemptions under applicable state laws. 

12

The Transaction will be submitted to a vote of the Company s stockholders at the Annual Meeting pursuant to the terms of the Purchase Agreement and in accordance with the Company s amended and restated certificate of incorporation. The terms and contemplated timeline of the Transaction, including the manner of determining the fair value for fractional share interests to be cashed out in the Transaction, is set forth in the definitive proxy statement filed by the Company on October 18, 2024 and a transaction statement on Schedule 13E-3 filed by the Company on October 18, 2024 outlining the Transaction. The Transaction may be considered a going private transaction as defined in Rule 13e-3 promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act ), as it is part of a plan to terminate the registration of the Common Stock under Sections 12(b) and 15(d) of the Exchange Act and suspend the Company s duty to file periodic reports and other information with the SEC under Section 13(a) thereunder, and to delist the Common Stock from the Nasdaq Capital Market. The Board may abandon the Transaction and terminate the Purchase Agreement at any time prior to the filing and effectiveness of the applicable amendments to the Company s amended and restated certificate of incorporation, even after stockholder approval.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES 

At September 30, 2024, the Company had approximately 1.4 million of cash and cash equivalents. The Company's operating activities used net cash of 90 thousand for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. Investing activities provided 34 thousand of net cash while financing activities used 503 thousand of net cash for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 

Cash used in operating activities of 90 thousand reflected net loss of 2.1 million adjusted for depreciation and amortization of 918 thousand, ROU asset amortization of 750 thousand and stock-based compensation of 824 thousand offset by a net change in operating assets and liabilities of 532 thousand. 

Cash provided by investing activities of 34 thousand was primarily related to cost of internally developed software, rent deposit used to offset the lease termination and renewal of patents. 

Cash used in financing activities of 503 thousand was primarily related to payments on equipment debt financing and financed insurance. 

Contractual obligations and other commercial commitments as of September 30, 2024, included legal settlement commitments, operating lease commitments, and outstanding debt, described in Notes 6, 7, and 8, respectively of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. 

While management currently believes that its existing funds, cash flow from operations and proceeds from the Transaction should be adequate to fund the Company s business for at least the next 12 months, economic conditions could adversely affect the Company s future operating results and cash flows. Depending upon the Company s results of operations, its future capital needs and available marketing opportunities, the Company may use various financing sources to raise additional funds. Such sources could include but are not limited to, issuance of additional common stock or debt financing, lines of credit, or equipment leasing, although there is no assurance that such financings will be available to the Company on terms it deems acceptable, if at all. 

Item 4. Controls and Procedures 

As of the end of the period covered by this report (the evaluation date the Company s management under the supervision and with the participation of the Company s Chief Executive Officer and the Company s Vice President of Finance performed an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act. Based upon that evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and the Vice President of Finance concluded as of the evaluation date, that the Company s disclosure controls and procedures were effective for ensuring that information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports that it files or submits under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms, and that its disclosure controls and procedures were also effective to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to management, including the Company s principal executive and principal financial officers, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 

There has been no significant change in the Company s internal control over financial reporting during the most recent fiscal quarter that has materially affected or is reasonably likely to materially affect the Company s internal control over financial reporting.

Item 1. Legal Proceedings 

Information pertaining to legal proceedings can be found in Item 1. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Note 6 Commitments and Contingencies . 

Item 1A. Risk Factors 

Item 1A. of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, includes a discussion of our risk factors. Except for the Risks Related to the Company s Stock set forth below, there have been no material changes in the risk factors described in such report. 

Risks Related to the Company s Stock 

Subject to stockholder approval at the Annual Meeting, the board of directors of the Company has approved a plan to effectuate a reverse/forward stock split to reduce the number of record holders of the Company s Common Stock and to terminate the registration of the Company s Common Stock under the Exchange Act. 

If the proposed reverse/forward stock split is effected, the Company intends to terminate the registration of its Common Stock under the Exchange Act . Following deregistration, the Company will no longer file annual reports on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, and current reports on Form 8-K. Accordingly, there will be significantly less information regarding the Company available to stockholders and potential investors. In addition, the Company will no longer be subject to the provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and certain of the liability provisions of the Exchange Act, although the Company will still be subject to the antifraud provisions of the Exchange Act and any applicable state securities laws. Following deregistration, the Company s executive officers, directors and 10 stockholders will no longer be required to file reports relating to their transactions in the Common Stock with the SEC. In addition, the Company s executive officers, directors and 10 stockholders will no longer be subject to the recovery of short-swing profits provision of the Exchange Act, and persons acquiring 5 of the Common Stock will no longer be required to report their beneficial ownership under the Exchange Act. In addition, as soon as practicable following the effective time of the reverse/forward stock split, the Company plans to delist its Common Stock from the Nasdaq Stock Market. Any trading in our common stock after the deregistration and delisting would only occur in privately negotiated sales or potentially on the OTC Pink Market, if one or more brokers chooses to make a market for our Common Stock there and complies with applicable regulatory requirements however, there can be no assurances regarding any such trading. The lack of public information and increased illiquidity will make trading in our shares of Common Stock more difficult, which may cause the value of our Common Stock to decrease. 

On October 18, 2024, the Company filed a definitive proxy statement that includes important information regarding the foregoing. Stockholders are urged to read the definitive proxy statement carefully. 

Item 2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities, Use of Proceeds and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities 

There were no purchases of treasury stock in the first nine months of 2024.
