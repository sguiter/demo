 The effective tax rates were (26.2) and 15.2 for the nine months ended September 27, 2024 and September 29, 2023, respectively. 
 For the nine months ended September 27, 2024, the difference between the Company s effective tax rate of (26.2) and the 21 federal statutory rate was due to a benefit from the U.S. research and development tax credit, offset by the impact of discrete items on lower levels of pre-tax income, including a modification of the tax treatment of certain research and development expenditures recognized in prior years. 
 For the nine months ended September 29, 2023, the difference between our effective tax rate of 15.2 and the 21 federal statutory rate resulted primarily from a lower tax rate on foreign derived intangible income and benefit from the U.S. research and development tax credit related to multiple periods. These benefits were partially offset by other non-deductible expenses and state taxes.

 Powered Vehicles Group 
 Powered Vehicles Group net sales decreased by 60.3 million, or 14.9 , due to lower industry demand in Power Sports and automotive because of higher interest rates. 
 Powered Vehicles Group adjusted EBITDA decreased by 27.2 million, or 40.1 , mainly due to a decrease in gross profit. 
 Aftermarket Applications Group 
 Aftermarket Applications Group net sales decreased by 121.1 million, or 28.1 , driven by lower upfitting sales due to product mix, higher interest rates impacting industry dealers and consumers, and higher inventory levels at dealerships. 
 Aftermarket Applications Group adjusted EBITDA decreased by 67.6 million, or 63.8 , mainly due to lower gross profit. 
 Specialty Sports Group 
 Specialty Sports Group net sales increased by 90.8 million, or 30.7 , primarily due to the inclusion of 150.8 million in net sales from Marucci, partially offset by a reduction in bike sales of 60.0 million because of the ongoing bike channel inventory recalibration and, to a lesser extent, lower end consumer demand. 
 Specialty Sports Group adjusted EBITDA decreased by 5.9 million, or 6.2 , primarily due to a decline in gross profit driven by reduced operating leverage on lower volume, offset by the inclusion of Marucci which grew year over year. 
 Unallocated corporate expenses 
 Unallocated corporate expenses decreased by 5.0 million, or 10.6 , driven by cost containment measures.

 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 Our primary cash needs are to support working capital, interest on debt, employee compensation, capital expenditures, acquisitions, debt repayments, and other general corporate purposes. Historically, we generally financed our liquidity needs with operating cash flows, borrowings under our Prior Credit Facility and our 2022 Credit Facility, and the issuance of common stock. These sources of liquidity may be impacted by events described in Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements and Part II, Item 1A. Risk Factors . 
 As of September 27, 2024, we held 31.0 million of our 89.2 million of cash and cash equivalents in accounts of our subsidiaries outside of the U.S., which we may repatriate. 
 A summary of our operating, investing and financing activities is shown in the following table: 
 For the nine months ended (in millions) September 27, 2024 September 29, 2023 Net cash provided by operating activities 50.1 126.7 Net cash used in investing activities (42.5) (165.4) Net cash used in financing activities (1.7) (16.2) Effect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents (0.4) 0.3 Change in cash and cash equivalents 5.6 (54.6) 
 Amounts may not foot due to rounding. 
 We expect that cash on hand, cash flow from operations and availability under our 2022 Credit Facility will be sufficient to fund our operations during the next 12 months from the date of this Form 10-Q and beyond. 
 Operating activities 
 In the nine months ended September 27, 2024, net cash provided by operating activities was 50.1 million. Our investment in operating assets and liabilities is a result of an increase in inventory of 29.0 million, a decrease in income taxes payable of 25.3 million, and an increase in accounts receivable of 21.8 million, partially offset by an increase in accounts payable of 24.2 million, an increase in accrued expenses and other liabilities of 11.3 million, and a decrease in prepaids and other assets of 9.9 million. The decrease in income taxes payable is mainly due to lower income tax expense and our income tax payments. The increase in inventory is mainly due to timing and some seasonal inventory. The change in our accounts receivable reflects an increase in our sales and the timing of customer collections. The decrease in prepaids and other assets is primarily due to lower chassis deposits as we worked to sell through model year 2024. The increase in accrued expenses and other liabilities is mainly due to additional leases. The change in our accounts payable is driven by timing of inventory purchases and vendor payments. 
 In the nine months ended September 29, 2023, net cash provided by operating activities was 126.7 million. Our investment in operating assets and liabilities is a result of increases in prepaids and other assets of 53.5 million primarily due to carrying more chassis to meet current year production needs for the upfitting product lines, and decreases in accounts payable of 51.4 million, income taxes payable of 20.4 million and accrued expenses and other liabilities of 7.3 million, partially offset by decreases in accounts receivable of 53.3 million and inventory of 20.4 million. The change in our accounts receivable reflects a shift in our product line mix and the timing of customer collections. The change in our accounts payable is driven by timing of inventory purchases and vendor payments. The change in accrued expenses and other liabilities is primarily due to payments made for compensation and tax related accruals. The decrease in inventory reflects our continued efforts to optimize inventory levels. 
 Investing activities 
 In the nine months ended September 27, 2024 and September 29, 2023, net cash used in investing activities consisted of 42.5 million and 165.4 million, respectively. Investing activities for the nine months ended September 27, 2024 consisted of 32.1 million of property and equipment additions, 5.3 million of cash consideration for our acquisition of other assets, and 5.0 million of cash consideration for our acquisitions. Investing activities for the nine months ended September 29, 2023 consisted of 130.9 million of cash consideration for our purchase of Custom Wheel House, 32.0 million of property and equipment additions and 2.4 million in cash consideration for our purchase of other assets.

 Financing activities 
 In the nine months ended September 27, 2024, net cash used in financing activities was 1.7 million, and consisted of the proceeds from our 2022 Credit Facility revolver of 169.0 million and draw from the Delayed Draw Term Loan of 200.0 million that were used to support our working capital, offset by payments of 329.0 million to reduce the revolver borrowings, 13.2 million repayments on our term loans, 25.0 million to repurchase shares of our common stock for retirement, and payments of 2.6 million to repurchase shares of our common stock to cover withholding taxes from our stock-based compensation program. 
 In the nine months ended September 29, 2023, net cash provided by financing activities was 16.2 million, and consisted of the proceeds from our 2022 Credit Facility of 210.0 million that were used to support our working capital and the purchase of Custom Wheel House, offset by payments of 220.0 million to reduce the revolver borrowings and payments of 6.2 million to repurchase shares of our common stock to cover withholding taxes from our stock-based compensation program. 
 2022 Credit Facility 
 On April 5, 2022, the Company entered into a new credit agreement with Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, and other named lenders (the 2022 Credit Facility ). The 2022 Credit Facility, which matures on April 5, 2027, provides for revolving loans, swingline loans and letters of credit up to an aggregate amount of 650.0 million. 
 On April 5, 2022, the Company borrowed 475.0 million under the 2022 Credit Facility, which was used to repay all outstanding amounts owed under the Prior Credit Facility and for general corporate purposes. Future advances under the 2022 Credit Facility will be used to finance working capital, capital expenditures and other general corporate purposes of the Company. To the extent not previously paid, all then-outstanding amounts under the 2022 Credit Facility are due and payable on the maturity date. 
 The Company paid 2.0 million in debt issuance costs in connection with the 2022 Credit Facility, which were allocated to the revolver and amortized on a straight-line basis over the term of the facility. Additionally, the Company had 4.5 million of remaining unamortized debt issuance costs related to the Prior Credit Facility. The Company expensed 1.9 million of the remaining unamortized debt issuance costs and allocated 2.5 million to the 2022 Credit Facility. 
 The Company may borrow, prepay and re-borrow principal under the 2022 Credit Facility during its term. Advances under the 2022 Credit Facility can be either Adjusted Term SOFR loans or base rate loans. SOFR rate revolving loans bear interest on the outstanding principal amount thereof for each interest period at a rate per annum equal to Term SOFR for such calculation plus 0.10 plus a margin ranging from 1.00 to 2.00 . Base rate revolving loans bear interest on the outstanding principal amount thereof at a rate per annum equal to the highest of (i) Federal Funds Rate plus 0.50 , (ii) the rate of interest in effect for such day as publicly announced from time to time by the lender as its prime rate , and (iii) Adjusted Term SOFR rate for a one-month tenor plus 1.00 , subject to the interest rate floors set forth therein, plus a margin ranging from 0.00 to 1.00 . At September 27, 2024, the one-month SOFR and three-month SOFR rates were 5.21 and 5.33 , respectively. At September 27, 2024, our weighted-average interest rate on outstanding borrowing was 6.30 . 
 On November 14, 2023, in connection and concurrently with the closing of the Marucci acquisition, the Company entered into the First Incremental Facility Amendment (the Amendment amending the 2022 Credit Facility. The Amendment provided the Company with the Incremental Term A Loan in an amount of 400.0 million and the Delayed Draw Term Loan in an amount of 200.0 million, each of which are permitted under the 2022 Credit Facility, subject to satisfaction of certain conditions. The Incremental Term A Loan was fully funded on November 14, 2023 and used to fund a portion of the consideration owed under the Marucci acquisition. The Delayed Draw Term Loan was available to the Company for up to six months commencing on December 6, 2023, until the earlier of (a) May 14, 2024 and (b) the date on which the Delayed Draw Term commitments have been terminated. Each Incremental Term Loan is subject to quarterly amortization payments of principal at a rate of 5.00 per annum. The Incremental Term Loans are in the form of term SOFR loans and base rate loans, at the option of the Company, and have an applicable margin ranging from 0.50 to 1.50 for base rate loans and 1.50 to 2.50 for term SOFR loans, subject to adjustment provisions. Each Incremental Term Loan has a maturity date of April 5, 2027, consistent with the 2022 Credit Facility. 
 The Company paid 10.1 million in debt issuance costs, of which 6.7 million were allocated to the Term A Loan and 3.4 million were allocated to the Delayed Draw Term Loan. Loan fees allocated to the Term A Loan are amortized using the interest method over the term of the Credit Facility. Loan fees allocated to the Delayed Draw Term Loan were deferred as an asset until the debt is drawn. 
 On May 13, 2024, the Company borrowed the full amount of 200,000 of the Delayed Draw Term Loan. The fees were reclassified to a contra-liability account and amortized over the term of the drawn debt using the interest method.

 On July 31, 2024, the Company entered into the Third Amendment to the Credit Facility to secure an improved covenant profile on its capital structure to provide more flexibility given the uncertain macro environment. The Company continues to work on gaining further flexibility. 
 The 2022 Credit Facility is secured by substantially all of the Company s assets, restricts the Company s ability to make certain payments and engage in certain transactions, and requires that the Company satisfy customary financial ratios. The Company was in compliance with the covenants as of September 27, 2024. 

Material Cash Requirements 
 There have been no material changes to the information in our material cash requirements related to commitments or contractual obligations from those reported in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 29, 2023, as filed with the SEC on February 23, 2024. 

Inflation 
 Historically, inflation has not had a material effect on our results of operations. However, significant increases in inflation, particularly those related to wages and increases in the cost of raw materials have and could continue to have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 

ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 
 There have been no material changes to the disclosures discussed in the section Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk in Part II, Item 7A of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 29, 2023, as filed with the SEC on February 23, 2024. 

ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 We maintain disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act, designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to the company s management, including its principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 
 Our management, under the direction and with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer, evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of September 27, 2024. Based on the evaluation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of September 27, 2024, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that, as of such date, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective at the reasonable assurance level. 
 Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 There was no change in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) of the Exchange Act) identified in connection with the evaluation required by Rules 13a-15(d) and 15d-15(d) of the Exchange Act that occurred during the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

Table of Contents 

 Inherent Limitations on Effectiveness of Controls 
 Our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, believes that our disclosure controls and procedures and internal controls over financial reporting are designed to provide reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives and are effective at the reasonable assurance level. However, our management does not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures or our internal controls over financial reporting will prevent all errors and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, have been detected. These inherent limitations include, but are not limited to, the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty, and that breakdowns can occur because of a simple error or mistake. Additionally, controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people or by management override of the controls. The design of any system of controls also is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions. Over time, controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. Because of the inherent limitations in a cost-effective control system, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and may not be detected. 

PART II. OTHER INFORMATION 
 
 ITEM 1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS 
 On February 20, 2024, a complaint alleging violations of federal securities laws and seeking certification as a class action was filed against the Company and certain of its current and former officers in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Georgia in Atlanta. On August 16, 2024, the plaintiff filed an amended complaint that purports to seek damages on behalf of a putative class of persons who purchased the Company s common stock between May 6, 2021 and November 2, 2023. The amended complaint asserts claims under Sections 10(b) and 20 of the Securities Exchange Act and alleges that the Company and certain current and former officers made material misstatements and omissions to investors regarding demand for the Company s products and its inventory levels. The amended complaint generally seeks money damages, interest, attorneys fees, and other costs. The defendants deny all allegations of wrongdoing, believe the plaintiff s positions are without merit, and intend to vigorously defend themselves. On October 15, 2024, the defendants filed a motion to dismiss the amended complaint. Per the Court s scheduling order, the plaintiff will file his opposition by December 13, 2024, and defendants will reply by January 13, 2025. 
 On October 9, 2024, and October 29, 2024, two stockholder derivative complaints were filed in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Georgia against certain of the Company s officers and its directors, with the Company named as a nominal defendant. The cases are assigned to the same judge presiding over the securities fraud class action. The complaints are premised on substantially the same factual allegations as the securities fraud class action, but in these complaints, the plaintiff claims that the Company s officers and directors breached their fiduciary duties or otherwise engaged in wrongdoing by allowing the underlying securities fraud to occur. The defendants deny all allegations of wrongdoing, believe the plaintiffs claims are without merit, and intend to vigorously defend themselves. 
 
 ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS 
 Work stoppages or other disruptions, including those that involve our customers, could adversely affect our operating results. 
 A portion of our goods move through ports on the coasts of the U.S. We have a global supply chain, and we import products from our third-party vendors and our Fox Taiwan facility into the U.S. largely through these ports. Dockworkers, none of whom are our employees, must offload freight from ships arriving at these ports. We do not control the activities of these employees or seaports, and we could suffer supply chain disruptions due to any disputes, capacity shortages, slowdowns, or shutdowns that may occur, as was experienced in February 2015, in relation to certain ports on the West Coast of the U.S. Most recently, the International Longshoremen s Association ILA ), which negotiates on behalf of 45,000 dockworkers at three dozen ports from Maine to Texas and collectively handles about half of seaborne imports into the U.S., began a member strike due to disagreements with the United States Maritime Alliance. While the ILA strike was suspended after two days and dockworkers returned to ports following an improved wage offer and tentative agreement with the United States Maritime Alliance, the parties continue to negotiate on a long-term agreement. The 2015 strike lasted longer than we forecasted, and any similar labor dispute in the future or any slowdown or stoppage relating to the ongoing labor agreement negotiations, including the reinstatement of a strike by the ILA, could potentially have a negative effect on both our financial condition and results of operations. Further, the improved wage offer outlined in the tentative agreement with the ILA could increase import and export

 costs. Additionally, the Baltimore Francis Scott Key bridge accident in March 2024 leading to the suspension of activity in the Port of Baltimore caused rerouting of shipping vessels, which may create congestion and delays in other ports, including certain East Coast ports through which we import products, increase fuel costs for shipping, and have long-standing impacts on supply chains in the retail and manufacturing industries. While the Port of Baltimore opened to maritime traffic on June 10, 2024, the bridge that is not expected to be rebuilt until late 2028 and further work to clear out wreckage and maintenance of the port may continue to cause delays in the Port of Baltimore and other East Coast ports where activities are rerouted. The incident has also raised concerns regarding deteriorating infrastructure throughout the U.S., which may further cause shipping delays and harm results of operation as such infrastructure is replaced or updated with new safety measures. Furthermore, the ongoing effects of the COVID-19 pandemic increased uncertainty for global supply chains, as port congestion and shipping container shortages have become exacerbated, which could adversely affect our operating results. 
 Work stoppages, labor disputes, and other disruptions involving our customers or otherwise could also adversely affect our operating results. For example, the United Auto Workers Union UAW 2023 strike impacted Ford Motor Company, General Motors, and Stellantis after the UAW was unable to reach a deal with the three automakers. Automotive OEMs are some of the largest customers of our powered vehicle suspension products. Recently, the UAW again threatened strikes against one of Ford Motor Company s units and Stellantis, though Ford and the UAW reached a tentative agreement prior to any strike activity by workers. The 2023 UAW strike may have lingering effects that could continue to impact the automotive industry. Any such lingering effects may adversely impact our own business, financial condition, or results of operation. Any future strikes, including the threatened 2024 UAW strikes and including any strikes against our customers, are highly unpredictable and may negatively affect our business. The ultimate impact on our business, financial position, and results of operations will depend on factors beyond our control, including the duration and scope of labor strikes. 
 U.S. policies related to global trade and tariffs could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. 
 The current domestic and international political environment, including existing and potential changes to U.S. policies related to global trade and tariffs, have resulted in uncertainty surrounding the future state of the global economy. In 2018, the U.S. imposed tariffs of 25 on steel and 10 on aluminum, with only a handful of countries exempt from the increase. Throughout the Trump Administration, the U.S. and China imposed a variety of tariffs on most goods traded between the two countries. The U.S. and the European Union also imposed tariffs on each other s products stemming from a dispute at the World Trade Organization related to aircraft. The Biden Administration and U.S. Congress have created significant uncertainty about their review of tariffs and future relationships between the U.S. and other countries with respect to regulations. Recently, a coalition of U.S. producers of aluminum extrusions filed a petition with U.S. trade authorities requesting the imposition of anti-dumping duties against imports of aluminum extrusions from 15 countries. The U.S. Department of Commerce began investigations based on the petitions and, following preliminary determinations, the U.S. Customs and Border Patrol started collecting anti-dumping duty cash deposits in May 2024. The final phase of hearings occurred in October 2024. The International Trade Commission is expected to announce final determinations on November 12, 2024, with the issuance of orders to follow. Because aluminum is one the primary raw materials used in the production of our products, our operating results could be adversely impacted by the imposition of duties on extruded aluminum. 
 While we have limited exposure to implemented tariffs at this time, any expansion in the types of tariffs implemented has the potential to negatively impact our supply chain costs and the operating performance of our customers, which in turn may negatively affect our sales, gross margin, and operating performance. Additionally, there is a risk that continued U.S. tariffs on imports could be met with additional retaliatory tariffs on U.S.-produced exports and that the broader trade uncertainty could intensify. This has the potential to significantly impact global trade and economic conditions in many of the regions where we do business and have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. 
 Except as noted in this Item 1A, there have been no material changes to the risk factors described in our Form 10-K for the 2023 fiscal year ended December 29, 2023.
