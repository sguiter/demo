Glossary
of Abbreviations and Acronyms for Selected References 

The
following list defines various abbreviations and acronyms used throughout this report, including Management s Discussion and Analysis
of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements, the Condensed Notes to Consolidated
Financial Statements and the Condensed Financial Statement Schedules. 

This
glossary covers essential terms related to Bitcoin mining, high-performance computing, Artificial Intelligence AI and
related fields, providing valuable context for readers of the Form10-Q. A number of cross-references to additional information included
throughout this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q are also utilized throughout this report, to assist readers seeking additional information
related to a particular subject. 

1.
Artificial Intelligence AI ): The simulation of human intelligence processes by machines, especially computer systems.
These processes include learning (the acquisition of information and rules for using the information), reasoning (using rules to reach
approximate or definite conclusions), and self-correction. AI applications include expert systems, natural language processing, speech
recognition, and machine vision. 

2.
Bitcoin : A decentralized digital currency created in 2009 by an unknown person or group of people using the name Satoshi Nakamoto.
It operates on a peer-to-peer network, allowing direct transactions without intermediaries. Transactions are verified by network nodes
through cryptography and recorded on a publicly distributed ledger called a blockchain. 

3.
Bitcoin Halving : An event occurring approximately every four years where the reward for mining new Bitcoin blocks is halved. This
reduces the number of new Bitcoins generated by miners, impacting their profitability and potentially affecting Bitcoin s value.
It s part of Bitcoin s deflationary monetary policy, designed to control supply. 

4.
Bitcoin Mining : The process of adding new transactions to the Bitcoin blockchain. It involves solving complex cryptographic puzzles
to discover a new block, rewarding miners with transaction fees and newly created Bitcoins. This process secures and verifies transactions
on the network. 

5.
Curtailment Curtailed or Curtailments ): In energy management, the reduction in electrical power supply
by power plants to balance the grid or avoid excess generation. In Bitcoin mining or other computing activities, curtailment 
pausing computing activities and related energy usage can occur during peak demand periods or insufficient energy supply. 

6.
Data Center Colocation : A service where businesses can be provided with services and infrastructure such as electrical power and
network connectivity for servers and other computing hardware at a third-party provider s data center. This arrangement allows
for cost savings, better infrastructure, and enhanced security compared to private data centers. 

7.
Electric Reliability Council of Texas ERCOT ): An independent system operator that manages the flow of electric power
to more than 26 million Texas customers, representing about 90 percent of the state s electric load. ERCOT schedules power on an
electric grid that connects more than 46,500 miles of transmission lines and over 680 generation units. 

8.
Exahash EH/s ): A unit of computational power equal to one quintillion (10 18) hashes per second. It is used to measure
the hashrate of the most powerful cryptocurrency mining equipment and the overall computational power of the Bitcoin network. 

9.
Generative AI : Artificial intelligence that can generate new content, such as text, images, or music, based on its training data.
It learns from vast amounts of data to create outputs that mimic original human-generated content, often used in creative and analytical
applications. 

10.
Gigawatt GW ): A unit of power equal to one billion watts. Often used to measure the capacity of large power plants
or the power usage of large operations like data centers and industrial complexes. 

11.
Grid Demand Response Services : Services provided to support the basic services of generating and delivering electricity to the grid.
They help maintain power quality, reliability, and efficiency. In the context of Bitcoin mining, the use of mining facilities to provide
grid stabilization services is an emerging concept. 

12.
Hashprice : The revenue a miner earns for each unit of computational power (hash) over a specific period. It is influenced by factors
such as the price of Bitcoin, network difficulty, and transaction fees. A higher hashprice means more profitability for miners. 

13.
Hashrate: The measure of computational power per second used in cryptocurrency mining. It indicates the number of hash function computations
per second by a miner s hardware, with higher hashrates implying greater efficiency and network security. 

2 

14.
High Performance Computing HPC ): The use of supercomputers and parallel processing techniques for solving complex
computational problems. HPC is used in fields such as scientific research, simulation, and large-scale data analysis. 

15.
Joules : A unit of energy in the International System of Units (SI). One joule is the energy transferred when one watt of power is
exerted for one second. In Bitcoin mining, energy efficiency is often measured in joules per hash. 

16.
Large Language Models (LLMs): Advanced AI models designed to understand, generate, and respond to human language in a way that mimics
human-like understanding. They are trained on vast datasets and can perform a variety of language-based tasks, such as translation, summarization,
and question-answering. 

17.
Machine Learning : A subset of artificial intelligence involving the creation of algorithms that can learn and make decisions or predictions
based on data. It enables computers to improve their performance on a specific task with experience and data, without being explicitly
programmed. 

18.
Megawatts MW ): A unit of power measurement equivalent to one million watts. Used to measure the electrical power consumption
of large operations like data centers and Bitcoin mining rigs. 

19.
Mining Pool : A group of cryptocurrency miners who combine their computational resources over a network to increase their chances
of finding a block and receiving rewards. The rewards are then divided among the pool participants, proportional to the amount of hashing
power each contributed. 

20.
Petahash PH/s ): A unit of computational power equal to one quadrillion (10 15) hashes per second. It is used to measure
the hashrate of extremely powerful cryptocurrency mining equipment. 

21.
Power Usage Effectiveness PUE ): A ratio that describes how efficiently a computer data center uses energy; specifically,
how much energy is used by the computing equipment (in contrast to cooling and other overhead that supports the equipment). 

22.
Terahash TH/s ): A unit of computational power equal to one trillion (10 12) hashes per second. It s a common
measure of the performance of cryptocurrency mining hardware, with higher terahash rates indicating more powerful equipment.

Notes
to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited) 

ownership interest in Soluna DVSL ComputeCo, LLC DVSL ), owner of Project Dorothy 1A, and a ownership interest
in Soluna DV ComputeCo, LLC DVCC ), owner of Project Dorothy 1B. On July 22, 2024 the Company closed financing for the
48 MW modular data center (the Project Dorothy 2 ). Project Dorothy 2 is financed by Soluna2 SLC Fund II Project Holdco
LLC, an investment vehicle of Spring Lane Capital SLC and SDI. As of the September 30, 2024, SDI has a ownership
interest in Project Dorothy 2. 

On
June 18, 2024, Soluna AL CloudCo, LLC CloudCo ), a subsidiary of Soluna Cloud, entered into an agreement with Hewlett Packard
Enterprise Company HPE ). Under this agreement, HPE will provide datacenter and cloud services for AI and supercomputing
applications utilizing NVIDIA H100 Graphic Processing Units. This agreement involves an initial pre-payment of million, with a
total commitment of million over a 36-month period and offers the potential for expansion based on mutual agreement. 

Soluna
is committed to leveraging its modular data centers and renewable energy partnerships to support the growing demands of Bitcoin mining,
AI, and other high-performance computing industries, while maintaining a focus on sustainable, cost-effective energy use. 

Going
Concern and Liquidity 

The
Company s condensed financial statements as of September 30, 2024 have been prepared using generally accepted accounting principles
in the United States of America U.S. GAAP applicable to a going concern, which contemplates the realization of assets
and liquidation of liabilities in the normal course of business. As shown in the accompanying condensed financial statements, the Company
was in a net loss, has negative working capital, and has significant outstanding debt as discussed in Note 7 as of September 30, 2024.
In addition, Soluna MC Borrowing has a litigation matter with NYDIG ABL LLC NYDIG in relation to their Master Equipment
Finance Agreement. See further discussion around the NYDIG litigation in Note 9. These factors, among others indicate that there is substantial
doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern within one year after issuance of these condensed financial statements
as of September 30, 2024, or November 14, 2024. 

The
ability to continue as a going concern is dependent upon the Company generating profitable operations in the future and/or obtaining
the necessary financing to meet its obligations and repay its liabilities arising from normal business operations when they come due.
In the near term, management is evaluating and implementing different strategies to obtain financing to fund the Company s expenses
and growth to achieve a level of revenue adequate to support the Company s current cost structure. Financing strategies may include,
but are not limited to, stock issuances, project level equity, debt borrowings, partnerships and/or collaborations. If the Company is
unable to meet its financial obligations, it could be forced to restructure or refinance, seek additional equity capital or sell its
assets. The Company might then be unable to obtain such financing or capital or sell its assets on satisfactory terms. There can be no
assurance that additional financing will be available to the Company when needed or, if available, that it can be obtained on commercially
reasonable terms. If the Company is not able to obtain the additional financing on a timely basis, if and when it is needed, it will
be forced to delay or scale down some or all of its development activities or perhaps even cease the operation of its business. 

In
addition to the Company s cash on hand for available use of approximately million as of September 30, 2024, the Company will
need additional capital raising activities, to meet its capital expenditure needs for its current pipeline and other operational needs.
On August 12, 2024, the Company entered into a Standby Equity Purchase Agreement (the SEPA with YA II PN, LTD., a Cayman
Islands exempt limited company YA ). In accordance with the terms of the SEPA, YA has agreed to purchase up to million
in aggregate gross purchase price of newly issued fully paid shares of the Company s common stock from time to time subject to
the limits and the conditions of the SEPA. 

The
Company in fiscal year 2024 will continue to look to evaluate different strategies to obtain financing to fund operations. However, management
cannot provide any assurances that the Company will be successful in accomplishing additional financing or any of its other plans. These
financial statements do not include any adjustments related to the recoverability and classification of assets or the amounts and classification
of liabilities that might be necessary should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern. 

(the Reverse Split ). The Company s
common stock began trading on a post-split basis under the Company s existing trading symbol, SLNH, when the market
opened on October 16, 2023. The reverse stock split was approved by the Board of Directors and by shareholders at the annual meeting
of the stockholders on June 29, 2023. At the effective time, The Reverse Split did
not change the number of shares of common stock authorized for issuance. No fractional shares were outstanding following the Reverse
Split. Any holder who would have received a fractional share of common stock was automatically entitled to receive an additional fraction
of a share of common stock to round up to the next whole share. 

The
primary goal of the Reverse Stock Split was to increase the per share price of the Common Stock in order to meet the minimum per share
price requirement of for continued listing on the Nasdaq. On October 30, 2023, the Company received a notice of compliance from

In
addition, effective as of the same time as the Reverse Split, proportionate adjustments were made to all then-outstanding equity awards,
warrants and convertible securities with respect to the number of shares of common stock subject to such award or security and the exercise
or conversion price thereof. Furthermore, the number of shares of common stock available for issuance under the Company s equity
incentive plans has been proportionately adjusted for the Reverse Split ratio, such that fewer shares will be subject to such plans.
Furthermore, proportionate adjustments were made to the conversion factor at which the Company s Series B Preferred Stock, par
value per share (the Series B Preferred Stock ), may be converted to Common Stock. The total number of shares of
Series B Preferred Stock of the Company authorized for issuance remained at .

million, in which approximately 
million was classified as current and approximately 
million was classified as non-current. As of December, 31, 2023, the Company had restricted cash of approximately 
million, in which 
million was classified as current and 
million was classified as non-current. The balance in restricted cash relates to funds held in escrow accounts due to sales of
equipment that were executed, in which the Company can release to the convertible noteholders only if they request their share of
funds. If no funds are distributed to the convertible noteholders from the escrow account by January 24, 2025, the funds may be used
for general purposes for the Company. In addition, there was a restricted deposit held with a customer that was for less than 12
months. The Company has a long-term restricted cash balance in relation to a collateralized deposit. 

million and million, respectively, in deposits and
credits on equipment, that had not yet been received by the Company. Once the Company receives such equipment in the subsequent period,
the Company will reclassify such balance into Property, Plant, and Equipment. Included in these balances was a credit on equipment of
 thousand, of which approximately thousand has been used as of September 30, 2024, and the remaining thousand will be restricted
to be used on future purchases for Project Dorothy 2 and Project Kati by March 1, 2025 expiration date ). The Company notes
that if an order is not executed by the expiration date, the credit would be forfeited. The Company intends to utilize the full credit
balance for future orders prior to the expiration date. 

million with an accredited investor. In addition, on July 12, 2024, CloudCo, Cloud, and the Existing Investor entered into a First
Amendment to the Note Purchase Agreement (the June SPA Amendment ). This amendment allows CloudCo to issue additional
secured promissory notes totaling 
million to new accredited investors (the Additional Investors ). In consideration of entering into the promissory note,
Cloud provided warrants to the accredited investor. Since the warrants were determined to not be indexed to the Company s own
stock under ASC 815-40-15, and since the warrants to be delivered upon exercise are not readily convertible to cash, they do not
meet the net settlement criteria within ASC 815-10-15-83. While Soluna Holdings, Inc is publicly traded, the shares provided are
specific to Soluna Cloud, Inc, which is a subsidiary of Soluna Holdings, Inc. The shares of Soluna Cloud, Inc are not publicly
traded and therefore the common stock underlying the warrant is not readily convertible to cash. Further evaluation of the Warrants
under ASC 815-10 was required to determine if the Warrants meet the definition of a derivative. The warrants are classified as a liability that are required to be adjusted to fair market
value. The Company applied a discounted cash flow method in relation to the valuation of Cloud in which assumptions from forecasted
projected cash flow data and other key operating assumptions such as working cash flow were used to determine an enterprise value
less any current debt in order to determine an equity value for Cloud. As of September 30, 2024, the warrants were fair valued, and
deemed to not have any further value, as such the Company wrote down the liability balance to .

the Company wrote down the net book value of the miners to the subsequent sales price. The Company had impairment charges of approximately
 thousand for the three months ended September 30, 2023 due to revaluing the M31 and M32 miners to the current market conditions.

In
April 2023, Project Sophie entered into a 25 MW hosting contract with a sustainability-focused Bitcoin miner, which has shifted the Company s
business model at the Company s modular data center at Project Sophie from proprietary mining to hosting Bitcoin miners for the

and , and for the three

tax rate is less than the Federal statutory rate of , primarily due to the change in the valuation allowance, as well as changes to
estimated taxable income for 2024 and permanent differences. There was thousand deferred income tax benefit and thousand deferred
income tax expense for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023.. There was million and thousand deferred income
tax benefit for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, offset with a thousand and current tax expense for nine months
ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. 

In
connection with the strategic contract pipeline acquired in the asset acquisition that occurred in October 2021, the Company is required
to recognize a deferred tax impact of acquiring an asset in a transaction that is not a business combination when the amount paid exceeds
the tax basis on the acquisition date. As such, the Company is required to adjust the value of the strategic contract pipeline by approximately
 million at inception date, in which was recorded as a deferred tax liability and this amount will be amortized over the life of
the asset. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the Company amortized thousand and million. 

The
Company provides for recognition of deferred tax assets if the realization of such assets is more likely than not to occur in accordance
with accounting standards that address income taxes. Significant management judgment is required in determining the period in which the
reversal of a valuation allowance should occur. The Company has considered all available evidence, both positive and negative, such as
historical levels of income and future forecasts of taxable income amongst other items, in determining its valuation allowance. In addition,
the Company s assessment requires us to schedule future taxable income in accordance with accounting standards that address income
taxes to assess the appropriateness of a valuation allowance which further requires the exercise of significant management judgment. 

The
Company believes that the accounting estimate for the valuation of deferred tax assets is a critical accounting estimate because judgment
is required in assessing the likely future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our financial statements or tax returns.
The Company based the estimate of deferred tax assets and liabilities on current tax laws and rates and, in certain cases, business plans
and other expectations about future outcomes. In the event that actual results differ from these estimates, or the Company adjusts these
estimates in future periods, the Company may need to adjust the recorded valuation allowance, which could materially impact our financial
position and results of operations. The Company has a full valuation allowance for the deferred tax asset of million and 
million on September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. We will continue to evaluate the ability to realize our deferred tax
assets and related valuation allowance on a quarterly basis.

Convertible
Notes 

On
October 25, 2021, pursuant to a Securities Purchase Agreement (the October SPA ,
the Company issued to certain accredited investors (the Noteholders (i) secured convertible notes in an aggregate principal
amount of million for an aggregate purchase price of million (collectively, the October Secured Notes ), which
were, subject to certain conditions, convertible at any time by the investors, into an aggregate of shares of the Company s
common stock, at a price per share of and (ii) Class A, Class B and Class C common stock purchase warrants (collectively, the October
Warrants to purchase up to an aggregate of shares of common stock, at an initial exercise price of , and
 per share, respectively. The October Warrants are legally detachable and can be separately exercised immediately for five years upon
issuance, subject to applicable Nasdaq rules. 

On
July 19, 2022 and on September 13, 2022, the Company entered an into an Addendum and Addendum Amendment which adjusted the terms such
as maturity date, conversion prices, and the issuance of new warrants to the Noteholders. Pursuant to the Addendum and Addendum Amendment,
the Company evaluated whether the new addendums qualified as debt modification or debt extinguishment. Based on ASC 470, Debt, the Company
determined the Addendum and Addendum Amendment to fall under Debt Extinguishment treatment and the Company would be required to fair
value the new debt, and in turn write off the existing debt on the books. 

Following
the debt extinguishment on July 19, 2022 as noted above, the Convertible Notes will be accounted for under the fair value method on a
recurring basis upon issuance (e.g., upon execution of the Addendum) per guidance within ASC 480, and at each subsequent reporting period,
with changes in fair value reported in earnings. Although the Notes are not being accounted for under 825-10, the substance of the debt
is considered to be the same and is therefore considered outside the scope of ASC 470-60. As such, the Company performed a fair value
analysis of the Convertible Notes. For the year-ended December 31, 2023 and quarter-ended September 30, 2024, the Company ran Monte Carlo
simulations for the expected conversion dates of the Convertible Notes using risk free rates, annual volatility, daily trading volumes,
likely conversion profiles, and other assumptions based on principal and accrued interest as of the period ends. The Company determined
the fair value of the Convertible Notes uses certain Level 3 inputs.

The
events of default stated in the Notice of Acceleration and Repossession defined below with NYDIG Financing constituted a cross-default
under the terms of secured convertible notes issued to the Noteholders. In addition to such cross-default, the failure of the Company
pursuant to the Addendum dated as of July 19, 2022, to escrow an aggregate amount of thousand for the benefit of the Noteholders
by December 21, 2022, constituted an event of default under the Notes .
 Due to the default, the Company accrued interest at a rate of which amounted to thousand
as of March 10, 2023. On March 10, 2023, the Company entered into a Second Addendum Amendment with the Noteholders, in which the Company
paid the accumulated default accrued interest of thousand using the restricted escrow accounts and contemporaneously with the payment,
the Noteholders waived all existing events of default arising under the convertible notes. 

On
May 11, 2023, the Company entered into a Second Amendment Agreement (the Second Amendment with the holders of its October
Secured Notes to extend the maturity date of the October Secured Notes to July 25, 2024. In connection with the Second Amendment, the
Company paid an extension fee of thousand and increased the principal amount of the outstanding October Secured Notes by . The
Company also issued new Class A warrants exercisable at and new Class B warrants exercisable at . 

On
November 20, 2023, the Company and the Noteholders entered into a Third Amendment Agreement to amend the Notes, the October SPA and related
agreements (collectively, the Transaction Documents ). The aim was to facilitate future financings by the Company that may
include funds for prepayment of the Notes by permitting the Company to force conversion of up to million of the Notes under certain
circumstances, reduce the prepayment penalty in return for reducing the conversion price of the million of the Notes and reducing
the exercise price of of the Warrants to . 

On
February 28, 2024 the Company and the Purchasers entered into a Fourth Amendment Agreement to amend the Notes, SPA and related agreements
to facilitate future financings by the Company by amending the Transaction Documents as follows: 

The
Company shall be permitted to undertake at-the-market transactions in the future provided: 

No
 Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing under the Notes; and 

The
 market price of the shares of common stock shall be at least the At-the-Market ATM Floor Price. 

In
addition, the Company will be permitted to unilaterally extend the maturity date of the Notes for two 3-Month extensions if prior to
the then in effect maturity date the Company gives notice to the Purchasers and increases the principal amount of the Notes on the date
of each such extension by two percent the principal amount of the Notes outstanding on the date of this Agreement per each extension. 

In
consideration of the foregoing, the Company: 

Reduced
 the conversion price of the Notes to per share; 

The
 Purchasers received an aggregate of three year warrants exercisable at per share; 

An
 aggregate of warrants held by the Purchasers had the exercise price reduced to per share (the 3.78 Warrants 
 and 

An
 aggregate of warrants held by the Purchasers had the exercise price reduced to per share (the 6.00 Repriced
 Warrants ). 

In
June 2024, pursuant to the Fourth Amendment Agreement, the Company exercised its right to extend the maturity date of the Senior Notes
for an additional six months, or until January 24, 2025, to enable the Company to continue to pursue its significant project development
opportunities for Soluna Cloud, Dorothy 2 and other projects. The extension of the notes caused an increase in the convertible note balance
of approximately thousand and the extension fee was recorded within Other Expense, net for the nine months ended September
30, 2024. 

The
effect of the additional penny warrants, warrants, and the repriced warrants including additional warrants if exercised with
the Noteholders, created a loss on debt extinguishment of approximately million due to the fair value associated as of February
28, 2024. Such amounts were recorded as a loss on debt extinguishment and affected the Company s warrant liability and additional
paid in capital balance account. Due to the requirement of the shareholder approval associated with the Fourth Amendment, the warrants
associated were initially treated as a liability. In addition, a warrant revaluation was done on March 31, 2024, which created a gain
on revaluation associated with the warrant liability of approximately million. On May 30, 2024, shareholder approval was obtained
removing the cap containment provision for the warrants, and as such, the liability accounting treatment was no longer required. Since
all other criteria were met to be treated as equity, the Company adjusted the warrant liability as of the date of shareholder approval
and reclassified balance to equity. As such, the Company accounted for the change in the fair value of the warrant liability as of the
date of the shareholder approval (May 30, 2024), in connection with its loss on revaluation of the warrant of approximately million. 

Pursuant
to additional agreements with holders of another outstanding warrants, similar adjustments with those warrants, resulted in a
total adjustment to warrants. As the warrants were not with the Noteholders, the treatment of repriced warrants
was recorded as a deemed dividend and adjusted the Company s earnings per share calculation noted in Footnote 9 for the nine months
ended September 30, 2024. The fair value associated with the warrants with non-Noteholders totaled approximately thousand.
O n May 17, 2024, the Company permitted the holders of the Company s Amended Class C Warrants,
previously exercisable at per share, to exercise such warrants at a reduced exercise price of per share, provided that each such
holder exercised at least of their Amended Class C Warrants by the close of business on May 17, 2024. The Company also agreed
to reduce the exercise price on all remaining Amended Class C Warrants. The adjustment in the exercise price, resulted in an additional
deemed dividend which amounted to approximately thousand for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 

For
the nine months ended September 30, 2024, of the Amended Class C warrants have been exercised by both the Noteholders and non-Noteholders,
resulting in the issuance of shares of warrants, shares of warrants, and shares of warrants.

approximate amount of million for principal and interest and penalties. On January 12, 2024, Soluna filed its objection to NYDIG s
motion for summary judgment on the grounds that NYDIG failed to explain what collateral of which loan was sold and how the sale proceeds
were allocated to each loan. A summary judgment motion was performed on February 13, 2024 and was agreed upon by both NYDIG and the Borrower,
that the total outstanding loan principal balance would be approximately million, in which a penalty fee was applied of approximately
 million to the repossessed collateralized assets, and outstanding interest and penalty balance would be approximately thousand

Loss
per Share 

The
Company computes basic loss per common share by dividing net loss by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during
the reporting period. Diluted loss per share reflects the potential dilution, if any, computed by dividing loss by the combination of
dilutive common share equivalents, comprised of shares issuable under outstanding investment rights, warrants and the Company s
share-based compensation plans, and the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the reporting period. Dilutive common
share equivalents include the dilutive effect of in-the-money stock options, which are calculated based on the average share price for
each period using the treasury stock method. Under the treasury stock method, the exercise price of a stock option and the amount of
compensation cost, if any, for future service that the Company has not yet recognized are assumed to be used to repurchase shares in
the current period.

Circuit Court of the Commonwealth of Kentucky on December 29, 2022 regarding a series of loans (the NYDIG Loans made by
NYDIG to Borrower pursuant to a Master Equipment Finance Agreement MEFA that were secured by certain assets of Borrower
and guaranteed by Guarantor pursuant to a written guaranty agreement executed by Guarantor. On February 15, 2023, the Court approved
an agreed order granting NYDIG s motion for writ of possession which, among other things, ordered the NYDIG Defendants to provide
NYDIG access to the collateral securing the NYDIG Loans and preserved the rights of NYDIG to pursue a deficiency judgment against the
NYDIG Defendants. Also on February 15, 2023, the NYDIG Defendants filed their answer and affirmative defenses in this proceeding. On
February 23, 2023, NYDIG proceeded to foreclose on all of the collateral securing the MEFA, and repossessed the collateralized assets
that totaled approximately million, of which approximately thousand was first used to pay off accrued interest and penalties
to date. On September 5, 2023, NYDIG provided a letter finalizing the accounting for the repossessed collateralized assets totaling proceeds
of approximately million. This included legal and other expenses associated with the sale of the assets, net a modest gain on the
estimated net book value of the assets totaling thousand that was expensed as a loss on disposition of assets for the year ended
December 31, 2023. On December 7, 2023, NYDIG filed its Motion for Summary Judgment seeking entry of a judgment against the NYDIG Defendants
in the approximate amount of million for principal and interest and penalties. On January 12, 2024, the NYDIG Defendants filed
their objection to NYDIG s motion for summary judgment on the grounds that NYDIG failed to explain what collateral of which loan
was sold and how the sale proceeds were allocated and applied to each loan. NYDIG and the NYDIG Defendants consensually resolved the
motion in the form of a Stipulation and Agreed Judgment, which the Court approved on February 23, 2024 

On
March 13, 2024, NYDIG served the NYDIG Defendants with a post-judgment discovery seeking information regarding the NYDIG Defendants 
assets and liabilities. Per agreement between NYDIG and the NYDIG Defendants, the deadline to respond to the discovery demands was extended
to May 13, 2024 but with rolling weekly production that commenced on April 12, 2024. The NYDIG Defendants completed responding to NYDIG s
initial document requests on May 13, 2024. On September 24, 2024, NYDIG sent a letter seeking supplemental discovery from the NYDIG Defendants. The NYDIG Defendants
responded seeking clarification from NYDIG regarding their supplemental requests. On November 6, 2024, NYDIG sent a second meet
and confer letter seeking (i) the production of additional/supplemental documents from Soluna by November 20, 2024 and (ii) the
deposition of a representative of the Defendants on or before December 15, 2024. The parties remain in discussions regarding the
requested supplemental discovery. 

Additionally,
NYDIG has stated its intention to pursue SCI, the parent company of Guarantor, under a piercing of the corporate veil theory relating
to NYDIG Defendants debts and liabilities under the loan documents. The Company intends to vigorously defend itself from NYDIG s
parent company claims. SCI denies any such liability and has filed a complaint for a declaratory judgment against NYDIG in the Eighth
Judicial District Court in Clark County, Nevada on March 16, 2023, seeking a declaratory judgment as to such matter. NYDIG filed a motion
to dismiss in response to SCI s declaratory judgment complaint on April 13, 2023. SCI filed a response in opposition to NYDIG s
motion to dismiss on April 27, 2023. The court heard oral arguments on May 16, 2023. On June 22, 2023, the court issued an order granting
NYDIG s motion to dismiss, on the basis that the case was not ripe for decision, without prejudice. SCI intends to continue to
vigorously defend any allegations regarding liability on account of NYDIG Defendants debts and liabilities to NYDIG under their
loan documents and intends to refile a declaratory judgment complaint against NYDIG. 

As
of September 30, 2024, the Company still has an outstanding principal of approximately million and outstanding interest and penalty
balance of approximately million. This settlement did not result in the admission of any liability on the part of SHI, whose declaratory
judgment remains the subject of litigation.

HEL
Transactions 

As
discussed in the Company s Annual Report, on October 29, 2021, the Company completed the Soluna Callisto acquisition pursuant to
the Merger Agreement. The purpose of the transaction was for SCI to acquire substantially all of the assets (other than those assets
physically located in Morocco) formerly held by Harmattan Energy, Ltd. HEL ), which assets consisted of SCI s existing
pipeline of certain cryptocurrency mining projects that HEL previously transferred to SCI, which was formed expressly for this purpose,
and to provide SCI with the opportunity to directly employ or retain the services of four individuals whose services it had retained
through HEL prior to the merger. As a result of the merger, each share of common stock of Soluna Callisto issued and outstanding immediately
prior to the effective time of the merger, other than shares owned by the Company or any of our subsidiaries, was cancelled and converted
into the right to receive a proportionate share of the Merger Consideration. 

In
connection with the Soluna Callisto acquisition, effective as of October 29, 2021, upon and subject to the terms and conditions of the
Termination Agreement, on November 5, 2021: (1) the existing Operating and Management Agreements between HEL and SCI were terminated
in all respects; and (2)(A) SCI paid HEL thousand, (B) SHI issued to HEL the Termination Shares, and (C) HEL and SHI entered into
an Amended and Restated Contingent Rights Agreement that, among other things, amended the existing Contingent Rights Agreement by and
between HEL and SHI, dated January 13, 2020, to provide SHI the right to invest directly in certain cryptocurrency mining opportunities
being pursued by HEL. SHI filed a registration statement with the SEC to register the resale of the Termination Shares on February 14,
2022.

Merger Shares remains available for possible issuance through October 29, 2026 pursuant to the terms of the Merger
Agreement.

2021
Plan

Company s 2021 Plan was adopted by the Board on February 12, 2021 and approved by the stockholders on March 25, 2021. The 2021
Plan was amended and restated effective as of October 29, 2021, and May 27, 2022, respectively. The 2021 Plan authorizes the Company
to issue shares of common stock upon the exercise of stock options, the grant of restricted stock awards, and the conversion of restricted
stock units (collectively, the Awards ). The Compensation Committee has full authority, subject to the terms of the 2021
Plan, to interpret the 2021 Plan and establish rules and regulations for the proper administration of the 2021 Plan. Subject to certain
adjustments as provided in the 2021 Plan, the maximum aggregate number of shares of the Company s common stock that may be issued
under the 2021 Plan (i) pursuant to the exercise of options, (ii) as shares or restricted stock and (iii) in settlement of RSUs shall

any Award granted under the 2021 Plan expires unexercised or unvested or is terminated, surrendered, or cancelled without the delivery
of shares of common stock, or any Awards are forfeited back to the Company, then the shares of common stock subject to such Award may
be made available for subsequent Awards under the terms of the 2021 Plan. 

On
March 10, 2023, at the Special Shareholder Meeting, the Third Amended and Restated 2021 Stock Incentive Plan was approved. The 

The
Board approved amendments to both the 2021 and 2023 Plans on April 15, 2024. The amendments were subsequently approved by the stockholders
at the 2024 Annual Meeting on May 30, 2024. Under the Plans, the number of shares of common stock available for awards is limited to,
 for the 2021 Plan and for the 2023 Plan of the number of Common Shares outstanding as of the first trading day of each
quarter. The amendments to each Plan would change the calculation of this limitation to reflect the applicable percentage to and
 respectively, after giving effect to the increase in the number of shares subject to Awards after giving effect to the amount
to the increase as of the date of the calculation. 

Under
the 2023 Plan and 2021 Plan, the Company may grant stock options, restricted stock awards (RSAs) and restricted stock units (RSUs) to
executive, management, employees, directors, and certain nonemployee personnel. The awards issued under the Plans can vest immediately,
over time or based upon the achievement of market, performance, or service conditions. RSAs and RSUs can vest immediately but generally
vest ratably over three years and Performance RSUs generally fully vest after three years, subject to achieving market, service or performance
conditions. In addition, the Company recognizes certain Awards held by certain employees and nonemployees that vest upon separation.
Each share granted subject to an Award reduces the number of shares available under the 2023 Plan and 2021 Plan by one share. 

The
fair value of stock options is estimated based on the Black-Scholes model, taking into account the historical volatility of our stock,
consistent with the accounting guidance. The risk-free interest rate is based on the risk-free zero-coupon rate for a period consistent
with the expected option term at the time of grant. The expected option term is calculated based on our historical forfeitures and cancellation
rates. 

During
April 2024, the Company cancelled certain vested Awards and modified the terms of certain unvested Awards, to permit different settlement
outcomes. The service period and vesting terms were changed at the time of modification. All such vested Awards were fully vested as
of the cancellation date and all compensation cost had been recognized. All such unvested equity awards were probable of vesting as of
the modification date and the change was accounted for as a Type I modification. In a Type I modification, the Company is required to
calculate the incremental difference of the awards, which equals the difference of new award value inclusive of estimated forfeitures
and the fair value of the original award as of the modification date. As of the modification date, there is no reversal or adjustment
of previously recognized stock compensation expense. 

Within
the 2021 and 2023 Plans, certain master grant agreements were executed on April 15, 2024 that have the potential for future additional
grants based on additional stock activity through certain anti-dilution provisions. A mutual understanding of the terms and conditions
for the specific awards cannot be obtained until a later date after all stock activity has occurred in the future period and necessary
approvals are obtained. When Board approval is obtained and the two grant conditions are met, the grant date will be identified and evidenced
through an additional restricted stock agreement. The compensation cost will be recognized per the vesting schedule within the agreement
with no catch-up for the reduced period. 

The
accounting impact resulting from the recognition of this equity-based compensation limits the comparability of the Company s financial
statements between periods. 

During
the three months ended September 30, 2024, the Company awarded restricted stock awards under the 2021 Plan, valued at per
share based on the closing market price of the Company s common stock on the date of the grant. The Company awarded restricted
stock awards under the 2023 Plan, valued at per share based on the closing market price of the Company s common stock on
the date of the grant. of the restricted stock awards vest immediately, . 

During
the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company awarded restricted stock awards under the 2021 Plan, valued at per
share based on the closing market price of the Company s common stock on the date of the grant. The Company awarded restricted
stock awards under the 2021 Plan, valued at per share based on the closing market price of the Company s common stock on
the date of the grant. The Company awarded restricted stock awards under the 2021 Plan, valued at per share based on the
closing market price of the Company s common stock on the date of the grant. The Company awarded preferred A restricted
stock awards under the 2021 Plan, valued at per share based on the closing market price of the Company s preferred A stock
on the date of the grant. The Company awarded restricted stock awards under the 2023 Plan, valued at per share based on
the closing market price of the Company s common stock on the date of the grant. The Company awarded restricted stock awards
under the 2023 Plan, valued at per share based on the closing market price of the Company s common stock on the date of the
grant. The Company awarded restricted stock awards under the 2023 Plan, valued at per share based on the closing market
price of the Company s common stock on the date of the grant. 

During
the three months ended September 30, 2023, the Company did not issue any equity awards under its 2021 or 2023 Plans. 

During
the nine months ended September 30, 2023, the Company awarded restricted stock units under the 2021 Plan, valued at per
share based on the closing market price of the Company s common stock on the date of the grant. The restricted stock units vested
during May 2023. 

The
Company will recognize the compensation expense on a straight-line basis over the service period for the entire Awards. Accordingly,
as of September 30, 2024, the Awards from the Plans are presented at fair value within the stockholders equity section of the
Company s balance sheet. 

As
of September 30, 2024, unrecognized compensation cost related to unvested Awards was approximately million. That cost is expected
to be recognized over a weighted-average period of approximately years. 

On
April 15, 2024, a modification related to the cancellation of under the water stock options granted to eight board members. The
options were replaced with new awards of restricted stock. The amount of incremental compensation cost resulting from the modification
was approximately million. There were no modifications during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023. 

Crypto
Assets (Subtopic 350-60): Accounting for and Disclosure of Crypto Assets 

In
December 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-08, Intangibles - Goodwill and Other - Crypto Assets (Subtopic 350-60): Accounting for and
Disclosure of Crypto Assets, which establishes accounting guidance for crypto assets meeting certain criteria. Bitcoin meets this
criteria. The amendments require crypto assets meeting the criteria to be recognized at fair value with changes recognized in net income
each reporting period. Upon adoption, a cumulative-effect adjustment is made to the opening balance of retained earnings as of the beginning
of the annual reporting period of adoption. ASU 2023-08 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024, including interim
periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted. The guidance is not expected to have an impact on the Company s
condensed consolidated financial statements and disclosures, unless the Company intends to hold crypto assets. 

Improvements
to Income Tax Disclosures 

In
December 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-09, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures (ASU 2023-09), which
requires disclosure of incremental income tax information within the rate reconciliation and expanded disclosures of income taxes paid,
among other disclosure requirements. ASU 2023-09 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024. Early adoption is permitted.
The Company is currently evaluating the impact that ASU 2023-09 will have on its condensed consolidated financial statements and disclosures. 

Stock
Compensation 

In
March 2024, the FASB issued ASU 2024-01, Compensation Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Scope Application of Profits Interest
and Similar Awards ASU 2024-01 ), to clarify the scope application of profits interest and similar awards by adding
illustrative guidance in ASC 718, Compensation Stock Compensation ASC 718 ). ASU 2024-01 clarifies how to
determine whether profits interest and similar awards should be accounted for as a share-based payment arrangement (ASC 718) or as a
cash bonus or profit-sharing arrangement (ASC 710, Compensation General, or other guidance and applies to all reporting
entities that account for profits interest awards as compensation to employees or non-employees. In addition to adding the illustrative
guidance, ASU 2024-01 modified the language in paragraph 718-10-15-3 to improve its clarity and operability without changing the guidance.
ASU 2024-01 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024, including interim periods within those annual periods. Early
adoption is permitted. The amendments should be applied either retrospectively to all prior periods presented in the financial statements,
or prospectively to profits interests and similar awards granted or modified on or after the adoption date. The Company is currently
assessing the impacts of adopting ASU 2024-01 on its condensed consolidated financial statements and disclosures. 

million to fund certain
projects to develop green data centers co-located with renewable energy assets (the Spring Lane Commitment ). 

On
August 5, 2022, the Company entered into a Contribution Agreement (the Dorothy Contribution Agreement with Spring Lane,
Soluna DV Devco, LLC Devco ), an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of SCI, and DVSL an entity formed in order to further
the Company s development for Project Dorothy, (each, a Party and, together, the Parties ). million to DVSL (the
 Company Commitment ), and on August 5, 2022, the Company was deemed to have contributed approximately 8.1 million, through
payment of capital expenditures and development costs made on behalf of DVSL by the Company prior to August 5, 2022. Further under the
Agreement, Spring Lane committed to a capital contribution of up to 12.5 million to DVSL (the Spring Lane Dorothy Commitment ),
and as of December 31, 2022, Spring Lane had actually contributed approximately million . Under the Dorothy Contribution Agreement,
the Company and Spring Lane have committed to make subsequent contributions, up to their respective Company Commitment and Spring Lane
Dorothy Commitment amounts, on a pro rata basis, upon receipt of a contribution request from DVSL, as set forth in the Dorothy Contribution
Agreement and subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions described therein. The proceeds of any subsequent commitments will be
applied to pay project costs in accordance with the project budget. 

In
exchange for their contributions, the Company and Spring Lane were issued and of the Class B Membership Interests in DVSL,
respectively, and were admitted as Class B members of DVSL. Further pursuant to the Agreement, DVSL issued of its Class A Membership
Interests to Devco. 

The
Company evaluated this legal entity under ASC 810, Consolidations and determined that DVSL is a variable interest entity VIE that should be consolidated into the Company, with a non-controlling interest recorded to account for Spring
Lane s equity ownership of the Company. The Company has a variable interest in DVSL. The entity was designed by the Company to
create an entity for outside investors to invest in specific projects. The creation of this entity resulted in the Company, through
its equity interest in DVSL, absorbing operational risk that the entity was created to create and distribute, resulting in the
Company having a variable interest in DVSL. 

On
March 10, 2023, the Company along with Devco , and Soluna DVSL ComputeCo, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (the Project
Company entered into a Purchase and Sale Agreement (the Purchase and Sale Agreement with Soluna SLC
Fund I Projects Holdco, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company Spring Lane that is wholly owned indirectly
by Spring Lane Management LLC. The Project Company was constructing a modular data center with a peak demand of 25 megawatts (the Dorothy
Phase 1A Facility ). 

Under
a series of transactions in February 2023 and March 2023, culminating in the March 10, 2023 Purchase and Sale Agreement, the Company
sold to Spring Lane certain Class B Membership Interests for a purchase price of million (the Sale ). After
giving effect to the Sale, the Company owned Class B Membership Interests (constituting of the Class B Membership Interests)
and Spring Lane owns Class B Membership Interests (constituting of the Class B Membership Interests). The cash portion
of the purchase price paid by Spring Lane to the Company was approximately million, which represented the purchase price of 
million less the Company s pro rata share of certain contributions funded entirely by Spring Lane in the earlier portion of this
series of transactions occurring during February 2023 and March 2023. As a further part of these transactions, the parties agreed that
from January 1, 2023 onwards, the Company would bear only of the costs relating to the construction and operation of the Dorothy
Phase 1A Facility, compared to its share until that time, including during the calendar year 2022. 

Concurrently
with the Sale, the Company, Spring Lane, Devco and the Project Company entered into (a) the Fourth Amended and Restated Limited Liability
Company Agreement of the Project Company, dated as of March 10, 2023 (the Fourth A R LLCA ), an amendment and
restatement of the Third Amended and Restated Limited Liability Company Agreement of the Project Company dated as of March 3, 2023, and
(b) the Amended and Restated Contribution Agreement, dated as of March 10, 2023 (the A R Contribution Agreement ),
an amendment and restatement of the Contribution Agreement dated as of August 5, 2022. The Fourth A R LLCA provides for certain updates
in respect of Spring Lane s majority ownership. The A R Contribution Agreement reflects updated pro rata member funding percentages
as a result of the Sale as well as updated contribution caps for each of the Company and Spring Lane. 

As of January 1, 2023, there were no changes in the Limited Liability Agreement of DVSL other than those related
to incorporating the new investment and the purpose and design of DVSL has not changed. The Company evaluated the concepts under ASC 810
for DVSL after the change in membership interest, concluding that this resulted in the Project Company not being structured with non-substantive
voting rights, as the noncontrolling shareholders have disproportionately fewer voting rights but the activities are not conducted on
their behalf. This, in conjunction with there being sufficient equity at risk to finance its activities and the equity holders as a group
having the characteristics of a controlling financial interest in DVSL, results in DVSL not meeting the definition of a VIE. The
Company s consolidation model is based on the concept of power. Given the Company s Class A membership interest, the Company
has the ability to control the significant decisions made in the ordinary course of the business of DVSL. The non-controlling shareholders
do not hold substantive participating rights, voting rights or liquidation rights. This results in the Project Company being a voting
interest entity VOE ), therefore allowing the Company to continue to consolidate.

Effective,
January 1, 2023, the Company s ownership in DVSL was reduced from to ; see above for details. 

On
May 9, 2023, the Company s indirect subsidiary DVCC completed a strategic partnership and financing with a special purpose vehicle,
Navitas West Texas Investments SPV, LLC , Navitas organized by Navitas Global, to complete the second phase of
the Dorothy Project Dorothy 1B ). Under a Contribution Agreement among the parties, the Company owned a substantially complete
25MW data center under construction, in which 

The
Company evaluated this legal entity under ASC 810, Consolidations and determined that DVCC is a VIE that
should be consolidated into the Company, with a non-controlling interest recorded to account for Navita s equity ownership of the
Company. The Company has a variable interest in DVCC. The entity was designed by the Company to create an entity for outside investors
to invest in specific projects. The creation of this entity resulted in the Company, through its equity interest in DVCC, absorbing operational
risk that the entity was created to create and distribute, resulting in the Company having a variable interest in DVCC. 

DVCC
is a VIE of the Company due to DVCC being structured with non-substantive voting rights. This is due to the following
two factors being met as outlined in ASC 810-10-15-14 that require the VIE model to be followed. 

a. 
 The
 voting rights of the Company are not proportional to their obligation to absorb the expected losses of the legal entity. The Company
 gave Navitas veto rights over significant decisions, which results in Soluna having fewer voting rights relative to their obligation
 to absorb the expected losses of the legal entity. 

b. 
 Substantially
 all of DVCC s activities are conducted on behalf of the Company, which has disproportionally fewer voting rights. 

Also,
the Company is the primary beneficiary due to having the power to direct the activities of DVCC that most significantly impact the performance
of DVCC due to its role as the manager handling the day-to-day activities of DVCC as well as majority ownership and the obligation to
absorb losses or gains of DVCC that could be significant to the Company. 

Accordingly,
the accounts of DVCC are consolidated in the accompanying financial statements.

On
July 22, 2024 (the Effective Date ), Soluna Holdings, Inc. (the Company closed financing for the Dorothy
2 project. This project involves Soluna Digital, Inc. (the Developer and Soluna DVSL II ComputeCo, LLC (the ComputeCo ),
a special purpose vehicle initially owned solely by the Developer. They are collaborating on the development, design, procurement, and
construction of a 48 MW modular data center (the Project Dorothy 2 in Briscoe County, TX. This facility, located in Silverton,
Texas, is owned by ComputeCo and operated by Soluna US Services, LLC, and may engage in cryptocurrency, batch processing, and other non-crypto
related activities. It is adjacent to two other Company modular data center projects at the same site. 

Project
Dorothy 2 is financed by Soluna2 SLC Fund II Project Holdco LLC, an investment vehicle of Spring Lane Capital SLC with
a capital contribution of up to million, and the Developer, as the parent company of ComputeCo, with an initial capital contribution
of up to million. As of the Effective Date, the Company and the Developer became co-owners of ComputeCo. 

Project
Dorothy 2 allows the Developer to invest in ComputeCo, with the total ownership of the Developer and its affiliates capped at of
the Class B Membership Interests. . 

On
May 16, 2024, the Company secured 
 million in financing from SLC for equipment and
machinery for Project Dorothy 2 through an Equipment Loan Agreement (the ELA between SDI SL Borrowing - 1, LLC (the Borrower and SLC. On that date, SLC lent the Borrower 
 to purchase medium voltage cables and low voltage
switchboards. This debt was later assigned to ComputeCo on the Effective Date. Subsequently, the Borrowing amount in full by issuing
the Investor Class B Membership Interests in the Dorothy 2 project valued at three times the borrowing amount (i.e., 2.16 million). 

The Company evaluated
this legal entity under ASC 810, Consolidations and determined that this is not a VIE. This entity is a VOE primarily due to there
being sufficient equity at risk to finance its activities, the equity holders as a group having the characteristics of a controlling financial
interest and the entity is not structured with non-substantive voting rights. The Company s consolidation model is based on the
concept of power. Given the Company s Class A membership interest, the Company has the ability to control the significant decisions
made in the ordinary course of the business of ComputeCo. Even though SLC has a majority of the Class B membership, the Company holds
all the Class A membership, which gives them the ability to control the significant decisions made in the ordinary course of business.
The non-controlling shareholders do not hold substantive participating rights, voting rights or liquidation rights. As of September 30,
2024, SLC owns 72 and SDI owns 28 of ComputeCo.

generated from Project Dorothy, and previously from Project Sophie and Marie. The Data Center Hosting segment generated revenue from
contracts for the provision/consumption of electricity and operation of the data center from the Company s high performance computing
facilities previously at Project Marie and currently from Project Sophie and Project Dorothy. The High-Performance Computing Services
currently has not generated any revenue as of third quarter of 2024, as Project Ada is still working on building its customer base. Project

1A 

D1A
is focused on Bitcoin Hosting of two large customers. There are approximately 7,700 Bitcoin miners installed between the two customers,
resulting in an installed hashrate of approximately 950 PH/s. From May 2023 through December 31, 2023, D1A consumed over 11,900 MWh of
Curtailed Energy and achieved a power usage effectiveness PUE of 1.03. For the three and nine months ended September
30, 2024, D1A consumed over 2,900 MWh and 31,000 MWh of Curtailed Energy and achieved a PUE of 0.99. 

D1A
was constructed in partnership with Spring Lane Capital SLC ), a leading venture capital firm focused on sustainability
solutions. SLC owns approximately 85 of the Class B Membership Units, while we own 15 and own 100 of the Class A Membership Units.
After SLC achieves an 18 Internal Rate of Return hurdle, Soluna retains 50 of the profits on D1A. 

Dorothy
1B 

D1B
is focused on proprietary Bitcoin Mining. There are approximately 7,900 Bitmain Antminer S19s, S19j Pro and S19j Pro+ machines installed,
resulting in an installed hashrate of 817 PH/s From July 2023 through December 31, 2023, D1B consumed over 10,600 MWh of Curtailed Energy
and achieved a PUE of 1.03. For the three and nine months ended September 30 2024, D1B consumed over 2,650 and 30,800 MWh of Curtailed
Energy and achieved a PUE of 0.99. 

Demand
Response Services at Dorothy 

In
November 2023, we completed registration of Project Dorothy for one of ERCOT s Demand Response Services DRS programs
establishing the project as a key contributor to intelligent and flexible energy solutions, promoting environmental and economic advantages
for the state of Texas. It also allowed us to diversify our revenue. Under the program, we have a single promise to stand ready, on a
monthly basis, to deliver a set amount of curtailment (committed capacity) per month when and if called upon by ERCOT. The Company is
able to generate additional revenue for Project Dorothy by providing this grid resilience support which reduces its power costs, making
it one of the lowest cost players in the industry. Since November 2023, Project Dorothy has successfully participated in and completed
the Winter, Spring and Summer DRS periods in ERCOT, and is currently in the fall standby period.

Cash
Flow, Site and Process Optimization 

In
the second quarter of 2023, we shifted our business from primarily proprietary Bitcoin Mining to Bitcoin Hosting. We signed 50 MW of
hosting agreements at Dorothy 1A and Sophie. 

Sophie 

Project
Sophie is a 25 MW data center, based in Murray, Kentucky connected to the grid, Sophie ). The project has a Power Purchase
Agreement PPA that requires the curtailment of the site during certain hours of the day to help balance the Kentucky
grid. We own 100 of the facility which was completed in 2021. 

Sophie
is focused on Bitcoin Hosting of multiple large customers such as Bit Digital and Compass. The data center generates revenue via a combination
of fixed services fees and profit share, while energy cost is passed through. There are approximately 9,000 Bitcoin miners installed,
resulting in an installed hashrate of approximately 801 PH/s. For 2023, the facility achieved a PUE of 1.03. For the three and nine months
ended September 30, 2024, the facility achieved a PUE of 1.02. 

Marie 

In
February 2023, Project Marie, our 20 MW data center in Kentucky was decommissioned. The decision was sparked by following events: 

NYDIG,
 our asset-backed-lender on mining and infrastructure equipment, accelerated their loan and repossessed their collateral. 

Our
 Bitcoin Hosting customer, Atlas Technology Group, LLC Atlas ), at the site failed to upgrade and invest in their mining
 equipment, decreasing the profitability of the site. 

Our
 landlord, CC Metals and Alloys, LLC, CCMA terminated our lease. 

As
a result, we disposed of all remaining assets at the site, terminated the Atlas hosting agreement, and decommissioned the site. 

Cost
Cutting and Process Optimization 

In
2023, we implemented a number of cost improvement initiatives and ramped up a new Financial Planning and Analysis FP A function to provide our management and operations teams better insight into the financial performance of our data centers. This helped
us find opportunities to improve profitability and proactively address critical issues with infrastructure equipment at all sites. Our
MaestroOS software platform managed the efficient operations of projects Dorothy and Sophie through record setting temperatures (hot
and cold) in both Texas and Kentucky in 2023. In 2024, our Maestro control system has continued to respond well to increases in grid
demand throughout the summer. 

In
2024, our objective is to achieve operational excellence across all data centers, targeting a budgeted EBITDA and maintaining high customer
satisfaction. Our infrastructure optimization efforts have been completed to protect equipment against the severe summer heat to include
miner heat shielding, building insulation upgrades, and transformer fan kit installations. 

Flagship
Expansion 

Dorothy
2 

We
began planning for the 50 MW expansion of Project Dorothy in 2023. We partnered with SLC who will finance up to 30 million of
the project cost. We closed the initial financing contribution and operation agreement with SLC in July 2024 and broke ground in the third quarter of 2024. Initial energization and ramp-up is expected by the
end of the first quarter of 2025. Dorothy 2 will feature a stronger waterfall structure and enhanced management and development fees
compared to Dorothy 1A, allowing Soluna to benefit from substantial income once the facility is operational. 

In
addition, we have 2 MW of our Project Dorothy 2 site slated for our Helix Pilot, focused on next generation data centers for AI.

Pipeline
Growth 

Kati 

Project
Kati is planned to be a 166 MW data center integrated with a 300 MW wind farm in South Texas. It is expected to host a mix of Bitcoin
Mining and AI/HPC customers in separate data center facilities located onsite and sharing certain infrastructure. The project has progressed
rapidly from term sheet signing in 2023 through the ERCOT planning process and signing of a PPA with EDF Renewables and Masdar - Abu
Dhabi Future Energy Company. 

Rosa 

Project
Rosa is planned to be a 187 MW data center integrated with a 240 MW wind farm in North Texas. It is, like Kati, expected to host a mix
of Bitcoin Mining and AI/HPC customers in separate data center facilities located onsite and sharing certain infrastructure. Term sheets
for power and land were signed in September 2024 and the project will soon move into and through the ERCOT planning process as well as
securing a PPA. 

We
are on track to nearly double our assets under management by the end of 2024 or early 2025 and thereafter which is our goal. 

Launch
AI 

Ada 

Project
Ada launched when a subsidiary of Soluna Cloud entered into a 12.5 million credit facility with GreenCloud Partners in June 2024 and
a 1.25 million credit facility on the same terms with a syndicated group of lenders related to Alpha Capital in July. These funds enabled
us to fund ongoing working capital needs and to secure an agreement with Hewlett Packard Enterprise Company HPE to acquire
access to datacenter and cloud services for AI and HPC processes for 36 months at a cost of 34 million, with 10.3 million pre-paid
in June at contract execution. 

Soluna
Cloud began offering its services by leveraging HPE s renewable-powered high performance data centers. Their cutting-edge facilities,
known for their energy efficiency and sustainability, support the environmental sustainability of Soluna Cloud s operations. Additionally,
this collaboration expands Soluna Cloud s offering beyond just bare-metal infrastructure, making available HPE s comprehensive
software solutions for AI pipelines. As an HPE Partner Ready Service Provider partner, Soluna Cloud will offer its advanced cloud solutions
to HPE s global customer base demonstrating AI expertise and delivery capabilities. This partnership can be expanded in the future. 

Grace 

Project
Grace will leverage Soluna s new Helix data center model to be built at 2 MW capacity adjacent to Project Dorothy. The Helix model
will serve as the growth pathway for customers, addressing the growing demand for more sustainable data centers for AI powered by renewable
energy and will demonstrate Soluna s proprietary data center design and its substantial expected benefits. 

Financing
Opportunities 

Yorkville
Standby Equity Purchase Agreement SEPA 

We
secured a 25 million SEPA in August 2024 with a subsidiary fund of Yorkville Advisors. This facility provides cash to us by way of draws
against it which can be made once the S-1 registration statement that was filed in September 2024 is effective and can be fully used
once shareholder approval to remove the exchange cap is obtained which is expected to be in November 2024. Funds from this facility will
fund critical Soluna Cloud AI operations and data center development, capital for deployment into projects to improve equity ownership
and cash flows, to strengthen the balance sheet and to retire existing convertible loan notes. 

In
order to secure necessary consents for the SEPA, agreements were reached with existing convertible loan noteholders and the Preferred
Series B stockholder. The agreements with convertible loan note holders resulted in prepayment of convertible loan note prepayment fees,
payment of a waiver fee of 750 thousand and an obligation to purchase the 1.25 million Soluna Cloud notes and pay unconverted convertible
loan note balances from cash raised from the SEPA. The agreements with the Preferred Series B stockholder resulted in limitations of
future rights of first refusal, participation, consent and warrant or stock conversion and repricing of the conversion price and existing
warrants and issuance of new warrants. 

Convertible
Noteholders 

In
2023 and early 2024, the Company negotiated four amendments to the Convertible Notes. These amendments were focused on extending the
maturity date of the notes, lowering the conversion price of the notes, adding features to the notes to allow early payoff with predetermined
cost, and the repricing of certain warrants to assist the Company in raising capital for operations. Additionally on May 17, 2024, certain
warrants were further repriced to assist in raising additional capital.

Future
Financing 

We
plan to raise funds, via the SEPA and other means, to support accretive opportunities related to our growth initiatives and projects. 

Recent
Developments and Trends 

Industry
Trends 

Soluna s
business is influenced by several industry trends, including: (1) challenges in the Bitcoin ecosystem, (2) the Bitcoin Halving, (3) the
Inflation Reduction Act, (4) the global Supply Chain, (5) the growth of AI. 

Bitcoin
Ecosystem 

Fiscal
years 2022 and 2023 presented unprecedented challenges for the Bitcoin mining industry. In 2022, a sharp drop in Bitcoin prices, compounded
by geopolitical tensions such as the war in Ukraine and surging global energy costs, drove several mining companies into bankruptcy proceedings,
resulting in market oversaturation with used mining equipment at steep discounts. This destabilization persisted well into 2023, further
complicated by high-profile industry setbacks, including the collapse of FTX and regulatory scrutiny on Binance, the largest global cryptocurrency
exchange. These events collectively dampened investor confidence and weighed on Bitcoin prices. 

In
late 2023, a critical turning point emerged as major asset managers, including BlackRock, Grayscale, and Bitwise, submitted applications
for Bitcoin Spot Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs). The anticipation surrounding potential ETF approvals reignited interest in Bitcoin, creating
a bullish shift in market sentiment. Bitcoin prices have since seen upward momentum, providing substantial revenue opportunities across
the ecosystem. The approval and adoption of Bitcoin ETFs in mainstream financial markets could seem poised to have marked a milestone
for broader institutional support, having facilitated greater liquidity, price stability, and increased investment in the sector. 

As
we progress through 2024, the Bitcoin mining sector seems positioned for both recovery and transformation. The trend of institutionalization
appears to be shaping the industry s landscape, with consolidation likely reducing network competition, thus potentially increasing
our share of Bitcoin rewards. Our company s access to low-cost and renewable energy sources places us in a strategic position to
maximize uptime and efficiency as hash rates and mining difficulty continue to climb. 

Key
factors shaping industry dynamics include ETF approvals, which have bolstered Bitcoin prices, increased institutional participation that
may provide stability, and the possibility of a more defined regulatory framework as the digital asset landscape matures. However, as
the sector gains mainstream acceptance, miners must also prepare for regulatory and ESG scrutiny, fluctuating energy costs, and market
consolidation. Our emphasis on low-cost, renewable energy sources and strategic risk management supports our ability to navigate these
challenges while maximizing profitability and operational longevity. 

Looking
forward, we are cautiously optimistic about industry trends, with a strong focus on agility, cost-efficiency, and compliance as we adapt
to an evolving Bitcoin mining landscape. 

Bitcoin
Halving 

In
April 2024, Bitcoin underwent its fourth halving event, occurring approximately every four years or after every 210,000 blocks are mined.
During a halving, miners rewards for validating transactions and creating new blocks on the Bitcoin blockchain are cut in half,
reducing the rate of new Bitcoin generation. This event typically triggers anticipation and speculation within the Bitcoin community
and among investors, leading to increased market activity. Price volatility tends to rise before and after a halving as the market reacts
to perceived supply scarcity. Mining profitability decreases post-halving, potentially prompting some miners to shut down operations.
This often sparks consolidations in the space, reducing the number of mining companies. However, the network automatically adjusts mining
difficulty to ensure consistent block production. The halving also causes a supply shock, reducing Bitcoin s inflation rate and
potentially driving long-term price appreciation, although past performance does not guarantee future outcomes. The 2024 halving was the
first to happen during a high interest rate environment, and in the presence of strong institutional demand for Bitcoin driven by ETFs.
Reduction in block-reward will represent a short-term reduction in revenue. But the supply-shock effect and the growth of ETFs may lessen
the volatility in the long run. A projected rise in Bitcoin price in the months after the halving would increase revenues and increase
demand for our low-cost data centers. 

Recent
events, including the Mt. Gox settlements have significantly impacted Bitcoin s price and supply due to the reintroduction of approximately
141,000 bitcoins into the market, raising concerns about increased selling pressure and market volatility. Despite these concerns, experts
believe the market has sufficient liquidity to absorb the selling pressure, and the impact on Bitcoin s value is expected to be
temporary. The announcement of repayments led to a notable decline in cryptocurrency prices, with Bitcoin experiencing a 6 drop in a
single day and the overall market capitalization decreasing by over 170 billion. However, the long-term investment prospects for Bitcoin
remain positive, influenced by broader economic factors such as potential Federal Reserve rate cuts. 

39 

Inflation
Reduction Act 

The
Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 IRA ), signed into law by President Biden, is a significant investment in climate and energy
in the U.S. At the time of its passage, legislators estimated that the bill would allocate 370 billion, primarily in the form of tax
credits, to a wide array of decarbonization efforts. Recent private estimates are much higher. In March, the Brookings Institute released
a study estimating the spending at 1.2 trillion, which is three times the Congressional estimate. The Act aims to tackle the climate
crisis, advance environmental justice, secure America s position as a world leader in clean energy manufacturing, and work towards
achieving a net-zero economy by 2050. Since its enactment, the Inflation Reduction Act has driven substantial investment in clean energy
projects, with over 110 billion announced in new clean-energy manufacturing investments. This includes investments in electric vehicle
supply chains and solar manufacturing. Overall, the IRA stimulates economic growth through renewable energy development and infrastructure
reinvestment in the United States. The IRA is accelerating the development of new renewable power plants across the country and extending
the tax incentives. This growth is likely to exacerbate the wasted energy problem as grid transmission will not keep pace. In 2024, new
guidance was issued allowing eligible taxpayers to sell their energy tax credits to unrelated parties, further incentivizing clean energy
investments and potentially increasing the company s long-term project pipeline. 

Supply
Chain 

The
global supply chain is facing challenges, particularly in the electric power sector, due to the scarcity of power infrastructure components
like transformers. The electric grid component market is experiencing a supply and demand mismatch, leading to an ongoing shortage of
transformers and other grid components. Over 70 of transmission and power transformers in the U.S. are over 25 years old, and there
is insufficient manufacturing capacity to meet the demand for grid transformers and component parts. Factors contributing to the scarcity
include aging infrastructure, increasing demand for electricity, extreme weather events threatening reliability, insufficient domestic
manufacturing capacity, and reliance on foreign suppliers. President Biden authorized the use of the Defense Production Act Title III
to accelerate domestic production of electric grid transformers and components to address the shortage. Companies are using emergency
stocks of components, reviewing scheduled work, substituting materials when possible, improving communication with suppliers, and digitizing
processes to enhance efficiency. The scarcity of power infrastructure components like transformers is a critical issue and efforts are
being made to address these challenges through various strategies and actions. Difficult to source equipment could affect our growth.
We have developed strategic relationships with key equipment providers with manufacturing facilities in the US and Abroad. 

AI 

Since
the inception of ChatGPT by OpenAI, AI has experienced remarkable growth, transforming the field. Large language models LLM 
s) have revolutionized AI, fueling interest in Generative AI technologies. The introduction of ChatGPT alone has increased AI-related
job listings significantly, indicating its impact beyond tech. In 2023, global venture capital investments in AI soared to 50 billion,
reflecting confidence in AI s future potential. Funding focus has shifted to mature companies with proven technologies, signaling
market maturation. This growth has driven demand for computing resources and attracted enterprise interest. The Generative AI market
is projected to reach 1.3 trillion by 2032, with significant energy implications. By 2030, AI could comprise 3-4 of global power demand,
with Google already attributing 10-15 of its power use to AI technologies. The widespread adoption of Generative AI like ChatGPT has
substantially increased energy consumption across various applications and services. (In 2023, Google reported a 17 increase in data
center energy consumption, driven by AI. Microsoft consumed 24 TWh of energy in a single year more than some developed nations.)
 The energy demands of AI will increase focus on the sustainability of the industry. We expect increasing demand for specialized AI
data centers with access to renewable energy. This will likely open opportunities for Soluna to provide AI Cloud and Colocation services
to new companies and enterprises investing in AI initiatives. 

Since
March 2024, developments in Generative AI have included advancements in multimodal models that integrate text, image, and audio generation,
as well as improvements in model efficiency and scalability. Major tech companies have launched new Generative AI tools tailored for
specific industries, enhancing productivity and innovation across sectors such as healthcare, finance, and entertainment. These advancements
underscore the need for robust, energy-efficient infrastructure to support the growing capabilities and applications of Generative AI. 

AI
Infrastructure is now in increased demand. For example, Core Scientific and CoreWeave forged a partnership in June 2024 worth billions
of dollars. This trend bodes well for Soluna s prospects as it expands into the AI Infrastructure space through its subsidiary
Soluna Cloud, in collaboration with Hewlett Packard Enterprise. 

Hosting Agreement Termination 

Recently
we have entered into substantive discussions with a customer, representing over 50 of our data hosting revenue, to mutually terminate
a hosting agreement early. This is most likely to take place during the fourth quarter of 2024. We are also in significant and advanced
discussions with multiple potential customers who are expected to fully replace the lost hosting capacity with minimal interruptions,
also likely to take place during the fourth quarter of 2024.

Cryptocurrency
Mining Revenue : Cryptocurrency revenue consists of revenue recognized from Soluna s cryptocurrency mining operations. Cryptocurrency
revenue was approximately 2.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 1.8 million for the three months ended
September 30, 2023. For the three months ended September 30, 2024, all cryptocurrency mining revenue related to Project Dorothy 1B, which
began energization in the third quarter of 2023, and has been running at a full 25 MWs. Operations were stopped for Project Marie in
February 2023 with the CCMA termination and NYDIG repossession of collateralized assets, and Project Sophie switched to Data Hosting
beginning in the second quarter of fiscal year 2023 creating only 47 thousand in cryptocurrency revenue for the three months ended September
30, 2023, as such no revenue was recognized for either Project Marie or Sophie for the three months ended September 30, 2024. As noted
above, Project Dorothy 1B began operations in the third quarter of 2023 as such was not running at 100 in the third quarter of 2023
and generated approximately 1.7 million of revenue. In addition to the above, the average price of Bitcoin increased by 118 from the
three months ended September 30, 2023 compared to the same period for September 2024. 

Data
Hosting Revenue : The Company s cryptocurrency hosting services provide energized space and operating services to third-party
mining companies who locate their mining hardware at one of our mining locations. Services include fees for hosting the miners which
could be fixed fees or profit sharing, as well as potential additional fees for services provided such as installation charges or other
services fees. Data hosting revenue was approximately 4.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 4.0 million
for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase was primarily related to continued energization and the deployment of hosting
customers at Project Dorothy 1A which began in the second quarter of 2023 creating approximately 3.5 million in data hosting revenue
for the third quarter of 2024 compared to approximately 3.0 million for the third quarter of 2023, approximately a 500 thousand increase,
in which was offset by a slight decrease in revenue of 235 thousand at Project Sophie who switched their business model from proprietary
mining to data hosting in the second quarter of 2023. 

Demand
Response Service : In November 2023, we completed our registration of Project Dorothy for one of ERCOT s demand response
programs, in which we began services in December 2023. On a monthly basis we stand ready to deliver a set amount of committed capacity
per period when and if called upon by ERCOT. We note that based on the time of the year, certain months and weather create more lucrative
rewards. No such services were performed for the three ended September 30, 2023. 

Cost
of Cryptocurrency Mining Revenue, exclusive of depreciation : Cost of cryptocurrency mining revenue includes direct utility
costs, site overhead expenses, and overhead costs that relate to the operations of our cryptocurrency mining facilities in Kentucky and
Texas. Going forward, cost of cryptocurrency revenue will include any additional cryptocurrency mining facilities that are part of the
Company s future pipeline. 

Cost
of cryptocurrency revenue, exclusive of depreciation costs was approximately 2.0 million and 1.0 million for the three months ended
September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, approximately 923 thousand increase. The higher costs during the three months ended September
30, 2024 compared to 2023 were due to the full Project Dorothy 1B site being active the entire quarter of 2024, versus as a startup in
2023. Also noted was that Project Sophie was dropping from being a proprietary mining site in the second quarter of 2023. 

42 

Cost
of Data Hosting Revenue, exclusive of depreciation: Cost of data hosting revenue includes utility charges, site overhead expenses,
and other charges. 

Cost
of data hosting revenue was approximately 2.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 2.2 million for the
same period in 2023. This increase was due to Project Dorothy 1A which began operations and hosting services in May 2023, creating costs
of approximately 2.0 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 1,8 million for the three months ended September
30, 2023. Also, the Company began data hosting operations at Project Sophie in mid-April 2023, which created an increase in costs of
approximately 137 thousand between the comparable periods. 

Cost
of High-Performance Computing Services: Cost of high-performance computing services include production costs related to high
performance computing services which for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was approximately 2.9 million and related to an agreement
with HPE effective July 1, 2024 to acquire access to datacenter and cloud services for AI and HPC processes. As of September 30, 2024,
no revenue has been generated for these services. There were no such costs associated for the three months ended September 30, 2023. 

Cost
of revenue- depreciation: Depreciation costs associated with cryptocurrency and data hosting revenue was approximately 1.5 million
for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to approximately 1.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The
increase related to the capital additions to fixed assets between the second quarter of fiscal year 2023 through the third quarter of
2024. It was noted that Project Marie was discontinued in February of 2023, Project Sophie had sold a majority of its miners in the second
quarter of 2023, and the significant additions of capital expenditures at Project Dorothy, causing an increase in depreciation costs
period over period. As the Company has begun to invest more in capital expenditures, we expect to see depreciation costs to significantly
increase over the next several quarters. 

General
and Administrative Expenses, exclusive of depreciation and amortization: General and administrative expenses, exclusive of depreciation
and amortization include cash and non-cash compensation, benefits and related costs in support of our general corporate operations, including
general management, finance and accounting, human resources, marketing, information technology, corporate development, and legal services. 

General
 and administrative expenses, exclusive of depreciation and amortization increased approximately 2.5 million or 93 for the three
 months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. General and administrative expenses, exclusive
 of depreciation and amortization were approximately 5.2 million, including approximately 1.2 million of stock compensation expense
 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to approximately 2.7 million, including 590 thousand of stock compensation
 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in general and administrative expenses, exclusive of depreciation and
 amortization was mainly due to employee related expenses, legal fees, professional fees, related credit loss provision expense, and
 stock compensation expenses. 

The
 Company had an increase of approximately 838 thousand in employee related expense for the three months ended September 30, 2024
 compared to three months ended September 30, 2023 due to an increase in resources and salaries of approximately 435 thousand, and
 in anticipation of hitting performance-based targets of approximately 403 thousand. 

Legal
 fees increased by approximately 391 thousand for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three months ended September
 30, 2023; the increase is due to the legal work related to Project Dorothy 2, equity plan amendments, and other development projects. 

The
 Company took a provision for expected credit loss for approximately 346 thousand for the three months ended September 30, 2024 in
 relation an unresolved pricing dispute with a Bitcoin hosting customer, compared to no provision for the three months ended September
 30, 2023. 

Professional
 fees associated to audit and tax increased by approximately 77 thousand for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to
 September 30, 2023 due to additional costs review of complex transactions and additional tax work related to subsidiary entities. 

Stock
 compensation increased approximately 659 thousand due multiple grants in April, June and September of 2024 causing an increasing
 in expense for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the prior comparable period. 

Depreciation
and Amortization associated with general and administrative expenses: Depreciation and amortization expense was comparable for
the three months ended September 30, 2024 and the three months ended September 30, 2023 in which the balances totaled approximately 2.4
million, respectively. The balances mainly related to amortization expense related to the strategic pipeline contract that was acquired
in October 2021. 

43 

Interest
expense: Interest expense for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was approximately 821 thousand related to approximately
 369 thousand to the NYDIG loan, 431 thousand to compounded interest and deferred financing amortization expense for the equipment financing
loan and June and July 2024 secured note financing, and 22 thousand to the Navitas loan. Interest expense for the three months ended
September 30, 2023, was 495 thousand which primarily related to mainly related to interest accrued on the Navitas loan of 85 thousand
and interest on the NYDIG Financing Loan of approximately 405 thousand. 

Gain
(Loss) on Debt Extinguishment and Revaluation, net : For the three months ended September 30, 2024, the Company had a gain on
revaluation of approximately 1.2 million. The gain was in relation to the convertible notes of 2.3 million due to factors
including conversion assumptions and payouts, annual volatility and stock price conditions on the dates of valuations compared to
what the noteholders could convert at as of September 30, 2024, in addition to a gain on warrant revaluation of the Soluna Cloud
warrants for 327 thousand. The gain for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was offset with a loss on debt of approximately
 1.4 million due to the satisfaction and redemption of the Dorothy 2 equipment loan through issuance of Class B Membership interests
in the Dorothy 2 project valued at three times the borrowing amount (i.e., 2.16 million), in which created approximately a 1.4
million loss. For the three months ended September 30, 2023, the Company had a loss on debt revaluation of approximately 769
thousand due to additional assumptions and assessments on the valuation of the debt at quarter end. See Note 7 for further
details.

30, 2024. For the three months ended September 30, 2023, the Company incurred a loss on sale of fixed assets of approximately 373 thousand
in relation to the sale of miners for Project Sophie and sale of the remaining Project Marie fixed assets including the Tesseracks. 

Income
Tax Benefit (expense): Income tax benefit for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was 547 thousand compared to an income
tax expense of approximately 569 thousand for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The balance for the three months ended September
30, 2024 and 2023 was related to deferred tax amortization impact of acquiring an asset in a transaction that is not a business combination
when the amount paid exceeds the tax basis on the acquisition date. As such, the Company is required to adjust the value of the strategic
contract pipeline by approximately 10.9 million at inception date (October 29, 2021), in which was recorded as a deferred tax liability
and this amount will be amortized over the life of the asset. For the three months ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023, the
Company amortized 547 thousand, respectively. In addition, for the three months ended September 30, 2023, there were timing difference
due to significant increase for in-service capital assets for the three months ended September 30, 2023 which created an offset of approximately
 1.1 million in deferred income tax expense. 

Net
(loss) income attributable to non-controlling interest: Net loss attributable to non-controlling interest for the three months
ended September 30, 2024 was 903 thousand compared to net income attributable to non-controlling interest of 646 thousand for the three
months ended September 30, 2023 This amount relates to Spring Lane s 85 noncontrolling interest of the net profit in Soluna DVSL
and Navitas 45 - 49 noncontrolling interest of the net loss in Soluna DV ComputeCo for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and
2023. The change in non-controlling interest relates to a net loss in noncontrolling interest at Dorothy 1B of approximately 177 thousand,
in which was driven by price of Bitcoin and site curtailments, and new for third quarter of 2024 was a noncontrolling interest loss of
approximately 1.4 million associated to Dorothy 2 in which Spring Lane had noncontrolling interest of 58 - 72 for the three months ended September
30, 2024 in which the site is in development stage and would expect losses, offset with continued profitability at Dorothy 1A having
a noncontrolling interest profit of 648 thousand in which is largely due to strong margins, creating a total net loss attributable to
non-controlling interest of 68 thousand. The three-month net income for September 2023 balance in relation to non-controlling interest
relates to Spring Lane s 85 noncontrolling interest of the Net Profit in Soluna DVSL for approximately 759 thousand offset with
Navitas 49 noncontrolling interest of the Net Loss of in Soluna DV ComputeCo of 111 thousand for the 3 months ended September 30, 2023.

Cryptocurrency
Mining Revenue : Cryptocurrency revenue consists of revenue recognized from Soluna s cryptocurrency mining operations. Cryptocurrency
revenue was approximately 13.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 5.5 million for the nine months ended
September 30, 2023. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, all cryptocurrency mining revenue related to Project Dorothy 1B, which
began energization in the third quarter of 2023, and has been running at a full 25 MWs. Operations were stopped for Project Marie in
February 2023 with the CCMA termination and NYDIG repossession of collateralized assets, and Project Sophie switched to Data Hosting
beginning in the second quarter of fiscal year, as such no revenue was recognized for either Project Marie or Sophie for the nine months
ended September 30, 2024. The Company also noted for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, that Project Marie shut down when only
8 MW was running for Proprietary Mining and Project Sophie was beginning to struggle and was not able to maintain running at 25 MW, therefore
we started our transition to a hosting model and was fully switched by June 2023. In addition to the above, the average price of Bitcoin
increased by 128 in the nine months ended September 30, 2023 compared to the same period for September 2024. 

Data
Hosting Revenue : The Company s cryptocurrency hosting services provide energized space and operating services to third-party
mining companies who locate their mining hardware at one of our mining locations. Services include fees for hosting the miners which
could be fixed fees or profit sharing, as well as potential additional fees for services provided such as installation charges or other
services fees. Data hosting revenue was approximately 14.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 5.5 million
for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The significant increase was primarily related to energization and the deployment of hosting
customers at Project Dorothy 1A in the second quarter of 2023 creating approximately 10.6 million in data hosting revenue for the nine
months ended September 30, 2024 compared to approximately 3.5 million for the same period in 2023, approximately a 7.1 million increase.
In addition, Project Sophie switched their business model from proprietary mining to data hosting in the second quarter of 2023 which
created an additional increase of approximately 2.1 million from approximately 1.7 million for the nine months ended September 30,
2023 to approximately 3.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. As such, the Company was performing hosting services
utilizing approximately 50 MW between Project Dorothy 1A and Project Sophie. Offsetting the increase was the decommission of Project
Marie operations in February 2023 causing a decline of approximately 276 thousand nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to September
30, 2023. For the first quarter of 2023, Project Marie was hosting at approximately 10 MW. 

Demand
Response Service : In November 2023, we completed our registration of Project Dorothy for one of ERCOT s demand response
programs, and we began services in December 2023. On a monthly basis we stand ready to deliver a set amount of committed capacity per
period when and if called upon by ERCOT. We note that based on the time of the year, certain months and weather create more lucrative
rewards. No such services were performed for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 

Cost
of Cryptocurrency Mining Revenue, exclusive of depreciation : Cost of cryptocurrency mining revenue includes direct utility
costs, site overhead expenses, and overhead costs that relate to the operations of our cryptocurrency mining facilities in Kentucky and
Texas. Going forward, cost of cryptocurrency revenue will include any additional cryptocurrency mining facilities that are part of the
Company s future pipeline. 

Cost
of cryptocurrency mining revenue, exclusive of depreciation costs was approximately 5.7 million and 4.5 million for the nine months
ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, approximately a 1.2 million increase. The higher costs during the nine months ended
September 30, 2024 compared to 2023 were due to the full Project Dorothy 1B site being active the entire nine months ended September
30, 2024, versus as a startup beginning in the second quarter of 2023. Also noted, Project Sophie was no longer a proprietary mining
site by the second quarter of 2023. The increase was slightly offset with the Company operating only one facility for the nine months
ended September 30, 2024, compared to three facilities for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Also, the electricity costs at Project
Dorothy 1B are comparatively lower than the costs were at Project Sophie and Marie. 

Cost
of Data Hosting Revenue, exclusive of depreciation: Cost of data hosting revenue includes utility charges, site overhead expenses,
and other charges. 

Cost
of data hosting revenue was approximately 7.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 3.2 million for the
nine months ended September 30, 2023. This increase was due to Project Dorothy 1A which began operations and hosting services in May
2023, creating costs of approximately 5.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 2.3 million for the nine
months ended September 30, 2023. Also, the Company began data hosting operations at Project Sophie in mid-April 2023, which created an
increase in costs of approximately 807 thousand between the comparable periods. The increase was offset as a direct result by Project
Marie s operations ceasing in February 2023, where the main hosting contract was also simultaneously terminated, creating a decline
in costs of approximately 204 thousand. 

Cost
of High-Performance Computing Services: Cost of high-performance computing services include production costs related to high
performance computing services which for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was approximately 2.9 million and related to an agreement
with HPE effective July 1, 2024 to acquire access to datacenter and cloud services for AI and HPC processes. As of September 30, 2024,
no revenue has been generated for these services. There were no such costs associated for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 

46 

Cost
of revenue- depreciation: Depreciation costs associated with cryptocurrency and data hosting revenue was approximately 4.5 million
for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to approximately 2.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The
increase related to the capital additions to fixed assets between the second quarter of fiscal year 2023 through the third quarter of
2024. It was noted that Project Marie was discontinued in February of 2023, Project Sophie had sold a majority of its miners in the second
quarter of 2023, and the significant additions of capital expenditures and energization at Project Dorothy, causing an increase in depreciation
costs period over period. As the Company has begun to invest more in capital expenditures, we expect to see depreciation costs to significantly
increase over the next several quarters. 

General
and Administrative Expenses, exclusive of depreciation and amortization: General and administrative expenses, exclusive of depreciation
and amortization include cash and non-cash compensation, benefits and related costs in support of our general corporate operations, including
general management, finance and accounting, human resources, marketing, information technology, corporate development, and legal services. 

General
 and administrative expenses, exclusive of depreciation and amortization increased approximately 3.4 million or 30 for the nine
 months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. General and administrative expenses, exclusive
 of depreciation and amortization were approximately 14.6 million, including approximately 3.3 million of stock compensation expense
 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to approximately 11.2 million, including 3.1 million of stock compensation
 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. This increase was mainly related to employee related expenses, professional fees and
 services, investor relations, expected credit loss provision expense, legal fees, and stock compensation expenses. 

The
 Company had an increase of approximately 1.9 million in wage related expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared
 to nine months ended September 30, 2023 due to an increase in resources and salaries of approximately 710 thousand and in anticipation
 of hitting performance-based targets of approximately 1.1 million. 

Professional
 fees associated to audit and tax increased by approximately 256 thousand for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to
 September 30, 2023 due to additional costs related to subsidiary audits and tax preparation, as well as additional review of complex
 transactions and year-end planning work performed earlier in the year. 

The
 Company took a provision for expected credit loss for approximately 611 thousand for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 due
 to a dispute over a contract rate with a customer and an outstanding note receivable that deemed uncollectible, compared to no provision
 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 

Investor
 relations increased by approximately 151 thousand for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to September 30, 2023 due
 to the Company implementing a series of investor acquisition and influencer marketing programs to attract new investors to Soluna
 Holdings. 

Stock
 based compensation expense increased by 123 thousand due to in the prior year there was an acceleration of grants and awards that
 occurred in May of 2023, compared to the current year, the Company had grants issued in April, June, and September of 2024 therefore
 further increasing the expense compared to prior comparable period. 

Legal
 fees increased by 170 thousand for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023.
 The increase was mainly attributable to project associated legal expenses and compensation plan projects. 

Depreciation
and Amortization associated with general and administrative expenses: Depreciation and amortization expense was comparable for
the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and the nine months ended June, 2023 in which the balances totaled approximately 7.2 million,
respectively. The balances mainly related to amortization expense related to the strategic pipeline contract that was acquired in October
2021. 

Impairment
on Fixed Assets: During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company had impairment charges of approximately 130 thousand.
This charge related to the sale of S19 miners that occurred in April 2024, whereas the Company wrote down the net book value of the miners
to the subsequent sales price. During the nine months ended September 30, 2023, the Company had impairment charges of approximately 418
thousand relating to impairment of approximately 166 thousand in power supply units (PSUs) at their Sophie location, 43 thousand for
M31 miners in which were subsequently sold in April 2023, in which the Company wrote down the net book value to the subsequent sale price,
 169 thousand of S19 miners to adjust to market value and 41 thousand related to miners held for sale. 

Interest
expense: Interest expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was approximately 1.7 million related to approximately
 1.1 million to the NYDIG loan, 480 thousand to compounded interest and deferred financing amortization expense of equipment financing
loan and June and July 2024 secured note financing, and 122 thousand to the Navitas loan. Interest expense for the nine months ended
September 30, 2023 was 2.4 million and related to default and continuing interest expense of the NYDIG loan of approximately 1.1 million,
interest and other charges of approximately 220 thousand for the promissory notes issued in January and February of 2023, and interest
on amortization of warrants for the convertible debt of approximately 475 thousand, as well as default interest charged through March
10, 2023 for the convertible holders of approximately 420 thousand. 

47 

Loss
on Debt Extinguishment and Revaluation, net : For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company had a loss on debt
extinguishment and revaluation of approximately 6.1 million. This was due to on February 28, 2024, the Company entered into the
Fourth Amendment with the Noteholders and lowered the conversion price and issued new warrants and repriced additional warrants with
certain exercise features. The issuance and reprice of warrants created a loss of extinguishment of debt of approximately 5.8
million, in which was offset by a gain on debt revaluation of the convertible debt of approximately 1.3 million as of February 28,
2024 (date of Fourth Amendment) and March 31, 2024 due to several factors including assumptions on conversions and payouts, annual
volatility and stock price conditions on the dates of valuations. In addition, there was a revaluation of the warrant liability, in
which created a gain on revaluation of approximately 1.5 million. The Company did a fair value assessment of the notes as of June
30, 2024, in which created a loss on revaluation of approximately 4.0 million due to factors including assumptions on conversions
and payouts, annual volatility and stock price conditions on the dates of valuations compared to what the noteholders could convert
at as of June 30, 2024. The convertible notes were revalued again on September 30, 2024, in which a gain was recorded of
approximately 2.3 million due mainly to change in Company stock price offsetting the previous quarter assessments. In addition, in
the second quarter of fiscal year 2024, the Company did a revaluation of the warrants through May 30, 2024 in which was the date of
Annual Shareholder approval, in which created a loss on revaluation of approximately 1.6 million. In addition to the revaluation of
the notes and warrants the loss on debt extinguishment had an additional loss on debt of approximately 1.4 million due to the
satisfaction and redemption of the Dorothy 2 equipment loan through issuance of Class B Membership interests in the Dorothy 2
project valued at three times the borrowing amount (i.e., 2.16 million), in which created approximately a 1.4 million loss for the
nine months ended September 30, 2024. The Company notes for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, the Company had a net loss on
debt extinguishment and revaluation of 2.4 million due to the extinguishment and revaluation of the convertible debt agreement in
the second quarter of 2023, as well as quarter end revaluations effected by changes in annual volatility, offset with a gain of 473
thousand in the first quarter of 2023. See Note 7 for further details. 

Loss
on Sale of Fixed Assets: The Company had an immaterial loss on sale of equipment of approximately 21 thousand for the nine months
ended September 30, 2024, in which related to equipment held for sale and in storage. The Company received proceeds on the sale of equipment
of approximately 215 thousand for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, in which the net book value was approximately 236 thousand. 

For
the nine months ended September 30, 2023, the Company had a loss on sale of equipment of approximately 404 thousand in which the majority
of the loss related to the sale of miners for Project Sophie and sale of the remaining Project Marie fixed assets including the Tesseracks.
For Project Sophie, the Company incurred a loss on sale of approximately 29 thousand in which was due to the shift at the site data
hosting services compared to proprietary mining beginning in the second quarter of fiscal 2023, the Company was looking to sell all the
miners at the site. The miners sold at the Sophie site were sold for proceeds of approximately 891 thousand in which had a net book
value of 921 thousand. For Project Marie, the Company sold the Tesseracks and remaining assets for proceeds of 320 thousand in which
included a note receivable of 240 thousand. In addition, the Company incurred a 251 thousand loss on sale of assets in relation to
NYDIG collateral finalization in which the Company had to pay for expenses and legal fees in related to the disposition. thousand. There
was an additional loss of approximately 31 thousand due to sale of M20 and M21 miners. 

Other
expense, net: For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, other expense, net was approximately 32 thousand, respectively,
compared to 301 thousand for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The main reason for the decrease in other expense, net, was that
for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 , there was a 250 thousand expense in relation to an extension fee for the noteholders
of the convertible debt when the 2nd Amendment was signed on May 11, 2023, whereas for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, there
was an extension fee expense of approximately 325 thousand, offset with a gain on settlement of litigation with Atlas of approximately
 254 thousand, in addition to some small additional other income items. 

Income
Tax Benefit: Income tax benefit for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was approximately 1.7 million, compared to approximately
 524 thousand for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The balances were mainly related to deferred tax amortization impact of acquiring
an asset in a transaction that is not a business combination when the amount paid exceeds the tax basis on the acquisition date. As such,
the Company is required to adjust the value of the strategic contract pipeline by approximately 10.9 million at inception date (October
29, 2021), in which was recorded as a deferred tax liability and this amount will be amortized over the life of the asset. For the nine
months ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023, the Company amortized approximately 1.6 million. In addition, for the nine months
ended September 30, 2023, there were timing difference due to significant increase for in-service capital assets for the nine months
ended September 30, 2023 which created an offset of approximately 1.1 million in deferred income tax expense. 

Net
income / (loss) attributable to non-controlling interest: Net income attributable to non-controlling interest for the nine months
ended September 30, 2024 was 3.5 million compared to a net loss of approximately 206 thousand for the nine months ended September 30,
2023. This amount relates to Spring Lane s 85 noncontrolling interest of the net profit in Soluna DVSL and Navitas 45 through
49 noncontrolling interest of the net profit in Soluna DV ComputeCo for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. The change
in non-controlling interest relates to continued profitability at Dorothy 1A and Dorothy 1B, creating a total net profit of approximately
 4.9 million attributable to non-controlling interest for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, which started to grow in the third
quarter of fiscal year 2023. The total net profit was offset by noncontrolling interest loss of 1.4 million associated to Dorothy 2
in which Spring Lane had noncontrolling interest of 58 - 72 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 in which the site is in development
stage and would expect losses. The 206 thousand net loss attributable to non-controlling interest for the nine months ended September
30, 2023 was attributable to a net loss in relation to the Company s DVSL entity for 6 thousand and 200 thousand net loss in
relation to the Company s DV entity. For the first six months of fiscal 2023, DVSL was generating a non-controlling interest net
loss, but with the energization at Dorothy 1A in effect beginning in the second quarter of 2023, the DVSL entity began to generate net
profits, while DV was generating a net loss for the first four months of operations, but with energization beginning in the third quarter
of fiscal 2023, the DV entity began to generate a net profit in non-controlling interest.

Non-GAAP
Measures 

In
addition to financial measures calculated in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles U.S. GAAP ),
we also use Adjusted EBITDA. Adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure defined as net income (loss) from interest,
taxes, depreciation and amortization EBITDA adjusted to eliminate the effects of certain non-cash, non-recurring items,
that we believe do not reflect our ongoing strategic business operations. Management believes that Adjusted EBITDA results in a performance
measurement that represents a key indicator of the Company s business operations of cryptocurrency mining and hosting customers
engaged in cryptocurrency mining. 

We
believe Adjusted EBITDA can be an important financial measure because it allows management, investors, and the Board to evaluate and
compare our operating results, including our return on capital and operating efficiencies, from period-to-period by making such adjustments.
Non-GAAP financial measures are subject to material limitations as they are not in accordance with, or a substitute for, measurements
prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. For example, we expect that stock-based compensation costs, which is excluded from the non-GAAP
financial measures, will continue to be a significant recurring expense over the coming years and is an important part of the compensation
provided to certain employees, officers, and directors. Similarly, we expect that depreciation and amortization of fixed assets will
continue to be a recurring expense over the term of the useful life of the assets. 

Adjusted
EBITDA is provided in addition to and should not be considered to be a substitute for, or superior to net income, the comparable measure
calculated in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Further, Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered as an alternative to revenue growth, net income,
or any other performance measure calculated in accordance with GAAP, or as an alternative to cash flow from operating activities as a
measure of our liquidity. Adjusted EBITDA has limitations as an analytical tool, and you should not consider such measures either in
isolation or as substitutes for analyzing our results as reported under GAAP. 

Reconciliations
of Adjusted EBITDA to net loss, the most comparable GAAP financial metric, for historical periods are presented in the table below:

The
Company had a consolidated accumulated deficit of approximately 274.3 million as September 30, 2024. As of September 30, 2024, the Company
had negative working capital of approximately 12.8 million, 3.1 million outstanding principal in notes payable that may be converted
to common stock, a subsidiary of the Company that defaulted on equipment financing and has a current outstanding loan of 9.2 million,
a 3-year secured loan financing of approximately 13.75 million, , and a 2-year 2.05 million principal loan commitment to Navitas, in
which as of September 30, 2024 has an outstanding principal balance of approximately 290 thousand. The Company had outstanding commitments
as of September 30, 2024, related to SDI of 13.0 million in capital expenditures related to Project Dorothy 2 and 21.3 million related
to CloudCo with HPE, and approximately 8.8 million of cash available to fund its operations. 

Based
on business developments, including changes in production levels, staffing requirements, and network infrastructure improvements, we
will require additional capital equipment in the foreseeable future. The Company is focused on developing and monetizing green, zero-carbon
computing and cryptocurrency mining facilities, as well as facilities capable of hosting customers engaged in cryptocurrency mining,
and data centers to provide specialized AI Cloud and colocation services. 

We
plan to continue funding operations from our current cash position and our projected 2024 cash flows pursuant to management s plans.
If necessary, we may also seek to supplement our resources by increasing credit facilities to fund operational working capital and capital
expenditure requirements. We expect to fund growth, including additional development and buildouts of data centers and its AI initiative
through project-level capital raising and equity sale activities, to the extent that we can successfully raise capital through sales
of additional debt or equity securities, as well as a variety of project specific funding options. Any additional financing, if required,
may not be available to us on acceptable terms or not at all. On August 12, 2024, the Company entered into a SEPA with in which YA has
agreed to purchase up to 25 million in aggregate gross purchase price of newly issued fully paid shares of the Company s common
stock from time to time subject to the limits and the conditions of the SEPA. On October 1, 2024, the Company obtained the necessary
consents from other parties to access the SEPA. The Company expects to draw down partially on the 25 million during fourth quarter of
2024. 

As
shown in the accompanying financial statements, the Company did not generate sufficient revenue to generate net income and has negative
working capital as of September 30, 2024. These factors, among others, indicate that there is substantial doubt about the Company s
ability to continue as a going concern within one year after issuance of the condensed financial statements as of September 30, 2024,
or November 14, 2024. 

Further,
various macroeconomic factors could adversely affect our business and the results of our operations and financial condition, including
changes in inflation, interest rates and overall economic conditions. For instance, inflation could negatively impact the Company by
increasing our labor costs, through higher wages and higher interest rates. If inflation or other factors were to significantly increase
our business costs, our ability to develop our current projects may be negatively affected. Interest rates, the liquidity of the credit
markets and the volatility of the capital markets could also affect the operation of our business and our ability to raise capital in
order to fund our operations. If our revenue estimates are off either in timing or amount, or if cash generated from operations is insufficient
to satisfy the operational working capital and capital expenditure requirements, the Company plans to implement additional steps to ensure
liquidity including, but not limited to, the deferral of planned capital spending and/or delaying existing or pending product development
initiatives; alternatively, the Company may be required to obtain credit facilities or other loans, if available, to fund these initiatives.
However, the Company is actively monitoring this situation and the possible effects on our financial condition, liquidity, operations,
suppliers, and the industry.

of 10.3 million for principal and interest and penalties. On January 12, 2024, Soluna filed its objection to NYDIG s motion for
summary judgment on the grounds that NYDIG failed to explain what collateral of which loan was sold and how the sale proceeds were allocated
to each loan. A summary judgment motion was performed on February 13, 2024 and was agreed upon by both NYDIG and the Borrower, that the
total outstanding loan principal balance would be approximately 9.2 million, in which a penalty fee was applied of approximately 1.0
million to the repossessed collateralized assets, and outstanding interest and penalty balance would be approximately 936 thousand as
of December 31, 2023. As of September 30, 2024, the Company still has an outstanding loan principal of approximately 9.2 million and

 1,250,000 to new accredited investors. These Additional Notes are subject to the same terms and conditions as the June SPA financing. 

Critical
Accounting Policies and Significant Judgments and Estimates 

The
above discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements,
which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Note 2, Accounting
Policies, to the consolidated financial statements in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 includes a
summary of our most significant accounting policies. There have been no material changes to the critical accounting policies previously
disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. The preparation of these condensed consolidated financial
statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, expenses,
and related disclosure of assets and liabilities. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates and judgments, including those related
to revenue recognition, income taxes, fair value measurements, and stock-based compensation. We base our estimates on historical experience
and on various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments
about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from
these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. Periodically, our management reviews our critical accounting estimates with
the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors.

Factors
Expected to Affect Our Future Results 

Revenue
Sources: 

Our
revenue streams consist of several components: 

1.
 Hosting Revenues: We provide electrical power and network connectivity to cryptocurrency mining customers, who pay a specified
amount and rate for these services. In the first quarter of 2024, we have entered in a co-location agreement with a GPU startup delivering
specialized GPU services for AI computing. 

2.
 Block Rewards in Bitcoin : These are fixed rewards programmed into the Bitcoin software and awarded to miners for solving cryptographic
problems and creating new blocks on the blockchain. 

3.
 Participation in Demand Response Programs: We also generate revenue by participating in demand response programs. 

Market
Price of Bitcoin 

Changes
in the market value of Bitcoin directly impact our revenues. For example, in 2021 and 2022, the average Bitcoin price was 47,432 and
 28,298, respectively. By December 31, 2023, the price of Bitcoin had reached a high of 44,146. For the three and nine months ended
September 30, 2024, the price of Bitcoin had reached a high of 69,349 and 73,083, and the average price of Bitcoin for the three and
nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 61,032 and 60,100. 

Halving 

Halving
events occur periodically in the Bitcoin network, reducing block rewards. The reduction is designed to occur irrespective of ongoing
demand. While halving can impact our revenues negatively by reducing the rewards for mining, it will continue until the total Bitcoin
rewards issued reach approximately 21 million, expected around 2140. For fiscal year 2023 and through April 19, 2024, the block rewards
were fixed at 6.25 Bitcoin per block, and on April 19, 2024 Bitcoin halved again to 3.125. 

Network
Hash Rate and Difficulty 

A
miner s chance of earning Bitcoin rewards depends on their hash rate relative to the global network hash rate. As demand for Bitcoin
increases, the global network hash rate rises rapidly, leading to higher network difficulty. This adjustment ensures a ten-minute block
validation time, making the network more secure but requiring more computing power to earn rewards. Failure to keep pace with industry
trends in deploying additional hash rate can decrease a miner s share of the global network hash rate and, consequently, their
chance of earning rewards.

Item
 4. 
 Controls
 and Procedures 

The
certifications of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officers are attached as Exhibits 31.1 and 31.2 to this Quarterly Report
on Form 10-Q include, in paragraph 4 of such certification, information concerning our disclosure controls and procedures and internal
control over financial reporting. Such certification should be read in conjunction with the information contained in this Item 4 for
a more complete understanding of the matters covered by such certification. 

(a)
Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

Our
management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer, evaluated the effectiveness of SHI s
disclosure controls and procedures as of September 30, 2024. The term disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in
Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act, means controls and other procedures of a company that are designed to ensure that
information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed,
summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission s (the SEC rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information
required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated
to the company s management, including its principal executive and principal financial officers, as appropriate to allow timely
decisions regarding required disclosure. We recognize that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can
provide only reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives and we necessarily apply our judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit
relationship of possible controls and procedures. Based on the evaluation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of September 30,
2024, our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer concluded that, as of such date, our disclosure controls and procedures
were effective at the reasonable assurance level. 

(b)
Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 

There
have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under
the Exchange Act, during our fiscal quarter ended September 30, 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially
affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 

55 

PART
II. OTHER INFORMATION 

Item 1. 
 Legal Proceedings 

At
any point in time, we may be involved in various lawsuits or other legal proceedings. Such lawsuits could arise from the sale of products
or services or from other matters relating to our regular business activities, compliance with various governmental regulations and requirements,
or other transactions or circumstances. 

EPA 

We
have been named as a party in the December 19, 2019 United States Environmental Protection Agency EPA Demand Letter regarding
the Malta Rocket Fuel Area Superfund Site Site located in Malta and Stillwater, New York, in connection with an alleged
release of hazardous materials into the environment. The EPA is seeking reimbursement of response costs from all named parties in the
amount of approximately 358 thousand plus interest in connection with the investigation and disposal activities associated with the
various drum caches discovered at the Site, issuance of the Explanation of Significant Differences ESD of the Site, and
implementation of the work contemplated by the ESD. We consider the likelihood of a material adverse outcome with respect to this matter
to be remote and do not currently anticipate that any expense or liability that we may incur as a result of this matter in the future
will be material to the Company s business or financial condition. 

NYDIG 

NYDIG
ABL LLC, NYDIG filed a complaint against SMCB1( Borrower and SMC Guarantor , and together
with Borrower, NYDIG Defendants in Marshall Circuit Court of the Commonwealth of Kentucky on December 29, 2022 regarding
a series of loans (the NYDIG Loans made by NYDIG to Borrower pursuant to a Master Equipment Finance Agreement MEFA that were secured by certain assets of Borrower and guaranteed by Guarantor pursuant to a written guaranty agreement executed by Guarantor.
On February 15, 2023, the Court approved an agreed order granting NYDIG s motion for writ of possession which, among other things,
ordered the NYDIG Defendants to provide NYDIG access to the collateral securing the NYDIG Loans and preserved the rights of NYDIG to
pursue a deficiency judgment against the NYDIG Defendants. Also on February 15, 2023, the NYDIG Defendants filed their answer and affirmative
defenses in this proceeding. On February 23, 2023, NYDIG proceeded to foreclose on all of the collateral securing the MEFA, and repossessed
the collateralized assets that totaled approximately 3.4 million, of which approximately 560 thousand was first used to pay off accrued
interest and penalties to date. On September 5, 2023, NYDIG provided a letter finalizing the accounting for the repossessed collateralized
assets totaling proceeds of approximately 3.4 million. This included legal and other expenses associated with the sale of the assets,
net a modest gain on the estimated net book value of the assets totaling 251 thousand that was expensed as a loss on disposition of
assets for the year ended December 31, 2023. On December 7, 2023, NYDIG filed its Motion for Summary Judgment seeking entry of a judgment
against the NYDIG Defendants in the approximate amount of 10.3 million for principal and interest and penalties. On January 12, 2024,
the NYDIG Defendants filed their objection to NYDIG s motion for summary judgment on the grounds that NYDIG failed to explain what
collateral of which loan was sold and how the sale proceeds were allocated and applied to each loan. NYDIG and the NYDIG Defendants consensually
resolved the motion in the form of a Stipulation and Agreed Judgment, which the Court approved on February 23, 2024. 

On
March 13, 2024, NYDIG served the NYDIG Defendants with a post-judgment discovery seeking information regarding the NYDIG Defendants 
assets and liabilities. Per agreement between NYDIG and the NYDIG Defendants, the deadline to respond to the discovery demands was extended
to May 13, 2024 but with rolling weekly production that commenced on April 12, 2024. The NYDIG Defendants completed responding to NYDIG s
initial document requests on May 13, 2024. On September 24, 2024, NYDIG sent a letter seeking supplemental discovery from the NYDIG Defendants. The NYDIG Defendants
responded seeking clarification from NYDIG regarding their supplemental requests. On November 6, 2024, NYDIG sent a second meet
and confer letter seeking (i) the production of additional/supplemental documents from Soluna by November 20, 2024 and (ii) the
deposition of a representative of the Defendants on or before December 15, 2024. The parties remain in discussions regarding the
requested supplemental discovery. 

Additionally,
NYDIG has stated its intention to pursue SCI, the parent company of Guarantor, under a piercing of the corporate veil theory relating
to NYDIG Defendants debts and liabilities under the loan documents. The Company intends to vigorously defend itself from NYDIG s
parent company claims. SCI denies any such liability and has filed a complaint for a declaratory judgment against NYDIG in the Eighth
Judicial District Court in Clark County, Nevada on March 16, 2023, seeking a declaratory judgment as to such matter. NYDIG filed a motion
to dismiss in response to SCI s declaratory judgment complaint on April 13, 2023. SCI filed a response in opposition to NYDIG s
motion to dismiss on April 27, 2023. The court heard oral arguments on May 16, 2023. On June 22, 2023, the court issued an order granting
NYDIG s motion to dismiss, on the basis that the case was not ripe for decision, without prejudice. SCI intends to continue to
vigorously defend any allegations regarding liability on account of NYDIG Defendants debts and liabilities to NYDIG under their
loan documents and intends to refile a declaratory judgment complaint against NYDIG. 

Atlas 

In
September 2023, Atlas Technology Group LLC Atlas filed a complaint against Soluna MC LLC, Soluna Computing, Inc., and
Soluna Holdings, Inc. (collectively, the Atlas Defendants in the Supreme Court of New York regarding a co-location services
agreement. Atlas alleged that Soluna MC s termination of the agreement was a breach, seeking a return of pre-paid fees of approximately
 464 thousand, additional damages of at least 7.9 million, and reimbursement of legal fees. The complaint also mentioned alter ego liability
and corporate veil piercing. 

56 

The
Atlas Defendants filed a motion to dismiss, and on April 17, 2024, the Court dismissed three of the four counts. The remaining count
was answered on May 6, 2024, with counterclaims against Atlas. The Court denied the dismissal of Soluna Computing, Inc. and Soluna Holdings,
Inc. as parties, leading to an appeal filed on May 7, 2024. 

On
June 25, 2024, Atlas and the Atlas Defendants entered into a settlement agreement. 

Item
 1A. 
 Risk
 Factors 

Part
II, Item 1A (Risk Factors) of our most recently filed Annual Report on Form 10-K with the SEC, filed on April 1, 2024, sets forth information
relating to important risks and uncertainties that could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating
results. Except as to the risk factors set forth below and to the extent that information disclosed elsewhere in this Quarterly Report
on Form 10-Q relates to such risk factors (including, without limitation, the matters described in Part I, Item 2 (Management s
Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Statement Concerning Forward Looking Statements), there
have been no material changes to our risk factors disclosed in our most recently filed Annual Report on Form 10-K. Those risk factors
continue to be relevant to an understanding of our business, financial condition and operating results, however, and accordingly, you
should review and consider such risk factors in making any investment decision with respect to our securities. 

We
have a Limited History in the Cloud Service and Artificial Intelligence Business 

We
are implementing a strategy to move into the cloud service business to provide green energy to power-intensive artificial intelligence
applications. This is a new business for the Company and no history of operations in this industry from which to evaluate our future
operating performance in this segment. Our ability to implement this strategy is dependent upon successfully deploy new supercomputers
in conjunction with our strategic partner and to attract and retain customers in a very competitive market. 

Risks Related to the Standby Equity Purchase Agreement and Market Driven
Evaluation 

Substantial blocks of our
Common Stock may be sold into the market as a result of our being party to the SEPA. 

On August 12, 2024, we entered
into a Standby Equity Purchase Agreement (the SEPA with YA II PN, LTD YA )., whereas we agreed to issue and
sell to YA, from time to time, and YA agreed to purchase from us, up to 25 million of our shares of Common Stock. For more information
regarding the terms and potential impacts of the SEPA, please refer to the Registration Statement on Form S-1 filed with the Securities
and Exchange Commission on October 9, 2024 (File No. 333-282559). 

Pursuant to the SEPA, the price
of our Common Stock could decline if there are substantial sales of shares of our Common Stock, if there is a large number of shares of
our Common Stock available for sale, or if there is the perception that these sales could occur. Any issuances of shares of our Common
Stock in any issuance will dilute the percentage ownership of stockholders and may dilute the per share projected earnings (if any) or
book value of our Common Stock. Sales of a substantial number of shares of our Common Stock in the public market or other issuances of
shares of our Common Stock to decline and may make it more difficult for you to sell your shares at a time and price that you deem appropriate. 

You may experience immediate
and substantial dilution (or improvement) in the net tangible book value per share of our Common Stock. 

The offering price per share of our Common Stock in
connection with the SEPA may or may not exceed the net tangible book value per share of our Common Stock outstanding prior to the SEPA.
For example, assuming that an aggregate of between 5,000,000 and 10,000,000 shares of our Common Stock are sold pursuant to the SEPA at
an assumed price of between 5.00 and 2.50 per share, respectively, for net proceeds of 25,000,000, you would experience accretion of
 0.67/share or dilution of 0.37/share, respectively (calculated based on current share count) per share, representing the difference
between our adjusted net tangible book value per share after giving effect to the SEPA and the assumed offering price. 

Under the SEPA, we do not
have the right to control the timing and amount sales of our shares of Common Stock by YA. 

Sales of our Common Stock, if
any, to YA under the SEPA will depend upon market conditions and other factors, and the discretion of YA. We may ultimately issue to YA
all, some, or none of the shares of our Common Stock. 

Because the price for the shares
will fluctuate based on the market prices of our Common Stock, it is not possible for us to predict, as of the date of this report and
prior to any issuance of shares under the SEPA, the number of shares that we will issue to YA under the SEPA, and it is possible that
the number of shares could be higher than the number of shares registered for resale by YA. In addition, unless we obtain stockholder
approval, we will not be able to issue shares in excess of the Exchange Cap under the SEPA (or any other transaction that is integrated
with the SEPA) in accordance with applicable Nasdaq rules. Further, the resale by YA of a significant amount of shares registered in this
offering at any given time, or the perception that these sales may occur, could cause the market price of our Common Stock to decline
and to be highly volatile. 

Item
 2. 
 Unregistered
 Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds 

In
connection with the SEPA, and the other Selling Holders, the Company issued shares of common stock which were exempt from registration
pursuant to Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. Northland Securities Inc. receives a brokerage commission of 6 
of funds raised under the SEPA.
