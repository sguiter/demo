Table of Contents CHASE GENERAL CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARY PART I financial INFORMATION item 2. management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
 OVERVIEW Chase General Corporation (Chase) is a holding company for its wholly-owned subsidiary, Dye Candy Company. This subsidiary is the main operating company that is engaged in the manufacture of confectionery products which are sold primarily to wholesale houses, grocery accounts, vendors, and repackers. The subsidiary (Company) operates two divisions, Chase Candy division and Seasonal Candy division, which share a common labor force and utilize the same basic equipment and raw materials. Therefore, segment reporting for the two divisions is not maintained by management. The Company s business, like that of many other confectionary product manufacturers, is seasonal. Historically, the Company has realized more of its revenue and earnings in the second fiscal quarter, which includes the majority of the holiday shopping season, than in any other fiscal quarter. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS - Three Months Ended September 30, 2024 Compared to Three Months Ended September 30, 2023 The following management comments regarding Chase s results of operations and outlook should be read in conjunction with the condensed consolidated financial statements included pursuant to Item 1 of the quarterly report. The following table sets forth certain items as a percentage of sales for the periods presented: 

Three Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 Sales 100 100 Cost of Sales 71 72 Gross Profit on Sales 29 28 Operating Expenses 30 27 Income (Loss) from Operations (2) 1 Other Expense, Net (1) Income (Loss) before Income Taxes (3) 1 Income Tax Benefit (Provision) 1 (1) Net Loss (2) (0) SALES Sales decreased 121,778 or 11 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 to 989,021 compared to 1,110,799 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. Sales for Chase Candy decreased 66,067 to 319,080 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 385,147 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. Sales for Seasonal Candy decreased 55,711 to 669,941 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 725,652 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The 17 decrease in sales of Chase Candy of 66,067 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 over the same period ended September 30, 2023, is primarily due to the effect of the following: 1) decreased net sales of approximately 21,000 for the Mini Mash L278/L212 segments due to a decrease in orders to existing customers; 2) decreased sales of the L276 Cherry Mash Distributors Pack segment by approximately 15,000 versus the same period a year ago primarily due to decreased orders from existing customers; 3) decreased sales of the L279/L299 Bulk Mini Mash segment by approximately 5,000 versus the same period a year ago primarily due to decreased orders from existing customers; and 4) decreased net sales of the L100/L200 Cherry Mash Merchandisers segment by approximately 25,000 due to an decrease in orders to existing customers.

 SALES (cont.) The 8 decrease in sales of Seasonal Candy of 55,711 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 over the same period ended September 30, 2023, is primarily due to the effect of the following: 1) decreased sales in the bulk seasonal division by approximately 5,000 versus the same period a year ago, primarily due to decreased sales to existing customers; and 2) decreased sales to existing customers in the clamshell division by approximately 50,000. Management intends to implement a price increase for this category during 2025. Despite the overall decrease in quantities sold for both divisions, the Company was able to implement a price increase in March 2024 of approximately 14 for the majority of the customers for Chase Candy products and in July 2024 of approximately 14 for the bulk and clamshell products. Both price increases have contributed to a slight increase in margins for the three months ended September 30, 2024. Due to the seasonal nature of the Company s business and the fact that the Company s largest customer continues to have price increases at lower negotiated rates, the majority of these price increases will continue to be more fully realized during the second quarter of fiscal year 2025. COST OF SALES Cost of sales decreased 92,942 to 704,078 or 71 of sales for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 797,020 or 72 of sales for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The slight decrease in cost of sales as a percentage of sales is related to decreases in raw material quantities ordered, lower prices and labor efficiencies. Due to volatility in the regions where these raw materials are grown, management anticipates the prices of these raw materials to continue to fluctuate primarily based on supply and demand. SELLING EXPENSES Selling expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2024 decreased 3,591 to 96,791, which is 10 of sales, compared to 100,382, or 9 of sales for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease of 3,591 in selling expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2024 is primarily due to a decrease in commission expense of approximately 4,500 over the same period ended September 30, 2023, primarily due to decreased sales. This decrease was offset by increases totaling 1,000 in other miscellaneous selling expenses. . GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES General and administrative expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2024 increased 5,033 to 204,128 and 21 of sales, compared to 199,096 or 18 of sales for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase of 5,033 in general and administrative expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2024 is primarily due to an increase in dues and subscriptions of approximately 8,500, an increase in insurance expense of 4,000, and approximately 3,000 of increases in other miscellaneous general and administrative expenses. The increase in dues and subscriptions is related to a subscription fee charge from one of the Company s largest customers that began during the second quarter of 2023. These increases were offset by decreases in professional fees of approximately 9,000 for the period ended September 30, 2024.

 OTHER INCOME (EXPENSE) Other expense increased by 130 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 to 7,246), compared to 7,116) for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The majority of this change can be attributed to an increase in interest expense. BENEFIT (PROVISION) FOR INCOME TAXES Due to the net loss for the quarter ending September 30, 2024, the Company recorded an income tax benefit of approximately 5,600. The Company recorded a (7,744) income tax provision for the three months ended September 30, 2023 primarily due to the Company recognizing a return to provision adjustment related to the recognition of a net deferred tax liability as well as federal and state income tax payable accounts. NET LOSS The Company reported a net loss for the three months ended September 30, 2024 of (17,613), compared to net loss of (559) for the three months ended September 30, 2023. This decrease of 17,054 is explained above. PREFERRED DIVIDENDS Preferred dividends were 32,018 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023, which reflects additional preferred stock dividends in arrears on the Company s Series A and Series B 5 par value preferred stock and its Series A and Series B 20 par value preferred stock. NET LOSS APPLICABLE TO COMMON STOCKHOLDERS Net loss applicable to common stockholders for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was (49,631) which is a decrease of 17,054 as compared to net loss applicable to common stockholders for the three months ended September 30, 2023 of (32,577).

 LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES (cont.) In order to maintain funds to finance operations and meet debt obligations, it is the intention of management to continue its efforts to expand the present market area and increase sales to its customers. Management also intends to continue tight control on all expenditures. Due to volatility in the regions where these raw materials are grown, management anticipates the prices of these raw materials to continue to fluctuate primarily based on supply and demand. Management intends to make sales price adjustments in the future to correspond with changes in raw material prices. Management believes that the projected cash flow from operations combined with the Company s ability to generate positive working capital will be sufficient to meet its funding requirements for the foreseeable future. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES Forward-Looking Information This report, as well as our other reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), contains forward-looking statements made pursuant to the safe harbor provisions of The Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. The words believe, estimate, anticipate, project, intend, expect, plan, outlook, forecast, may, will, should, continue, predict, and similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements. This report contains forward-looking statements regarding, among other topics, our expected financial position, results of operations, cash flows, strategy, and management s plans and objectives. Accordingly, these forward-looking statements are based on assumptions about a number of important factors. While we believe that our assumptions about such factors are reasonable, such factors involve risks, and uncertainties that could cause actual results to be different from what appear here. These risk factors include: the ability to adequately pass through customers unanticipated future increases in raw material costs, decreased demand for products, expected orders that do not occur, loss of key customers, the impact of competition and price erosion as well as supply and manufacturing constraints, and other risks and uncertainties. In light of these risks and uncertainties, there can be no assurance that the forward-looking information contained in this report will prove accurate, and our actual results may differ materially from these forward-looking statements. We assume no obligation to update any forward-looking statements made herein.

 ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK Not applicable to a smaller reporting company. ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES (a) Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 Chase s management, with the participation of the Chief Executive Officer, has evaluated the effectiveness of Chase s disclosure controls and procedures, as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act), as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based on such evaluation, such officer has concluded that the Company s disclosure controls and procedures are not effective as a result of a weakness in the design of internal control over financial reporting identified below. Disclosure controls and procedures include controls and procedures designed to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed in periodic filings under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to Management, including those officers, and to members of the board of directors, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. A material weakness was identified in our internal control over financial reporting due to a lack of accounting personnel with the appropriate level of knowledge, experience and training to perform an assessment of its internal controls. This has also resulted in a failure to maintain appropriate segregation of duties over system access. Management believes that this material weakness did not have an adverse effect on the Company s financial results reported herein. (b) Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 There were no significant changes in Chase s internal control over financial reporting or in other factors that management s estimates are reasonably likely to materially affect Chase s internal control over financial reporting subsequent to the date of evaluation.
