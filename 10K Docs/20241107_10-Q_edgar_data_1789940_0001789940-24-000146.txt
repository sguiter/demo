 FWR Holding Corporation FWR ), a subsidiary of the Company, is the borrower under the credit agreement dated October 6, 2021 Credit Agreement ), which provided for (i) a million term loan A facility (the Term Facility and (ii) a million revolving credit facility (the Revolving Credit Facility and, together with the Term Facility, collectively, the Credit Facility ). 
 On February 24, 2023, the Company entered into Amendment No. 1 to the Credit Agreement to replace the London interbank offer rate LIBOR with a secured overnight financing rate SOFR pursuant to the terms and LIBOR fallback language in the Credit Agreement. All outstanding borrowings under the Credit Agreement continued to bear interest at LIBOR until March 27, 2023. 
 On January 5, 2024, the Company entered into Amendment No. 2 to the Credit Agreement (the Second Amendment with terms substantially identical to the Credit Agreement to (i) replace the million Term Facility with a new million term loan A facility (the New Term Facility ), (ii) replace the million Revolving Credit Facility with a new million revolving credit facility (the New Revolving Credit Facility ), (iii) increase the New Revolving Credit Facility by million, bringing the aggregate committed amount under the New Revolving Credit Facility to million and (iv) add a new million incremental delayed draw term loan facility (the New Delayed Draw Term Facility ). The New Delayed Draw Term Facility is available to FWR for a period of months from the date of the Second Amendment and the proceeds may be used to fund permitted acquisitions and new restaurant capital expenditures, repay revolving loans and/or replenish balance sheet cash, in each case, used for such permitted acquisitions or capital expenditures. 
 Loans drawn under the New Delayed Draw Term Facility will amortize in equal quarterly installments at the same amortization rate per annum as then applicable to loans under the New Term Facility. The New Term Facility, the New Revolving Credit Facility and the New Delayed Draw Term Facility mature on January 5, 2029. 
 On April 12, 2024, the Company drew million of the million New Delayed Draw Term Facility. The proceeds were used to repay million of borrowings under the New Revolving Credit Facility and fund the franchise acquisition on April 15, 2024 that was completed for approximately million. 
 As of September 29, 2024, borrowings under the Credit Facility, as amended, bear interest at the option of FWR at either (i) the alternate base rate plus a margin of between and basis points depending on the total rent adjusted net leverage ratio of FWR and its restricted subsidiaries on a consolidated basis (the Total Rent Adjusted Net Leverage Ratio or (ii) SOFR plus a credit spread adjustment of basis points plus a margin of between and basis points depending on the Total Rent Adjusted Net Leverage Ratio.

 variable-to-fixed interest rate swaps. These interest rate swaps have an aggregate notional amount of million and mature on October 6, 2026. Under the terms of the interest rate swaps, the Company will pay a weighted average fixed rate of on the notional amount and will receive payments from the counterparties based on the three-month SOFR rate. 
 On May 17, 2024, the Company entered into additional variable-to-fixed interest rate swaps. These interest rate swaps have an aggregate notional amount of million and mature on June 30, 2027. Under the terms of the interest rate swaps, the Company will pay a weighted average fixed rate of on the notional amount and will receive payments from the counterparties based on the three-month SOFR rate. 
 The fair value measurement of the interest rate swaps was based on the contractual terms and used observable market-based inputs. The interest rate swaps were valued using a discounted cash flow analysis on the expected cash flows using observable inputs including interest rate curves and credit spreads. Although the majority of the inputs used to value the instruments fall within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy, the credit valuation adjustments utilized Level 3 inputs, such as estimates of current credit spreads to evaluate the likelihood of default by the Company and the counterparties. The Company has determined that the impact of the credit valuation adjustments was not significant to the overall valuation. As a result, the derivative was classified as Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy. 
 Amounts reported in Other comprehensive income related to the interest rate swaps will be reclassified to interest expense as interest payments are made on the Company s variable-rate debt. During the thirteen and thirty-nine weeks ended September 29, 2024, a total of million and million, respectively, was reclassified from Other comprehensive income (loss) as a reduction to Interest expense. Over the next 12 months, the Company estimates that million will be reclassified as an increase to interest expense.

 The effective income tax rates for the thirteen and thirty-nine weeks ended September 29, 2024 and September 24, 2023 were different than the blended federal and state statutory rate primarily due to (i) the change in the valuation allowance, (ii) the benefit of tax credits for FICA taxes on certain employees tips, (iii) the impacts of executive stock-based compensation and (iv) non-deductible costs associated with the Secondary Offerings. 
 Valuation allowance 
 Management evaluates quarterly whether the resulting deferred tax assets are realizable given the Company s earnings history. Based on the available evidence, the Company does not meet the more likely than not standard related to the realization of a portion of the deferred tax assets as of September 29, 2024. Accordingly, the Company has established a valuation allowance on the portion of deferred tax assets deemed not realizable, including state charitable contribution carryovers, various state loss carryforwards and various federal tax credit carryforwards. 
 Management continues to assess the rationale for recording a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets. As the Company s future taxable earnings increase and deferred tax assets are utilized, it is possible that a portion of the valuation allowance will no longer be needed. Release of any valuation allowance would result in the recognition of certain deferred tax assets and a decrease to income tax expense in the period of the release. The timing and amount of any release related to future taxable income is currently indeterminable. 
 Contingent consideration liability 
 Certain federal loss carryforwards, state loss carryforwards and general business credits were accumulated from operations prior to the August 2017 merger through which the Company became majority owned by Advent. Under the terms of an agreement with the previous stockholders, to the extent that these credits and carryforwards were utilized to reduce taxes payable, the Company was required to pay the previous stockholders an amount equal to tax savings. In accordance with the agreement, an initial contingent consideration liability of million was recognized and adjusted periodically for estimated future use and the actual distributions to previous stockholders. By agreement the obligation would lapse following a change in control event. 
 During the first quarter of 2024, Advent sold common stock of the Company through a secondary public offering. As a result, Advent no longer controlled a majority of the Company s issued and outstanding shares of common stock. Advent s first quarter sale, therefore, represents a change of control event as defined in the agreement. Given this change in control event, the remaining million of the contingent consideration liability was released through Transaction expenses, net. Final payment to previous stockholders was made in the second quarter of 2024. 
 
 12. 
 million in General and administrative expenses for this matter. In the second quarter of 2024, the Company paid million to the State of Delaware to resolve escheat matters related to unclaimed gift card balances. The Company believes any additional payments to the State of Delaware to resolve the remaining escheat matters will not be significant.

 Business Trends 
 
 As reported by Blackbox Financial Intelligence, the casual dining segment for US restaurants experienced another quarter of negative same-restaurant sales growth continuing a sustained business trend commencing prior to 2024. The Company s same-restaurant sales growth was negative 1.9 for the third quarter, following quarters one and two when our same-restaurant sales growth was positive 0.5 and negative 0.3 , respectively. 
 
 Commodity inflation was 3.4 in the third quarter. Management expects full year commodity inflation of approximately 3.0 . 
 
 Restaurant-level wage inflation during the third quarter was 3.8 and full year inflation is expected to be approximately 5.0 . 
 
 Key Performance Indicators 
 
 Throughout Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, we commonly discuss the following key operating metrics that we believe will drive our financial results and long-term growth model. We believe these metrics are useful to investors because management uses these metrics to evaluate performance and assess the growth of our business as well as the effectiveness of our marketing and operational strategies. 
 
 New Restaurant Openings NROs ): the number of new company-owned First Watch restaurants commencing operations during the period. Management reviews the number of new restaurants to assess new restaurant growth and company-owned restaurant sales. 
 
 Franchise-owned New Restaurant Openings Franchise-owned NROs ): the number of new franchise-owned First Watch restaurants commencing operations during the period. 
 
 Same-Restaurant Sales Growth : the percentage change in year-over-year restaurant sales (excluding gift card breakage) for the comparable restaurant base, which we define as the number of company-owned First Watch branded restaurants open for 18 months or longer as of the beginning of the fiscal year Comparable Restaurant Base ). For the third quarter of 2024, this operating metric compares the thirteen and thirty-nine-week periods ended September 29, 2024 with the thirteen and thirty-nine-week periods ended October 1, 2023, versus the thirteen and thirty-nine-week periods ended September 24, 2023, in order to compare like-for-like periods. For the thirteen and thirty-nine weeks ended September 29, 2024 and October 1, 2023, there were 344 restaurants and 327 restaurants, respectively, in our Comparable Restaurant Base. Measuring our same-restaurant sales growth allows management to evaluate the performance of our existing restaurant base. We believe this measure is useful for investors to provide a consistent comparison of restaurant sales results and trends across periods within our core, established restaurant base, unaffected by results of store openings, closings, and other transitional changes. 
 
 Same-Restaurant Traffic Growth : the percentage change in traffic counts for the thirteen and thirty-nine-week periods ended September 29, 2024 as compared to the thirteen and thirty-nine-week periods ended October 1, 2023 using the Comparable Restaurant Base, in order to compare like-for-like periods. Measuring our same-restaurant traffic growth allows management to evaluate the performance of our existing restaurant base. We believe this measure is useful for investors because an increase in same-restaurant traffic provides an indicator as to the development of our brand and the effectiveness of our marketing strategy. 
 
 System-wide restaurants : the total number of restaurants, including all company-owned and franchise-owned restaurants. 
 
 System-wide sales : consists of restaurant sales from our company-owned restaurants and franchise-owned restaurants. We do not recognize the restaurant sales from our franchise-owned restaurants as revenue.

 Non-GAAP Financial Measures 
 
 To supplement the consolidated financial statements, which are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America GAAP ), we use the following non-GAAP measures, which present operating results on an adjusted basis: (i) Adjusted EBITDA, (ii) Adjusted EBITDA margin, (iii) Restaurant level operating profit and (iv) Restaurant level operating profit margin. Our presentation of these non-GAAP measures includes isolating the effects of some items that are either nonrecurring in nature or vary from period to period without any correlation to our ongoing core operating performance. These supplemental measures of performance are not required by or presented in accordance with GAAP. Management believes these non-GAAP measures provide investors with additional visibility into our operations, facilitate analysis and comparisons of our ongoing business operations because they exclude items that may not be indicative of our ongoing operating performance, help to identify operational trends and allow for greater transparency with respect to key metrics used by management in our financial and operational decision making. Our non-GAAP measures may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies and have important limitations as analytical tools. These non-GAAP measures should not be considered in isolation or as substitutes for analysis of our results as reported under GAAP as they may not provide a complete understanding of our performance. These non-GAAP measures should be reviewed in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP. 
 
 We use Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin (i) as factors in evaluating management s performance when determining incentive compensation, (ii) to evaluate our operating results and the effectiveness of our business strategies and (iii) internally as benchmarks to compare our performance to that of our competitors. 
 
 We use Restaurant level operating profit and Restaurant level operating profit margin (i) to evaluate the performance and profitability of each operating restaurant, individually and in the aggregate, and (ii) to make decisions regarding future spending and other operational decisions. 
 
 Adjusted EBITDA : represents Net income before depreciation and amortization, interest expense, income taxes, and items that we do not consider in our evaluation of ongoing core operating performance as identified in the reconciliation of Net income, the most directly comparable measure in accordance with GAAP, to Adjusted EBITDA, included in the section Non-GAAP Financial Measure Reconciliations below . 
 
 Adjusted EBITDA Margin : represents Adjusted EBITDA as a percentage of total revenues. See Non-GAAP Financial Measure Reconciliations below for a reconciliation to Net income margin, the most directly comparable GAAP measure. 
 
 Restaurant Level Operating Profit : represents restaurant sales, less restaurant operating expenses, which include food and beverage costs, labor and other related expenses, other restaurant operating expenses, pre-opening expenses and occupancy expenses. Restaurant level operating profit excludes corporate-level expenses and other items that we do not consider in the evaluation of the ongoing core operating performance of our restaurants as identified in the reconciliation of Income from operations, the most directly comparable GAAP measure, to Restaurant level operating profit, included in the section Non-GAAP Financial Measure Reconciliations below. 
 
 Restaurant Level Operating Profit Margin : represents Restaurant level operating profit as a percentage of restaurant sales. See Non-GAAP Financial Measure Reconciliations below for a reconciliation to Income from operations margin, the most directly comparable GAAP measure.

 Restaurant Sales 
 Restaurant sales represent the aggregate sales of food and beverages, net of discounts, at company-owned restaurants. Restaurant sales in any period are directly influenced by the number of operating weeks in the period, the number of open restaurants, customer traffic and average check. Average check growth is driven by our menu price increases and changes to our menu mix.

 thirteen and thirty-nine weeks ended September 29, 2024, respectively, from 28 restaurants acquired from franchisees between September 24, 2023 and September 29, 2024 and (iii) menu price increases. 
 Franchise Revenues 
 Franchise revenues are comprised of sales-based royalty fees, system fund contributions and the amortization of upfront initial franchise fees, which are recognized as revenue on a straight-line basis over the term of the franchise agreement. Franchise revenues in any period are directly influenced by the number of open franchise-owned restaurants.

 The decrease in franchise revenues during the thirteen and thirty-nine weeks ended September 29, 2024 as compared to the same periods in the prior year was primarily driven by the Company s acquisitions of 28 franchise-owned restaurants, partially offset by franchise revenues from the 7 franchise-owned NROs between September 24, 2023 and September 29, 2024. 
 Food and Beverage Costs 
 The components of food and beverage costs at company-owned restaurants are variable by nature, change with sales volume, are impacted by product mix and are subject to increases or decreases in commodity costs.

 Labor and Other Related Expenses 
 Labor and other related expenses are variable by nature and include hourly and management wages, bonuses, payroll taxes, workers compensation expense and employee benefits. Factors that influence labor costs include minimum wage and payroll tax legislation, health care costs, the number and performance of our company-owned restaurants and increased competition for qualified staff.

 The increase in depreciation and amortization during the thirteen and thirty-nine weeks ended September 29, 2024 as compared to the same periods in the prior year was due to additional NRO assets and restaurants acquired, including reacquired rights from franchisees. 
 Transaction Expenses, Net 
 Transaction expenses, net include (i) revaluations of contingent consideration payable to previous stockholders for tax savings generated through the use of federal and state loss carryforwards and general business credits that had been accumulated from operations prior to our acquisition by Advent in August 2017, (ii) gains or losses associated with lease or contract terminations, (iii) costs incurred in connection with the acquisition of franchise-owned restaurants, (iv) costs related to restaurant closures and (v) costs related to certain equity offerings.

 The decrease in Transaction expenses, net during the thirteen-week period ended September 29, 2024 as compared to the same period in the prior year was primarily due to decrease in costs incurred in connection with the acquisition of franchise-owned restaurants. 
 
 The decrease in Transaction expenses, net during the thirty-nine weeks ended September 29, 2024 as compared to the same period in the prior year was primarily due to a contingent consideration liability reduction recognized as a reduction in transaction expenses in the first quarter of 2024.

 Net income and net income margin during the thirteen and thirty-nine weeks ended September 29, 2024 decreased as compared to the same periods in the prior year primarily due to the (i) increase in interest expense associated with increased borrowings to fund acquisitions and higher interest rates, (ii) the increase in income tax expense and (iii) the decrease in income from operations margin. 
 Restaurant Level Operating Profit and Restaurant Level Operating Profit Margin 
 THIRTEEN WEEKS ENDED THIRTY-NINE WEEKS ENDED (in thousands) SEPTEMBER 29, 2024 SEPTEMBER 24, 2023 Change SEPTEMBER 29, 2024 SEPTEMBER 24, 2023 Change Restaurant level operating profit 46,991 40,365 16.4 152,799 128,865 18.6 Restaurant level operating profit margin 18.9 18.7 0.2 20.5 20.3 0.2 
 
 Restaurant level operating profit margin during the thirteen and thirty-nine weeks ended September 29, 2024 increased as compared to the same periods in the prior year primarily due to (i) favorable labor and other related expenses as a percent of sales, (ii) favorable food and beverage costs as a percent of sales and (iii) restaurants acquired between September 24, 2023 and September 29, 2024. This was partially offset by the deleverage of occupancy expenses. 
 
 Restaurant level operating profit for the thirteen and thirty-nine week periods ended September 29, 2024 increased as compared to the same period in the prior year primarily due to (i) sales growth driven by the increase in menu prices, as well as (ii) restaurant sales contributed by 37 NROs and 28 restaurants acquired from franchisees between September 24, 2023 and September 29, 2024. This was partially offset by an increase in (i) food, labor and other restaurant operating expenses and (ii) deleverage of occupancy expenses.

 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 
 As of September 29, 2024, we had cash and cash equivalents of 51.1 million and outstanding borrowings under the Credit Facility of 195.0 million, excluding unamortized debt discount and deferred issuance costs. We had availability of 123.3 million under our revolving credit facility of 125.0 million, of which 1.7 million is reserved under letters of credit, and availability of 27.5 million under our delayed draw term loan pursuant to our credit agreement, as amended Credit Agreement ). Our principal uses of cash include capital expenditures for the development, acquisition or remodeling of restaurants, lease obligations, debt service payments and strategic infrastructure investments. Our working capital requirements are low due to our restaurants storing minimal inventory and customers pay for their purchases at the time of the sale, which frequently precedes our payment terms with suppliers. 
 
 We believe that our cash flow from operations combined with our availability under the Credit Facility and our cash and cash equivalents will be sufficient to meet the Company s liquidity needs for at least the next 12 months. We anticipate that to the extent that we require additional liquidity, or should we decide to pursue one or more significant acquisitions, the funds would be furnished first through additional indebtedness and thereafter through the issuance of equity. Although we believe that our current level of total available liquidity is sufficient to meet our short-term and long-term liquidity requirements, we regularly evaluate opportunities to improve our liquidity position in order to enhance financial flexibility. 
 
 We estimate that our capital expenditures will total approximately 130.0 million in 2024, not including the capital allocated to franchise acquisitions. This capital is invested primarily in new restaurant projects and planned remodels. We plan to fund the capital expenditures primarily with cash generated from our operating activities as well as with borrowings pursuant to our Credit Agreement.

 Summary of Cash Flows 
 The following table presents a summary of our cash provided by (used in) operating, investing and financing activities for the thirty-nine weeks ended September 29, 2024 and September 24, 2023: 
 THIRTY-NINE WEEKS ENDED (in thousands) SEPTEMBER 29, 2024 SEPTEMBER 24, 2023 Cash provided by operating activities 92,749 73,044 Cash used in investing activities (165,919) (82,633) Cash provided by (used) in financing activities 74,338 (85) Net increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash 1,168 (9,674) 
 Cash provided by operations is our typical source of liquidity used (i) to fund capital expenditures for new restaurants, (ii) to maintain and remodel existing restaurants and (iii) for debt service. Cash provided by operations increased during the thirty-nine week period ended September 29, 2024 as compared to the thirty-nine week period ended September 24, 2023 is primarily due to the increase in the number of restaurants. 
 Cash used in investing activities increased during the thirty-nine weeks ended September 29, 2024 from the thirty-nine weeks ended September 24, 2023 due principally to (i) increases in the number of new restaurants and capital projects into which the Company is investing and (ii) the amount invested in acquisitions of franchise-operated restaurants compared to the same period last year. 
 Cash provided by (used in) financing activities reflects borrowings from the Company s Credit Facility to fund strategic acquisitions of franchise-operated restaurants. 
 
 Critical Accounting Estimates 
 
 Our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon the accompanying unaudited interim consolidated financial statements and notes thereto, which have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of these unaudited interim consolidated financial statements and related notes requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses. Certain of our accounting policies require the application of significant judgment by management in selecting the appropriate assumptions for calculating financial estimates. By their nature, these judgments are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty. These judgments are based on our historical experience, terms of existing contracts, our evaluation of trends in the industry and information available from other outside sources, as appropriate. We evaluate our estimates and judgments on an on-going basis. Our actual results may differ from these estimates. Judgments and uncertainties affecting the application of those policies may result in materially different amounts being reported under different conditions or using different assumptions. There have been no significant changes to our critical accounting policies as disclosed in Critical Accounting Estimates in the 2023 Form 10-K.

 Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 
 We are exposed to interest rate risk through fluctuations in interest rates on our debt obligations. On June 23, 2023, we entered into a variable-to-fixed interest rate swap agreement with two financial institutions to hedge 90.0 million of the outstanding variable rate debt. Under the terms of the interest rate swap agreement, the Company will pay a weighted average fixed rate of 4.16 on the notional amount and will receive payments from the counterparties based on the three-month secured overnight financing rate. On May 17, 2024, we entered into a variable-to-fixed interest rate swap agreement with two financial institutions to hedge an additional 60.0 million of the 195.0 million variable rate debt outstanding. Under the terms of the interest rate swap agreement, the Company will pay a weighted average fixed rate of 4.42 on the notional amount and will receive payments from the counterparties based on the three-month secured overnight financing rate. Refer to Note 8, Interest Rate Swaps , in the accompanying notes to the unaudited interim consolidated financial statements. 
 Except as described above, there have been no material changes to our exposure to market risks as disclosed in the 2023 Form 10-K. 
 
 Item 4. Controls and Procedures 
 
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 
 We are responsible for establishing and maintaining disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act ), that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act, such as this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms. 
 
 Disclosure controls and procedures also include, without limitation, controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 
 
 Our management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, has evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Due to the material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting discussed below, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that, as of September 29, 2024, our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective. In light of this fact, our management has performed additional analyses, reconciliations, and other post-closing procedures and has concluded that, notwithstanding the material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting, the consolidated financial statements for the periods covered by and included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q fairly present, in all material respects, our financial position, results of operations and cash flows for the periods presented in conformity with GAAP. 
 
 Previously Identified Material Weaknesses 
 
 A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of annual or interim financial statements would not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. 
 
 Refer to the management report on internal control over financial reporting in Part II - Item 9A of the 2023 Form 10-K filed with SEC on March 5, 2024 for a discussion of the material weaknesses that continue to exist as of September 29, 2024. 
 
 32 

Table of Contents 

 Remediation Efforts 
 
 We continue to implement measures designed to improve the Company s internal control over financial reporting to address and remediate the previously identified material weaknesses. To date, such measures include the following: 
 
 Hired new and reassigned existing financial reporting, accounting, and information technology leadership with public company experience to enhance public company financial reporting, technical accounting, and information technology services and solutions. 
 Augmented financial reporting capabilities by staffing professionals with knowledge and experience in income tax, internal audit, information technology, and legal. 
 Established various policies, including a formal delegation of authority policy defining the protocols for reviewing and authorizing commitments, contracts, invoices, and transactions as well as a comprehensive set of information technology policies to govern the Company s information technology practices. 
 Formalized certain roles and reviewed responsibilities, including ensuring appropriate segregation of duties. 
 Designed and implemented period-end financial reporting controls, such as controls over the preparation and review of account reconciliations, journal entries, financial statement disclosures, and the consolidated financial statements, including controls around classification of cash flows and disclosure of noncash items, as well as establishing a formal management Disclosure Committee to review the draft financial statements and disclosures prior to release, including a sub-certification process from various functional groups. 
 Enhanced access restrictions for certain users over general ledger journal entries and designed new processes to further automate journal entries and segregate journal entry creation from journal entry approval authority. 
 Designed and implemented controls over the accounting for income taxes to ensure the realizability and appropriate recording of deferred income taxes, income taxes and related disclosures. 
 
 While the material weaknesses previously disclosed have not yet been remediated as of September 29, 2024, management is devoting substantial resources to the ongoing remediation efforts. As we continue to evaluate and work to improve our internal control over financial reporting, we may take additional measures to address control deficiencies, or we may modify certain of the remediation measures described above. The material weaknesses will not be considered remediated until the applicable controls operate for a sufficient period of time and management has concluded, through testing, that these controls are designed and operating effectively. 
 
 Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 There have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the fiscal quarter ended September 29, 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company s internal control over financial reporting.

 Part II - Other Information 
 
 Item 1. Legal Proceedings 
 
 From time to time, we are involved in various claims and legal actions that arise in the ordinary course of business. We currently do not believe that the ultimate resolution of any of these actions, individually or taken in the aggregate, will have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations, liquidity or capital resources. A significant increase in the number of claims or an increase in amounts owing under successful claims could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. See Note 12, Commitments and Contingencies , in the accompanying notes to the unaudited interim consolidated financial statements. 

Item 1A. Risk Factors 
 
 In addition to the other information discussed in this report, please consider the factors described in Part I, Item 1A., Risk Factors in our 2023 Form 10-K, updated as set forth below, which update was first included in Part II, Item 1A., Risk Factors in our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2024 to reflect that, due to Advent s sales of our common stock on March 12, 2024, we are no longer considered a controlled company under Nasdaq listing rules. These are not the only risks facing our Company. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial also may adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations. 
 
 The following risk factor has been updated: 
 
 If the ownership of our common stock continues to be highly concentrated, it may prevent you and other minority stockholders from influencing significant corporate decisions and may result in conflicts of interest. Although we are no longer a controlled company within the meaning of the rules of the Nasdaq, Advent will continue to exert substantial influence over us. 
 
 Advent indirectly beneficially owns approximately 45 of our outstanding common stock. Although we are no longer a controlled company within the meaning of the Nasdaq listing rules, Advent indirectly beneficially owns shares sufficient to significantly influence all matters requiring stockholder votes, including: the election of directors; mergers, consolidations and acquisitions; the sale of all or substantially all of our assets and other decisions affecting our capital structure; amendments to our certificate of incorporation or our bylaws; and our winding up and dissolution. 
 
 This concentration of ownership may delay, deter or prevent acts that would be favored by our other stockholders. The interests of Advent may not always coincide with our interests or the interests of our other stockholders. This concentration of ownership may also have the effect of delaying, preventing or deterring a change in control of us. Also, Advent may seek to cause us to take courses of action that, in its judgment, could enhance its investment in us, but which might involve risks to our other stockholders or adversely affect us or our other stockholders. As a result, the market price of our common stock could decline or stockholders might not receive a premium over the then-current market price of our common stock upon a change in control. In addition, this concentration of share ownership may adversely affect the trading price of our common stock because investors may perceive disadvantages in owning shares in a company with significant stockholders.
