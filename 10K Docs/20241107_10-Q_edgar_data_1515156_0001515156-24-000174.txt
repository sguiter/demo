 of the equity of the subsidiaries of Arq Limited (the "Arq Acquisition," and hereafter the Arq Limited subsidiaries are referred to as "Legacy Arq") to secure access to a feedstock, a manufacturing facility and certain patented processes as a means to manufacture additional GAC products for sale into the APT and other markets. With the Arq Acquisition, the Company now controls bituminous coal waste reserves and owns a manufacturing facility, both located in Corbin, Kentucky (the "Corbin Facility"), and a process to recover and purify the bituminous coal waste for sale or further conversion to GAC products. Using the Corbin Facility's manufacturing process, the Company is converting bituminous coal waste into a purified, microfine carbon powder known as Arq powder TM ("Arq Powder"). See further discussion of the Arq Acquisition in Note 2.

 Use of Estimates 
 Fair value measurements 
 
 Seasonality 
 The timing of the sale of consumable products is dependent upon several factors. Power generation is weather dependent, with electricity and steam production varying in response to heating and cooling demands. As a result, the Company's revenue is generally higher in our first and third fiscal quarters during the warmer and colder months of the year, respectively. Abnormally high and low temperatures during the summer and winter months, respectively, may significantly increase coal consumption for electricity generation and cause increased impurities within various municipalities' water sources, and thus increase the demand for the Company's products. Additionally, power generating units routinely schedule maintenance outages in the spring and/or fall depending on the operation of their boilers. During the period in which an outage may occur, which may range from one week to over a month, the Company's product sales may decrease. 
 Also, the Company's revenue and sales volumes are highly dependent upon the level of coal consumption at coal-fired power plants, which in turn is significantly affected by the prices of competing power generation sources, such as natural gas and renewables. During periods of low natural gas prices, natural gas provides a competitive alternative to coal-fired power generation and therefore, coal consumption for power generation may be reduced, which in turn reduces the demand for the Company's products. In contrast, during periods of higher prices for competing power generation sources, coal consumption generally increases, which generally increases demand for the Company's products. 
 In the sale of water purification products, demand is driven largely from municipal water treatment facilities. Depending on weather conditions and other environmental factors, the summer months historically have the highest demand for the Company's products used in water treatment. One of the major uses for PAC is for the treatment of taste and odor episodes caused by increased degradation of organic contaminants and natural materials in water that occurs during the summer months. Additionally, the rainy season generally results in more demand from water municipalities due to rain run-offs and contaminant dilution.

 of the equity of Legacy Arq in exchange for consideration (the "Purchase Consideration") totaling million, and consisting of (i) shares of the Company's common stock and (ii) shares of the Company's Series A Convertible Preferred Stock, par value per share (the "Series A Preferred Stock" or the "Preferred Shares"). 
 The Company accounted for the Arq Acquisition as an acquisition of a business, and the total Purchase Consideration of million was allocated to the acquired assets and assumed liabilities of Legacy Arq based on their estimated fair values as of the Acquisition Date. The Purchase Consideration was comprised of the fair values as of the Acquisition Date of shares of the Company's common stock, valued at million, and Preferred Shares, valued at million. The Company also incurred million in acquisition-related costs, which were expensed as incurred during fiscal years 2022 and 2023 and included in the "Selling, general and administrative" line item in the Statements of Operations for those years. 
 Legacy Arq's principal location is in Corbin, Kentucky where it operates the Corbin Facility, which processes bituminous coal waste into Arq Powder. Arq Powder can be used in high value applications, such as for a raw material to produce GAC products or as an additive in other applications. With the completion of the Arq Acquisition, the Company intends to use Arq Powder as a feedstock to produce high-quality AC for use in water and air purification markets. The Company expects to begin using Arq Powder to produce GAC products during the first quarter of 2025.

 Series A Preferred Stock 
 In connection with the issuance of the Series A Preferred Stock pursuant to the Purchase Agreement, the Company filed the Certificate of Designations of Preferred Stock for the Series A Preferred Stock (the "Certificate of Designations") with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware. Under the Certificate of Designations, million preferred shares were designated as Series A Preferred Stock. 
 Of the total Preferred Shares issued in the Arq Acquisition, were held in escrow (the "Escrow Shares") based on a contingent redemption feature. The fair value of the Preferred Shares issued was determined to be per Preferred Share on the Acquisition Date plus the value of the contingent redemption feature related to the Escrow Shares. The Escrow Shares were converted into shares of the Company's common stock (the "Escrow Common Shares") on the Conversion Date, as defined below. 
 Pursuant to the terms of the Series A Preferred Stock, on March 31, 2023, the Company declared a dividend of Series A paid-in kind shares (the "PIK Dividend") with respect to the accrued dividends on the Preferred Shares for the first quarter of 2023. The PIK Dividend was recorded at the estimated fair value of million as of March 31, 2023 and was paid on April 21, 2023. 
 On June 13, 2023 (the "Conversion Date"), the Company's stockholders approved the conversion of all of the outstanding shares of Series A Preferred Stock, including the Escrow Shares, and the corresponding issuance of shares of the Company's common stock. Upon such approval, each outstanding share of Series A Preferred Stock was automatically converted into the number of shares of the Company's common stock described below. Each share of Series A Preferred Stock was deemed to have an original issue price of per share (the "Original Issue Amount"). The number of shares of the Company's common stock issued upon conversion of each share of Series A Preferred Stock was equal to the product of (i) the sum of (A) the Original Issue Amount plus (B) an amount equal to the cumulative amount of the accrued and unpaid dividends on such share at such time divided by (ii) the Original Issue Amount, subject to adjustment.

 million. In the event that the IRS determined that no withholding was required by Arq Ltd., all of the Escrow Common Shares would be released and delivered to Arq Ltd. In the event that the IRS determined that any amount of withholding was required by Arq Ltd., the Company agreed to redeem a sufficient number of Escrow Common Shares to fund the required payment to the IRS, and that number of Escrow Common Shares would be returned to the Company. In April 2024, the Company received notice from Arq Ltd. that the IRS had approved its filing for no tax withholding on the Purchase Consideration. Accordingly, in April 2024, the Company instructed its stock transfer agent to release the Escrow Common Shares to the Arq Ltd. stockholders. 
 Equity Financing 
 On February 1, 2023, and pursuant to the Arq Acquisition, the Company entered into Subscription Agreements (the "Subscription Agreements") with certain persons (the "Subscribers"), which included existing shareholders of Arq Ltd., three of which were appointed to the Company's Board of Directors (the "Board"), pursuant to which the Subscribers subscribed for and purchased shares of the Company's common stock for an aggregate purchase price of million and at a price per share of (such transaction, the "PIPE Investment"). 
 Unaudited Pro Forma Financial Information 
 The following represents the pro forma effects for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 of the Arq Acquisition as if it had occurred on January 1, 2023. The pro forma net loss for the period presented has been calculated after applying the Company s accounting policies in effect for that period. In addition, pro forma net loss includes: (1) a decrease in depreciation and amortization of million resulting from fair value adjustments to Property, plant, equipment; (2) an increase in amortization of million resulting from fair value adjustments to intangible assets; and (3) increases to interest expense of million for: (a) the issuance of the CFG Loan (as defined below) including stated interest and the amortization of the CFG Loan's discount and issuance costs and (b) amortization of debt discount related to a fair value adjustment to the CTB Loan (as defined below), which was assumed by the Company on the Acquisition Date; together with the income tax effects on (1) through (3).

 CFG Loan 
 As required under the Purchase Agreement, and on February 1, 2023 (the "Closing Date"), the Company, as borrower, certain of its subsidiaries, as guarantors, and CF Global ("CFG"), a related party, as administrative agent and lender, entered into a term loan (the "CFG Loan") in the amount of million, less original issue discount ("OID") of million, upon execution of a Term Loan and Security Agreement (the "CFG Loan Agreement"). The Company received net cash proceeds of million after deducting the OID and debt issuance costs of million. One of the Company's directors is a principal with CFG. 
 The CFG Loan Agreement also required the issuance of a warrant (the "Warrant") to CFG to purchase shares of the Company's common stock at an exercise price of per share. The Warrant had a term of years and contained a cashless exercise provision. On March 29, 2024, CFG exercised the warrant in full and the Company issued CFG shares of its common stock, net of shares representing the exercise price of the warrant. 
 The CFG Loan matures on February 1, 2027 and bears interest at a rate equal to either (a) Adjusted Term SOFR (subject to a floor and a cap of plus a margin of paid in cash and paid in kind or (b) Base Rate (as defined in the CFG Loan Agreement) plus a margin of paid in cash and paid in kind, which interest on the CFG Loan in each case shall be payable (or capitalized, in the case of in kind interest) quarterly in arrears.

 of the outstanding principal amount of the CFG Loan being repaid or prepaid or (iii) thereafter until the maturity date, of the outstanding principal amount of the CFG Loan being repaid or prepaid. The "Make-Whole Amount," with respect to any repayment or prepayment, is (i) an amount equal to all required interest payable (except for currently accrued and unpaid interest) on the aggregate principal amount of the CFG Loan subject to such prepayment or repayment from the date of such prepayment or repayment through but excluding the date that is the first anniversary of the Closing Date calculated using an interest rate equal to (x) Adjusted Term SOFR for an interest period of one month in effect on the third U.S. Government Securities Business Day prior to such prepayment or repayment plus (y) per annum and assuming all interest was paid in cash, plus (ii) a prepayment premium of on the aggregate principal amount of the CFG Loan subject to such prepayment or repayment. 
 The CFG Loan is secured by substantially all of the assets of the Company and its subsidiaries (including those acquired in the Acquisition, but excluding those pledged as collateral (the "CTB Loan Assets") under the CTB Loan, as defined and described below), subject to customary exceptions. The CFG Loan Agreement includes, among others, the following covenants: (1) a minimum unrestricted balance of million as of the end of each fiscal quarter; (2) (x) as of December 31, 2024, for the fiscal year then ended, the Company must have a minimum annual revenue, on a consolidated basis, of million and (y) for any fiscal year thereafter, the Company must have a minimum annual revenue, on a consolidated basis, of million; (3) (x) as of December 31, 2024, for the fiscal year then ended, the Company must have a minimum Consolidated EBITDA of million and (y) for any fiscal year thereafter, the Company must have a minimum Consolidated EBITDA of million; and (4) during a period including a LTV Trigger Event (as defined in the CFG Loan Agreement), the Company must not exceed a loan to value ratio of :1.00 (based on the consolidated total assets of the Company and its subsidiaries, but excluding the CTB Loan Assets). 
 The Company allocated the cash proceeds of the CFG Loan to both the CFG Loan and the Warrant based on their relative fair values. The amount allocated to the Warrant was recorded as a debt discount and is amortized to interest expense over the term of the CFG Loan. The standalone fair value of the CFG Loan was based on a comparison of borrowings and associated credit ratings consistent with those of the Company. As the Warrant was exercisable for per share, the fair value was deemed to be equal to the fair value of the underlying shares, and accordingly, the fair value of the Warrant was determined as the number of shares issuable from the exercise of the Warrant (based on of post-transaction fully diluted share capital, as defined in the Purchase Agreement) multiplied by the closing share price of the Company's common stock on the Acquisition Date. 
 CTB Loan 
 Upon completion of the Arq Acquisition, the Company assumed a term loan (the "CTB Loan") held by certain Arq subsidiaries as set out in the CTB Loan (the "Arq Subsidiaries") with a financial institution ("CTB") in the principal amount of million. The Company recorded the CTB Loan on the Acquisition Date at its estimated fair value of million, with the difference of million between the estimated fair value and the principal amount recorded as a debt discount and recognized as interest expense over the term of the CTB Loan. 
 The CTB Loan was originally entered into on January 27, 2021 and is comprised of promissory notes (the "Notes"): (1) "Note A" in the principal amount of million, which is guaranteed by the U.S. Department of Agriculture; and (2) "Note B" in the principal amount of million. The Notes mature on January 27, 2036 and bear interest at per annum through January 2026 and at the prime rate plus thereafter. The Company is required to make combined interest and principal payments monthly in the fixed amount of million. Interest is computed and payable on the outstanding principal as of the end of the prior month and the balance of the fixed monthly payment amount is applied to the outstanding principal. The Notes carry a prepayment penalty of of the outstanding principal if paid prior to January 27, 2024, of the outstanding principal if paid prior to January 27, 2025 and of the outstanding principal if paid prior to January 27, 2026. Thereafter, the Notes may be prepaid without penalty. 
 On June 2, 2023 (the "Amendment Date"), certain of the Arq Subsidiaries, which included Corbin Project LLC, Arq Projects Holding Company LLC, Arq St. Rose LLC, Arq Corbin LLC and Arq Corbin Land LLC (collectively, the "Borrowers") and CTB entered into a loan modification agreement (the "CTB Loan Modification Agreement") to the CTB Loan, as amended by that certain letter agreement by and among CTB and Borrowers dated January 21, 2022, and as otherwise amended, modified and/or extended by the parties from time to time (collectively, the "CTB Loan Agreement"). As consideration for CTB entering into the CTB Loan Modification Agreement, the Borrowers agreed to pay a fee of plus additional fees incurred by CTB and were required to deposit an additional million into a deposit account (the "Interest Reserve Account" as defined in the CTB Loan Agreement), where the Interest Reserve Account is held as collateral by CTB. The Borrowers may withdraw funds from the Interest Reserve Account beginning one year from the Amendment Date, subject to restrictions as stated in the CTB Loan Modification Agreement.

 Tax Asset Protection Plan 
 U.S. federal income tax rules, and Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code in particular, could substantially limit the use of net operating losses and tax credits if the Company experiences an "ownership change" (as defined in the Internal Revenue Code). In general, an ownership change occurs if there is a cumulative change in the ownership of the Company by "5 percent stockholders" that exceeds 50 percentage points over a rolling three-year period. 
 An entity that experiences an ownership change generally will be subject to an annual limitation on its pre-ownership change tax loss and credit carryforwards equal to the equity value of the entity immediately before the ownership change, multiplied by the long-term, tax-exempt rate posted monthly by the Internal Revenue Service (subject to certain adjustments). The annual limitation would be increased each year to the extent that there is an unused limitation in a prior year. 
 On May 5, 2017, the Board approved the declaration of a dividend of rights to purchase Series B Junior Participating Preferred Stock for each outstanding share of common stock as part of a tax asset protection plan (the "TAPP"), which is designed to protect the Company s ability to utilize its net operating losses and tax credits. The TAPP is intended to act as a deterrent to any person acquiring beneficial ownership of or more of the Company s outstanding common stock. 
 On April 12, 2024, the Board approved the Seventh Amendment to the TAPP (the "Seventh Amendment"), which amends the TAPP, as previously amended by the First, Second, Third, Fourth, Fifth and Sixth Amendments that were approved by the Board on April 6, 2018, April 5, 2019, April 9, 2020, April 9, 2021, March 15, 2022, and April 13, 2023, respectively. The Seventh Amendment amends the definition of "Final Expiration Date" under the TAPP to extend the duration of the TAPP and makes associated changes in connection therewith. Pursuant to the Seventh Amendment, the Final Expiration Date shall be the close of business on the earlier of (i) December 31, 2025 or (ii) December 31, 2024 if stockholder approval of the Seventh Amendment has not been obtained prior to such date. At the Company's 2024 Annual Meeting of Stockholders held on June 10, 2024, the Company's stockholders approved the Seventh Amendment, thus the final expiration date will be the close of business on December 31, 2025.

 Stock Options 
 Stock options vest over and have a contractual limit of from the date of grant to exercise. The fair value of stock options granted is determined on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option pricing model, and the related expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the entire vesting period. The determination of the grant date fair value of stock options issued is affected by a number of variables, including the fair value of the Company s common stock, the expected common stock price volatility over the expected term of the stock option, the expected term of the stock option, risk-free interest rates, and the expected dividend yield of the Company s common stock. 
 Risk-free interest rate - The risk-free interest rate for stock options granted was determined by using a zero-coupon U.S. Treasury rate for the periods that coincided with the expected term of the options. 
 Dividend yield - An expected dividend yield of was included in the calculations, as the Company does not currently pay nor does it anticipate paying dividends on its common stock as of the grant date of the stock options. 
 Expected volatility - To calculate expected volatility, the historical volatility of the Company's common stock was used. 
 Expected term - The Company s expected term of stock options was calculated using a simplified method whereby the midpoint between the vesting date and the end of the contractual term is utilized to compute the expected term, as the Company does not have sufficient historical data for options with similar vesting and contractual terms.

Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 
 The following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of our operations should be read together with the unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements and notes of Arq, Inc. ("Arq" or the "Company") included elsewhere in Item 1 of Part I ("Item 1") of this Quarterly Report and with the audited consolidated financial statements and the related notes of Arq included in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 (the "2023 Form 10-K"). 
 The results of operations discussed in this "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" are those of Arq, Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries, collectively, the "Company," "we," "our" or "us." 
 
 Overview 
 We are an environmental technology company that is principally engaged in the sale of consumable air and water treatment solutions primarily based on Activated Carbon ("AC"). Our proprietary AC products enable customers to reduce air, water, and soil contaminants, including mercury, per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances ("PFAS") and other pollutants, to help our customers maximize effectiveness and to improve operating efficiencies to meet the challenges of existing and pending air quality, soil, and water regulations. We manufacture and sell AC and other chemicals used to capture and remove contaminants for coal-fired power generation, industrial and water treatment markets, which we collectively refer to as the advanced purification technologies ("APT") market. 
 Our primary products are comprised of AC, which is produced from a variety of carbonaceous raw materials. Our AC products include both powdered activated carbon ("PAC") and granular activated carbon ("GAC"). Additionally, we own the Five Forks Mine, a lignite mine that currently supplies the primary raw material for the manufacturing of our products. 
 In February 2023, we acquired 100 of the equity of the subsidiaries of Arq Limited (the "Arq Acquisition," and hereafter the Arq Limited subsidiaries are referred to as "Legacy Arq") to secure access to a feedstock, a manufacturing facility and certain patented processes as a means to manufacture additional GAC products for sale into the APT market and other markets. With the Arq Acquisition, we now control bituminous coal waste reserves and own a manufacturing facility, both located in Corbin, Kentucky (the "Corbin Facility"), and a process to recover and purify the bituminous coal fines for sale or further conversion to GAC products. Using the Corbin Facility's manufacturing process, we convert coal waste into a purified, microfine carbon powder known as Arq powder TM ("Arq Powder"). We expect to begin using Arq Powder as a feedstock to manufacture high-quality GAC products for sale in the APT and other markets during the first quarter of 2025. 
 We believe Arq Powder has additional potential for us to access new markets and applications. We expect to secure customer interest in Arq Powder as an additive into other markets, such as components for asphalt. These products utilizing Arq Powder are expected to have a lower carbon footprint compared to similar products utilizing conventional materials. These applications are currently in various stages of proof of concept testing or preliminary customer testing. 
 In February 2024, as part of a larger rebranding, we changed our name to Arq, Inc., and on February 1, 2024, our common stock commenced trading under the ticker symbol, "ARQ". 
 Drivers of Demand and Key Factors Affecting Profitability 
 Drivers of demand and current key factors affecting our profitability are sales of our AC products to the APT market. Our operating results are influenced by: (1) changes in our manufacturing production and sales volumes; (2) changes in price and product mix; (3) changes in coal-fired dispatch and electricity power generation sources and (4) changes in demand for contaminant removal within water treatment facilities. 
 For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, we experienced a decrease in demand for our products from certain coal-fired dispatch and electricity power generation customers compared to the same periods in 2023. This was primarily due to lower natural gas prices, resulting in several large utility customers opting to use natural gas versus coal as a primary source for power generation, and the year to date impact of mild temperatures during the winter and spring seasons, resulting in lower demand for power generation compared to 2023. We expect that natural gas prices will remain relatively consistent through 2024 due to surplus natural gas reserves in storage, which, we expect, will negatively impact sales of our products even with higher than average summer temperatures. 
 On April 10, 2024, the United States Environmental Protection Agency ("EPA") issued its first nationally enforceable PFAS National Primary Drinking Water Regulation, confirming a material tightening to an existing framework of guidance and regulations relating to the control and limitation of PFAS in municipal water. The regulatory changes are anticipated to phase in over an approximate five-year period. We expect the implementation of the announced regulations will drive a material increase in GAC demand in the water purification market. 
 22 

Results of Operations 
 For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, we recognized net income of 1.6 million and net loss of 3.8 million, respectively, compared to net loss of 2.2 million and 15.5 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023. The most significant factor impacting results for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was higher revenue as a result of increased average selling price, which was partially offset by a decrease in demand for our AC and chemical products with power generation customers, when compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease in demand from our power generation customers was primarily driven by continued low prices of alternative energy sources for power generation. These factors also impacted our results for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Additionally, during the nine months ended September 30, 2023, we recorded expenses related to the Arq Acquisition that did not occur in 2024. 
 The following sections provide additional information regarding these comparable periods. For comparability purposes, the following tables set forth our results of operations for the periods presented in the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 1 of this Quarterly Report. The current year period to prior year period comparisons of financial results may not be indicative of financial results to be achieved in future periods. 
 
 Comparison of the Three Months Ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 
 Revenue and Cost of revenue 
 A summary of the components of our Revenue and Cost of revenue for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 is as follows: 
 Three Months Ended September 30, Change (in thousands, except percentages) 
 2024 2023 ) ) Revenue 34,774 29,829 4,945 17 Cost of revenue, exclusive of depreciation and amortization 21,339 20,707 632 3 
 Revenue and Cost of revenue 
 For the three months ended September 30, 2024, revenue increased from the comparable quarter in 2023 primarily driven by overall favorable product mix and higher pricing of approximately 2.7 million and 1.2 million, respectively. The increase from favorable product mix was primarily driven by sales to municipal water customers and a large non-power generation customer. Also contributing to an increase in revenue between periods was 0.2 million attributable to volumes sold, despite lower natural gas prices compared to the same quarter in 2023, which contributed to decreased utilization of coal-fired generation and decreased demand for our products by customers in the power generation market. The average Henry Hub natural gas spot prices /MMBtu) for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 were 2.11 and 2.59, respectively. 
 Gross margin, exclusive of depreciation and amortization, increased for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the corresponding quarter in 2023. The increase in gross margin was primarily due to favorable product mix as described above, as well as lower fixed costs as a percentage of total cost of revenue due to higher production volumes for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the corresponding quarter in 2023. 
 We expect that revenue and gross margin will continue to be positively impacted by our product price increases and our efforts to move our product mix to higher margin products. We anticipate that the product price increases will help offset decreases in volumes due to prices of alternative energy sources impacting the demand for our AC and chemical products related to power generation. 
 Revenue continues to be affected by electricity demand driven by seasonal weather and related power generation needs, as well as competitor prices related to alternative power generation sources such as natural gas and renewables.

 Payroll and benefits 
 Payroll and benefits, which represent costs related to selling, general and administrative personnel, decreased for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the corresponding quarter in 2023 primarily due to severance related costs of 1.0 million associated with the termination of an executive officer during the three months ended September 30, 2023, and decreased salaries and wages in the current quarter primarily from lower executive compensation, which was a result of personnel changes implemented in 2023. 
 Legal and professional fees 
 Legal and professional fees decreased for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the corresponding quarter in 2023 primarily from legal and accounting costs incurred related to the Arq Acquisition during the period ended September 30, 2023, partially offset by increased consulting fees. 
 General and administrative 
 General and administrative expenses increased for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the corresponding quarter in 2023 by approximately 1.0 million, primarily due to an increase in rent and occupancy expenses, third-party services at the Corbin Facility, and franchise taxes. 
 Research and development 
 Research and development expense increased for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the corresponding quarter in 2023, primarily due to conducting product qualification testing with potential lead-adopters as part of our ongoing GAC contracting process, and increased research and development payroll costs. 
 Depreciation, amortization, depletion and accretion 
 Depreciation, amortization depletion and accretion expense remained flat for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the corresponding quarter in 2023. 
 Gain on sale of assets 
 Gain on sale of assets for the three months ended September 30, 2024 primarily relates to a gain on the sale of equipment.

 Percent change in excess of 100 not considered meaningful. 
 Earnings from equity method investments 
 Earnings from equity method investments for the three months ended September 30, 2024 represented cash distributions from Tinuum Group. Earnings from equity method investments for the three months ended September 30, 2023 represented cash distributions from both Tinuum Group and Tinuum Services. Tinuum Group continues to wind down their services into 2024. We do not expect further distributions from Tinuum Services as Tinuum Services has completed its wind-down. 
 Interest expense 
 Interest expense remained flat for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the corresponding quarter in 2023. 
 Other 
 The decrease in Other for the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the corresponding quarter in 2023 was primarily driven by a decrease in interest income of 0.4 million due to lower average balances in the Company's cash sweep accounts during the current quarter compared to the prior year quarter. 
 Income tax expense 
 For the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, we had pretax income of 1.6 million and pretax loss of 2.2 million, respectively. For the three months ended September 30, 2024, we recorded no income tax expense as we expect to incur pretax loss for the year ending December 31, 2024. For the three months ended September 30, 2023, we recorded no income tax benefit for the pretax loss due to the recording of a full valuation allowance based on our forecast of pretax loss for the year ended December 31, 2023. 
 
 Comparison of the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 
 Total Revenue and Cost of Revenue 
 A summary of the components of our revenues and cost of revenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 is as follows:

 Revenue and Cost of revenue 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, revenue increased from the comparable period in 2023 primarily driven by overall favorable product mix and higher pricing of approximately 5.4 million and 3.9 million, respectively. The increase from favorable product mix was primarily driven by sales to municipal water customers and a large non-power generation customer. These increases to revenue were partially offset by approximately 0.4 million attributable to lower volumes sold. Product sale volumes were lower among power generation customers primarily due to lower natural gas prices compared to the same period in 2023, which contributed to decreased utilization of coal-fired generation and decreased demand for our products. The average Henry Hub natural gas spot prices /MMBtu) for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 were 2.11 and 2.47, respectively. 
 25 

Gross margin, exclusive of depreciation and amortization, increased for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the corresponding period in 2023. The increase in gross margin was primarily due to favorable product mix and pricing as described above. 
 Operating Expenses 
 A summary of the components of our operating expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 is as follows:

 A summary of the components of selling, general and administrative expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, exclusive of cost of revenue items (presented above), is as follows: 
 Nine Months Ended September 30, Change (in thousands, except percentages)

 Payroll and benefits 
 Payroll and benefits decreased for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the corresponding period in 2023 primarily due to 1.1 million related to severance expense of former executives of Arq Limited and 1.0 million of severance related costs associated with the termination of an executive officer incurred during the nine months ended September 30, 2023, as well as decreased salaries and wages in the current year primarily from lower executive compensation, which was a result of personnel changes implemented in 2023. 
 Legal and professional fees 
 Legal and professional fees decreased for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the corresponding period in 2023 primarily from decreased consulting, legal, and accounting costs incurred related to the Arq Acquisition during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 General and administrative 
 General and administrative expenses increased for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the corresponding period in 2023 by approximately 1.8 million, primarily due to increases in rent and occupancy expenses, franchise tax expenses, outside construction-related labor and license and fee expenses. 
 Research and development 
 Research and development expense increased for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the corresponding period in 2023, primarily due to conducting product qualification testing with potential lead-adopters as part of our ongoing GAC contracting process, and increased research and development payroll costs. 
 Depreciation, amortization, depletion and accretion 
 Depreciation, amortization, depletion and accretion expense decreased by approximately 1.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the corresponding period in 2023, primarily due to increased absorption in inventory of 1.4 million, decreased amortization of leasehold improvements, customer relationships and developed technology of 0.5 million, and decreased depletion of 0.2 million, partially offset by increased depreciation expense, primarily related to Legacy Arq assets purchased in February 2023. 
 26 

Gain on sale of assets 
 On March 27, 2023, we completed the sale of all of our membership interests in Marshall Mine, LLC to a third party. During the nine months ended September 30, 2023, we recognized a gain of 2.7 million on the sale of Marshall Mine, LLC. Gain on sale of assets for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily due to a gain on the sale of equipment. 
 Other Income (Expense), net 
 A summary of the components of other income (expense), net for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 is as follows: 
 Nine Months Ended September 30, Change (in thousands, except percentages) 
 2024 2023 ) ) Other (expense) income: Earnings from equity method investments 127 1,512 (1,385) (92) Interest expense (2,426) (2,155) (271) 13 Other 931 1,510 (579) (38) Total other (expense) income (1,368) 867 (2,235) 
 Percent change in excess of 100 not considered meaningful. 
 Earnings from equity method investments 
 Earnings from equity method investments for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 represented cash distributions from Tinuum Group. During the nine months ended September 30, 2023, the amount represented cash distributions from both Tinuum Group and Tinuum Services. Tinuum Group continues to wind down their services into 2024. We do not expect further distributions from Tinuum Services as Tinuum Services has completed its wind-down. 
 Interest expense 
 Interest expense increased for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the corresponding period in 2023 primarily due to higher interest expense of 0.3 million related to the CFG Loan incurred for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. This increase was due to a higher principal balance from the accrual of interest payable upon the termination date of the CFG Loan. 
 Other 
 The decrease in Other for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily driven by a decrease in interest income of 0.5 million due to lower balances in the Company's cash sweep accounts during the current period compared to the prior year period. 
 Income tax expense 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, we had pretax losses of 3.7 million and 15.6 million, respectively, and recorded no income tax benefit for the pretax losses due to the recording of a full valuation allowance based on our forecast of pretax losses for the year ending December 31, 2024 and the year ended December 31, 2023. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we recorded out of period state income tax expense related to a state assessment.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures 
 To supplement our financial information presented in accordance with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles ("U.S. GAAP"), we provide certain supplemental financial measures, including EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA, which are measurements that are not calculated in accordance with U.S. GAAP. EBITDA is defined as earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, and Adjusted EBITDA is defined as EBITDA reduced by the non-cash impact of equity earnings from equity method investments and other non-cash gains, increased by cash distributions from equity method investments, other non-cash losses and non-recurring costs and fees. EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA should be considered in addition to, and not as a substitute for, net income (loss) in accordance with U.S. GAAP as a measure of performance. See below for a reconciliation from net income (loss), the nearest U.S. GAAP financial measure, to EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA. 
 We believe that the EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA measures are less susceptible to variances that affect the Company's operating performance. We include these non-GAAP measures because management uses them in the evaluation of our operating performance, and believe they help to facilitate comparison of operating results between periods. We believe the non-GAAP measures provide useful information to both management and users of the financial statements by excluding certain expenses, gains, and losses which can vary widely across different industries or among companies within the same industry and may not be indicative of core operating results and business outlook. 
 EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA: 
 The following table reconciles net income (loss), our most directly comparable as-reported financial measure calculated in accordance with U.S. GAAP, to EBITDA (loss) and Adjusted EBITDA (loss).

Additionally, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, Net loss included 2.5 million and 4.2 million of Legacy Arq payroll and benefit costs. Further included in Net Loss for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 is 1.3 million of severance expense related to two executive employees.

Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 Current Resources and Factors Affecting Our Liquidity 
 As of September 30, 2024, our principal sources of liquidity included: 
 cash on hand of 48.7 million, excluding 8.7 million of restricted cash, including net proceeds received from issuance and sale of our common stock of 42.4 million in the current year; and 
 cash from operations. 
 As of September 30, 2024, our principal uses of liquidity included: 
 capital expenditures, including those related to the Red River Plant expansion and commissioning of the Corbin Facility; 
 our business operating expenses; 
 payments on our lease obligations; and 
 payments on our debt obligations. 
 Cash Flows 
 Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 vs. Nine Months Ended September 30, 2023 
 Cash and restricted cash increased from 54.2 million as of December 31, 2023 to 57.4 million as of September 30, 2024. The following table summarizes our cash flows for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively: 
 Nine Months Ended September 30, (in thousands) 2024 2023 Change Cash and restricted cash provided by (used in): Operating activities 5,268 (21,145) 26,413 Investing activities (42,100) (17,304) (24,796) Financing activities 40,059 23,338 16,721 Net change in cash and restricted cash 3,227 (15,111) 18,338 
 Cash flow from operating activities 
 Cash flow from operating activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 were 5.3 million and represented a net increase of 26.4 million from cash used in operating activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 of 21.1 million. The net increase was primarily attributable to a decrease in cash payments on accounts payable and accrued expenses of 9.4 million, primarily due to payments made in 2023 of Legacy Arq assumed liabilities, comprised of accrued employee-related compensation and accrued transaction costs related to the Arq Acquisition in 2023; a decrease in net loss of 11.8 million; and a decrease in non-cash items primarily from a gain of 2.7 million recognized from the sale of Marshall Mine, LLC for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 Cash flow from investing activities 
 Cash flows used in investing activities increased for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023 increased by 24.8 million primarily as a result of an increase in property, plant and equipment additions of 25.2 million from construction activities related to the expansion of our Red River Plant; 2.2 million of cash acquired in the Arq Acquisition during the prior year; and a decrease in distributions from equity earnings in excess of cumulative earnings of 1.4 million. Partially offsetting the net increase in cash flows used in investing activities were a cash payment of 2.2 million made in the prior year required in the sale of Marshall Mine, LLC, a decrease in expenditures on mine development costs of 1.7 million, and cash received in 2024 of 0.2 million from the sale of equipment. 
 Cash flow from financing activities 
 Cash flows provided by financing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023 increased by 16.7 million primarily due to proceeds of 42.4 million, net of offering costs, we received related to issuance and sale of our common stock in both the Public Offering and the Private Placement, including 0.8 million received in April 2024 pursuant to a subscription agreement between the Company and its CEO executed in July 2023. During the nine months ended September 30, 2023, cash flows from financing activities included the receipt of proceeds of 15.2 million, net, from the PIPE Investment and proceeds from the CFG Loan of 8.5 million, net of debt issuance costs paid. 
 29 

Material Cash Requirements 
 Our ability to continue to generate sufficient cash flow required to meet ongoing operational needs and obligations depends upon several factors. These include executing on our contracts and initiatives and increasing our share of the market for APT consumables, including expanding our overall AC business into additional adjacent markets and increasing our gross margin by improving our customer and product mix. 
 We expect that our cash on hand as of September 30, 2024 and proceeds from additional debt financing, if needed, will provide sufficient liquidity to fund operations for the next 12 months while maintaining the cadence of our capital expenditures. 
 Capital expenditures 
 We have targeted the first quarter of 2025 for our first GAC deliveries. To meet this target, we need to incur substantial capital spend for additional equipment, labor, and project costs. We expect to finance the timely completion of the project with cash on hand, cash generation from operations, ongoing cost reduction initiatives, potential customer prepayments for GAC contracts, and an anticipated refinancing and expansion of the CFG Loan. 
 During 2024, we expect to spend between 60 and 70 million on construction and commissioning of our plants, depending on the pace of the project. Capital expenditures planned for 2024 are dependent on many factors, which may impact the timing and amount of capital expenditures, with 20 to 25 million expected to be spent in the fourth quarter of 2024. 
 Surety Bonds 
 As of September 30, 2024, we had outstanding surety bonds with regulatory commissions totaling 11.2 million primarily related to the Five Forks Mine and the Corbin Facility. As of September 30, 2024, and as required by our surety bond provider, we held restricted cash of 8.5 million pledged as collateral related to performance requirements required under a reclamation contract for the Five Forks Mine and the Corbin Facility. We expect that the obligations secured by these surety bonds will be performed in the ordinary course of business and in accordance with the applicable contractual terms. To the extent that the obligations are performed, the related surety bonds may be released and collateral requirements may be reduced. However, in the event any surety bond is called, our indemnity obligations could require us to reimburse the surety bond provider. 
 Long Term Requirements 
 For a discussion of our long-term cash requirements, which relate primarily to our obligations under the CFG Loan and CTB Loan, see Note 5 of the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 1 of this Quarterly Report.

EXHIBIT 95.1 
 Mine Safety and Health Administration Safety Data 
 
 We are committed to maintaining a safe work environment and working to ensure environmental compliance across all of our operations. The health and safety of our employees and limiting the impact to communities in which we operate are critical to our long-term success. We employ practices and conduct training to help ensure that our employees work safely. Furthermore, we utilize processes for managing, monitoring and improving safety and environmental performance. 
 The following disclosures are provided pursuant to Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) regulations, which require certain disclosures by companies required to file periodic reports under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, that operate coal mines regulated under the Federal Mine Safety and Health Act of 1977 (the Mine Act ). The disclosures reflect United States (U.S.) mining operations only. 
 Mine Safety Information. Whenever the Mine Safety and Health Administration (MSHA) believes that a violation of the Mine Act, any health or safety standard, or any regulation has occurred, it may issue a violation which describes the associated condition or practice and designates a time frame within which the operator must abate the violation. In some situations, such as when MSHA believes that conditions pose a hazard to miners, MSHA may issue an order removing miners from the area of the mine affected by the condition until hazards are corrected. Whenever MSHA issues a citation or order, it generally proposes a civil penalty, or fine, as a result of the violation that the operator is ordered to pay. Citations and orders can be contested and appealed and, as part of that process, are often reduced in severity and amount, and are sometimes vacated. The number of citations, orders and proposed assessments vary depending on the size and type (underground or surface) of the company and mine. 
 We are required to report citations and orders issued to us by MSHA during the three months ended September 30, 2024, as reflected in our systems. Our required disclosure covers only those mines that were issued orders or citations during the period presented and, commensurate with SEC regulations, does not reflect orders or citations issued to independent contractors working at our mines. Due to timing and other factors, our data may not agree with the mine data retrieval system maintained by MSHA. The proposed assessments for the three months ended September 30, 2024 were taken from the MSHA system as of November 4, 2024. 
 
 Additional information about MSHA references we are required to report is as follows 
 Section 104 S&S Violations The total number of violations received from MSHA under section 104(a) of the Mine Act that could significantly and substantially contribute to a serious injury if left unabated. 
 Section 104(b)Orders The total number of orders issued by MSHA under section 104(b) of the Mine Act, which represents a failure to abate a citation under section 104(a) within the period of time prescribed by MSHA. This results in an order of immediate withdrawal from the area of the mine affected by the condition until MSHA determines that the violation has been abated. 
 Section 104(d) Citations and Orders The total number of citations and orders issued by MSHA under section 104(d) of the Mine Act for unwarrantable failure to comply with mandatory health or safety standards. 
 Section 104(e) Notices The total number of notices issued by MSHA under section 104(e) of the Mine Act for a pattern of violations that could contribute to mine health or safety hazards. 
 Section 110(b)(2)Violations The total number of flagrant violations issued by MSHA under section 110(b)(2) of the Mine Act. 
 Section 107(a) Orders The total number of orders issued by MSHA under section 107(a) of the Mine Act for situations in which MSHA determined an imminent danger existed. 
 Proposed MSHA Assessments The total dollar value of proposed assessments from MSHA. 
 Fatalities The total number of mining-related fatalities. 
 Our first mine is located in the Gulf Coast Lignite Region, in Natchitoches Parish, Louisiana (the Five Forks Mine ). For the three months ended September 30, 2024, there were no reportable citations or orders issued to the Five Forks Mine. Our second mine is located in Knox, Kentucky Corbin Project ). For the three months ended September 30, 2024, there were no reportable citations or orders issued to Corbin Project. Our third mine is located in Mingo, West Virginia Mine Four ). For the three months ended September 30, 2024, there were no reportable citations or orders issued to Mine Four. 
 Pending Legal Actions. The Federal Mine Safety and Health Review Commission (the Commission) is an independent adjudicative agency that provides administrative trial and appellate review of legal disputes arising under the Mine Act. These cases may involve, among other questions, challenges by operators to citations, orders and penalties they have received from MSHA, or complaints of discrimination by miners under section 105 of the Mine Act. The following is a brief description of the types of legal actions that may be brought before the Commission. 

Contests of Citations and Orders A contest proceeding may be filed with the Commission by operators, miners or miners representatives to challenge the issuance of a citation or order issued by MSHA, including citations related to disputed provisions of operators' emergency response plans. 
 Contests of Proposed Penalties (Petitions for Assessment of Penalties) A contest of a proposed penalty is an administrative proceeding before the Commission challenging a civil penalty that MSHA has proposed for the violation. Such proceedings may also involve appeals of judges' decisions or orders to the Commission on proposed penalties, including petitions for discretionary review and review by the Commission on its own motion. 
 Complaints for Compensation A complaint for compensation may be filed with the Commission by miners entitled to compensation when a mine is closed by certain withdrawal orders issued by MSHA. The purpose of the proceeding is to determine the amount of compensation, if any, due miners idled by the orders. 
 Complaints of Discharge, Discrimination or Interference A discrimination proceeding is a case that involves a miner s allegation that he or she has suffered a wrong by the operator because he or she engaged in some type of activity protected under the Mine Act, such as making a safety complaint. This category includes temporary reinstatement proceedings, which involve cases in which a miner has filed a complaint with MSHA stating he or she has suffered discrimination and the miner has lost his or her position. 
 Applications for Temporary Relief An application for temporary relief from any modification or termination of any order or from any order issued under certain subparts of section 104 of the Mine Act may be filed with the Commission at any time before such order becomes final. 
 Appeals of Judges' Decisions or Orders. 
 For the three months ended September 30, 2024, there were no pending or legal actions before the Commission at Five Forks Mine, Corbin Project or Mine Four.
