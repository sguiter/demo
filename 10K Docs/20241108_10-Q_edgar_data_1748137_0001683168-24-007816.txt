shares as follows: (i) 
shares related to restricted stock units granted to an officer and another employee in April 2024; (ii) shares related to warrants
issued to investors in the public offering completed in August 2022; (iii) shares related to warrants issued to the underwriters
in that same offering; (iv) shares related to restricted stock units granted to an officer in March 2022; and (v) shares
issuable to directors and other advisors (see Notes 3 and 5). 

.
Under this agreement, we will be required to make monthly payments to the lender of accrued interest, at the rate of per annum, on
any outstanding borrowings that we make, with the principal and any unpaid accrued interest being due at maturity on . In order to secure such borrowings, we have granted a security interest in all of our assets to the lender. As a condition of receiving
this line of credit from the lender, we have agreed not to issue any securities pursuant to the Company s Form S-3 (file number
333-280400), without the lender s consent, so long as any borrowings remain outstanding. As of September 30, 2024, we had made 
borrowings under this credit agreement (see Note 5). 

 The shares of common stock and the Warrants comprising the Units were
immediately separated at closing of the offering and each is now independently listed on the NASDAQ Capital Market. Each Warrant became
exercisable on the date of issuance and will expire five years from the date of issuance. 

In the underwritten public
offering, a total of Units, including exercise of the underwriter s overallotment option, were sold at an offering price
to the public of 4.00 per Unit. The gross proceeds of the offering were and the net proceeds, after deduction of underwriting
discounts and other offering costs were approximately . The Company also granted the underwriter non-tradeable warrants to purchase
a total of shares of common stock at an exercise price of per share for a period of five years. 

In conjunction with the public
offering, all holders of the Company s 2018 convertible notes in the total amount of , including accrued interest, converted
their debt into a total of shares of common stock at the stated conversion rate, and all holders of the Company s 2021
convertible notes in the total amount of , including accrued interest, automatically converted their debt into a total of 
shares of common stock at the stated conversion rate. 

Warrants The
Warrants for a total of shares of common stock issued to investors and the underwriters are exercisable at any time after their
original issuance and at any time up to the date that is five years after their original issuance, or . The Warrants may
be exercised upon payment of the exercise price in cash on or prior to the expiration date. Under the terms of the Warrant Agreement,
we must use our best efforts to maintain the effectiveness of the registration statement and current prospectus relating to common stock
issuable upon exercise of the Warrants until the expiration of the Warrants. If we fail to maintain the effectiveness of the registration
statement and current prospectus relating to the common stock issuable upon exercise of the Warrants, the holders of the Warrants shall
have the right to exercise the Warrants solely via a cashless exercise feature provided for in the Warrants, until such time as there
is an effective registration statement and current prospectus.

These warrants were issued
in conjunction with an underwritten public equity offering, therefore, there was no employee or non-employee compensation expense recognized. 

Stock Compensation Expense 
In April 2024, we entered into an employment agreement with a new Chief Executive Officer CEO ), providing for an initial
term extending through June 30, 2027, which will be automatically renewed for additional one-year terms unless either party chooses not
to renew it. Pursuant to the agreement, our new CEO received an initial equity grant equal to restricted stock units RSU s ),
with a grant date value of , which will vest over a four-year period, subject to his continued employment with the Company,
and will be entitled to earn additional RSU s on each anniversary in the form of three annual performance-based equity grants, beginning
in the year ending June 30, 2025, with a target value of up to 660,000 each. However, no such additional grants have been made as of
September 30, 2024. 

In February 2022, we entered
into a new employment agreement with our then CEO, effective April 1, 2022. As noted above, we engaged a new CEO effective April 29, 2024,
replacing our former CEO who remains as Chairman of the Board and chief technology officer. Pursuant to the agreement, we issued our former
CEO an RSU award for up to 150,000 shares of our common stock upon achieving the following milestones (which achievements shall be determined
by the Board): (i) Milestone 1 - Successfully complete an uplisting of our common stock in 2022 and continue his employment with our company
until January 1, 2023: 50,000 shares; and (ii) Milestone 2 - Produce 2,000 ESSs in 2022 and continue his employment with our company until
January 1, 2023: 100,000 shares. As of December 31, 2023, Milestone 1 had been achieved, however, Milestone 2 had not been achieved and
was no longer achievable. The underlying shares of common stock earned under Milestone 1 were issued to our former CEO as of January
1, 2023. 

In February 2022, we entered
into a new employment agreement with our Chief Financial Officer CFO ), effective March 1, 2022. Pursuant to the agreement,
we issued our CFO an RSU award for up to 300,000 shares of our common stock upon achieving the following milestones (which achievements
shall be determined by the Board): (i) Milestone 1 - Successfully complete an uplisting of our common stock in 2022 and continue his employment
with our company until January 1, 2023: 250,000 shares; and (ii) Milestone 2 - successfully complete and file the Company s Form
10-K for the year ended June 30, 2023 no later than September 29, 2023 and continue his employment with our company until January 1, 2024:
50,000 shares. Milestone 1 was achieved as of January 1, 2023, and the underlying shares of common stock earned under Milestone
1 were issued to our CFO as of that date. Milestone 2 was achieved as of January 1, 2024, and the underlying shares of common stock
earned under Milestone 2 are expected to be issued to our CFO at a later date. 

Based upon our assessment
of the probability of our three executive officers noted above, plus a non-executive recipient of another RSU award issued in June 2024,
ultimately achieving any applicable milestones specified under the RSU awards indicated above, we have calculated the grant date value
of such awards and are amortizing it as stock compensation expense over the underlying performance periods. We have recognized stock compensation
expense applicable to such RSU awards in the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 in the amounts of and ,
respectively 

In conjunction with our public
offering in August 2022, we appointed two new independent directors and adopted a new compensation plan for all independent directors
based on an annual compensation amount of 65,000 with not less than 70 of such amount paid in shares of our common stock, calculated
based on the share price at the end of such prior fiscal quarter, and up to 30 paid in cash, with such final amounts to be determined
by each director. As of September 30, 2024, we booked an accrual of of compensation expense (of which 43,875 will be settled
through the issuance of shares) for our three independent directors under this plan. 

In the three months
ended September 30, 2024, we recognized total non-cash stock compensation expense of as follows: (i) for the
amortized value of the RSUs granted to our chief executive officer, as previously described, plus a non-executive recipient of
another RSU award granted in June 2024; and (ii) for the amortized value of the portion of the new compensation
plan for our independent directors that is attributable to stock. There were a total of shares of our common stock that were
issued to two grantees in the three months ended September 30, 2024, which were previously expensed in the year ended June 30,
2024. 

In the three months ended
September 30, 2023, we recognized total non-cash stock compensation expense of as follows: (i) for the amortized value
of the RSUs granted to our two executive officers, as previously described; and (ii) for the amortized value of the portion of
the new compensation plan for our independent directors that is attributable to stock. There were no shares of common stock that were
issued to any grantees in the three months ended September 30, 2023. 

Other Matters 
In February 2019, the Company s Board of Directors approved the establishment of a new 2019 Stock Plan Plan with
an authorization for the issuance of up to shares of common stock. The Plan is designed to provide for future discretionary
grants of stock options, stock awards and stock unit awards to key employees, consultants, advisors, and non-employee directors. As of
September 30, 2024, we have made total awards of shares under the Plan as follows: (i) shares for the RSUs granted
to our three executive officers and a non-executive recipient, as noted above; (ii) shares for the initial services of our three
independent directors in the year ended June 30, 2023, pursuant to the new compensation plan adopted in August 2022 for independent directors;
and (iii) shares granted to several wholesale dealers under an incentive sales program. 

(4) 
 Commitments and Contingencies 

Effective January 1, 2021,
we secured new corporate and manufacturing office space under a sublease agreement with a company that served as our contract manufacturer
at that time. Under the terms of the sublease agreement, we were required to make rental payments of 10,350 per month during the initial
one-year term of the agreement. Further, under the terms of the sublease agreement, we were granted the right to renew the sublease for
additional terms of 12 months each upon mutual agreement of both parties, provided thirty days notice is given for each subsequent
term, at a modest increase in the monthly rent, through February 28, 2025. However, we were under no obligation to renew it. At inception
of the sublease, management determined that exercise of the renewal option was not reasonably certain and, notwithstanding that the Company
elected to renew the agreement for additional one year periods as of January 1, 2022, 2023 and 2024, continues to believe that is the
case. Accordingly, we have accounted for it as a short-term lease under ASC 842, Leases . Under an amendment to our supply agreement
with our former contract manufacturer in April 2023, we took over direct responsibility for the manufacturing process surrounding our
ESS units on June 1, 2023, however, that amendment had no effect on the sublease agreement with our former contract manufacturer. 

As indicated in Note 1, we
sell our proprietary ESS units through wholesale dealers, primarily in California. In that regard, we have entered into agreements with
several wholesale dealers operating in California and other states under which we have incentivized the dealers to achieve quarterly sales
above targeted levels by agreeing to grant them shares of our common stock for exceeding such quarterly sales targets, determined as of
the calendar year end, subject to defined maximums, as determined annually on a calendar year basis. 

We are dependent on our two
main component vendors for our suppliers of batteries, inverters and other raw materials and the inability of these single-source suppliers
to deliver necessary components of our products according to our schedule and at prices, quality levels and volumes acceptable to us,
or our inability to efficiently manage these components, could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and operating
results. 

From time to time in the ordinary
course of our business, the Company may be involved in legal proceedings, the outcomes of which may not be determinable. The Company is
not involved in any legal proceedings at this time. The results of litigation are inherently unpredictable. Any claims against us, whether
meritorious or not, could be time consuming, result in costly litigation, require significant amounts of management time and result in
diversion of significant resources. We are not able to estimate an aggregate amount or range of reasonably possible losses for those legal
matters for which losses are not probable and estimable.

ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 

Introduction 

This information should be
read in conjunction with the interim unaudited financial statements and the notes thereto included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q,
and the audited financial statements and notes thereto and Part II. Other Information - Item 7. Management s Discussion and
Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations , contained in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended June
30, 2024, filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on September 27, 2024 (the Annual Report ). 

Certain capitalized terms
used below and otherwise defined below, have the meanings given to such terms in the footnotes to our unaudited financial statements included
above under Part I - Financial Information - Item 1. Financial Statements . 

Unless the context requires
otherwise, references to the Company , we , us, our , NEOV ,
refer specifically to NeoVolta, Inc. 

In addition, unless the context
otherwise requires and for the purposes of this Report only: 

Exchange Act refers to the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended; 

SEC or the Commission refers to the United States Securities and Exchange Commission; and 

Securities Act refers to the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. 

Overview 

We are a designer, manufacturer,
and seller of high-end Energy Storage Systems (or ESS), primarily our NeoVolta NV14, NV14-K, and NV-24, which can store and use energy
via batteries and an inverter at residential or commercial sites. We were founded to identify new ways to leverage emerging technologies
with the dynamic changes that are taking place in the energy delivery space. We primarily market and sell our products directly to our
certified solar installers and solar equipment distributors. We are also pursuing agreements with residential developers, commercial developers,
and other commercial opportunities. Because we are purely dedicated to energy solar systems, virtually all our current resources and efforts
go into further developing our flagship NV14, NV14-K, and NV-24 products, while focusing on specific industry needs for our next generation
of products. We believe we are unique in the marketplace due to our low cost, our innovative battery chemistry, our product versatility
and our commitment to installer service. Because of these factors, we believe NeoVolta is uniquely equipped to establish itself as a major
player in the energy storage market. 

In May 2019, we completed
a public offering of 3,500,000 shares of our common stock at an offering price of 1.00 per share for gross proceeds of 3.5 million pursuant
to Regulation A of the Securities Act. We used the proceeds of the offering to ramp up production, marketing, and sales of our NV14 product
line. In that regard, we have used the proceeds from the offering to fund the marketing, production and distribution of our products,
which commenced in July 2019 through a group of wholesale customers in California, as well as to provide additional working capital for
other corporate purposes. We have expanded to include one wholesale distribution customer in Nevada. As of the current date, we have had
successful installations of our products in the additional States of Arizona, Utah, Colorado, Wyoming, Texas, Oklahoma, Missouri, Tennessee,
Alabama, Georgia, Florida, and Puerto Rico. 

14 

As further discussed below
under Liquidity and Capital Resources, we completed an underwritten public offering of our equity securities in the form
of Units in August 2022. We sold a total of 1,121,250 Units in the offering at an offering price to the public of 4.00 per Unit. The
gross proceeds of the offering were 4,485,000 and the net proceeds, after deduction of underwriting discounts and other offering costs,
were approximately 3,780,000. We are using the proceeds of this public offering to increase our current production capacity, expand our
product portfolio, enlarge our product marketing and sales efforts, and for other general corporate purposes. 

On April 14, 2023, California
implemented Net Energy Metering 3 (NEM3) for subsequent new solar installations. NEM3 reduces the amount of NEM credit for each kilowatt
(KW) of solar power sent to the utility from a rate of approximately 0.20 per KW to 0.09 per KW (each Utility varies). NEM3 effectively
increases the average solar Return of Investment (ROI) from 5-6 years to 10-12 years (each Utility varies). Effectively, the Company believes
that solar installation in California currently makes little financial sense without also including a battery system. Installing NeoVolta
nets a ROI of 4-6 years. NEM3 reduced our sales from December 2022 until very recently as solar installers worked off their
permitted NEM2 installs. We expect our sales to ultimately increase going forward. 

Results of Operations 

The following discussion
reflects the Company s revenues and expenses for the three month periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, as reported in our financial
statements included in Item 1. 

Revenues - Revenues
from contracts with customers for the three months ended September 30, 2024 were 590,236 compared to 764,130 for the three months ended
September 30, 2023. Such decrease was primarily due to the impact of various macroeconomic factors,
such as relatively high interest rates, and regulatory factors, such as utility regulations in the State of California that we believe
may have temporarily caused an economic disadvantage for residential utility customers to acquire our energy storage systems not
only prior to the April 2023 effective date of those regulations, but also subsequently,
as certain implications of them because better known in the marketplace. 

Cost of Goods Sold 
- Cost of goods sold for the three months ended September 30, 2024 were 497,389 compared to 642,958 for the three months ended September
30, 2023. The cost of goods sold in both periods reflected the cost of procuring and assembling the component parts of the energy storage
systems that were sold in each fiscal year and resulted in gross profits on such sales of approximately 16 in both periods. 

General and Administrative
Expense - General and administrative expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2024 were 1,050,119 compared to 555,160 for
the three months ended September 30, 2023. Such increase was mainly due to our engagement of a new chief executive officer, who was engaged
at an annual salary of 350,000 and also received a 4 year amortizing equity award of 2,854,000, as well as several other employees since
April 2024. The addition of these personnel resulted in a higher level of both cash compensation expense and other
associated expenses, such as marketing and travel, as well as non-cash stock compensation expenses related to the Company s equity
incentive programs. 

Research and Development
Expense - Research and development expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2024 were 8,617 compared to zero for the three
months ended September 30, 2023. Such fluctuation was largely due to timing differences in the level of the Company s recent product
development efforts. 

Other Income and Expense 
- Interest income for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was 1,395 compared to 5,273 for the three months ended September 30,
2023. This decrease was due to the Company s lower level of investable cash in the three months ended September 30, 2024. 

Net Loss - Net loss
for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was 964,494 compared to 428,715 for the three months ended September 30, 2023, representing
the aggregate of the various revenue and expense categories indicated above. The Company has not recognized any income tax benefit for
these net losses due to the uncertainty of its ultimate realization. 

15 

Liquidity and Capital Resources 

Operating activities. 
Net cash used in operating activities in the three months ended September 30, 2024 was 593,031 compared to 179,089 in the three months
ended September 30, 2023. This increase was largely due to the current period increase in our comparative net loss, largely due to the
decline in our gross profit and the increase in our other cash operating expenses. The fluctuations in our working capital components
had only a de minimis impact on net operating cash flow on a comparative basis. 

Financing activities. 
As indicated in Note 2, we entered into an agreement with a newly formed financing entity in September 2024 whereby we obtained a line
of credit for borrowings of up to 5,000,000. Under this agreement, we will be required to make monthly payments to the lender of accrued
interest, at the rate of 16 per annum, on any outstanding borrowings that we make, with the principal and any unpaid accrued interest
being due at maturity in September 2026. In order to secure such borrowings, we have granted a security interest in all of our assets
to the lender. As of September 30, 2024, we had made no borrowings under this credit agreement. 

As of September 30, 2024,
we had a cash balance of approximately 0.4 million and net working capital of approximately 3.9 million. Currently, we are not generating
a break-even level of net operating cash flow from our net sales. However, we anticipate that demand for our products will ultimately
increase over time and that, in conjunction with our recently obtained line of credit noted above, we will have sufficient cash to operate
for at least the next 12 months. 

Assembly Inventory Purchase 

In April 2023, we made a bulk
purchase of raw materials inventory from our contract manufacturer by making a cash payment to that company in the net amount of approximately
 1.3 million. This transaction was completed pursuant to an amendment of our Master Supply Agreement with our contract manufacturer. In
addition to the purchase of the raw materials inventory from our contract manufacturer, this amendment provided for the eventual assumption
by us of full responsibility from our contract manufacturer for the manufacturing of our proprietary Energy Storage Systems ESS units. Pursuant to the amendment, we assumed such responsibility for the manufacturing process surrounding our ESS units from our contract
manufacturer on June 1, 2023. In conjunction with assuming this responsibility, we hired the employees of our contract manufacturer who
previously performed contract manufacturing services for us. 

Other Developments 

We continue to monitor current
international developments occurring in Ukraine and Israel. However, we do not believe that they will have a significant impact on either
the domestic markets for our products or the international supply chains for our product components, which are largely sourced from Asis. 

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 

We have no obligations, assets
or liabilities which would be considered off-balance sheet arrangements as defined in Item 303 of Regulation S-K. 

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 

Our discussion and analysis
of our financial condition and results of operations are based on financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with generally
accepted accounting principles in the United States. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments
that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses. We believe that certain accounting policies affect our
more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements. See Note 1. Business and Summary
of Significant Accounting Policies of the Notes to Financial Statements set forth above and under Item 8. Financial Statements
and Supplementary Data of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended June 30, 2024, as filed with the SEC on September 27,
2024, for a further description of our critical accounting policies and estimates.

ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 

Information for this Item
is not required as the Registrant is a smaller reporting company as defined in Rule 12b-2 of the Exchange Act. 

ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures

We have established and maintain
a system of disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed
in our reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission pursuant to the Exchange Act, is recorded, processed, summarized and
reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the Commission and that such information is accumulated and communicated
to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer, who is our principal executive officer, and Chief Financial Officer, who is
our principal financial and accounting officer, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures. 

As of September 30, 2024,
our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls
and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Exchange Act). Based on that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer
and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that, as a result of the material weakness relating to the lack of segregation of duties, our
disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report were not effective. Due to our size and
nature, segregation of all conflicting duties may not always be possible and may not be economically feasible. We will be required to
hire additional personnel in order to remediate our material weakness. 

Limitations on Effectiveness of Controls and
Procedures 

In designing and evaluating
the disclosure controls and procedures, management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated,
can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives. In addition, the design of disclosure controls and
procedures must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and that management is required to apply its judgment in evaluating
the benefits of possible controls and procedures relative to their costs. 

Changes in Internal Controls over Financial
Reporting 

There was no change in our
internal controls over financial reporting that occurred during the quarter ended September 30, 2024, that has materially affected, or
is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal controls over financial reporting. 

17 

PART II. 	OTHER INFORMATION 

ITEM 1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS 

Although we may, from time
to time, be involved in litigation and claims arising out of our operations in the normal course of business, we are not currently a party
to any material legal proceeding. In addition, we are not aware of any material legal or governmental proceedings against us, or contemplated
to be brought against us. 

ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS 

There have been no material
changes from the risk factors previously disclosed in Part I, Item 1A of the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended
June 30, 2024, as filed with the SEC on September 27, 2024 (the Form 10-K ), under the heading Risk Factors , and investors should review the risks provided in the Form 10-K prior to making an investment in the Company. The
business, financial condition and operating results of the Company can be affected by a number of factors, whether currently known or
unknown, including but not limited to those described in the Form 10-K for the year ended June 30, 2024, under Risk Factors , any one or more of which could, directly or indirectly, cause the Company s actual financial condition and operating
results to vary materially from past, or from anticipated future, financial condition and operating results. Any of these factors, in
whole or in part, could materially and adversely affect the Company s business, financial condition, operating results and stock
price. 

ITEM 2. UNREGISTERED SALES OF EQUITY SECURITIES AND USE OF PROCEEDS 

There have been no sales of
unregistered securities during the three months ended September 30, 2024. 

ITEM 3. DEFAULTS UPON SENIOR SECURITIES 

None. 

ITEM 4. MINE SAFETY DISCLOSURES 

Not applicable. 

ITEM 5. OTHER INFORMATION 

During the period covered by
this Quarterly Report, none of the Company s directors or executive officers has or a Rule 10b5-1 trading arrangement
or a non-Rule 10b5-1 trading arrangement (each as defined in Item 408 of Regulation S-K under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as
amended).
