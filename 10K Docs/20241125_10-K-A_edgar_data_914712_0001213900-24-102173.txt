Delinquent Section 16(a) Reports 

Section 16(a) of the Exchange
Act requires the Company s Directors and executive officers, and persons who beneficially own more than ten percent of a registered
class of the Company s equity securities, to file reports of beneficial ownership and changes in beneficial ownership with the SEC. Based
solely on a review of reports filed with the SEC and written representations from certain reporting persons that no other reports were
required, the Company believes that, during Fiscal 2024, its officers, Directors and ten-percent stockholders complied with all applicable
Section 16(a) filing requirements applicable to such individuals. However, due to administrative oversights, Steel Excel filed
one late Form 4, reporting three transactions, and one late Form 4, reporting one transaction from the previous fiscal year, with respect
to its beneficial ownership of more than ten percent of the shares of Common Stock.

information, see, Item 13. Certain Relationships and Related Transactions , and Director Independence-Certain
Relationships and Related Person Transactions-STCN Management Services Agreement . Steel Services has informed us that it
cannot identify the portion of the cash compensation paid by Steel Services to each of Mr. Lichtenstein or Mr. O Herrin
relating solely to their service as an executive officer to us, as Steel Services does not provide cash compensation to its
employees specifically for such service. Subject to the discretion of our Board and/or Compensation Committee, however, Mr.
Lichtenstein may receive compensation from us for service payable in future years. We reimburse Steel Services (a wholly-owned
subsidiary of Steel Holdings) for expenses for business-related air travel of certain of our executive officers whose services are
provided to us under the STCN Management Services Agreement. From time to time, family members or other guests may accompany these
executive officers on this business-related air travel. No amounts are included in the Summary Compensation Table for travel by
family members and/or other guests since it did not create any reportable incremental cost to the Company. 

Additionally,
Mr. Lichtenstein receives compensation from us for his service as our Director and the Executive Chairman, pursuant to our director compensation
program, as described below under the section titled Director Compensation-Director Compensation Program . 

Mr. Khalil 

The compensation paid to Mr.
Khalil during Fiscal 2024 included a base salary and cash bonuses. As with other individuals we employ to provide services to us, the
base salary payable to Mr. Khalil is intended to provide a fixed component of compensation reflecting his skill set, experience, role
and responsibilities. Mr. Khalil was eligible to participate in Fiscal 2024 in the ModusLink Corporation Short Term Incentive Plan (the
 ModusLink 2024 STIP ). The ModusLink 2024 STIP was designed to provide a cash bonus to employees and other service providers
at the ModusLink level. Under the ModusLink 2024 STIP, Mr. Khalil received a target bonus opportunity of 50 of his salary 360,000),
to be paid out as a multiple of that target, based 80 on corporate performance of ModusLink (i.e., 50 on Adjusted EBITDA of ModusLink,
15 on net new annualized VAR of ModusLink, and a combined 15 on the operational and service level performance for certain key customers)
and 20 on his individual performance. Net new annualized VAR was defined as value-added revenue (net revenue, less cost of materials)
gained from new projects minus value-added revenue lost from customer exits during the year. For each of the corporate performance metrics,
a threshold payout would be made with respect to the metric (to the extent of its weighting) between 90 and 100 of target, if a threshold
level of performance was met (i.e., 90 of target performance for Adjusted EBITDA, 80 of target performance for net new annualized VAR,
and 100 of target performance for the key customers metrics). Additionally, for the Adjusted EBITDA metric and the net new annualized
VAR metric, a maximum payout could be achieved with respect to the metric (to the extent of its weighting) of 150 of target, if an oversized
level of performance was met (i.e., 125 or more of target performance for Adjusted EBITDA and 120 or more of target performance for
net new annualized VAR). Performance above 100 of target performance for the key customers metrics would not yield a payout with respect
to those metrics (to the extent of their weighting) beyond 100 of target. Based on Adjusted EBITDA of 25.5 million, net new annualized
VAR of 9.5 million and between 100 and 10 attainment of the key customers performance goals, as well as Mr. Khalil s individual
performance, in each case, in Fiscal 2024, Mr. Khalil received a bonus for Fiscal 2024 equal to 93.1 of target 167,522). 

6 

Additionally, on May 14, 2024,
the Compensation Committee approved the following changes to the compensation for Mr. Fawaz Khalil: (a) an increase in base salary to
 360,000, (b) a target bonus opportunity under the ModusLink Corporation Long Term Incentive Plan of 100 of base salary, and (c) an equity
award of 1,907 restricted common units (each a Restricted Unit of Steel Holdings under the Steel Partners Holdings L.P.
Second Amended and Restated 2018 Incentive Award Plan. Each Restricted Unit will vest in full on October 1, 2026, subject to Mr. Khalil s
continued employment through the vesting date. If Mr. Khalil s employment terminates for any reason at any time prior to the vesting
of the Restricted Units, all unvested Restricted Units will be forfeited. 

We do not have any agreements
with Mr. Khalil that guarantee employment for a set term, and accordingly, he is an employee at will. 

Potential Payments Upon Termination or Change-in-Control 

There were no agreements or
arrangements providing for payments or benefits in the event of termination of employment of any of our Named Executive Officers as of
July 31, 2024. For the effect of termination on Mr. Lichtenstein s outstanding restricted stock awards as a Director and the Executive
Chairman of the Company, see Director Compensation-Director Compensation Program . Additionally, Mr. Khalil is a participant
in the ModusLink Corporation Long Term Incentive Plan (the ModusLink LTIP ), which
provides an award based on certain metrics measured over two-distinct three-year performance periods lasting until July 31, 2025 and July
31, 2026, respectively. For more information, see the Company s current report on Form 8-K filed with the SEC on August 1, 2023.
While payout under the ModusLink LTIP is contingent upon a participant being employed as of the payout date, the Compensation Committee
may exercise discretion to pay out an award following termination under certain circumstances, including involuntary termination of employment
due to a reduction-in-force, cost reduction or restructure, or in the event of the participant s death, disability or retirement.

Awards column represent the aggregate grant date fair value of restricted stock awards, which are calculated in accordance with
FASB ASC Topic 718 using the Company s stock price on the grant date, as discussed in Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements
in the Original Form 10-K. Each Director received 9,860 shares of restricted Common Stock for Fiscal 2024, which consisted of four grants
made on each of October 1, 2023, January 1, 2024, April 1, 2024 and July 1, 2024 pursuant to the 2020 Incentive Plan. Each of these grants
was unvested as of July 31, 2024, and vests a year from the grant date, provided that the individual remains a director of the Company
through the vesting date. For more information, see Director Compensation Program . As a result, as of July 31, 2024,
the Directors held outstanding awards of unvested restricted stock in the following amounts: Mr. Fenton: 9,860; Mr. Kassan: 9,860; Mr.
Martin: 9,860; Mr. Wald: 9,860; Ms. Simril: 9,860; and Mr. Howard: 9,860. The Compensation Committee, in its discretion, accelerated

(2) Ms. Molland did not stand for
reelection at the annual meeting of stockholders held on September 11, 2023. The Board nominated Mr. Martin, who was then elected to
the Board at that same meeting. 

Director Compensation Program

receive a combination of cash compensation and equity in the form of restricted stock awards on an annual basis. In addition, all of the
Directors of the Company receive reimbursement of expenses incurred with respect to attendance at meetings of the Board and meetings of
committees thereof, which amounts are not included in the above table. 

Each participating Director
who serves as a Director during any fiscal quarter receives a payment for such quarter of 12,500, with a pro rata fee applicable to service
for less than a whole quarter (provided, however, that any Director who serves as the non-executive Chairman of the Board during any fiscal
quarter receives a payment for such quarter of 28,750 instead of 12,500, with a pro rata fee applicable to service for less than a whole
quarter). Each participating Director who serves as the chairperson of a committee of the Board during any fiscal quarter receives a payment
of 1,250 (provided, however, that the chairperson of the Audit Committee during any fiscal quarter receives a payment of 2,500, in each
such case with a pro rata fee applicable to service for less than a whole quarter). Each participating Director who attends a telephonic
meeting of the Board or a committee thereof receives a meeting fee of 500. Each participating Director who attends a meeting of the Board
or a committee thereof, where a majority of the Directors attend such meeting in person, receives a meeting fee of 1,000. In addition,
each Director receives restricted stock awards for shares of Common Stock with an aggregate fair market value equal to approximately 100,000
per year, divided in equal quarterly grants, provided that such Director is serving as a Director on the applicable grant date. The number
of shares underlying each grant is determined based on the volume weighted average of the closing sale prices of our Common Stock on Nasdaq

provided that the Director remains a director of the Company on the applicable vesting date. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if a Director s
service terminates, all unvested awards will be forfeited immediately (except if due to death or disability, in which case all unvested
awards will become immediately vested), unless otherwise determined by the Compensation Committee.

relating to the size of the Board and the Composition of the Company s Audit Committee and the approval of certain transactions
as discussed below. Any amendment of the Stockholders Agreement by the Company prior to the Final Sunset Date requires the approval
of the Independent Audit Committee or the Disinterested Audit Committee, as applicable.

Inc., the management fee was reduced from 282.8 thousand per month to 101.9 thousand per month. 

On October 25, 2023, the Company

to which the parties agreed to increase the monthly fee to 131.0 thousand effective as of January 1, 2024, primarily to increase
the business development and mergers and acquisition staffing needed to originate, analyze and pursue strategic acquisitions and investments.

of Amendment No. 2 to the STCN Management Services Agreement, expenses incurred by ModusLink were paid to Steel Services under the STCN
Management Services Agreement.

services of certain employees and executive officers to serve in various positions or functions and to perform duties normally associated

include, but are not limited to, services related to legal and environmental, health and safety, finance, tax and treasury, human resources,
 lean, internal audit, mergers and acquisitions, and information technology. Previously, the terms regarding such non-exclusive
services were governed by the STCN Management Services Agreement.

Agreement provides that ModusLink will pay Steel Services a fixed monthly fee of 80.0 thousand in consideration of the non-exclusive
services and will reimburse Steel Services and its representatives for all reasonable expenses incurred in providing the services. The

Delaware Litigation Settlement 

On April 13, 2018, a purported shareholder, Donald Reith (the plaintiff ),
filed a verified complaint, Reith v. Lichtenstein, et al., 2018-277 (Del. Ch.) in the Delaware Court of Chancery (the Reith litigation ).
The complaint alleges class and derivative claims for breach of fiduciary duty and/or aiding and abetting breach of fiduciary duty and
unjust enrichment against certain current and former directors of the Company, Warren G. Lichtenstein, Glen M. Kassan, William T. Fejes,
Jack L. Howard, Jeffrey J. Fenton, Philip E. Lengyel and Jeffrey S. Wald; and stockholders Steel Holdings and several of its affiliated
companies (collectively, the Defendants in connection with the acquisition of 35.0 million of the Series C Convertible
Preferred Stock by SPHG Holdings and equity grants made to Messrs. Lichtenstein, Howard and Fejes on December 15, 2017 (collectively,
the Challenged Transactions ). The Company is named as a nominal defendant. The complaint alleges that although the Challenged
Transactions were approved by a Special Committee consisting of the independent members of the Board of Directors (Messrs. Fenton, Lengyel
and Wald), the Steel Parties dominated and controlled the Special Committee, who approved the Challenged Transactions in breach of their
fiduciary duty. Plaintiff alleges that the Challenged Transactions unfairly diluted stockholders and therefore unjustly enriched Steel
Holdings, SPHG Holdings and Messrs. Lichtenstein, Howard and Fejes. The complaint also alleges that the Board of Directors made misleading
disclosures in the Company s proxy statement for the 2017 Annual Meeting of Stockholders in connection with seeking approval to
amend the 2010 Incentive Award Plan to authorize the issuance of additional shares to accommodate certain shares underlying the equity
grants. Remedies requested include rescission of the Series C Convertible Preferred Stock and equity grants, disgorgement of any unjustly
obtained property or compensation and monetary damages. 

14 

On August 13, 2021, the Company
and the Defendants, entered into a memorandum of understanding (the MOU with the plaintiff in connection with the settlement
of the Reith litigation. A definitive Stipulation of Settlement (the First Stipulation incorporating the terms of the MOU
was filed with the Court on February 18, 2022. Pursuant to the MOU and First Stipulation, and contingent on approval of the terms by the
court, the Defendants agreed to cause their directors and officers liability insurance carriers to pay to the Company 2.8 million
in cash. The Company s insurance carrier agreed to pay 1.7 million and Steel Holdings insurance carrier agreed to pay
 1.1 million of the settlement. 

Additionally, under the MOU
and separate letter agreements between the Company and such individuals (the Surrender Agreements ), Messrs. Lichtenstein,
Howard and Fejes agreed to surrender to the Company an aggregate 353,571 shares that they had initially received in December 2017 in consideration
for services to the Company. The surrenders and cancellations are in the following amounts: for Mr. Lichtenstein, 196,429 vested shares
and 32,143 unvested shares; for Mr. Howard, 98,214 vested shares and 16,071 unvested shares; and for Mr. Fejes, 10,714 vested shares.
On August 17, 2021, Mr. Lichtenstein and Mr. Howard surrendered the shares required under the MOU, the First Stipulation and their respective
Surrender Agreements, and in December 2021 Mr. Fejes did the same. All such shares were subsequently cancelled. On September 23, 2022,
the court ruled that it was denying approval of the settlement as described in the First Stipulation. 

On June 6, 2023, the Company
received a books and records demand from the plaintiff under Delaware General Corporation Law Section 220 which requests an array of documents
for the purported purposes of investigating potential wrongdoing in connection with the April 30, 2023 exchange transaction between Steel
Holdings and Steel Connect. 

On April 8, 2024, the Company,
the Defendants and Mr. Reith entered into a memorandum of understanding contemplating the settlement of the Reith litigation. 

On October 18, 2024, the Company,
the plaintiff, and the Defendants entered into a Stipulation and Agreement of Compromise, Settlement and Release (the Second Stipulation to resolve the Reith litigation (the Proposed Settlement ). If the Proposed Settlement is approved by the Court, (i) the
Defendants shall cause their insurers to make a cash payment of 6.0 million to the Company and, after deducting any Court-approved award
of attorneys fees to Plaintiff s counsel and certain litigation expenses, the Company shall distribute the balance of the
cash payment, by way of a special divided or other distribution, to the holders of the Company s common stock pursuant to the allocation
provisions set forth in the Stockholders Agreement, as amended by the Proposed Settlement; (ii) the Company will adopt certain
amendments to the Stockholders Agreement; and (iii) the Company will adopt certain corporate governance policies and practices,
including a formal review process for compensation clawbacks, enhancing the process for granting equity awards and keeping records of
equity awards granted under the Company s stock plans, further enhancing board committee independence, and reducing the materiality
threshold for review of related party transactions under the Stockholders Agreement. 

The Proposed Settlement requires
Court approval, and there can be no assurances that such approval will be granted. The Proposed Settlement, if approved by the Court,
will cause the dismissal, with prejudice, of the Reith litigation and the release of claims against the parties to the Proposed Settlement
as described in the Second Stipulation.

Related Person Transaction Policies and Procedures 

Pursuant to our Audit Committee
charter, our Audit Committee has the sole and direct responsibility and authority to administer our related person transaction policies
and procedures. All related person transactions, within the meaning of the applicable Nasdaq Rules and Item 404(a) of Regulation S-K,
are expected to receive the approval of the Audit Committee (or, in the event it is inappropriate for the Audit Committee to review such
transaction due to a conflict of interest or otherwise, by other independent directors of our Board). Under its procedures, the Audit
Committee (or other subset of independent directors of our Board) considers all facts and information that are available and deemed relevant
by it, including, but not limited to, whether the transaction is on terms no less favorable than the terms generally available to an unaffiliated
third person under the same or similar circumstances, as well as the extent of the related person s interest in the transaction. 

In addition, our Code of Business
Conduct and Ethics prohibits Directors, officers and employees from entering into transactions or relationships amounting to conflicts
of interest, which are defined to arise when such officer, Director or employee of the Company takes action or has an interest that prevents
them from performing their Company duties and responsibilities honestly, impartially, objectively and effectively. Individuals are responsible
for disclosing any transaction or relationship that could reasonably give rise or appear to give rise to a conflict of interest, in the
case of employees, to the Legal Department, and in the case of Directors and officers, to the Board, which, in each case, is responsible
for determining whether a conflict of interest exists. 

Director Independence 

Board Independence 

The Board has determined that
each of Messrs. Fenton and Wald and Ms. Simril satisfies the criteria for being an independent director in accordance with
the applicable Nasdaq Rules and has no material relationship with the Company other than by virtue of his or her service on the Board.
A full list of current Directors is set forth in Item 10. Directors , Executive Officers and Corporate Governance-Information
About our Directors . 

Committee Independence 

The Audit Committee currently
consists of Mr. Fenton, Ms. Simril and Mr. Wald, as chairman, each of whom is independent for purposes of membership on that committee,
as determined in accordance with the applicable Nasdaq Rules and Rule 10A-3 under the Exchange Act. The Compensation Committee currently
consists of Mr. Fenton, as chairman, and Mr. Wald, each of whom is an independent director for purposes of membership on that committee,
as determined in accordance with the Compensation Committee charter and applicable Nasdaq Rules. The Governance Committee currently consists
of Mr. Wald, as chairman, and Ms. Simril, each of whom is independent, as determined in accordance with the applicable Nasdaq Rules. 

Controlled Company Status 

As of November 13, 2024, Steel
Holdings, directly and indirectly, owned approximately 89.9 , and, when combined with its affiliated entities and individuals who are
members of a Section 13(d) group with Steel Holdings and its affiliated entities, 91.0 , of our outstanding Common Stock (in each case,
assuming conversion of the Convertible Senior Note, the Series C Preferred Stock and the Series E Preferred Stock). Each of Mr. Lichtenstein,
our Interim Chief Executive Officer, a Director and the Executive Chairman of our Board, and Mr. Howard, a member of our Board, is a member
of this Section 13(d) group. For more information, see Item 12. Security Ownership of Certain Beneficial Owners and Management
and Related Stockholder Matters . 

16 

As a result, we are a controlled
company within the meaning of the applicable Nasdaq Rules. Under the Nasdaq Rules, a company of which more than 50 of the voting
power for the election of directors is held by an individual, group or another company is a controlled company and may elect
not to comply with certain Nasdaq corporate governance requirements, including: (i) the requirement that a majority of the Board consist
of independent directors; (ii) the requirement that we have director nominees selected or recommended for the Board s selection,
either by a majority vote of only the independent directors or by a nomination committee comprised solely of independent directors, with
a written charter or Board resolution addressing the nominations process; and (iii) the requirement that we have a compensation committee
that is composed entirely of independent directors with a written charter addressing the committee s purpose and responsibilities.
We currently rely on this exemption only with respect to our Board; a majority of our Board is not independent. While we do not plan to
rely on any of the other exemptions, we may do so in the future. Currently, each of our Audit Committee, Compensation Committee and Governance
Committee is fully independent and has its own charter and maintain charters in line with the Nasdaq Rules.
