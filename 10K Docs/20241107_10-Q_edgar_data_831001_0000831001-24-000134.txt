Non-GAAP Financial Measures 
 Citi prepares its financial statements in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) and also presents certain non-GAAP financial measures (non-GAAP measures) that exclude certain items or otherwise include components that differ from the most directly comparable measures calculated in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Citi believes the presentation of these non-GAAP measures provides a meaningful depiction of the underlying fundamentals of period-to-period operating results for investors, industry analysts and others, including increased transparency and clarity into Citi s results, and improved visibility into management decisions and their impacts on operational performance; enables better comparison to peer companies; and allows Citi to provide a long-term strategic view of its businesses and results going forward. These non-GAAP measures are not intended as a substitute for GAAP 

financial measures and may not be defined or calculated the same way as non-GAAP measures with similar names used by other companies. 
 Citi s non-GAAP financial measures in this Form 10-Q include: 
 
 Revenues excluding divestiture-related impacts 
 Expenses excluding the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) special assessment and divestiture-related impacts 
 All Other (managed basis), which excludes divestiture-related impacts 
 Tangible common equity (TCE), return on tangible common equity (RoTCE) and tangible book value per share (TBVPS) 
 Banking and Corporate Lending revenues excluding gain (loss) on loan hedges 
 Services non-interest revenue excluding the impact of the Argentine peso devaluation 
 Non- Markets net interest income 
 
 Citi s results excluding divestiture-related impacts exclude items that are incurred and recognized, which are wholly and necessarily a consequence of actions taken to sell (including through a public offering), dispose of or wind down business activities associated with Citi s previously announced exit markets within All Other Legacy Franchises. Citi s Chief Executive Officer, its chief operating decision maker, regularly reviews financial information for All Other on a managed basis that excludes these divestiture-related impacts. For more information on Citi s results excluding divestiture-related impacts, see Executive Summary and All Other Divestiture-Related Impacts (Reconciling Items) below.

MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION 
 AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 
 
 Third Quarter of 2024 Continued Progress on Strategy Execution and Other Priorities 
 As described further throughout this Executive Summary, during the third quarter of 2024: 
 
 Citi s revenues increased 1 versus the prior-year period on a reported basis. Excluding divestiture-related impacts, which included an approximate 400 million gain from the sale of the Taiwan consumer banking business in the prior-year period, revenues increased 3 , driven by growth across all reportable operating segments, partially offset by a decline in revenues in All Other (managed basis). 
 Citi s expenses decreased 2 versus the prior-year period. Excluding divestiture-related impacts in both the current quarter and the prior-year period and a 56 million FDIC special assessment benefit in the current quarter, expenses decreased 1 . The decrease was primarily driven by savings associated with Citi s organizational simplification and stranded cost reductions, partially offset by volume-related expenses and continued investments in Citi s transformation and other risk and control initiatives. (See Expenses below.) 
 Citi s cost of credit was approximately 2.7 billion versus 1.8 billion in the prior-year period. The increase was largely driven by higher cards net credit losses in Branded Cards and Retail Services in U.S. Personal Banking USPB and a higher allowance for credit losses (ACL) build. The higher cards net credit losses primarily reflected the continued maturation of multiple cards loan vintages originated in recent years, impacted by unprecedented levels of government stimulus during the pandemic. In addition, the higher ACL build was primarily driven by changes in portfolio composition in the corporate portfolio and an increase in transfer risk reserves associated with unremittable corporate dividends. 
 Citi returned 2.1 billion to common shareholders in the form of common dividends and share repurchases. 
 Citigroup s Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1) Capital ratio under the Basel III Standardized Approach increased to 13.7 as of September 30, 2024, compared to 13.6 as of September 30, 2023 (see Capital Resources below). This compares to Citigroup s required regulatory CET1 Capital ratio of 12.3 as of September 30, 2024 and 12.0 as of September 30, 2023 under the Basel III Standardized Approach. Effective October 1, 2024, Citigroup s required regulatory CET1 Capital ratio decreased to 12.1 from 12.3 under the Standardized Approach, reflecting the decrease in the Stress Capital Buffer (SCB) requirement to 4.1 from 4.3 (see Capital Resources Stress Capital Buffer below). 
 Citi also continued to make progress with the separation of its consumer banking and small business and middle-market banking operations in Mexico in preparation for a planned initial public offering and wind-downs of the 

Korea and China consumer banking businesses and the Russia consumer, local commercial and institutional businesses. 
 
 Third Quarter of 2024 Results Summary 
 
 Citigroup 
 Citigroup reported net income of 3.2 billion, or 1.51 per share, compared to net income of 3.5 billion, or 1.63 per share in the prior-year period. Net income decreased 9 versus the prior-year period, driven by the higher cost of credit, partially offset by the higher revenue and the lower expenses. Citigroup s effective tax rate in the current quarter was approximately 25 , relatively unchanged from the prior-year period. Average diluted shares outstanding decreased 1 . 
 Citigroup revenues of 20.3 billion increased 1 versus the prior-year period, on a reported basis. Excluding the divestiture-related impacts in both periods, revenues of 20.3 billion increased 3 , driven by growth across all reportable operating segments, partially offset by a decline in All Other (managed basis). (For additional information on the divestiture-related impacts, see All Other Divestiture-Related Impacts (Reconciling Items) below.) (As used throughout this Form 10-Q, Citi s results of operations and financial condition excluding divestiture-related impacts are non-GAAP financial measures.) 
 Services revenues were primarily driven by higher non-interest revenues in Securities Services and Treasury and Trade Solutions (TTS). Markets revenues were largely driven by strength in Equity Markets, while Banking revenues largely reflected growth in Investment Banking. USPB revenues benefited from loan growth in cards, as well as lower partner payments, and Wealth revenues were primarily driven by higher investment fee revenue. 
 Citigroup s end-of-period loans were 689 billion, up 3 versus the prior-year period, largely reflecting loan growth in cards in USPB and higher loans in Markets and Services . 
 Citigroup s end-of-period deposits were approximately 1.3 trillion, up 3 versus the prior-year period, largely due to an increase in Services , driven by the continued deepening of client relationships and operating deposit growth in both TTS and Securities Services. For additional information about Citi s deposits by business, including drivers and deposit trends, see each applicable business s results of operations and Liquidity Risk Deposits below. 
 
 Expenses 
 Citigroup s operating expenses of 13.3 billion decreased 2 from the prior-year period. Expenses in the third quarter of 2024 included divestiture-related impacts of 67 million (compared to 114 million in the prior-year period). Excluding divestiture-related impacts in both periods and a 56 million FDIC special assessment benefit in the current quarter, expenses decreased 1 , driven by savings associated with Citi s organizational simplification and stranded cost reductions, partially offset by volume-related expenses and 

4 

continued investments in the transformation and other risk and control initiatives. Citi s transformation initiatives will continue to entail significant investments during the remainder of 2024 and beyond. For more information about Citi s transformation, see Citi s Multiyear Transformation below. (As used throughout this Form 10-Q, Citi s results of operations and financial condition excluding divestiture-related impacts and the incremental FDIC special assessment benefit are non-GAAP financial measures.) 
 
 Cost of Credit 
 Citi s total provisions for credit losses and for benefits and claims was a cost of 2.7 billion, compared to 1.8 billion in the prior-year period. The increase was primarily driven by higher net credit losses in Branded Cards and Retail Services in USPB and a higher ACL build. The higher cards net credit losses primarily reflected continued maturation of multiple cards loan vintages originated in recent years, impacted by unprecedented levels of government stimulus during the pandemic. In addition, the increase was due to macroeconomic pressures related to the elevated inflationary and interest rate environment impacting both cards portfolios, with lower FICO band customers primarily driving the increase. The increase in the net ACL build was due to changes in portfolio composition in the corporate portfolio, an increase in transfer risk reserves associated with unremittable corporate dividends and loan growth in the consumer portfolio. 
 For additional information on Citi s ACL, see Significant Accounting Policies and Significant Estimates Citi s Allowance for Credit Losses (ACL) below. 
 Net credit losses of 2.2 billion increased 33 from the prior-year period. Consumer net credit losses of 2.1 billion increased 33 , largely reflecting the higher cards net credit losses. Corporate net credit losses increased to 74 million from 58 million. Citi continues to expect elevated consumer net credit losses in the fourth quarter of 2024. 
 For additional information on Citi s consumer and corporate credit costs, see each respective business s results of operations and Credit Risk below. 
 
 Capital 
 Citigroup s CET1 Capital ratio was 13.7 as of September 30, 2024, compared to 13.6 as of September 30, 2023, based on the Basel III Standardized Approach for determining risk-weighted assets (RWA). The increase was primarily driven by the net income and unrealized gains on available-for-sale securities recognized in Accumulated other comprehensive income (AOCI) , partially offset by the payment of common and preferred dividends, common share repurchases and an increase in RWA. 
 In the third quarter of 2024, Citi paid approximately 1.1 billion of common dividends and repurchased approximately 1.0 billion of common shares (see Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities, Repurchases of Equity Securities and Dividends below). Citi will continue to determine the level of common share repurchases on a quarter-by-quarter basis given the uncertainty regarding future regulatory capital requirements. For additional information on capital-related risks, trends and uncertainties, see Capital Resources Regulatory Capital Standards and Developments below and 

Risk Factors Strategic Risks, Operational Risks and Compliance Risks in Citi s 2023 Form 10-K. 
 Citigroup s Supplementary Leverage ratio as of September 30, 2024 was 5.8 , compared to 6.0 as of September 30, 2023. The decrease was driven by an increase in Total Leverage Exposure and a decrease in Tier 1 Capital. For additional information on Citi s capital ratios and related components, see Capital Resources below. 
 
 Services 
 Services net income of 1.7 billion increased 23 from the prior-year period, driven by higher revenues, partially offset by higher expenses and higher cost of credit. Services expenses of 2.6 billion increased 3 , primarily driven by continued investments in technology, other risk and controls, and product innovation. Cost of credit was 127 million, compared to 95 million in the prior-year period. The current-quarter ACL build was primarily due to an increase in transfer risk associated with unremittable corporate dividends outside of the U.S. being held on behalf of clients, driven by safety and soundness considerations under U.S. banking law. 
 Services revenues of 5.0 billion increased 8 , primarily reflecting continued momentum across Securities 
 Services and TTS. Non-interest revenue increased 33 , driven by a smaller impact from currency devaluation in Argentina, as well as continued strength across underlying fee drivers. Excluding the impact of the Argentine peso devaluation (approximately 42 million in the current quarter and approximately 273 million in the prior-year period), non-interest revenue increased 11 . Net interest income was largely unchanged, as the benefit of higher deposit volumes was offset by a decline in interest rates in Argentina. (As used throughout this Form 10-Q, Services non-interest revenue excluding the impact of the Argentine peso devaluation is a non-GAAP financial measure.) 
 TTS revenues of 3.6 billion increased 4 from the prior-year period. TTS non-interest revenue increased 41 , primarily driven by the smaller impact from currency devaluation in Argentina, an increase in cross-border transaction value of 8 , an increase in U.S. dollar clearing volume of 7 and an increase in commercial card spend volume of 8 . The increase in non-interest revenue was partially offset by a 5 decline in net interest income, driven by the decline in interest rates in Argentina, partially offset by higher deposit volumes. 
 Securities Services revenues of 1.4 billion increased 24 , largely driven by a 23 increase in net interest income, primarily driven by higher deposit spreads and volumes, and a 24 increase in non-interest revenue. The increase in non-interest revenue was primarily driven by higher fees due to a 22 increase in AUC/AUA balances, benefiting from new client onboarding, deepening relationships with existing clients and higher market valuations. 
 For additional information about Citi s exposure in Argentina, see Managing Global Risk Other Risk Country Risk Argentina below. For additional information on the results of operations of Services in the third quarter of 2024, see Services below. 

5 

Markets 
 Markets net income of 1.1 billion increased 2 from the prior-year period, driven by higher revenues and lower cost of credit, partially offset by higher expenses. Markets expenses of 3.3 billion increased 1 , primarily due to higher volume-related expenses. Cost of credit was 141 million versus 162 million in the prior-year period. The current-quarter net ACL build was primarily driven by changes in portfolio composition in spread products. 
 Markets revenues of 4.8 billion increased 1 , driven by growth in Equity Markets, up 32 , partially offset by a 6 decline in Fixed Income Markets. Equity Markets benefited from growth in prime services and higher volatility in equity derivatives, as well as higher cash equity volumes. The decline in Fixed Income Markets largely reflected a decline in rates and currencies revenues, partially offset by higher revenues in spread products and other fixed income. Rates and currencies revenues decreased 10 , reflecting a strong prior-year performance. Spread products and other fixed income revenues increased 5 , driven by growth in asset-backed financing, securitization activity and underwriting fees, partially offset by lower commodities revenue on lower gas volatility. 
 For additional information on the results of operations of Markets in the third quarter of 2024, see Markets below. 
 
 Banking 
 Banking net income was 238 million, compared to net income of 156 million in the prior-year period, driven by higher revenues and lower expenses, partially offset by higher cost of credit. Banking expenses of 1.1 billion decreased 9 , primarily driven by benefits from prior repositioning actions. Cost of credit was 177 million, versus a benefit of 56 million in the prior-year period, driven by a net ACL build due to changes in portfolio composition. 
 Banking revenues of 1.6 billion increased 16 , primarily driven by growth in Investment Banking. Investment Banking revenues increased 31 , reflecting strength in Debt Capital Markets (DCM), which benefited from strong issuance activity in the quarter, an increase in Advisory due to strong announced deal volume from earlier this year coming to fruition as those deals close and an increase in Equity Capital Markets (ECM) reflecting stronger follow-on activity, partially offset by less initial public offering (IPO) activity amid market volatility mid quarter. Corporate Lending revenues were largely unchanged, including the impact of the gain (loss) on loan hedges. Excluding the gain (loss) on loan hedges, Corporate Lending revenues increased 5 , largely driven by a smaller impact from currency devaluation in Argentina. (As used throughout this Form 10-Q, Citi s results of operations and financial condition excluding the impact of the gains (losses) on loan hedges are non-GAAP financial measures.) 
 For additional information on the results of operations of Banking in the third quarter of 2024, see Banking below. 

U.S. Personal Banking 
 USPB net income of 522 million decreased 31 from the prior-year period, driven by higher cost of credit, partially offset by higher revenues and lower expenses. USPB expenses of 2.5 billion decreased 1 , driven by continued productivity savings, partially offset by higher volume-related expenses. Cost of credit increased to 1.9 billion, compared to 1.5 billion in the prior-year period, driven by higher net credit losses, partially offset by a lower net ACL build. Net credit losses increased 39 , primarily reflecting the continued maturation of multiple cards loan vintages originated in recent years, impacted by unprecedented levels of government stimulus during the pandemic. In addition, the increase was due to macroeconomic pressures related to the elevated inflationary and interest rate environment impacting both cards portfolios, with lower FICO band customers primarily driving the increase. The ACL build of 45 million was primarily driven by loan growth. 
 USPB revenues of 5.0 billion increased 3 , driven by an increase in net interest income due to loan growth in cards, and higher non-interest revenue due to lower partner payments. Branded Cards revenues of 2.7 billion increased 8 , driven by interest-earning balance growth of 8 , as payment rates continued to moderate, and card spend volume growth of 3 . Retail Services revenues of 1.7 billion decreased 1 , primarily driven by a slowing growth rate in interest-earning balances and higher reversals of interest from net credit losses. Retail Banking revenues of 599 million decreased 8 , primarily driven by the impact of the transfers of certain relationships and the associated deposits to Wealth . 
 For additional information on the results of operations of USPB in the third quarter of 2024, see U.S. Personal Banking below. 
 
 Wealth 
 Wealth net income was 283 million, versus 132 million in the prior-year period, reflecting higher revenues and lower expenses, partially offset by higher cost of credit. Wealth expenses decreased 4 to 1.6 billion, primarily driven by benefits from prior repositioning and restructuring actions. Cost of credit was 33 million, compared to a benefit of 2 million in the prior-year period, largely due to an ACL build for loans, compared to a release in the prior-year period. 
 Wealth revenues of 2.0 billion increased 9 , driven by a 15 increase in non-interest revenue, reflecting higher investment fee revenues on momentum in client investment assets, as well as a 6 increase in net interest income due to higher deposit volumes and spreads. Private Bank revenues of 614 million were largely unchanged from the prior-year period. Wealth at Work revenues of 244 million increased 4 , driven by improved deposit spreads and higher investment fee revenues, partially offset by higher mortgage funding costs. Citigold revenues of 1.1 billion increased 17 , driven by higher investment fee revenues and higher deposit volumes. 
 For additional information on the results of operations of Wealth in the third quarter of 2024, see Wealth below. 

6 

All Other (Managed Basis) 
 All Other (managed basis) net loss was 483 million, compared to a net loss of 101 million in the prior-year period, driven by lower revenues and higher cost of credit, partially offset by lower expenses. All Other (managed basis) expenses of 2.1 billion decreased 5 , primarily driven by lower expenses from the closed exits and wind-downs, partially offset by a legal reserve. Cost of credit of 289 million increased 45 , largely reflecting a net ACL build driven by Mexico Consumer, compared to an ACL release in the prior-year period. 
 All Other (managed basis) revenues decreased 18 from the prior-year period, primarily driven by lower revenues in Corporate/Other and Legacy Franchises (managed basis). Legacy Franchises (managed basis) revenues were 1.7 billion, a decline of 6 from the prior-year period, largely driven by lower revenues in Asia Consumer (managed basis) due to the closed exits and wind-downs. Corporate/Other revenues decreased to 86 million, from 397 million in the prior-year period, largely driven by margin compression on mortgage securities in the investment portfolio that have extended. 
 For additional information on the results of operations of All Other (managed basis) in the third quarter of 2024, see All Other Divestiture-Related Impacts (Reconciling Items) and All Other (Managed Basis) below. 
 
 Macroeconomic and Other Risks and Uncertainties 
 Various geopolitical, macroeconomic and regulatory challenges and uncertainties continue to pose risks to economic conditions in the U.S. and globally, including, among others, potential policy and other changes resulting from the incoming U.S. administration and Congress, central bank interest rate policies, unemployment levels, economic growth rates, conflicts in the Middle East, economic conditions and tensions involving China and the Russia Ukraine war. These and other factors could negatively impact global economic growth rates, result in disruptions and volatility in financial markets and cause a recession in various regions and countries globally. These and other factors could also adversely affect Citi s customers, clients, businesses, funding costs, cost of credit and overall results of operations and financial condition during the remainder of 2024. For a further discussion of trends, uncertainties and risks that will or could impact Citi s businesses, results of operations, capital and other financial conditions during the remainder of 2024, see Third Quarter of 2024 Results Summary above and each respective business s results of operations, Managing Global Risk, including Managing Global Risk Other Risks Country Risk Russia and Argentina, and Forward-Looking Statements below and Risk Factors in Citi s 2023 Form 10-K. 

CITI S MULTIYEAR TRANSFORMATION 
 
 As previously disclosed, Citi s transformation, including the remediation of its 2020 consent orders with the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (FRB) and Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) and the amendment to the 2020 OCC consent order, is a multiyear endeavor that is not linear. Citi is modernizing and simplifying the Company in order to lead in a dynamic, competitive and digital world. Citi s transformation is addressing decades of underinvestment in its infrastructure, going beyond remedying regulatory concerns to intentionally transform how the organization operates, and making investments that not only support current needs, but also benefit the Company over the long term. For additional information on Citi s transformation, including focus areas and status, consent order compliance, governance and transformation bonus program, see Citi s Multiyear Transformation in Citi s Second Quarter of 2024 Form 10-Q. 
 Transformation efforts of this scale involve significant complexities and uncertainties, including ongoing regulatory challenges and risks. Citi s transformation initiatives will take several years to complete, and, as previously disclosed, Citi may continue to experience significant challenges in satisfying the regulators expectations in both sufficiency and timing. For additional information about regulatory risks related to Citi s transformation initiatives, see Risk Factors Compliance Risks in Citi s 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K. 
 The transformation s target outcomes remain focused on changing Citi s business and operating models such that they simultaneously (i) strengthen controls, enhance data quality, reduce risk and improve Citi s regulatory compliance and its culture, and (ii) enhance Citi s value to customers, clients and shareholders.

 Closed the 2013 consent order with the FRB related to anti-money laundering and Bank Secrecy Act deficiencies 
 Retired approximately 450 legacy applications through third-quarter 2024 year-to-date, and over 1,250 since 2022, as Citi continued to modernize its technology infrastructure 
 Launched a strategic operations capacity planning tool, which is assisting Citi to streamline and replace various systems and forecast resources needed for expected processing volumes 
 Continued implementation of a strategic loan servicing platform, with live transactions on the platform increasing to approximately 25 billion in notional value 
 Reduced data center consumption through migration of workload to a private cloud and streamlined and reduced the time involved in the cloud onboarding process from over seven weeks to two weeks 
 Upgraded 100 of Citi s over 2,300 ATMs in North America, Singapore, Hong Kong and the UAE to next-generation software for better customer security and monitoring

SERVICES 

Services includes Treasury and Trade Solutions (TTS) and Securities Services. TTS provides an integrated suite of tailored cash management, trade and working capital solutions to multinational corporations, financial institutions and public sector organizations. Securities Services provides cross-border support for clients, including on-the-ground local market expertise, post-trade technologies, customized data solutions and a wide range of securities services solutions that can be tailored to meet clients needs. 
 Services revenue is generated primarily from spreads and fees associated with these activities. Services earns spread revenue through generating deposits, as well as interest on loans. Revenue generated from these activities is primarily recorded in Net interest income . Fee income is earned for assisting clients with transactional services and clearing. Revenue generated from these activities is recorded in Commissions and fees . Revenue is also generated from assets under custody and administration and is recognized when the associated service is satisfied, which normally occurs at the point in time the service is requested by the client and provided by Citi. Revenue generated from these activities is primarily recorded in Administration and other fiduciary fees . For additional information on these various types of revenues, see Note 5. Services revenues also include revenues earned by Citi that are subject to a revenue sharing arrangement with Banking Corporate Lending for Investment Banking, Markets and Services products sold to Corporate Lending clients. 
 At September 30, 2024, Services had 608 billion in assets and 826 billion in deposits. Securities Services managed 26.3 trillion in assets under custody and administration, of which Citi provided both custody and administrative services to certain clients related to 2.1 trillion of such assets.

 3Q24 vs. 3Q23 
 Net income of 1.7 billion increased 23 , driven by higher revenues, partially offset by higher expenses and higher cost of credit. 
 Revenues increased 8 , primarily reflecting higher revenues in Securities Services and TTS. The increase in revenues was driven by higher non-interest revenue (up 33 ), largely due to a smaller impact of the Argentine peso devaluation. Excluding the impact of the Argentine peso devaluation (approximately 42 million in the current quarter and approximately 273 million in the prior-year period), non-interest revenue increased 11 , driven by continued strength across underlying fee drivers in TTS and Securities Services. Net interest income was largely unchanged, as the benefit of higher deposit volumes was offset by a decline in interest rates in Argentina. Average deposits increased 4 , driven by growth in both Securities Services and TTS, as Citi continued to increase operating deposits in both businesses. 
 TTS revenues increased 4 , as a 41 increase in non-interest revenues was partially offset by a 5 decrease in net interest income. The increase in non-interest revenue was driven by the smaller impact from currency devaluation in Argentina, as well as growth in underlying fee drivers, including cross-border transaction value (up 8 ), U.S. dollar clearing volume (up 7 and commercial card spend volume (up 8 ). The decrease in net interest income was driven by the 

decline in interest rates in Argentina, partially offset by higher deposit volumes. Average deposits increased 2 , driven by growth in both North America and International. For additional information about Citi s exposure in Argentina, see Managing Global Risk Other Risk Country Risk Argentina below. 
 Securities Services revenues increased 24 , largely driven by a 23 increase in net interest income, primarily driven by higher deposit spreads and volumes, and a 24 increase in non-interest revenue. Average deposits increased 13 , driven by growth in both North America and International. The growth in non-interest revenue was primarily driven by the increase in volume-related fees due to a 22 increase in AUC/AUA balances, benefiting from new client onboarding, deepening relationships with existing clients and higher market valuations, as well as continued elevated levels of corporate activity in Issuer Services. 
 Expenses increased 3 , primarily driven by continued investments in technology, other risk and controls and product innovation. 
 Provisions were 127 million, compared to 95 million in the prior-year period. The current-quarter net ACL build of 113 million, compared to 68 million in the prior-year period, was largely due to an increase in transfer risk associated with unremittable corporate dividends outside the U.S. being held on behalf of clients, driven by safety and 

13 

soundness considerations under U.S. banking law. See Significant Accounting Policies and Significant Estimates below.

 3Q24 YTD vs. 3Q23 YTD 
 Net income of 4.6 billion increased 20 , primarily driven by higher revenues and lower cost of credit, partially offset by higher expenses. 
 Revenues increased 7 , driven by higher revenues in both Securities Services and TTS, reflecting higher non-interest revenue and higher net interest income. 
 TTS revenues increased 3 , driven by a 21 increase in non-interest revenue, partially offset by a 1 decrease in net interest income, largely driven by the same factors described above. The increase in non-interest revenue was driven by the smaller impact from currency devaluation in Argentina, as well as continued growth in underlying fee drivers, including higher cross-border transaction value (up 8 ), U.S. dollar clearing volume (up 6 and commercial card spend volume (up 6 ). 
 Securities Services revenues increased 17 , driven by 18 growth in net interest income and 17 growth in non-interest revenue. The increase in net interest income was driven by spread improvement from higher interest rates across currencies and deposit mix. The increase in non-interest revenue was driven by the same factors described above. 
 Expenses were up 7 , primarily driven by continued investments in technology, other risk and controls and product innovation, as well as an Argentina-related transaction tax expense and a legal settlement expense in the second quarter of 2024. 
 Provisions were 164 million, compared to 304 million in the prior-year period. Net credit losses decreased to 20 million, compared to 46 million in the prior-year period. The net ACL build was 144 million, compared to 258 million in the prior-year period. The net ACL build in the current period was primarily driven by an increase in transfer risk associated with unremittable corporate dividends outside the U.S. being held on behalf of clients, driven by safety and soundness considerations under U.S. banking law, partially offset by an improved macroeconomic outlook.

MARKETS 
 
 Markets provides corporate, institutional and public sector clients around the world with a full range of sales and trading services across equities, foreign exchange, rates, spread products and commodities. The range of services includes market-making across asset classes, risk management solutions, financing, prime brokerage, research, securities clearing and settlement. 
 As a market maker, Markets facilitates transactions, including holding product inventory to meet client demand, and earns the differential between the price at which it buys and sells the products. These price differentials and the unrealized gains and losses on the inventory are recorded in Principal transactions . Other primarily includes realized gains and losses on available-for-sale (AFS) debt securities, gains and losses on equity securities not held in trading accounts and other non-recurring gains and losses. Interest income earned on assets held, less interest paid on long- and short-term debt, secured funding transactions and customer deposits, is recorded as Net interest income. 
 The amount and types of Markets revenues are impacted by a variety of interrelated factors, including market liquidity; changes in market variables such as interest rates, foreign exchange rates, equity prices, commodity prices and credit spreads, as well as their implied volatilities; investor confidence; and other macroeconomic conditions. Markets revenues include revenues earned by Citi that are subject to a revenue sharing arrangement with Banking Corporate Lending for Investment Banking, Markets and Services products sold to Corporate Lending clients. 
 Assuming all other market conditions do not change, increases in client activity levels or bid/offer spreads generally result in increases in revenues. However, changes in market conditions can significantly impact client activity levels, bid/offer spreads and the fair value of product inventory. Management of the Markets businesses involves daily monitoring and evaluation of the above factors. 
 Markets international presence is supported by trading floors in approximately 80 countries and a proprietary network in 95 countries and jurisdictions.

 3Q24 vs. 3Q23 
 Net income of 1.1 billion increased 2 , driven by higher revenues and lower cost of credit, partially offset by higher expenses. 
 Revenues increased 1 , driven by higher Equity Markets revenues, partially offset by lower Fixed Income Markets revenues. 
 Fixed Income Markets revenues decreased 6 , reflecting a decline in rates and currencies revenues, partially offset by higher revenues in spread products and other fixed income. Rates and currencies revenues decreased 10 on strong prior-year performance, partially offset by growth in FX on higher corporate client activity. Spread products and other fixed income revenues increased 5 , driven by growth in asset-backed financing, securitization activity and underwriting fees. This revenue growth was partially offset by a decline in commodities revenues on lower overall volatility. 
 Equity Markets revenues increased 32 , driven by growth in prime services, higher volatility in equity derivatives and higher cash equity volumes. Equity Markets continued to grow prime balances. 
 Expenses increased 1 , driven by higher volume-related expenses, partially offset by efficiency savings. 

Provisions were 141 million, compared to 162 million in the prior-year period, driven by a lower net ACL build of 117 million, compared to 166 million in the prior-year period, partially offset by higher net credit losses. The net ACL build in the current quarter was primarily driven by changes in portfolio composition in spread products .

 3Q24 vs. 3Q23 
 Net income was 238 million, compared to net income of 156 million in the prior-year period, driven by higher revenues and lower expenses, partially offset by an increase in cost of credit. 
 Revenues increased 16 (including losses on loan hedges), reflecting higher Investment Banking revenues, largely driven by continued strong issuance activity in Debt Capital Markets (DCM) and strong deal volume in Advisory. The losses on loan hedges increased to 79 million, compared to 47 million in the prior-year period. Excluding the impact of losses on loan hedges, Banking revenues increased 18 . 
 Investment Banking revenues increased 31 , reflecting overall higher banking fees revenue. DCM underwriting fees increased 75 , benefiting from strong issuance activity in the quarter, primarily in investment-grade activity, as clients pulled forward activity ahead of the U.S. election. Citi expects normalization and ordinary seasonality in investment-grade activity in the fourth quarter of 2024. Advisory fees increased 32 , due to strong announced deal volume from earlier this year coming to fruition as those transactions close. ECM underwriting fees increased 5 , due to stronger follow-on activity, partially offset by less IPO activity amid market volatility mid quarter. 

Corporate Lending revenues were largely unchanged, including the impact of losses on loan hedges. Excluding the impact of losses on loan hedges, Corporate Lending revenues increased 5 , primarily driven by a smaller impact from currency devaluation in Argentina. 
 Expenses decreased 9 , primarily driven by benefits of prior repositioning actions and other actions to lower the expense base. 
 Provisions were 177 million, compared to a benefit of 56 million in the prior-year period, driven by a net ACL build of 141 million, compared to a net release of 85 million in the prior-year period.

3Q24 vs. 3Q23 
 Net income was 522 million, compared to 756 million in the prior-year period, driven by higher cost of credit, partially offset by higher revenues and lower expenses. 
 Revenues increased 3 , due to higher net interest income (up 2 ), driven by loan growth in cards, as well as higher non-interest revenue (up 4 ). The increase in non-interest revenue was largely driven by lower partner payments in Retail Services, due to higher net credit losses. 
 Cards revenues increased 4 . Branded Cards revenues increased 8 , driven by interest-earning balance growth (up 8 ), as payment rates continued to moderate, and card spend volume growth. Branded Cards average loans increased 8 , also reflecting the lower card payment rates and higher card spend volume. Branded Cards card spend volume increased 3 , driven by higher FICO band customers. 
 Retail Services revenues decreased 1 , primarily driven by a slowing growth rate in interest-earnings balances and higher reversals of interest from net credit losses. The decrease in revenues was partially offset by higher non-interest revenue due to the lower partner payments, driven by the higher net credit losses (see Provisions below and Note 5). Retail Services average loans increased 2 , largely reflecting lower card payment rates, partially offset by lower card spend volume. Card spend volume decreased 7 , primarily due to continued lower in-store foot traffic. 
 Retail Banking revenues decreased 8 , primarily driven by the impact of the transfers of certain relationships and the associated deposit balances to Wealth . Average deposits decreased 23 , largely reflecting the transfers of certain relationships and the associated deposits to Wealth 26 billion at the time of transfer over the last 12 months). 
 Expenses decreased 1 , driven by continued productivity savings, partially offset by higher volume-related expenses. 
 Provisions were 1.9 billion, compared to 1.5 billion in the prior-year period, driven by higher net credit losses, partially offset by a lower net ACL build for loans. Net credit losses of 1.9 billion increased 39 , primarily reflecting the continued maturation of multiple cards loan vintages originated in recent years, impacted by unprecedented levels of government stimulus during the pandemic. In addition, the increase was driven by macroeconomic pressures related to the elevated inflationary and interest rate environment impacting both cards portfolios, with lower FICO band customers primarily driving the increase. Branded Cards net credit losses of 1.0 billion increased 41 , and Retail Services net credit losses of 0.8 billion increased 38 . 
 The net ACL build was 45 million, compared to 116 million in the prior-year period. The net ACL build in the current quarter primarily reflected loan growth. For additional information on Citi s ACL, see Significant Accounting Policies and Significant Estimates below.

 Revenues increased 9 , driven by higher non-interest revenue (up 15 ), reflecting higher investment fee revenues on momentum in client investment assets, as well as an increase in net interest income (up 6 ), driven by higher deposit volumes and spreads. 
 Client balances increased 14 , primarily driven by higher client investment assets (up 24 ), reflecting higher market valuations and strong net new assets generation. 
 Average deposits increased 4 , reflecting the transfers of relationships and the associated deposits from USPB 26 billion at the time of transfer over the last 12 months), partially offset by a shift in deposits to higher-yielding investments on Citi s platform. Average loans decreased 1 , as Wealth continued to optimize capital usage. 
 Private Bank revenues were largely unchanged, as the higher investment fee revenues and improved deposit spreads were offset by higher mortgage funding costs. 
 Wealth at Work revenues increased 4 , driven by improved deposit spreads and the higher investment fee revenues, partially offset by higher mortgage funding costs. 
 Citigold revenues increased 17 , driven by the higher investment fee revenues and higher deposit volumes. 
 Expenses decreased 4 , primarily driven by the benefits of prior repositioning and restructuring actions. 
 Provisions were a cost of 33 million, compared to a benefit of 2 million in the prior-year period, largely driven by a net ACL build for loans, compared to a release in the prior-year period. For additional information on Citi s ACL, see Significant Accounting Policies and Significant Estimates below.

 3Q24 YTD vs. 3Q23 YTD 
 Net income was 668 million, compared to 398 millio n in the p rior-year period, reflecting higher revenues, lower expenses and lower cost of credit. 
 Revenues increased 3 , largely driven by an increase in non-interest revenue (up 13 ), reflecting higher investment fee revenues, partially offset by lower net interest income (down 3 ), mainly due to lower deposit spreads and higher mortgage funding costs. 
 Private Bank revenues were largely unchanged. Wealth at Work revenues decreased 5 , driven by higher mortgage funding costs and lower deposit spreads, partially offset by higher investment fee revenues. Citigold revenues increased 6 , driven by higher investment fee revenues and higher deposit volumes. 
 Expenses decreased 2 , mainly driven by benefits from prior repositioning and restructuring actions, partially offset by higher volume-related expenses and technology investments focused on risk and controls and platform enhancements. 
 Provisions were a benefit of 146 million, compared to a benefit of 7 million in the prior-year period, largely driven by a higher net ACL release. The higher net ACL release was primarily driven by a change in the ACL associated with the margin lending portfolio.

3Q24 vs. 3Q23 
 Net loss was 483 million, compared to a net loss of 101 million in the prior-year period, driven by lower revenues and higher cost of credit, partially offset by lower expenses. 
 All Other (managed basis) revenues decreased 18 , driven by lower revenues in Corporate/Other and Legacy Franchises (managed basis). 
 Legacy Franchises (managed basis) revenues decreased 6 , mainly due to lower revenues in Asia Consumer (managed basis). 
 Mexico Consumer/SBMM (managed basis) revenues were largely unchanged, as higher revenues driven mainly by higher loan volumes and higher fee revenues were offset by the depreciation of the Mexican peso. Asia Consumer (managed basis) revenues decreased 33 , primarily driven by the closed exits and wind-downs. 
 Corporate/Other revenues decreased to 86 million, compared to 397 million in the prior-year period, largely driven by margin compression on mortgage securities in the investment portfolio that have extended. 
 Expenses decreased 5 , primarily driven by lower expenses from the closed exits and wind-downs, partially offset by a legal reserve. 
 Provisions were 289 million, compared to 199 million in the prior-year period, largely reflecting a net ACL build driven by Mexico Consumer, compared to an ACL release in the prior-year period. Net credit losses of 208 million decreased 12 , primarily driven by the impact from the wind-downs.

 All Other (managed basis) revenues decreased 16 , driven by lower revenues in Corporate/Other and Legacy Franchises (managed basis). 
 Legacy Franchises (managed basis) revenues decreased 5 , mainly due to lower revenues in Asia Consumer (managed basis) and Legacy Holdings Assets, partially offset by higher revenues in Mexico Consumer/SBMM (managed basis). 
 Mexico Consumer/SBMM (managed basis) revenues increased 12 , primarily due to higher loan balances in retail banking, cards and SBMM and higher deposits in SBMM. 
 Asia Consumer (managed basis) revenues decreased 47 , primarily driven by the closed exits and wind-downs. 
 Legacy Holdings Assets revenues decreased to (109) million, compared to 99 million in the prior-year period, primarily due to higher funding costs related to the transfer of the retail banking business in the U.K. 
 Corporate/Other revenues decreased to 896 million, compared to 1.8 billion in the prior-year period, largely driven by higher funding costs. 
 Expenses increased 2 , primarily driven by restructuring charges (see Note 9), the net incremental FDIC special assessment and an aggregate of 136 million of civil money penalties imposed by the FRB and OCC in the second quarter of 2024, partially offset by the closed exits and wind-downs. 
 Provisions were 718 million, compared to 844 million in the prior-year period, largely driven by a lower net ACL build, partially offset by a 6 increase in net credit losses, primarily due to higher lending volumes in Mexico Consumer.

CAPITAL RESOURCES 
 
 For additional information about capital resources, including Citi s capital management, regulatory capital buffers, the stress testing component of capital planning and current regulatory capital standards and developments, see Capital Resources and Risk Factors in Citi s 2023 Form 10-K. 
 During the third quarter of 2024, Citi returned a total of 2.1 billion of capital to common shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases. For additional information, see Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities, Repurchases of Equity Securities and Dividends below. 
 Citi paid common dividends of 0.56 per share for the third quarter of 2024, and on October 23, 2024, declared common dividends of 0.56 per share for the fourth quarter of 2024. Citi plans to maintain a quarterly common dividend of 0.56 per share, subject to financial and macroeconomic conditions as well as its Board of Directors approval. In addition, Citi repurchased approximately 1.0 billion of common shares during the third quarter of 2024. Citi will continue to determine the level of common share repurchases on a quarter-by-quarter basis given the uncertainty regarding future regulatory capital requirements. For additional information, see Regulatory Capital Standards and Developments below. 
 
 Common Equity Tier 1 Capital Ratio 
 Citi s Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1) Capital ratio under the Basel III Standardized Approach was 13.7 as of September 30, 2024, compared to 13.6 as of June 30, 2024 and 13.4 as of December 31, 2023, relative to a required regulatory CET1 Capital ratio of 12.3 as of such dates under the Standardized Approach. Citi s CET1 Capital ratio under the Basel III Advanced Approaches was 12.2 as of September 30, 2024 and June 30, 2024, and 12.1 as of December 31, 2023, relative to a required regulatory CET1 Capital ratio of 10.5 as of such dates under the Advanced Approaches framework. 
 Citi s CET1 Capital ratio increased under the Standardized Approach from June 30, 2024, driven primarily by net income and unrealized gains on available-for-sale securities recognized in AOCI , partially offset by an increase in Standardized Approach RWA, the payment of common and preferred dividends and common share repurchases. The CET1 Capital ratio under the Advanced Approaches framework remained largely unchanged from June 30, 2024, as net income and unrealized gains on available-for-sale securities recognized in AOCI were offset by the payment of common and preferred dividends and common share repurchases, as well as an increase in Advanced Approaches RWA. Citi s CET1 Capital ratio increased under both the Standardized Approach and Advanced Approaches from year-end 2023, primarily driven by year-to-date net income of 9.8 billion and unrealized gains on available-for-sale securities recognized in AOCI , partially offset by the payment of common and preferred dividends, common share repurchases and an increase in RWA. 

Stress Capital Buffer 
 In August 2024, the FRB confirmed Citi s Stress Capital Buffer (SCB) requirement of 4.1 , decreased from 4.3 , for the four-quarter window from October 1, 2024 to September 30, 2025. 
 Accordingly, effective October 1, 2024, Citi s required regulatory CET1 Capital ratio decreased to 12.1 from 12.3 under the Standardized Approach, incorporating the 4.1 SCB through September 30, 2025 and Citi s current GSIB surcharge of 3.5 . Citi s required regulatory CET1 Capital ratio under the Advanced Approaches (using the fixed 2.5 Capital Conservation Buffer) remains unchanged at 10.5 . The SCB applies to Citigroup only; the regulatory capital framework applicable to Citibank, including the Capital Conservation Buffer, is unaffected by Citigroup s SCB. 
 For additional information regarding regulatory capital buffers, including the SCB and GSIB surcharge, see Capital Resources Regulatory Capital Buffers in Citi s 2023 Form 10-K.

 (1) Issuance costs of 63 million and 84 million related to outstanding noncumulative perpetual preferred stock at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively, were excluded from common stockholders equity and netted against such preferred stock in accordance with FRB regulatory reporting requirements, which differ from those under U.S. GAAP. 
 (2) Citi s regulatory capital ratios and components reflect certain deferrals based on the modified regulatory capital transition provision related to the CECL standard. See Capital Resources Regulatory Capital Treatment Modified Transition of the Current Expected Credit Losses Methodology in Citi s 2023 Form 10-K. 
 (3) Includes goodwill embedded in the valuation of significant common stock investments in unconsolidated financial institutions. 
 (4) Of Citi s 30.0 billion of net DTAs at September 30, 2024, 11.3 billion of net DTAs arising from net operating loss, foreign tax credit and general business credit tax carry-forwards, as well as 3.1 billion of DTAs arising from temporary differences that exceeded 10 /15 limitations, were excluded from Citi s CET1 Capital as of September 30, 2024. DTAs arising from net operating loss, foreign tax credit and general business credit tax carry-forwards are required to be entirely deducted from CET1 Capital under the U.S. Basel III rules. DTAs arising from temporary differences are required to be deducted from capital only if they exceed 10 /15 limitations under the U.S. Basel III rules.

(5) Assets subject to 10 /15 limitations include MSRs, DTAs arising from temporary differences and significant common stock investments in unconsolidated financial institutions. At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, this deduction related only to DTAs arising from temporary differences that exceeded the 10 limitation. 
 (6) Represents Citigroup Capital XIII trust preferred securities, which are permanently grandfathered as Tier 1 Capital under the U.S. Basel III rules. 
 (7) Under the Standardized Approach, the allowance for credit losses is eligible for inclusion in Tier 2 Capital up to 1.25 of credit risk-weighted assets, with any excess allowance for credit losses being deducted in arriving at credit risk-weighted assets, which differs from the Advanced Approaches framework, in which eligible credit reserves that exceed expected credit losses are eligible for inclusion in Tier 2 Capital to the extent that the excess reserves do not exceed 0.6 of credit risk-weighted assets. The total amount of eligible credit reserves in excess of expected credit losses that were eligible for inclusion in Tier 2 Capital, subject to limitation, under the Advanced Approaches framework were 5.1 billion and 3.9 billion at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively.

See Capital Resources Regulatory Capital Treatment Modified Transition of the Current Expected Credit Losses Methodology in Citi s 2023 Form 10-K. 
 (3) Under the Standardized Approach, the allowance for credit losses is eligible for inclusion in Tier 2 Capital up to 1.25 of credit risk-weighted assets, with any excess allowance for credit losses being deducted in arriving at credit risk-weighted assets, which differs from the Advanced Approaches framework, in which eligible credit reserves that exceed expected credit losses are eligible for inclusion in Tier 2 Capital to the extent that the excess reserves do not exceed 0.6 of credit risk-weighted assets. 
 (4) Citibank s binding CET1 Capital, Tier 1 Capital and Total Capital ratios were derived under the Basel III Advanced Approaches framework for all periods presented. 
 (5) Citibank must maintain required CET1 Capital, Tier 1 Capital, Total Capital and Leverage ratios of 6.5 , 8.0 , 10.0 and 5.0 , respectively, to be considered well capitalized under the revised Prompt Corrective Action (PCA) regulations applicable to insured depository institutions as established by the U.S. Basel III rules. Citibank must also maintain a required Supplementary Leverage ratio of 6.0 to be considered well capitalized. 
 (6) Leverage ratio denominator. Represents quarterly average total assets less amounts deducted from Tier 1 Capital. 
 (7) Supplementary Leverage ratio denominator. 
 
 As presented in the table above, Citibank s capital ratios at September 30, 2024 were in excess of the regulatory capital requirements under the U.S. Basel III rules. In addition, Citibank was well capitalized as of September 30, 2024. 
 Citibank s Supplementary Leverage ratio was 7.1 at September 30, 2024, compared to 7.0 at June 30, 2024 and 6.9 at December 31, 2023. The quarter-over-quarter increase was primarily driven by net income and unrealized gains on available-for-sale securities recognized in AOCI , partially offset by an increase in Total Leverage Exposure and the payment of common and preferred dividends. The ratio increased from the fourth quarter of 2023, primarily driven by year-to-date net income of 10.6 billion, partially offset by the payment of common and preferred dividends and an increase in Total Leverage Exposure.

Impact of Changes on Citigroup and Citibank Capital Ratios 
 The following tables present the hypothetical sensitivity of Citigroup s and Citibank s capital ratios to changes of 100 million in CET1 Capital, Tier 1 Capital and Total Capital (numerator), and changes of 1 billion in Advanced Approaches and Standardized Approach RWA and quarterly adjusted average total assets, as well as Total Leverage Exposure (denominator), as of September 30, 2024. This information is provided for the purpose of analyzing the 

impact that a change in Citigroup s or Citibank s financial position or results of operations could have on these ratios. These sensitivities only consider a single change to either a component of capital, RWA, quarterly adjusted average total assets or Total Leverage Exposure. Accordingly, an event that affects more than one factor may have a larger basis point impact than is reflected in these tables.

Citigroup Broker-Dealer Subsidiaries 
 At September 30, 2024, Citigroup Global Markets Inc., a U.S. broker-dealer registered with the SEC that is an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of Citigroup, had net capital, computed in accordance with the SEC s net capital rule, of 17 billion, which exceeded the minimum requirement by 12 billion. 
 Moreover, Citigroup Global Markets Limited, a broker-dealer registered with the United Kingdom s Prudential Regulation Authority (PRA) that is also an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of Citigroup, had total regulatory capital of 27 billion at September 30, 2024, which exceeded the PRA s minimum regulatory capital requirements. 
 In addition, certain of Citi s other broker-dealer subsidiaries are subject to regulation in the countries in which they do business, including requirements to maintain specified levels of net capital or its equivalent. Citigroup s other principal broker-dealer subsidiaries were in compliance with their regulatory capital requirements at September 30, 2024. 
 
 Total Loss-Absorbing Capacity (TLAC) 
 The table below details Citi s eligible external TLAC and long-term debt (LTD) amounts and ratios, and each TLAC and LTD regulatory requirement, as well as the surplus amount in dollars in excess of each requirement:

Regulatory Capital Standards and Developments 
 
 Basel III Revisions 
 On July 27, 2023, the U.S. banking agencies issued a notice of proposed rulemaking, known as the Basel III Endgame (capital proposal), that would amend U.S. regulatory capital requirements. Citi continues to monitor developments related to this rulemaking. 
 The capital proposal would maintain the current capital rule s dual-requirement structure for RWA, but would eliminate the use of internal models to calculate credit risk and operational risk components of RWA. The capital proposal would also replace the current market risk framework with a new standardized methodology and a new models-based methodology for calculating RWA for market risk. Large banking organizations, such as Citi, would be required to calculate their risk-based capital ratios under both the new expanded risk-based approach and the Standardized Approach and use the lower of the two for each risk-based capital ratio for determining the binding constraints. 
 The expanded risk-based approach is designed to align with the international capital standards adopted by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (Basel Committee). The Basel Committee finalized the Basel III reforms in December 2017, which included revisions to the methodologies to determine credit, market and operational RWA amounts. 
 If adopted as proposed, the capital proposal s impact on RWA amounts would also affect several other requirements including TLAC, external long-term debt and the short-term wholesale funding score included in the GSIB surcharge under method 2 (see GSIB Surcharge below). The proposal has a three-year transition period that would begin on July 1, 2025. If finalized as proposed, the capital proposal would materially increase Citi s required regulatory capital. 

For information about risks related to changes in regulatory capital requirements, see Risk Factors Strategic Risks, Operational Risks and Compliance Risks in Citi s 2023 Form 10-K. 
 
 GSIB Surcharge 
 Separately on July 27, 2023, the FRB proposed changes to the GSIB surcharge rule that aim to make it more risk sensitive. Proposed changes include measuring certain systemic indicators on a daily versus quarterly average basis, changing certain of the risk indicators and shortening the time to come into compliance with each year s surcharge. In addition, the proposal would narrow surcharge bands under method 2 from 50 bps to 10 bps to reduce cliff effects when moving between bands. 
 
 Long-Term Debt Requirements 
 On August 29, 2023, the FRB issued a notice of proposed rulemaking to amend the TLAC rule to change the haircuts (i.e., the percentage reductions) that are applied to eligible long-term debt. Under the proposed rule, only 50 of eligible long-term debt with a maturity of one year or more but less than two years would count toward the TLAC requirement, instead of the current 100 . These proposed revisions are estimated to decrease the TLAC percentage of Advanced Approaches RWA as well as the TLAC percentage of Total Leverage Exposure. The proposed rule in its current form has no proposed transition period for its implementation and is not expected to be material to Citi.

Tangible Common Equity, Book Value Per Share, Tangible Book Value Per Share and Return on Equity 
 Tangible common equity (TCE), as defined by Citi, represents common stockholders equity less goodwill and identifiable intangible assets (other than mortgage servicing rights (MSRs)). Return on tangible common equity (RoTCE) represents annualized net income available to common shareholders as a percentage of average TCE. Tangible book value per share (TBVPS) represents average TCE divided by average common shares outstanding. Other companies may calculate these measures differently. TCE, RoTCE and TBVPS are non-GAAP financial measures.

MANAGING GLOBAL RISK 
 
 For Citi, effective risk management is of primary importance to its overall operations. Accordingly, Citi s risk management process has been designed to monitor, evaluate and manage the principal risks it assumes in conducting its activities. Specifically, the activities that Citi engages in, and the risks those activities generate, must be consistent with Citi s Mission and Value Proposition and the key Leadership Principles that support it, as well as Citi s risk appetite. For more information on managing global risk at Citi, see Managing Global Risk in Citi s 2023 Form 10-K. 

CREDIT RISK 
 
 For more information on credit risk, including Citi s credit risk management, measurement and stress testing, and Citi s consumer and corporate credit portfolios, see Credit Risk and Risk Factors in Citi s 2023 Form 10-K. In addition, see Notes 14 and 15.

 On an average basis, loans increased 4 year-over-year and 1 sequentially. The year-over-year increase was largely due to growth in USPB , Markets and Services. 

As of the third quarter of 2024, average loans for: 
 
 USPB increased 7 year-over-year, driven by growth in Branded Cards, Retail Banking and Retail Services. 
 Wealth remained largely unchanged. 
 Services increased 5 year-over-year, primarily driven by strong demand in TTS for export and agency finance, as well as working capital loans. 
 Markets increased 10 year-over-year, largely driven by asset-backed lending in spread products, as well as margin loans in Equities. 
 Banking decreased 1 year-over-year, primarily driven by regulatory capital optimization efforts.

Portfolio Mix Geography and Counterparty 
 Citi s corporate credit portfolio is diverse across geography and counterparty. The following table presents the percentage of this portfolio across North America and the clusters within International, based on Citi s internal management geography: 
 
 September 30, 2024 June 30, 2024 December 31, 2023 North America 57 57 56 International 43 43 44 Total 100 100 100 International by cluster (percentages are based on total Citi) United Kingdom 11 12 11 Japan, Asia North and Australia (JANA) 7 7 7 LATAM 6 6 8 Asia South 5 5 5 Europe 11 11 11 Middle East and Africa (MEA) 3 3 3 
 
 The maintenance of accurate and consistent risk ratings across the corporate credit portfolio facilitates the comparison of credit exposure across all lines of business, geographies and products. Counterparty risk ratings reflect an estimated probability of default for a counterparty, and internal risk ratings are derived by leveraging validated statistical models and scorecards in combination with consideration of factors specific to the obligor or market, such as management experience, competitive position, regulatory environment and commodity prices. Facility risk ratings are assigned that reflect the probability of default of the obligor and factors that affect the loss given default of the facility, such as support or collateral. Internal ratings that generally correspond to BBB 

and above are considered investment grade, while those below are considered non-investment grade. 
 The following table presents the corporate credit portfolio by facility risk rating as a percentage of the total corporate credit portfolio: 
 
 Total exposure September 30, 2024 June 30, 2024 December 31, 2023 AAA/AA/A 49 49 50 BBB 33 33 33 BB/B 17 17 16 CCC or below 1 1 1 Total 100 100 100 
 
 Note: Total exposure includes direct outstandings and unfunded lending commitments. 
 
 In addition to the obligor and facility risk ratings assigned to all exposures, Citi may classify exposures in the corporate credit portfolio. These classifications are consistent with Citi s interpretation of the U.S. banking regulators definition of criticized exposures, which may categorize exposures as special mention, substandard, doubtful or loss. 
 Risk ratings and classifications are reviewed regularly and adjusted as appropriate. The credit review process incorporates quantitative and qualitative factors, including financial and non-financial disclosures or metrics, idiosyncratic events or changes to the competitive, regulatory or macroeconomic environment. 
 Citi believes the corporate credit portfolio to be appropriately rated and classified as of September 30, 2024. Citi has applied management judgment to adjust internal ratings and classifications of exposures as both the macroeconomic environment and obligor-specific factors have changed, particularly where additional stress has been observed. 

45 

As obligor risk ratings are downgraded, the probability of default increases. Downgrades of obligor risk ratings tend to result in a higher provision for credit losses. In addition, appetite per obligor is reduced consistent with the ratings, and downgrades may result in the purchase of additional credit derivatives or other risk/structural mitigants to hedge the incremental credit risk, or may result in Citi seeking to reduce exposure to an obligor or an industry sector. Citi will continue to review exposures to ensure that the appropriate probability of default is incorporated into all risk assessments. 
 See Note 14 for additional information on Citi s corporate credit portfolio.

Credit Risk Mitigation 
 As part of its overall risk management activities, Citigroup uses credit derivatives, both partial and full term, and other risk mitigants to economically hedge portions of the credit risk in its corporate credit portfolio, in addition to outright asset sales. In advance of the expiration of partial-term economic hedges, Citi will determine, among other factors, the economic feasibility of hedging the remaining life of the instrument. The results of the mark-to-market and any realized gains or losses on credit derivatives are reflected primarily in Principal transactions in the Consolidated Statement of Income. 
 At September 30, 2024, June 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, Banking had economic hedges on the corporate credit portfolio of 39.7 billion, 39.7 billion and 35.9 billion, respectively. Citi s expected credit loss model used in the calculation of its ACL does not include the favorable impact of credit derivatives and other mitigants that are marked-to-market. In addition, the reported amounts of direct outstandings and unfunded lending commitments in the tables above do not reflect the impact of these hedging transactions. The credit protection was economically hedging underlying Banking corporate credit portfolio exposures with the following risk rating distribution:

Consumer Credit Trends 
 
 U.S. Personal Banking 

As indicated above, USPB provides credit card products through Branded Cards and Retail Services, and mortgages and home equity, small business and personal consumer loans through Citi s Retail Banking network. Retail Banking is concentrated in six major U.S. metropolitan areas. USPB also provides mortgages through correspondent channels. 
 As of September 30, 2024, approximately 77 of USPB EOP loans consisted of Branded Cards and Retail Services credit card loans, which generally drives the overall credit performance of USPB , as U.S. cards net credit losses represented approximately 96 of total USPB net credit losses for the third quarter of 2024. As of September 30, 2024, Branded Cards represented 68 of total U.S. cards EOP loans and Retail Services represented 32 of U.S. cards EOP loans. 
 As presented in the chart above, the third quarter of 2024 net credit loss rate in USPB decreased quarter-over-quarter, primarily driven by seasonality, and increased year-over-year, primarily reflecting the continued maturation of multiple cards loan vintages originated in recent years, impacted by unprecedented levels of government stimulus during the pandemic. In addition, the increase was driven by macroeconomic pressures related to the elevated inflationary and interest rate environment impacting both cards portfolios, with lower FICO band customers primarily driving the increase. 
 The 90+ days past due delinquency rate was broadly stable quarter-over-quarter, and increased year-over-year, primarily reflecting the continued maturation of multiple cards loan vintages originated in recent years, impacted by unprecedented levels of government stimulus during the pandemic. In addition, the increase was driven by macroeconomic pressures related to the elevated inflationary and interest rate environment impacting both cards portfolios, with lower FICO band customers primarily driving the increase. 

Branded Cards 

USPB s Branded Cards portfolio includes proprietary and co-branded cards. 
 As presented in the chart above, the third quarter of 2024 net credit loss rate in Branded Cards decreased quarter-over-quarter, primarily driven by seasonality, and increased year-over-year, primarily reflecting the continued maturation of multiple cards loan vintages originated in recent years, impacted by unprecedented levels of government stimulus during the pandemic. In addition, the increase was driven by macroeconomic pressures related to the elevated inflationary and interest rate environment, with lower FICO band customers primarily driving the increase.

In addition, the increase was driven by macroeconomic pressures related to the elevated inflationary and interest rate environment, with lower FICO band customers primarily driving the increase. 
 
 Retail Services 

USPB s Retail Services partners directly with more than 20 retailers and dealers to offer private label and co-branded cards. Retail Services target market focuses on select industry segments such as home improvement, specialty retail, consumer electronics and fuel. Retail Services continually evaluates opportunities to add partners within target industries 

51 

that have strong loyalty, lending or payment programs and growth potential. 
 As presented in the chart above, the third quarter of 2024 net credit loss rate in Retail Services decreased quarter-over-quarter, primarily driven by seasonality, and increased year-over-year, primarily reflecting the continued maturation of multiple cards loan vintages originated in recent years, impacted by unprecedented levels of government stimulus during the pandemic. In addition, the increase was driven by macroeconomic pressures related to the elevated inflationary and interest rate environment, with lower FICO band customers primarily driving the increase.

 For additional information on cost of credit, loan delinquency and other information for Citi s cards portfolios, see each respective business s results of operations above and Note 14. 
 
 Retail Banking 

USPB s Retail Banking portfolio consists primarily of consumer mortgages (including home equity) and unsecured lending products, such as small business loans and personal loans. The portfolio is generally delinquency managed, where Citi evaluates credit risk based on FICO scores, delinquencies and the value of underlying collateral. The consumer mortgages in this portfolio have historically been extended to high credit quality customers, generally with loan-to-value ratios that are less than or equal to 80 on first and second mortgages. For additional information, see Loan-to-Value (LTV) Ratios in Note 14. 
 As presented in the chart above, the third quarter of 2024 net credit loss rate in Retail Banking was unchanged quarter-over-quarter, and increased year-over-year, primarily driven by the growth and seasoning of personal loans. The 90+ days past due delinquency rate was largely unchanged quarter-over-quarter, and decreased year-over-year, primarily driven by lower delinquencies in U.S. mortgages. 

Wealth 

As indicated above, Wealth provides consumer mortgages, margin lending, credit cards and other lending products to customer segments that range from affluent to ultra-high net worth through the Private Bank, Wealth at Work and Citigold businesses. These customer segments represent a target market that is characterized by historically low default rates and delinquencies and includes loans that are delinquency managed or classifiably managed. The delinquency-managed portfolio consists primarily of mortgages, margin lending and credit cards. 
 As of September 30, 2024, approximately 44 billion, or 29 , of the portfolios were classifiably managed and primarily consisted of mortgage loans, margin loans, personal and small business loans and other lending programs. These classifiably managed loans are primarily evaluated for credit risk based on their internal risk rating, of which 72 were rated investment grade. While the 90+ days past due delinquency rates shown in the chart above were calculated only for the delinquency-managed portfolio, the net credit loss rates shown were calculated using net credit losses for both the delinquency and classifiably managed portfolios. 
 As presented in the chart above, the third quarter of 2024 net credit loss rate and 90+ days past due delinquency rate in Wealth were broadly stable quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year. The low net credit loss and 90+ days past due delinquency rates continued to reflect the strong credit profiles of the portfolios. 

52 

Mexico Consumer 

Mexico Consumer operates in Mexico through Citibanamex and provides credit cards, consumer mortgages and small business and personal loans. Mexico Consumer serves a mass-market segment in Mexico and focuses on developing multiproduct relationships with customers. As presented in the chart above, the third quarter of 2024 net credit loss rate in Mexico Consumer increased quarter-over-quarter, primarily driven by seasonality, and increased year-over-year, primarily driven by the ongoing normalization of loss rates from post-pandemic lows. 
 The 90+ days past due delinquency rate increased quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year, primarily driven by the ongoing normalization from post-pandemic lows. 
 
 For additional details on cost of credit, loan delinquency and other information for Citi s consumer loan portfolios, see each respective business s results of operations above and Note 14.

 The FICO distribution of both cards portfolios declined from the prior quarter and prior year, primarily reflecting the continued maturation of cards loan vintages originated in recent years, impacted by unprecedented levels of government stimulus during the pandemic, as well as macroeconomic pressures related to the elevated inflationary and interest rate environment impacting both cards portfolios. The FICO distribution continued to reflect strong underlying credit quality of the portfolios. See Note 14 for additional information on FICO scores.

Non-Accrual Loans and Assets 
 For additional information on Citi s non-accrual loans and assets, see Non-Accrual Loans and Assets in Citi s 2023 Form 10-K. 
 
 Non-Accrual Loans 
 The table below summarizes Citigroup s non-accrual loans (NAL) as of the periods indicated. Non-accrual loans may still be current on interest payments. In situations where Citi reasonably expects that only a portion of the principal owed will ultimately be collected, all payments received are reflected as a reduction of principal and not as interest income. For all other non-accrual loans, cash interest receipts are generally recorded as revenue.

 (1) Corporate loans are placed on non-accrual status based on a review by Citigroup s risk officers. Corporate non-accrual loans may still be current on interest payments. With limited exceptions, the following practices are applied for consumer loans: consumer loans, excluding credit cards and mortgages, are placed on non-accrual status at 90 days past due and are charged off at 120 days past due; residential mortgage loans are placed on non-accrual status at 90 days past due and written down to net realizable value at 180 days past due. Consistent with industry conventions, Citigroup generally accrues interest on credit card loans until such loans are charged off, which typically occurs at 180 days contractual delinquency. As such, the non-accrual loan disclosures do not include credit card loans. The balances above represent non-accrual loans within Corporate loans and Consumer loans on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. 
 (2) Approximately 64 , 68 , 61 , 50 and 62 of Citi s corporate non-accrual loans remain current on interest and principal payments at September 30, 2024, June 30, 2024, March 31, 2024, December 31, 2023 and September 30, 2023, respectively. 
 (3) The September 30, 2024 total corporate non-accrual loans represented 0.31 of total corporate loans. 
 (4) The increase at September 30, 2023 was primarily related to two commercial real estate loans. The decrease at June 30, 2024 was primarily related to commercial real estate loans. 
 (5) Asia Consumer includes balances in Poland and Russia for all periods presented.

LIQUIDITY RISK 
 
 For additional information on funding and liquidity at Citi, including objectives and stress testing, see Liquidity Risk and Risk Factors Liquidity Risks in Citi s 2023 Form 10-K. 
 
 Overview 
 Citi s liquidity is managed centrally by Corporate Treasury through the Liquidity Risk Management Policy (Policy), which sets forth the minimum requirements for identifying, measuring, monitoring, controlling and reporting liquidity risk, consistent with Citi s risk appetite in conjunction with local treasurers and with oversight provided by Independent Risk Management and the Citigroup Asset and Liability Committee (ALCO). The Policy establishes the framework for sound management of Citi s liquidity risk, to facilitate transparency and comparability of liquidity risk-taking activities, and supports Citi s maintenance of adequate liquidity, including a cushion of unencumbered, high-quality liquid assets, to withstand a range of stress events including those involving the loss or impairment of both unsecured and secured funding sources. 
 Citi s enterprise-wide liquidity management framework establishes a risk appetite that is expressed as a set of quantitative minimum levels for Citigroup and Citibank, consolidated to maintain liquidity levels above limits for the U.S. Liquidity Coverage ratio (LCR), U.S. Net Stable Funding ratio (NSFR) and Internal Liquidity Stress Tests (ILST). Liquidity concentration risk, which is defined as liquidity risk due to funding concentration to a specific counterparty, industry, product type or maturity, among other categories, is an integral part of Citi s liquidity management framework and is managed in accordance with established risk appetite limits. For example, product or industry concentration limits consider specific attributes of a product (e.g., wholesale deposits, secured versus unsecured, etc.). 

Similar requirements applicable to country legal entities, material legal entities (as defined in the public section of Citi s 2023 resolution plan) or other legal entities are specified in the Liquidity Risk Management Procedures (Procedures). The Procedures provide for liquidity risk management, risk identification, risk appetite, risk limits and triggers, and monitoring including escalation, stress testing, risk reporting, training and review, oversight and approval of key liquidity risk proposals, and analytical tools applicable to the entities within the Procedures scope. In addition, the Procedures provide for data governance, roles and responsibilities, and reference to frameworks within Citi s liquidity management. 
 Liquidity risk in foreign jurisdictions and legal entities is managed as part of Citi s legal entity liquidity management framework (similar to Citigroup and Citibank), in which legal entities, including those in foreign jurisdictions, are subject to regulatory and internal liquidity stress tests on a standalone basis, managed against legal entity limits set in accordance with Citi s risk appetite and governed by local governance forums. Citi also has other local governance forums for managing its balance sheet and liquidity at various organizational levels, including material legal entities. 
 Citi s Chief Risk Officer and Chief Financial Officer co-chair Citigroup s ALCO, which includes Citi s Treasurer and other senior executives. The ALCO sets the strategy of the liquidity portfolio and monitors portfolio performance (see Risk Governance Board and Executive Management Committees in Citi s 2023 Form 10-K). Significant changes to portfolio asset allocations require approval by the ALCO.

 Note: The amounts in the table above are presented on an average basis. For securities, the amounts represent the liquidity value that potentially could be realized and, therefore, exclude any securities that are encumbered and incorporate any haircuts applicable under the U.S. LCR rule. The table above incorporates various restrictions that could limit the transferability of liquidity between legal entities, including Section 23A of the Federal Reserve Act. Changes in HQLA line categories from the prior-year period were primarily driven by the re-allocation of nontransferable HQLA, which did not change total average HQLA, and thus did not impact Citi s LCR ratio. 
 (1) Foreign government debt includes securities issued or guaranteed by foreign sovereigns, agencies and multilateral development banks. Foreign government debt securities are held largely to support local liquidity requirements and Citi s local franchises and principally include government bonds from Japan, Korea, Mexico, India and Hong Kong. 

The table above includes average amounts of HQLA held at Citigroup s operating entities that are eligible for inclusion in the calculation of Citigroup s consolidated LCR, pursuant to the U.S. LCR rules. These amounts include the HQLA needed to meet the minimum requirements at these entities as well as any amounts in excess of these minimums that are available to be transferred to other entities within Citigroup. Citigroup s average HQLA increased quarter-over-quarter as of the third quarter of 2024, primarily driven by an increase in non-U.S. sovereign debt. 
 As of September 30, 2024, Citigroup had approximately 959 billion of available liquidity resources to support client and business needs, including end-of-period HQLA 561 billion); additional unencumbered HQLA, including excess liquidity held at bank entities that is non-transferable to other entities within Citigroup 252 billion); and unused borrowing capacity from available assets not already accounted for within Citi s HQLA to support additional advances from the Federal Home Loan Bank (FHLB) and the Federal Reserve Bank discount window 146 billion). 

Short-Term Liquidity Measurement: Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR) 
 In addition to internal 30-day liquidity stress testing performed for Citi s major entities, operating subsidiaries and countries, Citi also monitors its liquidity by reference to the LCR. The table below details the components of Citi s LCR calculation and HQLA in excess of net outflows for the periods indicated: 
 
 In billions of dollars Sept. 30, 2024 Jun. 30, 2024 Sept. 30, 2023 HQLA 551.2 541.6 569.3 Net outflows 469.6 464.0 485.3 LCR 117 117 117 HQLA in excess of net outflows 81.6 77.6 84.0 
 
 Note: The amounts are presented on an average basis. 
 
 As of September 30, 2024, Citigroup s average LCR was unchanged from the quarter ended June 30, 2024, as Citi s average HQLA and net outflows increased proportionately. 
 In addition, considering Citi s total available liquidity resources at quarter end of 959 billion, Citi maintained approximately 489 billion of excess liquidity resources above the stressed average net outflow of approximately 470 billion, presented in the LCR table above. 

64 

Long-Term Liquidity Measurement: Net Stable Funding Ratio (NSFR) 
 The NSFR is required by a rule promulgated by the U.S. banking agencies and measures the availability of a bank s stable funding against the required stable funding in accordance with the calculation as defined by the rule. 
 In general, a bank s available stable funding includes portions of equity, deposits and long-term debt, while its required stable funding will be based on the liquidity characteristics of its assets, derivatives and commitments. Standardized weightings are required to be applied to the various asset and liability classes. The ratio of available stable funding to required stable funding must be greater than 100 . 
 For the quarter ended September 30, 2024, Citigroup s consolidated NSFR was compliant with the rule. (For additional information, see the Consolidated Citigroup NSFR Disclosure for the quarterly periods ended March 31, 2024 and June 30, 2024, on Citi s Investor Relations website. The Consolidated Citigroup NSFR Disclosure on Citi s Investor Relations website is not incorporated by reference into, and does not form any part of, this Form 10-Q).

 Cash and Investments 
 The table below details average and end-of-period Cash and due from banks , Deposits with banks (collectively cash) and Investment securities . Citi s investment securities portfolio consists largely of highly liquid U.S. Treasury, U.S. agency and other sovereign bonds, with an aggregate duration of less than three years. At September 30, 2024, Citi s EOP cash and Investment securities comprised approximately 33 of total assets:

 (1) During the third quarter of 2024, approximately 9 billion of institutional deposits were moved from Markets to All Other Corporate/Other. Prior periods were not reclassified. For additional information about the reallocated deposits, see Note 3. 
 
 Citi s deposit base is spread across a diversified set of countries, industries, clients and currencies and is subject to Citi s Liquidity Risk Management Policy and Procedures. 
 End-of-period deposits increased 3 year-over-year, primarily driven by growth in Services , reflecting operating deposit growth. End-of-period deposits increased 2 sequentially, primarily driven by growth in TTS and Securities Services. 
 On an average basis, deposits were largely unchanged both year-over-year and sequentially. In the third quarter of 2024, average deposits for: 
 
 Services increased 4 year-over-year, as TTS increased 2 and Securities Services increased 13 . The net increase was primarily attributable to growth in Services operating deposits. 
 USPB decreased 23 year-over-year, as the transfer of certain relationships and the associated deposits to Wealth more than offset underlying deposit growth. 
 Wealth increased 4 year-over-year, largely reflecting the transfer of certain relationships and the associated deposits from USPB , partially offset by the shift in deposits to higher-yielding investments on Citi s platform. 
 All Other decreased 18 year-over-year, primarily reflecting the continued wind-down of deposits in Legacy Franchises. 
 
 The majority of Citi s 1.3 trillion of end-of-period deposits are institutional (approximately 840 billion) and span 90 countries. A large majority of these institutional deposits are within TTS, and of these, approximately 80 are from clients that use all three TTS integrated services: payments and collections, liquidity management and working capital solutions. In addition, nearly 80 of TTS deposits are from clients that have a longer than 15-year relationship with Citi. 

65 

Citi also has a strong consumer and wealth deposit base, with 401 billion of USPB and Wealth deposits as of the end of the current quarter, which are diversified across the Private Bank, Citigold and Wealth at Work within Wealth , as well as USPB , and across regions and products. As of the end of the current quarter, approximately 66 of U.S. Citigold clients have been with Citi for more than 10 years and approximately 39 of Private Bank ultra-high net worth clients have been with Citi for more than 10 years. In addition, USPB s deposits are spread across six key metropolitan areas in the U.S. 
 
 Long-Term Debt 
 
 Weighted-Average Maturity (WAM) 
 The following table presents Citigroup and its affiliates 
 (including Citibank) WAM of unsecured long-term debt issued with a remaining life greater than one year: 
 
 WAM in years Sept. 30, 2024 Jun. 30, 2024 Sept. 30, 2023 Unsecured debt 7.5 7.6 7.4 Non-bank benchmark debt 7.0 7.2 7.1 Customer-related debt 8.6 8.7 8.2 TLAC-eligible debt 8.5 8.6 8.7 
 
 The WAM is calculated based on the contractual maturity of each security. For securities that are redeemable prior to maturity where the option is not held by the issuer, the WAM is calculated based on the earliest date an option becomes exercisable.

 (1) Non-bank includes long-term debt issued to third parties by the parent holding company (Citigroup) and Citi s non-bank subsidiaries (including broker-dealer subsidiaries) that are consolidated into Citigroup. As of September 30, 2024, non-bank included 91.9 billion of long-term debt issued by Citi s broker-dealer and other subsidiaries that are consolidated into Citigroup. Certain Citigroup consolidated hedging activities are also included in this line. 
 (2) Local country and other includes debt issued by Citi s affiliates in support of their local operations. Within non-bank, certain secured financing is also included. 
 (3) Predominantly credit card securitizations, primarily backed by Branded Cards receivables. 
 
 Citi s total long-term debt outstanding increased 8 year-over-year, driven by higher debt across almost all categories. Sequentially, long-term debt outstanding increased 7 , largely related to senior benchmark debt at the bank and non-bank entities and customer-related debt issuances at the non-bank entities. 
 As part of its liability management, Citi has considered, and may continue to consider, opportunities to redeem or repurchase its long-term debt pursuant to open market purchases, tender offers or other means. Such redemptions and repurchases help reduce Citi s overall funding costs. During the third quarter of 2024, Citi redeemed or repurchased an aggregate of 9.9 billion of its outstanding long-term debt.

Secured Funding Transactions and Short-Term Borrowings 
 Citi supplements its primary sources of funding with short-term financings that generally include (i) secured funding transactions consisting of securities loaned or sold under agreements to repurchase, i.e., repos, and (ii) to a lesser extent, short-term borrowings consisting of commercial paper issuances and borrowings from the FHLB and other market participants. 
 
 Secured Funding Transactions 
 Secured funding is primarily accessed through Citi s broker-dealer subsidiaries, with a smaller portion executed through Citi s bank entities to efficiently fund both (i) secured lending activity and (ii) a portion of the securities inventory held in the context of market making and customer activities. Secured funding transactions are predominantly collateralized by government debt securities. Generally, changes in the level of Citi s secured funding are primarily due to fluctuations in secured lending activity in the matched book (as described below) and changes in securities inventory. In order to maintain reliable funding under a wide range of market conditions, Citi manages risks related to its secured funding by establishing secured funding limits and conducting daily stress tests that account for risks related to capacity, tenor, haircut, collateral type, counterparty and client actions. 
 Secured funding of 278 billion as of September 30, 2024 increased 8 year-over-year and decreased 9 from the prior quarter, largely driven by additional financing to support increases in trading-related assets within Citi s broker-dealer subsidiaries. As of the quarter ended September 30, 2024, on an average basis, secured funding was 338 billion. The portion of secured funding in the broker-dealer subsidiaries that funds secured lending is commonly referred to as matched book activity and is primarily secured by high-quality liquid securities such as U.S. Treasury securities, U.S. agency securities and foreign government debt securities. Other matched book activity is secured by less liquid securities, including equity securities, corporate bonds and asset-backed securities, the tenor of which is generally equal to or longer than the tenor of the corresponding assets. As indicated above, the remaining portion of secured funding is used to fund securities inventory held in the context of market making and customer activities. 

Short-Term Borrowings 
 Citi s short-term borrowings of 41 billion as of September 30, 2024 decreased 4 year-over-year, as issuances of long-term debt replaced the need for short-term borrowings. Sequentially, short-term borrowings increased 7 , compared to June 30, 2024, driven by additional funding to support client activities (see Note 18 for further information on Citigroup s and its affiliates outstanding short-term borrowings).

Credit Ratings 
 The table below presents the ratings for Citigroup and Citibank as of September 30, 2024. While not included in the table below, the long-term and short-term ratings of Citigroup Global Markets Holdings Inc. (CGMHI) were A+/F1 at Fitch Ratings, A2/P-1 at Moody s Ratings and A/A-1 at S P Global Ratings as of September 30, 2024.

Potential Impacts of Ratings Downgrades 
 Ratings downgrades by Fitch, Moody s or S P could negatively impact Citigroup s and/or Citibank s funding and liquidity due to reduced funding capacity, including derivative triggers, which could take the form of cash obligations and collateral requirements. 
 For additional information on the impact of credit rating changes on Citi and its applicable subsidiaries, see Risk Factors Liquidity Risks and Credit Ratings in Citi s 2023 Form 10-K. 
 
 Citigroup Inc. and Citibank Potential Derivative Triggers 
 As of September 30, 2024, Citi estimates that a hypothetical one-notch downgrade of the senior debt/long-term rating of Citigroup Inc. across all three major rating agencies could impact Citigroup s funding and liquidity due to derivative triggers by approximately 0.1 billion (unchanged from June 30, 2024). Other funding sources, such as secured financing transactions and other margin requirements, for which there are no explicit triggers, could also be adversely affected. 
 As of September 30, 2024, Citi estimates that a hypothetical one-notch downgrade of the senior debt/long-term rating of Citibank across all three major rating agencies could impact Citibank s funding and liquidity due to derivative triggers by approximately 0.1 billion (unchanged from June 30, 2024). Other funding sources, such as secured funding transactions and other margin requirements, for which there are no explicit triggers, could also be adversely impacted. 
 In total, as of September 30, 2024, Citi estimates that a one-notch downgrade of Citigroup Inc. and Citibank across all three major rating agencies could result in increased aggregate cash obligations and collateral requirements of approximately 0.2 billion (unchanged from June 30, 2024). As detailed under High-Quality Liquid Assets (HQLA) above, Citigroup has various liquidity resources available to its bank and non-bank entities in part as a contingency for the potential events described above. 

Citibank Additional Potential Impacts 
 In addition to the above derivative triggers, Citi believes that a potential downgrade of Citibank s senior debt/long-term rating across any of the three major rating agencies could also have an adverse impact on the commercial paper/short-term rating of Citibank. Citibank has provided liquidity commitments to consolidated asset-backed commercial paper conduits, primarily in the form of asset purchase agreements. As of September 30, 2024, Citibank had liquidity commitments of approximately 11.1 billion to consolidated asset-backed commercial paper conduits (compared to 10.8 billion at June 30, 2024) (see Note 21). 
 In addition to the above-referenced liquidity resources of certain Citibank entities, Citibank could reduce the funding and liquidity risk, if any, of the potential downgrades described above through mitigating actions, including repricing or reducing certain commitments to commercial paper conduits. In the event of the potential downgrades described above, Citi believes that certain corporate customers could re-evaluate their deposit relationships with Citibank. This re-evaluation could result in clients adjusting their discretionary deposit levels or changing their depository institution, which could potentially reduce certain deposit levels at Citibank. However, Citi could choose to adjust pricing, offer alternative deposit products to its existing customers or seek to attract deposits from new customers, in addition to the mitigating actions referenced above.

MARKET RISK 
 
 Market risk arises from both Citi s trading and non-trading portfolios. For additional information on market risk and market risk management at Citi, see Market Risk Overview and Risk Factors in Citi s 2023 Form 10-K. 
 
 MARKET RISK OF NON-TRADING PORTFOLIOS 
 Market risk from non-trading portfolios stems predominantly from the potential impact of changes in interest rates and foreign exchange rates on Citi s net interest income and on Citi s Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) (AOCI) from its investment securities portfolios. Market risk from non-trading portfolios also includes the potential impact of changes in foreign exchange rates on Citi s capital invested in foreign currencies. 
 
 Banking Book Interest Rate Risk 
 For interest rate risk purposes, Citi s non-trading portfolios are referred to as the Banking Book. Management of interest rate risk in the Banking Book is governed by Citi s Non-Trading Market Risk Policy. Management s Asset and Liability Committee (ALCO) establishes Citi s risk appetite and related limits for interest rate risk in the Banking Book, which are subject to approval by Citigroup s Board of Directors. Corporate Treasury is responsible for the day-to-day management of Citi s Banking Book interest rate risk as well as periodically reviewing it with the ALCO. Citi s Banking Book interest rate risk management is also subject to independent oversight from the second line of defense team reporting to the Chief Risk Officer. 
 Changes in interest rates impact Citi s net income, AOCI and CET1. These changes primarily affect Citi s Banking Book through net interest income, due to a variety of risk factors, including: 
 
 Differences in timing and amounts of the maturity or repricing of assets, liabilities and off-balance sheet instruments; 
 Changes in the level and/or shape of interest rate curves; 
 Client behavior in response to changes in interest rates (e.g., mortgage prepayments, deposit betas); and 
 Changes in the maturity of instruments resulting from changes in the interest rate environment. 
 
 As part of their ongoing activities, Citi s businesses generate interest rate-sensitive positions from their client-facing products, such as loans and deposits. The component of this interest rate risk that can be hedged is transferred via Citi s funds transfer pricing process to Corporate Treasury. Corporate Treasury uses various tools to manage the total interest rate risk position within the established risk appetite and target Citi s desired risk profile, including its investment securities portfolio, company-issued debt and interest rate derivatives. 

In addition, Citi uses multiple metrics to measure its Banking Book interest rate risk. Interest Rate Exposure (IRE) is a key metric that analyzes the impact of a range of scenarios on Citi s Banking Book net interest income and certain other interest rate-sensitive income versus a base case. IRE does not represent a forecast of Citi s net interest income. 
 The scenarios, methodologies and assumptions used in this analysis are periodically evaluated and enhanced in response to changes in the market environment, changes in Citi s balance sheet composition, enhancements in Citi s modeling and other factors. 
 Citi utilizes the most recent quarter-end balance sheet, assuming no changes to its composition and size over the forecasted horizon (holding the balance sheet static). The forecasts incorporate expectations and assumptions of deposit pricing, loan spreads and mortgage prepayment behavior implied by the interest rate curves in each scenario. The base case scenario reflects the market-implied forward interest rates, and sensitivity scenarios assume instantaneous shocks to the base case. The forecasts do not assume Citi takes any risk-mitigating actions in response to changes in the interest rate environment. Certain interest rates are subject to flooring assumptions in downward rate scenarios. Deposit pricing sensitivities (i.e., deposit betas) are informed by historical and expected behavior. Actual deposit pricing could differ from the assumptions used in these forecasts. 
 Citi s IRE analysis primarily reflects the impacts from the following Banking Book assets and liabilities: loans, client deposits, Citi s deposits with other banks, investment securities, long-term debt, any related interest rate hedges and the funds transfer pricing of positions in total trading and credit portfolio value at risk (VAR). It excludes impacts from any positions that are included in total trading and credit portfolio VAR. 
 In addition to IRE, Citi analyzes economic value sensitivity (EVS) as a longer-term interest rate risk metric. EVS is a net present value (NPV) based measure of the lifetime cash flows of Citi s Banking Book. It estimates the interest rate sensitivity of the Banking Book s economic value from longer-term assets being potentially funded with shorter-term liabilities, or vice versa. Citi manages EVS within risk limits approved by Citigroup s Board of Directors that are aligned with Citi s risk appetite.

Interest Rate Risk of Investment Portfolios Impact on AOCI 
 Citi measures the potential impacts of changes in interest rates on the value of its AOCI , which can in turn impact Citi s common equity and tangible common equity. This will impact Citi s CET1 and other regulatory capital ratios. Citi seeks to manage its exposure to changes in the market level of interest rates, while limiting the potential impact on its AOCI and regulatory capital position. 
 AOCI at risk is managed as part of the Company-wide interest rate risk position. AOCI at risk considers potential 

changes in AOCI (and the corresponding impact on the CET1 Capital ratio) relative to Citi s capital generation capacity. 
 Citi uses 100 basis point (bps) shocks in each scenario to reflect its net interest income sensitivity to unanticipated changes in market interest rates, as potential monetary policy decisions and changes in economic conditions may be reflected in current market-implied forward rates. The following table presents the 12-month estimated impact to Citi s net interest income, AOCI and the CET1 Capital ratio, each assuming an unanticipated parallel instantaneous 100 bps increase in interest rates:

 The All other currencies of 1.4 billion as of September 30, 2024 in the table above includes the impact from the following top five non-U.S. dollar currencies by absolute size: approximately (0.3) billion from the euro, 0.4 billion from the British pound sterling, and approximately 0.1 billion each from the Japanese yen, Indian rupee and Swiss franc. The remaining impact is spread across more than 30 additional currencies. 
 Citi s balance sheet is asset sensitive (assets reprice faster than liabilities), resulting in higher net interest income in increasing interest rate scenarios. The estimated impact to Citi's net interest income in a 100 bps upward rate shock scenario as of September 30, 2024 remained relatively stable year-over-year. At progressively higher interest rate levels, the marginal net interest income benefit is lower, as Citi assumes it will pass on a larger share of rate changes to depositors (i.e., higher betas), further reducing Citi s IRE sensitivity. Currency-specific interest rate changes and balance sheet factors may drive quarter-to-quarter volatility in Citi s estimated IRE. 
 In a 100 bps upward rate shock scenario, Citi expects that the approximate 1.2 billion initial negative impact to AOCI could potentially be offset in shareholders equity through the expected recovery of the impact on AOCI through accretion of Citi s investment portfolio and expected net interest income benefit over a period of approximately seven months. 

71 

Scenario Analysis 
 The following table presents the estimated impact to Citi s net interest income and AOCI under six different scenarios of changes in interest rates for the U.S. dollar and all other currencies in which Citi has invested capital as of September 30, 2024. The 100 bps downward rate scenarios potentially may be impacted by the low level of interest rates in several countries and the assumption that market interest rates, as well as rates paid to depositors and charged to borrowers, do not fall below zero (i.e., the flooring assumption ). The interest rate scenarios are also impacted by convexity related to mortgage products and deposit pricing.

 (1,173) (1,284) 100 (385) 1,274 890 
 
 Note: Each scenario assumes that the rate change will occur instantaneously. Changes in interest rates for maturities between the overnight rate and the 10-year rate are interpolated. The interest rate exposure in the table above assumes no change in deposit size or mix from the baseline forecast included in the different interest rate scenarios presented. As a result, in higher interest rate scenarios, customer activity resulting in a shift from non-interest-bearing and low interest rate deposit products to higher-yielding deposits would reduce the expected benefit to net interest income. Conversely, in lower interest rate scenarios, customer activity resulting in a shift from higher-yielding deposits to non-interest-bearing and low interest rate deposit products would reduce the expected decrease to net interest income. 
 (1) The Scenario 1 impact of 1,388 million consists of the following top five non-U.S. dollar currencies as of September 30, 2024 by absolute size: approximately (0.3) billion from the euro, 0.4 billion from the British pound sterling, and approximately 0.1 billion each from the Japanese yen, Indian rupee and Swiss franc. The remaining balance is spread across more than 30 additional currencies. 
 (2) Includes the effect of changes in interest rates on AOCI related to investment securities, cash flow hedges and pension liability adjustments. 

As presented in the table above, the estimated impact to Citi s net interest income is larger under Scenario 2 than Scenario 3, as Citi s Banking Book has relatively higher interest rate exposure to the short end of the yield curve. For U.S. dollars, exposure to downward rate shocks is smaller in magnitude than to upward rate shocks. This is because of the lower benefit to net interest income from Citi s deposit base at higher rate levels, as well as the prepayment effects on mortgage loans and mortgage-backed securities. 
 The magnitude of the impact to AOCI is greater under Scenario 2 compared to Scenario 3. This is because Citi s investment portfolio and pension liabilities are more sensitive to rates at shorter- and intermediate-term maturities. 

72 

Changes in Foreign Exchange Rates Impacts on AOCI and Capital 
 As of September 30, 2024, Citi estimates that an unanticipated parallel instantaneous 5 appreciation of the U.S. dollar against all of the other currencies in which Citi has invested capital could reduce Citi s tangible common equity (TCE) by approximately 1.6 billion, or 1.0 , as a result of changes to Citi s CTA in AOCI , net of hedges. This impact would be primarily due to changes in the value of the euro, Mexican peso and Indian rupee. 
 This impact is also before any mitigating actions Citi may take, including ongoing management of its foreign currency 
 translation exposure. Specifically, as currency movements change the value of Citi s net investments in foreign currency-denominated capital, these movements also change the value of Citi s RWA denominated in those same currencies. This, 

coupled with Citi s foreign currency hedging strategies, such as foreign currency borrowings, foreign currency forwards and other currency hedging instruments, lessens the impact of foreign currency movements on Citi s CET1 Capital ratio. Changes in these hedging strategies, as well as hedging costs, divestitures and tax impacts, can further affect the actual impact of changes in foreign exchange rates on Citi s capital compared to an unanticipated parallel shock, as described above. 
 The effect of Citi s ongoing management strategies with respect to quarterly changes in foreign exchange rates, and the quarterly impact of these changes on Citi s TCE and CET1 Capital ratio, are presented in the table below. See Note 19 for additional information on the changes in AOCI .

 (2) Interest expense associated with certain hybrid financial instruments, which are classified as Long-term debt and accounted for at fair value, is reported together with any changes in fair value as part of Principal transactions in the Consolidated Statement of Income and is therefore not reflected in Interest expense in the table above. 
 (3) The average rate on interest income and net interest margin reflects TEGU. See footnote 1 above.

 Citi s net interest income in the third quarter of 2024 was 13.4 billion, on both a reported and taxable equivalent basis, a decrease of 3 or 0.5 billion from the prior-year period, primarily driven by a 17 decline in Markets net interest income and a 1 decline in non- Markets net interest income. The decline in Markets net interest income was primarily driven by higher funding costs related to trading inventory in Fixed Income Markets. 
 The decline in non- Markets net interest income was largely due to lower revenue from Citi s net investment in Argentina and margin compression on mortgage securities in the investment portfolio that have been extended within Corporate Treasury in All Other . The decline in non- Markets net interest income was partially offset by loan growth in cards and maturing assets in Citi s securities portfolio being reinvested at higher yields. 
 Citi s net interest margin was 2.33 on a taxable equivalent basis in the current quarter, a decrease of eight basis points from the prior quarter. The decline in net interest margin was largely driven by a decline in Markets due to dividend seasonality in the prior quarter, partially offset by loan growth in cards and maturing loans and investments being refinanced and reinvested at higher yields.

MARKET RISK OF TRADING PORTFOLIOS 
 
 Value at Risk (VAR) 
 Citi believes its VAR model is conservatively calibrated to incorporate fat-tail scaling and the greater of short-term (approximately the most recent month) and long-term (18 months for commodities and three years for others) market volatility. As of September 30, 2024, Citi estimates that the conservative features of the VAR calibration contribute an approximate 22 add-on to what would be a VAR estimated under the assumption of stable and perfectly, normally distributed markets. As of June 30, 2024, the add-on was 23 . 
 As presented in the table below, Citi s average trading VAR for the third quarter of 2024 decreased 5 from the second quarter of 2024, primarily due to inventory changes in the Markets businesses.

 (1) Covariance adjustment (also known as diversification benefit) equals the difference between the total VAR and the sum of the VARs tied to each risk type. The benefit reflects the fact that the risks within individual and across risk types are not perfectly correlated and, consequently, the total VAR on a given day will be lower than the sum of the VARs relating to each risk type. The determination of the primary drivers of changes to the covariance adjustment is made by an examination of the impact of both model parameter and position changes. 
 (2) The total trading VAR includes mark-to-market and certain fair value option trading positions with the exception of hedges of the loan portfolio, fair value option loans and all CVA exposures. Available-for-sale and accrual exposures are not included. 
 (3) The specific risk-only component represents the level of equity and fixed income issuer-specific risk embedded in VAR. 
 (4) The credit portfolio is composed of mark-to-market positions associated with non-trading business units, with the CVA relating to derivative counterparties, all associated CVA hedges and market sensitivity FVA hedges. FVA and DVA are not included. The credit portfolio also includes hedges of the loan portfolio, fair value option loans and hedges of the leveraged finance pipeline within capital markets origination. 
 
 The table below provides the range of market factor VARs associated with Citi s total trading VAR, inclusive of specific risk:

 Note: No covariance adjustment can be inferred from the above table as the high and low for each market factor will be from different close-of-business dates.

 Regulatory VAR Back-Testing 
 In accordance with Basel III, Citi is required to perform back-testing to evaluate the effectiveness of its Regulatory VAR model. Regulatory VAR back-testing is the process in which the daily one-day VAR, at a 99 confidence interval, is compared to the buy-and-hold profit and loss (i.e., the profit and loss impact if the portfolio is held constant at the end of the day and re-priced the following day). Buy-and-hold profit and loss represents the daily mark-to-market profit and loss attributable to price movements in covered positions from the close of the previous business day. Buy-and-hold profit and loss excludes realized trading revenue, net interest, fees and commissions, intra-day trading profit and loss and changes in reserves. 
 Based on a 99 confidence level, Citi would expect two to three days in any one year where buy-and-hold losses exceed the Regulatory VAR. Given the conservative calibration of Citi s VAR model (as a result of taking the greater of short- and long-term volatilities and fat-tail scaling of volatilities), Citi would expect fewer exceptions under normal and stable market conditions. Periods of unstable market conditions could increase the number of back-testing exceptions. 
 As of September 30, 2024, there was one back-testing exception observed for Citi s Regulatory VAR in the last 12 months.

Country Risk 
 
 Top 25 Country Exposures 
 The following table presents Citi s top 25 exposures by country (excluding the U.S.) as of September 30, 2024. (Including the U.S., Citi s top 25 exposures by country would represent approximately 98 of Citi s exposure to all countries as of September 30, 2024.) 
 For purposes of the table, loan amounts are reflected in the country where the loan is booked, which is generally based on the domicile of the borrower. For example, a loan to a Chinese subsidiary of a Switzerland-based corporation will generally be categorized as a loan in China. In addition, Citi has developed regional booking centers in certain countries, most significantly in the United Kingdom (U.K.) and Ireland, 

in order to more efficiently serve its corporate customers. As an example, in the case of the U.K., only 41 of corporate loans presented in the table below are to U.K. domiciled counterparties (45 for unfunded commitments), while the majority of the remaining loans are to counterparties domiciled in other European countries. Approximately 91 of the total U.K. funded loans and 87 of the total U.K. unfunded commitments were investment grade as of September 30, 2024. 
 Trading account assets and investment securities are generally categorized based on the domicile of the issuer of the security of the underlying reference entity. For additional information on the assets included in the table, see the footnotes to the table below.

Russia 
 
 Overview 
 In Russia, Citi s remaining operations are conducted through Services , Markets , Banking and All Other Legacy Franchises. Citi continues to monitor the war in Ukraine, related sanctions and economic conditions and continues to mitigate its Russia exposures and risks as appropriate. 
 Citi previously ended nearly all of the institutional banking services it offered in Russia and ceased soliciting any new business or new clients in the country, with the remaining services only those necessary to fulfill its remaining legal and regulatory obligations, as well as support its employees. In addition, Citi significantly reduced its All Other Legacy Franchises consumer loan portfolio in Russia (reported as part of Asia Consumer), largely due to loan portfolio sales and its entry into a credit card referral agreement with a Russian bank. For additional information, see Citi s Wind-Down of Its Russia Operations below. 

For additional information about Citi s risks related to its Russia exposures, see Risk Factors Market-Related Risks, Operational Risks and Other Risks in Citi s 2023 Form 10-K. 
 
 Impact of the Russia Ukraine War on Citi s Businesses 
 
 Russia-related Balance Sheet Exposures 
 Citi s remaining domestic operations in Russia are conducted through a subsidiary of Citibank, AO Citibank, which uses the Russian ruble as its functional currency. 

The following table summarizes Citi s exposures related to its Russia operations:

(1) Investment securities include debt securities AFS, recorded at fair market value, primarily local government debt securities. 
 (2) Unfunded exposure consists of unfunded corporate lending commitments, letters of credit and other contingencies. 
 (3) Cash on deposit and placements are primarily with the Central Bank of Russia. The increase at September 30, 2024 was due to Citi s inability to enter into reverse repos, thus the cash inflows from dividends received from Russian corporations on behalf of Citi s clients were placed with the Central Bank of Russia. 
 (4) Represents dividends received by Citi in its role as custodian for investor clients in Russia, which Citi is required by local regulation to hold at the Deposit Insurance Agency (DIA). Citi is unable to remit these funds to clients due to restrictions imposed by the Russian government. In accordance with a Central Bank of Russia regulatory requirement, all balances in the National Settlements Depository were transferred to the DIA in the second quarter of 2023. 
 (5) The majority of AO Citibank s third-party exposures were funded with the dividends described in footnote 4 and domestic deposit liabilities from both corporate and personal banking clients. 
 (6) Citigroup s CTA loss included in its AOCI related to its indirect subsidiary, AO Citibank, is excluded from the above table, because the CTA loss is not held in AO Citibank and would be recognized in Citigroup s earnings only upon either the substantial liquidation or a loss of control of AO Citibank. Citi has separately described these risks in Deconsolidation Risk below. 

83 

During the third quarter of 2024, Citi s Russia-related exposures increased by 0.9 billion, to 9.1 billion as presented in the table above. The increase in exposures was primarily driven by inflows from dividends received from Russian corporations on behalf of Citi s clients, partially offset by depreciation of the Russian ruble. Approximately 82 of Citi s 9.1 billion of total Russia-related exposures are corporate dividends that Citi cannot remit to its clients due to restrictions imposed by the Russian government, of which 5.8 billion is held with the Deposit Insurance Agency. 
 Citi s net investment in Russia was approximately 0.2 billion as of September 30, 2024 (up from 0.1 billion at June 30, 2024). This increase in the net investment was due to an increase in interest income and custody revenue during the quarter, partially offset by the impact from a net ACL build on other assets, driven by increases in transfer risk for safety and soundness considerations under U.S. banking law. For more information on transfer risk reserves, see Significant Accounting Policies and Significant Estimates Citi s Allowance for Credit Losses (ACL) below. 
 Citi hedges its Russian ruble/U.S. dollar spot FX exposure in AOCI through the purchase of FX derivatives. The ongoing mark-to-market of the hedging derivatives is also reported in AOCI . When the Russian ruble depreciates against the U.S. dollar, the U.S. dollar equivalent value of Citigroup s investment in AO Citibank also declines. This change in value is offset by the change in value of the hedging instrument (FX derivative). Going forward, Citi may record devaluations on its net ruble-denominated assets in earnings, without the benefit from a change in the fair value of derivative positions used to economically hedge the exposures. 
 
 Earnings and Other Impacts on Citi s Businesses 
 Services , Markets , Banking and All Other Legacy Franchises results have been impacted by various macroeconomic factors and volatilities, including the war in Ukraine and its direct and indirect impacts on the European and global economies. For a broader discussion of these factors and volatilities on Citi s businesses, see Executive Summary and each applicable business s results of operations above. 
 As of September 30, 2024, Citigroup s ACL included a 0.1 billion remaining credit reserve for Citi s direct Russian counterparties (largely unchanged from June 30, 2024). This balance does not include the additional reserves for transfer risk associated with exposures in Russia. 
 
 Citi s Wind-Down of Its Russia Operations 
 In August 2022, Citi disclosed its decision to wind down its Russia consumer, local commercial and institutional banking businesses, including actively pursuing portfolio sales. In connection with this wind-down, Citi has incurred approximately 71 million to date in charges, largely from restructuring, vendor termination fees and other related charges. Citi expects to incur an additional approximate 42 million in estimated charges (approximately 1 million in Banking and 41 million in All Other , excluding the impact from any portfolio sales). For additional information about Citi s continued efforts to reduce its operations and exposure in Russia, see Note 2 and Risk Factors and Managing 

Global Risk Other Risks Country Risk Russia in Citi s 2023 Form 10-K. 
 
 Deconsolidation Risk 
 Citi s remaining operations in Russia subject it to various risks, including, among others, foreign currency volatility, including appreciation or devaluation; restrictions arising from retaliatory Russian laws and regulations on the conduct of its business; sanctions or asset freezes; or other deconsolidation events (see Risk Factors Other Risks in Citi s 2023 Form 10-K). Examples of triggers that may result in deconsolidation of AO Citibank include voluntary or forced sale of ownership or loss of control due to actions of relevant governmental authorities, including expropriation (i.e., the entity becomes subject to the complete control of a government, court, administrator, trustee or regulator); revocation of banking license; and loss of ability to elect a board of directors or appoint members of senior management. As of September 30, 2024, Citi continued to consolidate AO Citibank because none of the deconsolidation factors were triggered. 
 In the event Citi deems there is a loss of control, for example, through expropriation of AO Citibank, Citi s foreign entity in Russia, Citi would be required to (i) write off the net investment of approximately 0.2 billion (up from 0.1 billion at June 30, 2024), (ii) recognize a CTA loss of approximately 1.6 billion (unchanged from June 30, 2024) through earnings and (iii) recognize a loss of 0.7 billion (unchanged from June 30, 2024) on net intercompany liabilities owed by AO Citibank to other Citi entities outside Russia. In the sole event of a substantial liquidation, as opposed to a loss of control, Citi would be required to recognize the CTA loss of approximately 1.6 billion through earnings and would evaluate its remaining net investment as circumstances evolve. The 1.6 billion CTA write-off through earnings under either event is expected to be largely equity neutral, since the reversal of the CTA loss out of AOCI would improve Citi s total AOCI . 
 
 Citi as Paying Agent for Russia-related Clients 
 Citi serves or served as paying agent on bonds issued by various entities in Russia, including Russian corporate clients. Citi s role as paying agent is administrative. In this role, Citi acts as an agent of its client, the bond issuer, receiving interest and principal payments from the bond issuer and then making payments to international central securities depositories (e.g., Depository Trust Company, Euroclear, Clearstream). The international central securities depositories (ICSDs) make payments to those participants or account holders (e.g., broker/dealers) that have clients who are investors in the applicable bonds (i.e., bondholders). As a paying agent, Citi generally does not have information about the identity of the bondholders. Citi may be exposed to risks due to its responsibilities for receiving and processing payments on behalf of its clients as a result of sanctions or other governmental requirements and prohibitions. To mitigate operational and sanctions risks, Citi has established policies, procedures and controls for client relationships and payment processing to help ensure compliance with U.S., U.K., EU and other jurisdictions sanctions laws. 

84 

These processes may require Citi to delay or withhold the processing of payments as a result of sanctions on the bond issuer. Citi is also prevented from making payments to accounts on behalf of bondholders should the ICSDs disclose to Citi the presence of sanctioned bondholders. In both instances, Citi is generally required to segregate, restrict or block the funds until applicable sanctions are lifted or the payments are otherwise authorized under applicable law. 
 
 Reputational Risks 
 Citi has continued its efforts to enhance and protect its reputation with its colleagues, clients, customers, investors, regulators and the public. Citi s response to the war in Ukraine, including any action or inaction, may have a negative impact on Citi s reputation with some or all of these parties. 
 For example, Citi is exposed to reputational risk as a result of its remaining presence in Russia and association with Russian individuals or entities, whether subject to sanctions or not, including Citi s inability to support its global clients in Russia, which could adversely affect its broader client relationships and businesses; current involvement in transactions or supporting activities involving Russian assets or interests; failure to correctly interpret and apply laws and regulations, including those related to sanctions; perceived misalignment of Citi s actions to its stated strategy in Russia; and the reputational impact from Citi s activity and engagement with Ukraine or with non-Russian clients exiting their Russia businesses. 
 While Citi announced its intention to wind down its businesses in Russia, Citi will continue to manage those operations during the wind-down process and will be required to maintain certain limited operations to fulfill its remaining legal and regulatory obligations. Also, sanctions and sanctions compliance are highly complex and may change over time and result in increased operational risk. Failure to fully comply with relevant sanctions or the application of sanctions where they should not be applied may negatively impact Citi s reputation. In addition, Citi currently performs services for, conducts business with or deals in non-sanctioned Russian-owned businesses and Russian assets. This has attracted, and will likely continue to attract, negative attention, despite the previously disclosed plan to wind down nearly all its activities in the country, cessation of new business and client originations, and reduction of other exposures. 
 Citi s continued presence or divestiture of businesses in Russia could also increase its susceptibility to cyberattacks that could negatively impact its relationships with clients and customers, harm its reputation, increase its compliance costs and adversely affect its business operations and results of operations. For additional information on operational and cyber risks, see Risk Factors Operational Risks in Citi s 2023 Form 10-K. 

Board of Directors Role in Overseeing Related Risks 
 The Citigroup Board of Directors (Board) and the Board s Risk Management Committee (RMC) and its other Committees receive regular reports from senior management regarding global geopolitical, macroeconomic and reputational impacts to Citi (including the war in Ukraine and its impact on Citi s operations in Russia and Ukraine). The reports to the Board and its Committees from senior management who represent the impacted businesses and the international cluster, Independent Risk Management, Finance, Independent Compliance Risk Management, including those individuals responsible for sanctions compliance, and Human Resources, have included detailed information regarding financial impacts, impacts on capital, cybersecurity, strategic considerations, sanctions compliance, employee assistance and reputational risks, enabling the Board and its Committees to properly exercise their oversight responsibilities. In addition, senior management has provided updates to Citi s Executive Management Team and the Board, outside of formal meetings, regarding cybersecurity matters (including Russia-specific risks). 

Ukraine 
 Citi has continued to operate in Ukraine throughout the war through its Services , Markets and Banking businesses, serving the local subsidiaries of multinationals, along with local financial institutions and the public sector. Citi employs approximately 215 people in Ukraine and their safety is Citi s top priority. All of Citi s domestic operations in Ukraine are conducted through a subsidiary of Citibank, which uses the Ukrainian hryvnia as its functional currency. As of September 30, 2024, Citi had 1.5 billion of direct exposures related to Ukraine (unchanged from June 30, 2024). 

85 

Argentina 
 Citi operates in Argentina through its Services , Markets and Banking businesses. As of September 30, 2024, Citi s net investment in its Argentine operations was approximately 1.3 billion (compared to 1.4 billion at June 30, 2024). Citi uses the U.S. dollar (USD) as the functional currency for its operations in countries such as Argentina that are deemed highly inflationary in accordance with GAAP. Citi therefore records the impact of exchange rate fluctuations on its net Argentine peso (ARS) denominated assets directly in earnings. Citi uses Argentina s official market exchange rate to remeasure its net ARS-denominated assets into USD. As of September 30, 2024, the official ARS exchange rate was 971, which devalued by 6.5 against the USD during the third quarter of 2024. 
 The decrease in Citi s net investment in Argentina during the quarter was primarily driven by capital repatriations from the onshore net investment, which were authorized by the Central Bank of Argentina (BCRA) on a one-time basis in April 2024 through the purchase of certain USD-denominated bonds (BOPREALs) issued by the BCRA in a primary auction, and subsequent sales of the bonds in the secondary market and remittances of the bond proceeds to the parent entity outside Argentina. During the third quarter, Citi remitted approximately 247 million in dividends from its net investment in Argentina, thereby reducing future FX devaluation risk. In total, 435 million of dividends were remitted in 2024 due to the sale proceeds of the BOPREALs. 
 In addition to the capital repatriation, Citi s net investment in Argentina was also impacted by earnings from Citi s normal onshore operations and interest income earned on the net investment, partially offset by FX translation losses on the net investment. 
 Other than the authorized dividend remittance described above, the BCRA continues to maintain certain capital and currency controls that generally restrict Citi s ability to access USD in Argentina and remit earnings from its Argentine operations. The capital and currency controls have resulted in indirect foreign exchange mechanisms that some Argentine entities may use to obtain USD, generally at rates that are significantly higher than Argentina s official exchange rate. Citibank Argentina is generally precluded from accessing these alternative mechanisms, and under U.S. GAAP, these exchange mechanisms cannot be used to re-measure Citi s net monetary assets into USD. If Argentina s official exchange rate further converges with the approximate rate implied by the indirect foreign exchange mechanisms, Citi could incur additional translation losses on its net investment in Argentina. Accordingly, Citi seeks to reduce its overall ARS exposure in Argentina while complying with local capital and currency exposure limitations. 

Of the 1.3 billion net investment in Argentina as of September 30, 2024, Citi s net ARS exposure was approximately 0.9 billion (compared to 0.8 billion as of June 30, 2024). The net ARS exposure was reduced as of the end of the quarter as a result of Citi holding approximately 200 million of USD-denominated loans as well as approximately 200 million of certain local government bonds that are USD denominated. If Citi had not invested in such instruments to reduce its ARS exposure, Citi would have recognized additional translation losses during the third quarter of 2024. Given current economic conditions and the local capital, currency and regulatory limitations, Citi cannot guarantee the availability or effectiveness of such mechanisms to reduce its ARS exposure in the future. 
 In addition to reducing the ARS exposure, Citi also seeks to economically hedge the exposure to the extent possible and prudent using non-deliverable forward (NDF) derivative instruments that are primarily executed outside of Argentina. As of September 30, 2024, Citi hedged approximately 0.3 billion of its ARS exposure through offshore hedges, including NDF derivative instruments. Citi was unable to hedge its remaining ARS exposure, given the illiquidity of the offshore NDF market. To the extent that Citi is unable to execute or renew NDF contracts in the future, Citi would record devaluations on its net ARS-denominated assets in earnings, without any benefit from a change in the fair value of such derivative positions used to economically hedge the exposure. Citi cannot predict the availability of hedging instruments in the future nor can it predict changes in foreign exchange rates and the resulting impact on earnings. 
 Citi continually evaluates its economic exposure to its Argentine counterparties and reserves for changes in credit risk and records mark-to-market adjustments for relevant market risks associated with its Argentine assets. Citi believes it has established an appropriate ACL on its Argentine loans, and appropriate fair value adjustments on Argentine assets and liabilities measured at fair value, for credit and sovereign risks under U.S. GAAP as of September 30, 2024. For additional information on Citi s emerging markets risks, including those related to its Argentine exposures, see Risk Factors Strategic Risks in Citi s 2023 Form 10-K.

SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND SIGNIFICANT ESTIMATES 
 
 This section contains a summary of Citi s most significant accounting policies. Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Citi s 2023 Form 10-K contains a summary of all of Citigroup s significant accounting policies. These policies, as well as estimates made by management, are integral to the presentation of Citi s results of operations and financial condition. While all of these policies require a certain level of management judgment and estimates, this section highlights and discusses the significant accounting policies that require management to make highly difficult, complex or subjective judgments and estimates at times regarding matters that are inherently uncertain and susceptible to change (see also Risk Factors Operational Risks in Citi s 2023 Form 10-K). Management has discussed each of these significant accounting policies, the related estimates and its judgments with the Audit Committee of the Citigroup Board of Directors. 
 
 Valuations of Financial Instruments 
 Citigroup holds debt and equity securities, derivatives, retained interests in securitizations, investments in private equity and other financial instruments. A portion of these assets and liabilities is reflected at fair value on Citi s Consolidated Balance Sheet as Trading account assets , Available-for-sale securities and Trading account liabilities . 
 Citi purchases securities under agreements to resell (reverse repos or resale agreements) and sells securities under agreements to repurchase (repos), a substantial portion of which is carried at fair value. In addition, certain loans, short-term borrowings, long-term debt and deposits, as well as certain securities borrowed and loaned positions that are collateralized with cash, are carried at fair value. Citigroup holds its investments, trading assets and liabilities, and resale and repurchase agreements on Citi s Consolidated Balance Sheet to meet customer needs and to manage liquidity needs, interest rate risks and private equity investing. 
 When available, Citi generally uses quoted market prices to determine fair value and classifies such items within Level 1 of the fair value hierarchy established under ASC 820-10, Fair Value Measurement . If quoted market prices are not available, fair value is based on internally developed valuation models that use, where possible, current market-based or independently sourced market parameters, such as interest rates, currency rates and option volatilities. Such models are often based on a discounted cash flow analysis. In addition, items valued using such internally generated valuation techniques are classified according to the lowest level input or value driver that is significant to the valuation. Thus, an item may be classified under the fair value hierarchy as Level 3 even though there may be some significant inputs that are readily observable. 

Citi is required to exercise subjective judgments relating to the applicability and functionality of internal valuation models, the significance of inputs or drivers to the valuation of an instrument and the degree of illiquidity and subsequent lack of observability in certain markets. The fair value of these instruments is reported on Citi s Consolidated Balance Sheet with the changes in fair value recognized in either the Consolidated Statement of Income or in AOCI . 
 Losses on available-for-sale securities whose fair values are less than the amortized cost, where Citi intends to sell the security or could more-likely-than-not be required to sell the security prior to recovery, are recognized in earnings. Where Citi does not intend to sell the security nor could more-likely-than-not be required to sell the security, any portion of the loss that is attributable to credit is recognized as an allowance for credit losses with a corresponding provision for credit losses, and the remainder of the loss is recognized in AOCI . Such credit losses are capped at the difference between the fair value and amortized cost of the security. 
 For equity securities carried at cost or under the measurement alternative, decreases in fair value below the carrying value are recognized as impairment in the Consolidated Statement of Income. Moreover, for certain equity method investments, decreases in fair value are only recognized in earnings in the Consolidated Statement of Income if such decreases are judged to be an other-than-temporary impairment (OTTI). Assessing if the fair value impairment is temporary is also inherently judgmental. 
 The fair value of financial instruments incorporates the effects of Citi s own credit risk and the market view of counterparty credit risk, the quantification of which is also complex and judgmental. For additional information on Citi s fair value analysis, see Notes 6, 23 and 24 in this Form 10-Q and Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Citi s 2023 Form 10-K.

Citi s reserves for expected credit losses on funded loans and for unfunded lending commitments, standby letters of credit and financial guarantees are reflected on the Consolidated Balance Sheet in the Allowance for credit losses on loans (ACLL) and Other liabilities (for Allowance for credit losses on unfunded lending commitments (ACLUC)), respectively. In addition, Citi s reserves for expected credit losses on other financial assets carried at amortized cost, including held-to-maturity securities, reverse repurchase agreements, securities borrowed, deposits with banks and other financial receivables are reflected in Other assets . These reserves, together with the ACLL and ACLUC, are referred to as the ACL. Changes in the ACL are reflected as Provision for credit losses in the Consolidated Statement of Income for each reporting period. Citi s ability to estimate expected credit losses over the reasonable and supportable (R S) period is based on the ability to forecast economic activity over a R S timeframe. The R S forecast period for all loans is eight quarters. 
 The ACL is composed of quantitative and qualitative management adjustment components. The quantitative component uses three forward-looking macroeconomic forecast scenarios base, upside and downside. The qualitative management adjustment component reflects risks and certain economic conditions not fully captured in the quantitative component. Both the quantitative and qualitative components are further discussed below. 
 
 Quantitative Component 
 Citi estimates expected credit losses for its quantitative component using (i) its comprehensive internal data on loss and default history, (ii) internal credit risk ratings, (iii) external credit bureau and rating agencies information and (iv) R S forecasts of macroeconomic conditions. 
 For its consumer and corporate portfolios, Citi s expected credit losses are determined primarily by utilizing models that consider the borrowers probability of default (PD), loss given default (LGD) and exposure at default (EAD). The loss likelihood and severity models used for estimating expected credit losses are sensitive to changes in macroeconomic variables, including housing prices, unemployment rate and real GDP, and cover a wide range of geographic, industry, product and business segments. 
 In addition, Citi s models determine expected credit losses based on leading credit indicators, including loan delinquencies, changes in portfolio size, default frequency, risk ratings and loss recovery rates, as well as other credit trends. 
 
 Qualitative Component 
 The qualitative management adjustment component includes risks that are not fully captured in the quantitative component. These may include but are not limited to portfolio characteristics, idiosyncratic events, factors not within historical loss data or the economic forecast, uncertainty in the credit environment and other factors as required by banking supervisory guidance for the ACL. The primary examples of these are the following: 

Transfer risk associated with exposures outside the U.S. for certain safety and soundness considerations under U.S. banking law 
 Potential impacts on vulnerable industries and regions due to emerging macroeconomic risks and uncertainties, including those related to potential global recession, inflation, interest rates, commodity prices and geopolitical tensions 
 Risk associated with consumer payment behavior given the elevated inflationary and interest rate environment 
 
 As of the third quarter of 2024, Citi s qualitative component of the ACL increased quarter-over-quarter. The increase was driven by factors such as increases in transfer risk associated with exposures outside the U.S. for safety and soundness considerations under U.S. banking law and macroeconomic uncertainties, partially offset by a reduction in qualitative reserves associated with consumer payment behavior related to the elevated inflationary and interest rate environment. 
 
 Macroeconomic Variables 
 As further discussed below, Citi considers a multitude of global macroeconomic variables for the base, upside and downside probability-weighted macroeconomic scenario forecasts it uses to estimate the quantitative component of the ACL. Citi s forecasts of the U.S. unemployment rate and U.S. real GDP growth rate represent the key macroeconomic variables that most significantly affect its estimate of the ACL. 
 The tables below present Citi s forecasted quarterly average U.S. unemployment rate and year-over-year U.S. real GDP growth rate used in determining the base macroeconomic forecast for Citi s ACL for each quarterly reporting period from the third quarter of 2023 to the third quarter of 2024:

 (1) The year-over-year growth rate is the percentage change in the real (inflation adjusted) GDP level. 

89 

Under the base macroeconomic forecast as of the third quarter of 2024, U.S. real GDP growth is expected to slow during 2025, while the unemployment rate increases gradually into the first half of 2025 before gradually declining into 2026. 
 
 Scenario Weighting 
 Citi s ACL is estimated using three probability-weighted macroeconomic scenarios base, upside and downside. The macroeconomic scenario weights are estimated using a statistical model, which, among other factors, takes into consideration key macroeconomic drivers of the ACL, severity of the scenario and other macroeconomic uncertainties and risks. Citi evaluates scenario weights on a quarterly basis. 
 Citi s downside scenario incorporates more adverse macroeconomic assumptions than the base scenario. For example, compared to the base scenario, Citi s downside scenario reflects a recession, including an elevated average U.S. unemployment rate of 6.8 over the eight-quarter R S period, with a peak difference of 3.6 in the first quarter of 2026. The downside scenario also reflects a year-over-year U.S. real GDP contraction in 2025 of 2.2 , with a peak quarter-over-quarter difference to the base scenario of 1.2 . 
 Citi s ACL is sensitive to the various macroeconomic scenarios that drive the quantitative component of expected credit losses, due to changes in the length and severity of forecasted economic variables or events in the respective scenarios. Citi s downside scenario incorporates more adverse macroeconomic assumptions than the weighted scenario assumptions. To demonstrate this sensitivity, if Citi applied 100 weight to the downside scenario as of September 30, 2024 to reflect the most severe economic deterioration forecast in the macroeconomic scenarios, there would have been a hypothetical incremental increase in the ACL of approximately 5.3 billion related to lending exposures, except for loans individually evaluated for credit losses and other financial assets carried at amortized cost. 
 This analysis does not incorporate any impacts or changes to the qualitative component of the ACL. These factors could change the outcome of the sensitivity analysis based on historical experience and current conditions at the time of the assessment. Given the uncertainty inherent in macroeconomic forecasting, Citi continues to believe that its ACL estimate based on a three probability-weighted macroeconomic scenario approach combined with the qualitative component remains appropriate as of September 30, 2024. 
 
 3Q24 Changes in the ACL 
 As further discussed below, Citi s ending ACL balance for the third quarter of 2024 was 22.1 billion, a slight increase from June 30, 2024. The net build of 0.5 billion in the quarter was primarily driven by changes in portfolio composition in Banking and Markets , an increase in transfer risk associated with unremittable corporate dividends in Services and loan growth in USPB . Citi believes its analysis of the ACL reflects the forward view of the economic environment as of September 30, 2024. See Note 15 for additional information. 

Consumer Allowance for Credit Losses on Loans 
 Citi s consumer ACLL is largely driven by U.S. cards (Branded Cards and Retail Services) in USPB . Citi s total consumer ACLL build was 0.1 billion in the third quarter of 2024, as a result of higher loan balances. This resulted in a September 30, 2024 ACLL balance of 15.8 billion, or 4.05 of total funded consumer loans. 
 For U.S. cards, the level of reserves relative to total funded loans increased slightly to 8.15 at September 30, 2024, compared to 8.14 at June 30, 2024. For the remaining consumer exposures, the level of reserves relative to total funded loans was 1.08 at September 30, 2024, compared to 1.09 at June 30, 2024. 
 
 Corporate Allowance for Credit Losses on Loans 
 Citi had a corporate ACLL build of 0.1 billion in the third quarter of 2024, largely driven by changes in portfolio composition in Banking and Markets. This resulted in a September 30, 2024 ACLL balance of 2.6 billion, or 0.89 of total funded corporate loans. 
 
 ACLUC 
 Citi had an ACLUC build of 0.1 billion in the third quarter of 2024, largely driven by changes in portfolio composition in Banking and Markets . The ACLUC reserve balance, included in Other liabilities , was 1.7 billion at September 30, 2024. 
 
 ACL on Other Financial Assets 
 Citi had an ACL build of 0.2 billion on other financial assets carried at amortized cost for the third quarter of 2024, primarily due to an increase in transfer risk associated with unremittable corporate dividends outside the U.S. being held on behalf of clients, driven by safety and soundness considerations under U.S. banking law. Including FX/Other, the ACL reserve balance of 2.0 billion remained unchanged from June 30, 2024. See Note 15 for additional information. 
 
 Regulatory Capital Impact 
 Citi elected the modified CECL transition provision for regulatory capital purposes provided by the U.S. banking agencies final rule. Accordingly, the Day One regulatory capital effects resulting from the adoption of CECL, as well as the ongoing adjustments for 25 of the change in CECL-based allowances in each quarter between January 1, 2020 and December 31, 2021, started to be phased in on January 1, 2022 and will be fully reflected in Citi s regulatory capital as of January 1, 2025. 
 
 See Notes 1 and 15 for a further description of the ACL and related accounts. 

90 

Goodwill 
 Citi tests for goodwill impairment annually as of October 1 (the annual test) and conducts interim assessments between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more-likely-than-not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount. These events or circumstances include, among other things, a significant adverse change in the business climate, a decision to sell or dispose of all or a significant portion of a reporting unit or a sustained decrease in Citi s stock price. 
 The impairment tests performed in the fourth quarter of 2023 resulted in the fair values of Citi s reporting units exceeding their carrying values for all reporting units. Additionally, the tests results showed that the fair value of the Mexico Consumer/SBMM reporting unit as a percentage of its carrying value was 106 , with the carrying value including approximately 1.1 billion of goodwill. For each of the remaining reporting units, fair value exceeded carrying value by at least 10 . 
 While the inherent risk related to uncertainty is embedded in the key assumptions used in the valuations of the reporting units, the economic and business environments continue to evolve as Citi s management executes on its transformation and strategy. If management s future estimates of key economic and market assumptions were to differ from its current assumptions, Citi could potentially experience material goodwill impairment charges in the future. See Note 16 for a further discussion of goodwill. 
 
 Litigation Accruals 
 See the discussion in Note 27 for Citi s policies on establishing accruals for litigation and regulatory contingencies. 

INCOME TAXES 
 
 Effective Tax Rate 
 
 Three Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30, In millions of dollars, except effective tax rate 2024 2023 2024 2023 Income from continuing operations before income tax expense 4,390 4,788 13,244 15,013 Provision for income taxes 1,116 1,203 3,299 3,824 Effective tax rate 25 25 25 25 
 
 Citi s effective tax rate was 25 in the third quarter of 2024 and in the third quarter of 2023, with the rates for all periods including the impact of divestitures. 

Deferred Tax Assets 
 For additional information on Citi s deferred tax assets (DTAs), see Capital Resources, Risk Factors Strategic Risks, Significant Accounting Policies and Significant Estimates Income Taxes and Notes 1 and 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Citi s 2023 Form 10-K. 
 
 The table below summarizes Citi s net DTAs balance: 
 
 Jurisdiction/Component DTAs balance In billions of dollars September 30, 2024 December 31, 2023 Total U.S. 26.8 26.3 Total foreign 3.2 3.3 Total 30.0 29.6 
 
 At September 30, 2024, Citigroup had recorded net DTAs of approximately 30.0 billion, a decrease of 0.2 billion from June 30, 2024 and an increase of 0.4 billion from December 31, 2023. The decrease quarter-over-quarter was primarily from unrealized gains in Other comprehensive income and the year-to-date increase was primarily a result of Citi s geographic mix of earnings. Of Citi s 30.0 billion of net DTAs, 12.8 billion (compared to 13.6 billion at June 30, 2024) was deducted in calculating Citi s regulatory capital, and the remaining 17.2 billion was appropriately risk weighted under the Basel III rules. 
 The 12.8 billion of DTAs deducted from regulatory capital was composed of 11.3 billion related to tax carry-forwards, with 3.1 billion of temporary differences in excess of the 10 /15 regulatory limitations, reduced by 1.6 billion of deferred tax liabilities, primarily associated with goodwill and certain other intangible assets that were separately deducted from capital. 
 
 DTA Realizability 
 Citi believes that realization of the net DTAs of 30.0 billion at September 30, 2024 is more-likely-than-not, based on management s expectations of future taxable income generation in the jurisdictions in which the DTAs arise, as well as consideration of available tax planning strategies (as defined in ASC Topic 740, Income Taxes ).

Consumer Loan Modifications to Borrowers Experiencing Financial Difficulty 
 Citi seeks to modify consumer loans to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty to minimize losses, avoid foreclosure or repossession of collateral and ultimately maximize payments received from the borrowers. Citi uses various metrics to identify consumer borrowers experiencing financial difficulty, with the primary indicator being delinquency at the time of modification. Citi s significant consumer modification programs are described below. 
 
 Credit Cards 
 Citi seeks to assist credit card borrowers who are experiencing financial difficulty by offering long-term loan modification programs. These modifications generally involve reducing the interest rate on the credit card, placing the customer on a fixed payment plan not to exceed 60 months and canceling the customer s available line of credit. Citi also grants modifications to credit card borrowers working with third-party renegotiation agencies that seek to restructure customers entire unsecured debt. In both circumstances, if the cardholder does not comply with the modified payment terms, the credit card loan continues to age and will ultimately be charged off in accordance with Citi s standard charge-off policy. In certain situations, Citi may forgive a portion of an outstanding balance if the borrower pays a required amount. 

Residential Mortgages 
 Citi utilizes a third-party subservicer for the servicing of its residential mortgage loans. Through this third-party subservicer, Citi seeks to assist residential mortgage borrowers who are experiencing financial difficulty primarily by offering interest rate reductions, principal and/or interest forbearance, term extensions or combinations thereof. Borrowers enrolled in forbearance programs typically have payments suspended until the end of the forbearance period. In the U.S., before permanently modifying the contractual payment terms of a mortgage loan, Citi enters into a trial modification with the borrower. Trial modifications generally represent a period during which the borrower makes monthly payments under the anticipated modified payment terms. These loans continue to age and accrue interest in accordance with their original contractual terms. Upon successful completion of the trial period, and the borrower s formal acceptance of the modified terms, Citi and the borrower enter into a permanent modification. Citi expects the majority of loans entering trial modifications to ultimately be enrolled in a permanent modification. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, million and million, respectively, of mortgage loans were enrolled in trial programs. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, million and million, respectively, of mortgage loans were enrolled in trial programs. Mortgage loans of million and million had gone through Chapter 7 bankruptcy during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, and million and million during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively.

 (1) In 2023, goodwill of approximately million was transferred from Banking to Markets related to business realignment. Prior-period amounts have been 
 revised to conform with the current presentation. See Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Citi s 2023 Form 10-K. 
 (2) Goodwill allocated to the global fiduciary and trust administration services business was classified as HFS during the third quarter of 2024. 

Citi tests for goodwill impairment annually as of October 1 (the annual test) and conducts interim assessments between the annual test if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more-likely-than-not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount. No such events or circumstances were identified as part of the qualitative assessment performed as of September 30, 2024. For additional information regarding Citi s goodwill impairment testing process, see Notes 1 and 17 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Citi s 2023 Form 10-K. 

While the inherent risk of uncertainty is embedded in the key assumptions used in the reporting unit valuations, the economic and business environments continue to evolve as management executes on its transformation and strategy. If management s future estimates of key economic and market assumptions were to differ from its current assumptions, Citi could potentially experience material goodwill impairment charges in the future.

(1) The definition of maximum exposure to loss is included in the text that follows this table. 
 (2) Included on Citigroup s September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 Consolidated Balance Sheet. 
 (3) A significant unconsolidated VIE is an entity in which the Company has any variable interest or continuing involvement considered to be significant, regardless of the likelihood of loss. 
 (4) Citigroup mortgage securitizations also include agency and non-agency (private label) re-securitization activities. These SPEs are not consolidated. See Re-securitizations below for further discussion. 
 (5) Included within this line are loans to third-party-sponsored private equity funds, which represent billion and billion in unconsolidated VIE assets and million and million in maximum exposure to loss as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively.

 certain VIEs structured by third parties in which the Company holds securities in inventory, as these investments are made on arm s-length terms; 
 certain positions in mortgage- and asset-backed securities held by the Company, which are classified as Trading account assets or Investments , in which the Company has no other involvement with the related securitization entity deemed to be significant (see Notes 13 and 22 for more information on these positions); 
 certain representations and warranties exposures in Citigroup residential mortgage securitizations, in which the original mortgage loan balances are no longer outstanding; and 
 VIEs such as preferred securities trusts used in connection with the Company s funding activities. The Company does not have a variable interest in these trusts. 

The asset balances for consolidated VIEs represent the carrying amounts of the assets consolidated by the Company. The carrying amount may represent the amortized cost or the current fair value of the assets depending on the classification of the asset (e.g., loan or security) and the associated accounting model ascribed to that classification. 
 The asset balances for unconsolidated VIEs in which the Company has significant involvement represent the most current information available to the Company. In most cases, the asset balances represent an amortized cost basis without regard to impairments, unless fair value information is readily available to the Company. 
 The maximum funded exposure represents the balance sheet carrying amount of the Company s investment in the VIE. It reflects the initial amount of cash invested in the VIE, adjusted for any accrued interest and cash principal payments received. The carrying amount may also be adjusted for increases or declines in fair value or any impairment in value recognized in earnings. The maximum exposure of unfunded positions represents the remaining undrawn committed amount, including liquidity and credit facilities provided by the Company or the notional amount of a derivative instrument considered to be a variable interest. In certain transactions, the Company has entered into derivative instruments or other arrangements that are not considered variable interests in the VIE (e.g., interest rate swaps, cross-currency swaps or where the Company is the purchaser of credit protection under a credit default swap or total return swap where the Company pays the total return on certain assets to the SPE). Receivables under such arrangements are not included in the maximum exposure amounts.

Credit Card Securitizations 
 The Company s primary credit card securitization activity is through trusts Citibank Credit Card Master Trust and Citibank Omni Trust. These trusts are consolidated entities given Citi s continuing involvement. For additional information, see Note 23 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Citi s 2023 Form 10-K. There were no material cash flows arising from either proceeds from new securitizations or paydowns of maturing notes during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023.

 Gains recognized on the securitization of U.S. agency-sponsored mortgages were less than million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024. Gains recognized on the securitization of non-agency-sponsored mortgages were million and million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively. 

Gains recognized on the securitization of U.S. agency-sponsored mortgages were less than million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023. Gains recognized on the securitization of non-agency-sponsored mortgages were million and million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively. 

(1) Disclosure of non-agency-sponsored mortgages as senior and subordinated interests is indicative of the interests position in the capital structure of the securitization.

 The fair value of the MSRs is primarily affected by changes in prepayments of mortgages that result from shifts in mortgage interest rates. Specifically, higher interest rates tend to lead to declining prepayments, which causes the fair value of the MSRs to increase. In managing this risk, Citigroup economically hedges a significant portion of the value of its MSRs through the use of interest rate derivative contracts, forward purchase and sale commitments of mortgage-backed securities and purchased securities, all classified as Trading account assets . 

The Company receives fees during the course of servicing previously securitized mortgages.

retained interests in private label re-securitization transactions structured by Citi. 
 The Company also re-securitizes U.S. government-agency-guaranteed mortgage-backed (agency) securities. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, Citi transferred agency securities with a fair value of approximately billion and billion to re-securitization entities, compared to approximately billion and billion for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively. 
 As of September 30, 2024, the fair value of Citi-retained interests in agency re-securitization transactions structured by Citi totaled approximately billion (including billion related to re-securitization transactions executed in 2024), compared to billion as of December 31, 2023 (including million related to re-securitization transactions executed in 2023), which is recorded in Trading account assets . The original fair values of agency re-securitization transactions in which Citi holds a retained interest as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 were approximately billion and billion, respectively. 
 As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company did not consolidate any private label or agency re-securitization entities. 
 
 Citi-Administered Asset-Backed Commercial Paper Conduits 
 At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the commercial paper conduits administered by Citi had approximately billion and billion of purchased assets outstanding, and unfunded commitments with clients of approximately billion and billion, respectively. 
 Substantially all of the funding of the conduits is in the form of short-term commercial paper. At September 30, 2024 

and December 31, 2023, the weighted-average remaining maturities of the commercial paper issued by the conduits were approximately and days, respectively. 
 Each asset purchased by the conduit is structured with transaction-specific credit enhancements, including over-collateralization, cash and excess spread collateral accounts, direct recourse or third-party guarantees. Each credit enhancement is sized with the objective of approximating an investment-grade credit rating, based on Citi s internal risk ratings. In addition to the transaction-specific credit enhancement, the conduits have obtained letters of credit from the Company that equal at least to of the conduit s assets with a minimum of million to million. The letters of credit provided by the Company to the conduits total approximately billion and billion as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. The net result across multi-seller conduits administered by the Company is that, in the event that defaulted assets exceed the transaction-specific credit enhancement described above, any losses in each conduit are allocated first to the Company and then to the commercial paper investors. 
 At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company owned billion and billion, respectively, of the commercial paper issued by its administered conduits. The Company s investments were not driven by market illiquidity and the Company is not obligated under any agreement to purchase the commercial paper issued by the conduits. 
 
 Municipal Securities Tender Option Bond (TOB) Trusts 
 At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, none of the municipal bonds owned by non-customer TOB trusts were subject to a credit guarantee provided by the Company. 
 The Company provides other liquidity agreements or letters of credit to customer-sponsored municipal investment funds, which are not variable interest entities, and municipality-related issuers that totaled billion and billion as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. These liquidity agreements and letters of credit are offset by reimbursement agreements with various term-out provisions.

 (1) Credit derivatives are arrangements designed to allow one party (protection purchaser) to transfer the credit risk of a reference asset to another party (protection seller). These arrangements allow a protection seller to assume the credit risk associated with the reference asset without directly purchasing that asset. The Company enters into credit derivative positions for purposes such as risk management, yield enhancement, reduction of credit concentrations and diversification of overall risk, and as a market-maker to facilitate client transactions.

In other instances, market changes have resulted in some inputs becoming more observable, and some unobservable inputs becoming less significant to the overall valuation of the instruments (e.g., when an option becomes deep-in or deep-out of the money). This has primarily resulted in billion and billion of certain structured long-term debt products being transferred from Level 3 to Level 2 during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively .

million and a gain of million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, and a loss of ) million and ) million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Changes in fair value resulting from changes in instrument-specific credit risk were estimated by incorporating the Company s current credit spreads observable in the bond market into the relevant valuation technique used to value each liability as described above. 
 
 The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities 
 
 Selected Portfolios of Securities Purchased Under Agreements to Resell, Securities Borrowed, Securities Sold Under Agreements to Repurchase, Securities Loaned and Certain Uncollateralized Short-Term Borrowings 
 The Company elected the fair value option for certain portfolios of fixed income securities purchased under agreements to resell and fixed income securities sold under 

agreements to repurchase, securities borrowed, securities loaned and certain uncollateralized short-term borrowings held primarily by broker-dealer entities in the U.S., the U.K. and Japan. In each case, the election was made because the related interest rate risk is managed on a portfolio basis, primarily with offsetting derivative instruments that are accounted for at fair value through earnings. 
 Changes in fair value for transactions in these portfolios are recorded in Principal transactions . The related interest income and interest expense are measured based on the contractual rates specified in the transactions and are reported as Interest income and Interest expense in the Consolidated Statement of Income. 
 
 Certain Loans and Other Credit Products 
 Citigroup has also elected the fair value option for certain other originated and purchased loans, including certain unfunded loan products, such as guarantees and letters of credit, executed by Citigroup s lending and trading businesses. None of these credit products are highly leveraged financing commitments. Significant groups of transactions include loans and unfunded loan products that are expected to be either sold or securitized in the near term, or transactions where the economic risks are hedged with derivative instruments, such as purchased credit default swaps or total return swaps where the Company pays the total return on the underlying loans to a third party. Citigroup has elected the fair value option to mitigate accounting mismatches in cases where hedge accounting is complex and to achieve operational simplifications. Fair value was not elected for most lending transactions across the Company. 

Aggregate unpaid principal balance in excess of (less than) fair value ) Balance of non-accrual loans or loans more than 90 days past due Aggregate unpaid principal balance in excess of (less than) fair value for non-accrual loans or loans more than 90 days past due

million and a loss of ) million, respectively. Changes in fair value due to instrument-specific credit risk are estimated based on changes in borrower-specific credit spreads and recovery assumptions. 
 
 Certain Investments in Unallocated Precious Metals 
 Citigroup invests in unallocated precious metals accounts (e.g., gold, silver, platinum and palladium) as part of its commodity trading activities. Under ASC 815, the investment is bifurcated into a debt host contract and a commodity derivative instrument. Citigroup elects the fair value option for the debt host contract, and reports the contract within Trading account assets on the Company s Consolidated Balance Sheet. 

As part of its commodity trading activities, Citi trades unallocated precious metals investments and executes forward purchase and forward sale derivative contracts with trading counterparties. When Citi sells an unallocated precious metals investment, Citi s receivable from its depository bank is repaid and Citi derecognizes its investment in the unallocated precious metal. The forward purchase or sale contract with the trading counterparty indexed to unallocated precious metals is accounted for as a derivative, at fair value through earnings. 
 
 Certain Mortgage Loans Held-for-Sale (HFS) 
 Citigroup has elected the fair value option for certain purchased and originated prime fixed-rate and conforming adjustable-rate first mortgage loans HFS. These loans are intended for sale or securitization and are economically hedged with derivative instruments. The Company has elected the fair value option to mitigate accounting mismatches in cases where hedge accounting is complex and to achieve operational simplifications. 

Aggregate fair value in excess of (less than) unpaid principal balance Balance of non-accrual loans or loans more than 90 days past due Aggregate unpaid principal balance in excess of fair value for non-accrual loans or loans more than 90 days past due 
 
 The changes in the fair values of these mortgage loans are reported in Other revenue in the Company s Consolidated Statement of Income. There was no net change in fair value during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 due to instrument-specific credit risk. Changes in fair value due to instrument-specific credit risk are estimated based on changes in the borrower default, prepayment and recovery forecasts in addition to instrument-specific credit spread. Related interest income continues to be measured based on the contractual interest rates and reported as Interest income in the Consolidated Statement of Income.

 (2) At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, this maximum potential exposure was estimated to be approximately billion and billion, respectively. However, Citi believes that the maximum exposure is not representative of the actual potential loss exposure based on its historical experience. This contingent liability is unlikely to arise, as most products and services are delivered when purchased and amounts are refunded when items are returned to merchants.

million and million at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively, and these amounts are included in Other liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. 
 
 Futures and Over-the-Counter Derivatives Clearing 
 Citi provides clearing services on central clearing parties (CCP) for clients that need to clear exchange-traded and over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives contracts with CCPs. As a clearing member, Citi is exposed to the risk of non-performance by clients (e.g., failure of a client to post variation margin to the CCP for negative changes in the value of the client s derivative contracts). In the event of non-performance by a client, Citi would move to close out the client s positions. The CCP would typically utilize initial margin posted by the client and held by the CCP, with any remaining shortfalls required to be paid by Citi as clearing member. Citi generally holds incremental cash or securities margin posted by the client, which would typically be expected to be sufficient to mitigate Citi s credit risk in the event that the client fails to perform. 

Carrying Value Guarantees and Indemnifications 
 At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the total carrying amounts of the liabilities related to the guarantees and indemnifications included in the tables above amounted to approximately billion and billion, respectively.

Securities and other marketable assets held as collateral amounted to billion and billion at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. The majority of collateral is held to reimburse losses realized under securities lending indemnifications. In addition, letters of credit in favor of Citi held as collateral amounted to billion and billion at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. Other property may also be available to Citi to cover losses under certain guarantees and indemnifications; however, the value of such property has not been determined.

 For additional information regarding Citi s leases, see Notes 1 and 29 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Citi s 2023 Form 10-K. 
 Lease liability 
 
 The Company recognizes fixed lease costs on a straight-line basis throughout the lease term in the Consolidated Statement of Income. In addition, variable lease costs are recognized in the period in which the obligation for those payments is incurred.

 billion in the aggregate. 
 As available information changes, the matters for which Citigroup is able to estimate will change, and the estimates themselves will change. In addition, while many estimates presented in financial statements and other financial disclosures involve significant judgment and may be subject to significant uncertainty, estimates of the range of reasonably possible loss arising from litigation, regulatory, tax, or other matters are subject to particular uncertainties. For example, at the time of making an estimate, Citigroup may only have preliminary or incomplete information about the facts underlying the claim; its assumptions about the future rulings of the court or other tribunal on significant issues, or the behavior and incentives of adverse parties, regulators, or tax authorities may prove to be wrong; and the outcomes it is attempting to predict are often not amenable to the use of statistical or other quantitative analytical tools. In addition, from time to time an outcome may occur that Citigroup had not accounted for in its estimates because it had deemed such an outcome to be remote. For all these reasons, the amount of loss in excess of amounts accrued in relation to matters for which an estimate has been made could be substantially higher or lower than the range of loss included in the estimate.

References herein to the accrual of dividends refer only to the determination of the amount of such dividend and do not imply that any right to a dividend arises prior to the date on which a dividend is declared. 
 
 (c) Priority of Dividends. So long as any share of Series AA Preferred Stock remains outstanding, unless as to a Dividend Payment Date full dividends on all outstanding shares of the Series AA Preferred Stock have been declared and paid or declared and a sum sufficient for the payment of those dividends has been set aside for the Dividend Period then ending, the Company will not, and will cause its subsidiaries not to, during the next succeeding Dividend Period that commences on such Dividend Payment Date, declare or pay any dividend on, make any distributions relating to, or redeem, purchase, acquire or make a liquidation payment relating to, any Junior Stock, or make any guarantee payment with respect thereto, other than

 The foregoing restriction, however, will not apply to any Junior Stock dividends paid by the Company where the dividend stock is the same stock as that on which the dividend is being paid. 
 
 Except as provided below, for so long as any share of Series AA Preferred Stock remains outstanding, if dividends are not declared and paid in full upon the shares of Series AA Preferred Stock and any Parity Stock, all dividends declared upon shares of Series AA Preferred Stock and any Parity Stock will be declared on a proportional basis so that the amount of dividends declared per share will bear to each other the same ratio that accrued dividends for the then-current Dividend Period per share of Series AA Preferred Stock and accrued dividends for the then-current Dividend Period per share of any Parity Stock (including, in the case of any such Parity Stock that bears cumulative dividends, all accrued and unpaid dividends) bear to each other. 
 
 Subject to the foregoing, and not otherwise, such dividends payable in cash, stock or otherwise, as may be determined by the Board of Directors, the Preferred Stock Committee or any other duly authorized committee thereof, may be declared and paid on any Junior Stock and Parity Stock from time to time out of any assets legally available for such payment, and Holders will not be entitled to participate in those dividends.

Holders shall not be entitled to any further payments in the event of any such voluntary or involuntary liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the affairs of the Company other than what is expressly provided for in this Section 5. 
 
 (b) Partial Payment. If the assets of the Company are not sufficient to pay in full the liquidation preference plus any dividends which have been declared but not yet paid to all Holders and all holders of any Parity Stock, the amounts paid to the Holders and to the holders of all Parity Stock shall be pro rata in accordance with the respective aggregate liquidating distributions to which they would otherwise be entitled. 
 
 (c) Residual Distributions. If the respective aggregate liquidating distributions to which all Holders and all holders of any Parity Stock are entitled have been paid, the holders of Junior Stock shall be entitled to receive all remaining assets of the Company according to their respective rights and preferences. 
 
 (d) Merger, Consolidation and Sale of Assets Not Liquidation. For purposes of this Section 5, the sale, conveyance, exchange or transfer (for cash, shares of stock, securities or other consideration) of all or substantially all of the property and assets of the Company shall not be deemed a voluntary or involuntary dissolution, liquidation or winding up of the 

affairs of the Company, nor shall the merger, consolidation or any other business combination transaction of the Company into or with any other corporation or person or the merger, consolidation or any other business combination transaction of any other corporation or person into or with the Company be deemed to be a voluntary or involuntary dissolution, liquidation or winding up of the affairs of the Company.

In case of any redemption of only part of the shares of Series AA Preferred Stock at the time outstanding, the shares of Series AA Preferred Stock to be redeemed shall be selected pro rata from the Holders in proportion to the number of shares of Series AA Preferred Stock held by such Holders, by lot or in such other manner as the Board of Directors, the Preferred Stock Committee or any other duly authorized committee thereof may determine to be fair and equitable. Subject to the provisions of this Section 6, the Board of Directors, the Preferred Stock Committee or any other duly authorized committee thereof shall have full power and authority to prescribe the terms and conditions upon which shares of Series AA Preferred Stock shall be redeemed from time to time. 
 
 (d) Effectiveness of Redemption. If notice of redemption has been duly given and if on or before the redemption date specified in the notice all funds necessary for the redemption have been set aside by the Company, separate and apart from its other assets, in trust for the pro rata benefit of the Holders of the shares called for redemption, so as to be and continue to be available therefor, or deposited by the Company with a bank or trust company selected by the Board of Directors, the Preferred Stock Committee or any other duly authorized committee thereof (the Trust in trust for the pro rata benefit of the Holders of the shares called for redemption, then, notwithstanding that any certificate for any share so called for redemption has not been surrendered for cancellation, on and after the redemption date all shares so called for redemption shall cease to be outstanding, all dividends with respect to such shares shall cease to accrue on such redemption date, and all rights with respect to such shares shall forthwith on such redemption date cease and terminate, except only the right of the Holders thereof to receive the amount payable on such redemption from the Trust at any time after the redemption date from the funds so deposited, without interest. The Company shall be entitled to receive, from 

time to time, from the Trust any interest accrued on such funds, and the Holders of any shares called for redemption shall have no claim to any such interest.

 Section 7. Voting Rights. 
 
 (a) General. The Holders shall not be entitled to vote on any matter except as set forth in Section 7(b) below or as required by Delaware law. 
 
 (b) Special Voting Right. 
 
 (i) Voting Right. If and whenever dividends on the Series AA Preferred Stock or any other class or series of preferred stock that ranks on parity with Series AA Preferred Stock as to payment of dividends, and upon which voting rights equivalent to those granted by this Section 7(b)(i) have been conferred and are exercisable, have not been paid in an aggregate amount equal, as to any class or series, to at least six quarterly Dividend Periods (whether consecutive or not) (a Nonpayment ), the number of directors constituting the Board of Directors shall be increased by two, and the Holders (together with holders of any class or series of the Company s authorized preferred stock having equivalent voting rights), shall have the right, voting separately as a single class without regard to class or series (and with voting rights allocated pro rata based on the liquidation preference of each such class or series), to the exclusion of the holders of Common Stock, to elect two directors of the Company to fill such newly created directorships (and to fill any vacancies in the terms of such directorships), provided that the Holders and the holders of any such other class or series shall not be entitled to elect such directors to the extent such election would cause the Company to violate the corporate governance requirements of the New York Stock Exchange (or other exchange on which the Company s securities may be listed) that listed companies must have a majority of independent directors and further provided that the Board of Directors shall at no time include more than two such directors. Each such director elected by the Holders and any other class or series of preferred stock that ranks on parity with the Series AA Preferred Stock as to payment of dividends and having equivalent voting rights is a Preferred Stock Director . 
 
 (ii) Election. The election of the Preferred Stock Directors will take place at any annual meeting of stockholders or any special meeting of the Holders and any other class or series of stock of the Company that ranks on parity with Series AA Preferred Stock as to payment of dividends and having equivalent voting rights and for which dividends have not been paid, called as provided herein. At any time after the special voting power has vested pursuant to Section 7(b)(i) above, the secretary of the Company may, and upon the written request of the Holders of at least 20 of the Series AA Preferred Stock or the holders of at least 20 of such other series (addressed to the secretary at the Company s principal office) must (unless such request is received less than 90 days before the date fixed for the next annual or special meeting of the stockholders, in which event such election shall be held at such next annual or special meeting of stockholders), call a special meeting of the Holders and any other class or series of preferred stock that ranks on parity with Series AA Preferred Stock as to payment of dividends and having equivalent voting rights and for which dividends have not been paid for the election of the two directors to be elected by them as provided in Section 7(b)(iii) below. The Preferred Stock Directors shall each be entitled to one vote per director on any matter. 
 
 (iii) Notice of Special Meeting. Notice for a special meeting will be given in a similar manner to that provided in the Company s by-laws for a special meeting of the stockholders. If the secretary of the Company does not call a special meeting within 20 days after receipt of any such request, then any Holder may (at the expense of the Company) call such meeting, upon notice as provided in this Section 7(b)(iii), and for that purpose will have access to the stock register of the Company. The Preferred Stock Directors elected at any such special meeting will hold office until the next annual meeting of the stockholders of the Company unless they have been previously terminated or removed pursuant to Section 7(b)(iv). In case any vacancy in the office of a Preferred Stock Director occurs (other than prior to the initial election of the Preferred Stock Directors), the vacancy may be filled by the written consent of the Preferred Stock Director remaining in office, or if none remains in office, by the vote of the Holders (together with holders of any other class of the Company s authorized preferred stock having equivalent voting rights, whether or not the holders of such preferred stock would be entitled to vote for the election of directors if such default in dividends did not exist) to serve until the next annual meeting of the stockholders. 

(iv) Termination Removal. Whenever the Company has paid full dividends for at least four consecutive quarterly dividend periods following a Nonpayment on the Series AA Preferred Stock and any other class or series of non-cumulative preferred stock ranking on parity with Series AA Preferred Stock as to payment of dividends, if any, and has paid cumulative dividends in full on any class or series of cumulative preferred stock ranking on parity with the Series AA Preferred Stock as to payment of dividends (in each case, upon which equivalent voting rights to those set forth in Section 7(b)(iii) have been conferred and are exercisable), then the right of the Holders to elect the Preferred Stock Directors will cease (but subject always to the same provisions for the vesting of the special voting rights in the case of any similar non-payment of dividends in respect of future Dividend Periods). The terms of office of the Preferred Stock Directors will immediately terminate, and the number of directors constituting the Board of Directors will be reduced accordingly. Any Preferred Stock Director may be removed at any time without cause by the Holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of the Series AA Preferred Stock (together with holders of any other class of the Company s authorized preferred stock having equivalent voting rights, whether or not the holders of such preferred stock would be entitled to vote for the election of directors if such default in dividends did not exist) when they have the voting rights described in this Section 7(b). 
 
 (c) Senior Issuances Adverse Changes. So long as any shares of Series AA Preferred Stock are outstanding, the vote or consent of the Holders of at least two-thirds of the shares of Series AA Preferred Stock at the time outstanding, voting as a class with all other series of preferred stock ranking equally with the Series AA Preferred Stock and entitled to vote thereon, given in person or by proxy, either in writing without a meeting or by vote at any meeting called for the purpose, will be necessary for effecting or validating any of the following actions, whether or not such approval is required by Delaware law 
 
 (i) any amendment, alteration or repeal of any provision of the Company s Certificate of Incorporation (including the certificate of designation creating the Series AA Preferred Stock) or the Company s by-laws that would alter or change the voting powers, preferences or special rights of the Series AA Preferred Stock so as to affect them adversely 
 
 (ii) any amendment or alteration of the Company s certificate of incorporation to authorize or create, or increase the authorized amount of, any shares of, or any securities convertible into shares of, any class or series of the Company s capital stock ranking prior to the Series AA Preferred Stock in the payment of dividends or in the distribution of assets on any liquidation, dissolution or winding-up of the Company or

 If any amendment, alteration, repeal, share exchange, reclassification, merger or consolidation specified in this Section 7(c) would adversely affect one or more but not all series of preferred stock of the Company, then only such series of preferred stock as are 

adversely affected by and entitled to vote on the matter shall vote on the matter together as a single class (in lieu of all other series of preferred stock). 
 
 (d) No Vote if Redemption. No vote or consent of the Holders shall be required pursuant to Section 7(b) or (c) if, at or prior to the time when the act with respect to such vote or consent would otherwise be required shall be effected, the Company shall have redeemed or shall have called for redemption all outstanding shares of Series AA Preferred Stock, with proper notice and sufficient funds having been set aside for such redemption, in each case pursuant to Section 6 above.

 The foregoing restriction, however, will not apply to any Junior Stock dividends paid by the Company where the dividend stock is the same stock as that on which the dividend is being paid. 
 
 Except as provided below, for so long as any share of Series E Preferred Stock remains outstanding, if dividends are not declared and paid in full upon the shares of Series E Preferred Stock and any Parity Stock, all dividends declared upon shares of Series E Preferred Stock and any Parity Stock will be declared on a proportional basis so that the amount of dividends declared per share will bear to each other the same ratio that accrued dividends for the then-current Dividend Period per share of Series E Preferred Stock and accrued dividends for the then-current Dividend Period per share of any Parity Stock (including, in the case of any such Parity Stock that bears cumulative dividends, all accrued and unpaid dividends) bear to each other. 
 
 Subject to the foregoing, and not otherwise, such dividends payable in cash, stock or otherwise, as may be determined by the Board of Directors, the Preferred Stock Committee or any other duly authorized committee thereof, may be declared and paid on any Junior Stock and Parity Stock from time to time out of any assets legally available for such payment, and Holders will not be entitled to participate in those dividends.

Holders shall not be entitled to any further payments in the event of any such voluntary or involuntary liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the affairs of the Company other than what is expressly provided for in this Section 5. 
 
 (b) Partial Payment. If the assets of the Company are not sufficient to pay in full the liquidation preference plus any dividends which have been declared but not yet paid to all Holders and all holders of any Parity Stock, the amounts paid to the Holders and to the holders of all Parity Stock shall be pro rata in accordance with the respective aggregate liquidating distributions to which they would otherwise be entitled. 
 
 (c) Residual Distributions. If the respective aggregate liquidating distributions to which all Holders and all holders of any Parity Stock are entitled have been paid, the holders of Junior Stock shall be entitled to receive all remaining assets of the Company according to their respective rights and preferences. 
 
 (d) Merger, Consolidation and Sale of Assets Not Liquidation. For purposes of this Section 5, the sale, conveyance, exchange or transfer (for cash, shares of stock, securities or other consideration) of all or substantially all of the property and assets of the Company shall not be deemed a voluntary or involuntary dissolution, liquidation or winding up of the affairs of the Company, nor shall the merger, consolidation or any other business combination transaction of the Company into or with any other corporation or person or the merger, consolidation or any other business combination transaction of any other corporation or person into or with the Company be deemed to be a voluntary or involuntary dissolution, liquidation or winding up of the affairs of the Company.

The Company, at the option of its Board of Directors, the Preferred Stock Committee or any other duly authorized committee thereof, may redeem out of funds legally available therefor, in whole or in part, the shares of Series E Preferred Stock at the time outstanding, on any Dividend Payment Date on or after April 30, 2018 as to which the Company has declared a dividend in full on the Series E Preferred Stock, upon notice given as provided in Section 6(b) below, and at a redemption price equal to 25,000 per share provided, however, that the Company may not effect a partial redemption of the Series E Preferred Stock unless at least 2,000 shares 50,000,000 aggregate liquidation amount) of Series E Preferred Stock, excluding shares of Series E Preferred Stock held by the Company or its subsidiaries, remain outstanding after giving effect to such partial redemption.

Subject to the provisions of this Section 6, the Board of Directors, the Preferred Stock Committee or any other duly authorized committee thereof shall have full power and authority to prescribe the terms and conditions upon which shares of Series E Preferred Stock shall be redeemed from time to time.

The Preferred Stock Directors elected at any such special meeting will hold office until the next annual meeting of the stockholders of the Company unless they have been previously terminated or removed pursuant to Section 7(b)(iv). In case any vacancy in the office of a Preferred Stock Director occurs (other than prior to the initial election of the Preferred Stock Directors), the vacancy may be filled by the written consent of the Preferred Stock Director remaining in office, or if none remains in office, by the vote of the Holders (together with holders of any other class of the Company s authorized preferred stock having equivalent voting rights, whether or not the holders of such preferred stock would be entitled to vote for the election of directors if such default in dividends did not exist) to serve until the next annual meeting of the stockholders. 
 
 (iv) Termination Removal. Whenever the Company has paid full dividends for at least two consecutive semi-annual or four consecutive quarterly dividend periods following a Nonpayment on the Series E Preferred Stock and any other class or series of non-cumulative preferred stock ranking on parity with Series E Preferred Stock as to payment of dividends, if any, and has paid cumulative dividends in full on any class or series of cumulative preferred stock ranking on parity with the Series E Preferred Stock as to payment of dividends (in each case, upon which equivalent voting rights to those set forth in Section 7(b)(iii) have been conferred and are exercisable), then the right of the Holders to elect the Preferred Stock Directors will cease (but subject always to the same provisions for the vesting of the special voting rights in the case of any similar nonpayment of dividends in respect of future Dividend Periods). The terms of office of the Preferred Stock Directors will immediately terminate, and the number of directors constituting the Board of Directors will be reduced accordingly. Any Preferred Stock Director may be removed at any time without cause by the Holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of the Series E Preferred Stock (together with holders of any other class of the Company s authorized preferred stock having equivalent voting rights, whether or not the holders of such preferred stock would be entitled to vote for the election of directors if such default in dividends did not exist) when they have the voting rights described in this Section 7(b). 
 
 (c) Senior Issuances Adverse Changes. So long as any shares of Series E Preferred Stock are outstanding, the vote or consent of the Holders of at least two-thirds of the shares of Series E Preferred Stock at the time outstanding, voting as a class with all other series of preferred stock ranking equally with the Series E Preferred Stock and entitled to vote thereon, given in person or by proxy, either in writing without a meeting or by vote at any meeting called for the purpose, 

will be necessary for effecting or validating any of the following actions, whether or not such approval is required by Delaware law 
 
 (i) any amendment, alteration or repeal of any provision of the Company s Certificate of Incorporation (including the certificate of designation creating the Series E Preferred Stock) or the Company s by-laws that would alter or change the voting powers, preferences or special rights of the Series E Preferred Stock so as to affect them adversely 
 
 (ii) any amendment or alteration of the Company s certificate of incorporation to authorize or create, or increase the authorized amount of, any shares of, or any securities convertible into shares of, any class or series of the Company s capital stock ranking prior to the Series E Preferred Stock in the payment of dividends or in the distribution of assets on any liquidation, dissolution or winding-up of the Company or 
 
 (iii) the consummation of a binding share exchange or reclassification involving the Series E Preferred Stock or a merger or consolidation of the Company with another entity, except that holders of Series E Preferred Stock will have no right to vote under this provision or otherwise under Delaware law if in each case (i) the Series E Preferred Stock remains outstanding or, in the case of any such merger or consolidation with respect to which the Company is not the surviving or resulting entity, is converted into or exchanged for preferred securities of the surviving or resulting entity or its ultimate parent, that is an entity organized and existing under the laws of the United States of America, any state thereof or the District of Columbia and that is a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes (or if such entity is not a corporation, the Company having received an opinion of nationally recognized counsel experienced in such matters to the effect that Holders will be subject to tax for U.S. federal income tax purposes with respect to such new preferred securities after such merger or consolidation in the same amount, at the same time and otherwise in the same manner as would have been the case under the Series E Preferred Stock prior to such merger or consolidation), and (ii) such Series E Preferred Stock remaining outstanding or such preferred securities, as the case may be, have such rights, preferences, privileges and voting powers, taken as a whole, as are not materially less favorable to the holders thereof than the rights, preferences, privileges and voting powers of the Series E Preferred Stock, taken as a whole 
 
 provided, however, that any increase in the amount of the authorized or issued Series E Preferred Stock or authorized preferred stock or any securities convertible into preferred stock or the creation and issuance, or an increase in the authorized or issued amount, of other series of preferred stock or any securities convertible into preferred stock ranking equally with and or junior to the Series E Preferred Stock with respect to the payment of dividends (whether such dividends are cumulative or non-cumulative) and or the distribution of assets upon the Company s liquidation, dissolution or winding up will not be deemed to adversely affect the voting powers, preferences or special rights of the Series E Preferred Stock and Holders will have no right to vote on such an increase, creation or issuance. 
 
 If any amendment, alteration, repeal, share exchange, reclassification, merger or consolidation specified in this Section 7(c) would adversely affect one or more but not all series of preferred stock of the Company, then only such series of preferred stock as are adversely affected by and entitled to vote on the matter shall vote on the matter together as a single class (in lieu of all other series of preferred stock). 
 
 (d) No Vote if Redemption. No vote or consent of the Holders shall be required pursuant to Section 7(b) or (c) if, at or prior to the time when the act with respect to such vote or consent would otherwise be required shall be effected, the Company shall have redeemed or shall have called for redemption all outstanding shares of Series E Preferred Stock, with proper notice and sufficient funds having been set aside for such redemption, in each case pursuant to Section 6 above. 
 
 Section 8. Preemption and Conversion Rights. 
 
 The Holders shall not have any rights of preemption or conversion. 
 
 Section 9. Rank.

 Section 10. Repurchase. 

Subject to the limitations imposed herein, the Company may purchase and sell Series E Preferred Stock from time to time to such extent, in such manner, and upon such terms as the Board of Directors, the Preferred Stock Committee or any other duly authorized committee thereof may determine provided, however, that the Company shall not use any of its funds for any such purchase when there are reasonable grounds to believe that the Company is, or by such purchase would be, rendered insolvent provided, further, however, that in the event that the Company beneficially owns any Series E Preferred Stock, the Company will procure that voting rights in respect of such Series E Preferred Stock are not exercised. 
 
 Section 11. Unissued or Reacquired Shares. 
 
 Shares of Series E Preferred Stock not issued or which have been issued and redeemed or otherwise purchased or acquired by the Company shall be restored to the status of authorized but unissued shares of preferred stock without designation as to series.

References herein to the accrual of dividends refer only to the determination of the amount of such dividend and do not imply that any right to a dividend arises prior to the date on which a dividend is declared.

So long as any share of Series F Preferred Stock remains outstanding, unless as to a Dividend Payment Date full dividends on all outstanding shares of the Series F Preferred Stock have been declared and paid or declared and a sum sufficient for the payment of those dividends has been set aside for the Dividend Period then ending, the Company will not, and will cause its subsidiaries not to, during the next succeeding Dividend Period that commences on such Dividend Payment Date, declare or pay any dividend on, make any distributions relating to, or redeem, purchase, acquire or make a liquidation payment relating to, any Junior Stock, or make any guarantee payment with respect thereto, other than

 The foregoing restriction, however, will not apply to any Junior Stock dividends paid by the Company where the dividend stock is the same stock as that on which the dividend is being paid. 
 
 Except as provided below, for so long as any share of Series F Preferred Stock remains outstanding, if dividends are not declared and paid in full upon the shares of Series F Preferred Stock and any Parity Stock, all dividends declared upon shares of Series F Preferred Stock and any Parity Stock will be declared on a proportional basis so that the amount of dividends declared per share will bear to each other the same ratio that accrued dividends for the then current Dividend Period per share of Series F Preferred Stock and accrued dividends for the then-current Dividend Period per share of any Parity Stock (including, in the case of any such Parity Stock that bears cumulative dividends, all accrued and unpaid dividends) bear to each other. 
 
 Subject to the foregoing, and not otherwise, such dividends payable in cash, stock or otherwise, as may be determined by the Board of Directors, the Preferred Stock Committee or any other duly authorized committee thereof, may be declared and paid on any Junior Stock and Parity Stock from time to time out of any assets legally available for such payment, and Holders will not be entitled to participate in those dividends.

Holders shall not be entitled to any further payments in the event of any such voluntary or involuntary liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the affairs of the Company other than what is expressly provided for in this Section 5. 
 
 (b) Partial Payment. If the assets of the Company are not sufficient to pay in full the liquidation preference plus any dividends which have been declared but not yet paid to all Holders and all holders of any Parity Stock, the amounts paid to the Holders and to the holders of all Parity Stock shall be pro rata in accordance with the respective aggregate liquidating distributions to which they would otherwise be entitled. 
 
 (c) Residual Distributions. If the respective aggregate liquidating distributions to which all Holders and all holders of any Parity Stock are entitled have been paid, the holders of Junior Stock shall be entitled to receive all remaining assets of the Company according to their respective rights and preferences. 
 
 (d) Merger, Consolidation and Sale of Assets Not Liquidation. For purposes of this Section 5, the sale, conveyance, exchange or transfer (for cash, shares of stock, securities or other consideration) of all or substantially all of the property and assets of the Company shall not be deemed a voluntary or involuntary dissolution, liquidation or winding up of the affairs of the Company, nor shall the merger, consolidation or any other business combination transaction of the 

Company into or with any other corporation or person or the merger, consolidation or any other business combination transaction of any other corporation or person into or with the Company be deemed to be a voluntary or involuntary dissolution, liquidation or winding up of the affairs of the Company.

 (v) that dividends on the shares to be redeemed will cease to accrue on the redemption date. 
 
 Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the Series F Preferred Stock is held in book-entry form through DTC, the Company may give such notice in any manner permitted by DTC. 
 
 (c) Partial Redemption. In case of any redemption of only part of the shares of Series F Preferred Stock at the time outstanding, the shares of Series F Preferred Stock to be redeemed shall be selected pro rata from the Holders in proportion to the number of shares of Series F Preferred Stock held by such Holders, by lot or in such other manner as the Board of Directors, the Preferred Stock Committee or any other duly authorized committee thereof may determine to be fair and equitable. Subject to the provisions of this Section 6, the Board of Directors, the Preferred Stock Committee or any other duly authorized committee thereof shall have full power and authority to prescribe the terms and conditions upon which shares of Series F Preferred Stock shall be redeemed from time to time. 
 
 (d) Effectiveness of Redemption. If notice of redemption has been duly given and if on or before the redemption date specified in the notice all funds necessary for the redemption have been set aside by the Company, separate and apart from its other assets, in trust for the pro rata benefit of the Holders of the shares called for redemption, so as to be and continue to be available therefor, or deposited by the Company with a bank or trust company selected by the Board of Directors, the Preferred Stock Committee or any other duly authorized committee thereof (the Trust in trust for the pro rata benefit of the Holders of the shares called for redemption, then, notwithstanding that any certificate for any share so called for redemption has not been surrendered for cancellation, on and after the redemption date all shares so called for redemption shall cease to be outstanding, all dividends with respect to such shares shall cease to accrue on such redemption date, and all rights with respect to such shares shall forthwith on such redemption date cease and terminate, except only the right of the Holders thereof to receive the amount payable on such redemption from the Trust at any time after the redemption date from the funds so deposited, without interest. The Company shall be entitled to receive, from time to time, from the Trust any interest accrued on such funds, and the Holders of any shares called for redemption shall have no claim to any such interest. Any funds so deposited and unclaimed at the end of three years from the redemption date shall, to the extent permitted by law, be released or repaid to the Company, and in the event of such repayment to the Company, the Holders of the shares so called for redemption shall be deemed to be unsecured creditors of the 

Company for an amount equivalent to the amount deposited as stated above for the redemption of such shares and so repaid to the Company, but shall in no event be entitled to any interest. 
 
 Section 7. Voting Rights. 
 
 (a) General. The Holders shall not be entitled to vote on any matter except as set forth in Section 7(b) below or as required by Delaware law. 
 
 (b) Special Voting Right. 
 
 (i) Voting Right. If and whenever dividends on the Series F Preferred Stock or any other class or series of preferred stock that ranks on parity with Series F Preferred Stock as to payment of dividends, and upon which voting rights equivalent to those granted by this Section 7(b)(i) have been conferred and are exercisable, have not been paid in an aggregate amount equal, as to any class or series, to at least six quarterly Dividend Periods (whether consecutive or not) (a Nonpayment ), the number of directors constituting the Board of Directors shall be increased by two, and the Holders (together with holders of any class or series of the Company s authorized preferred stock having equivalent voting rights), shall have the right, voting separately as a single class without regard to class or series (and with voting rights allocated pro rata based on the liquidation preference of each such class or series), to the exclusion of the holders of Common Stock, to elect two directors of the Company to fill such newly created directorships (and to fill any vacancies in the terms of such directorships), provided that the Holders and the holders of any such other class or series shall not be entitled to elect such directors to the extent such election would cause the Company to violate the corporate governance requirements of the New York Stock Exchange (or other exchange on which the Company s securities may be listed) that listed companies must have a majority of independent directors and further provided that the Board of Directors shall at no time include more than two such directors. Each such director elected by the Holders and any other class or series of preferred stock that ranks on parity with the Series F Preferred Stock as to payment of dividends and having equivalent voting rights is a Preferred Stock Director . 
 
 (ii) Election. The election of the Preferred Stock Directors will take place at any annual meeting of stockholders or any special meeting of the Holders and any other class or series of stock of the Company that ranks on parity with Series F Preferred Stock as to payment of dividends and having equivalent voting rights and for which dividends have not been paid, called as provided herein. At any time after the special voting power has vested pursuant to Section 7(b)(i) above, the secretary of the Company may, and upon the written request of the Holders of at least 20 of the Series F Preferred Stock or the holders of at least 20 of such other series (addressed to the secretary at the Company s principal office) must (unless such request is received less than 90 days before the date fixed for the next annual or special meeting of the stockholders, in which event such election shall be held at such next annual or special meeting of stockholders), call a special meeting of the Holders and any other class or series of preferred stock that ranks on parity with Series F Preferred Stock as to payment of dividends and having equivalent voting rights and for which dividends have not been paid for the election of the two directors to be elected by them as provided in Section 7(b)(iii) below. The Preferred Stock Directors shall each be entitled to one vote per director on any matter. 
 
 (iii) Notice of Special Meeting. Notice for a special meeting will be given in a similar manner to that provided in the Company s by-laws for a special meeting of the stockholders. If the secretary of the Company does not call a special meeting within 20 days after receipt of any such request, then any Holder may (at the expense of the Company) call such meeting, upon notice as provided in this Section 7(b)(iii), and for that purpose will have access to the stock register of the Company. The Preferred Stock Directors elected at any such special meeting will hold office until the next annual meeting of the stockholders of the Company unless they have been previously terminated or removed pursuant to Section 7(b)(iv). In case any vacancy in the office of a Preferred Stock Director occurs (other than prior to the initial election of the Preferred Stock Directors), the vacancy may be filled by the written consent of the Preferred Stock Director remaining in office, or if none remains in office, by the vote of the Holders (together with holders of any other class of the Company s authorized preferred stock having equivalent voting rights, whether or not the holders of such preferred stock would be entitled to vote for the election of directors if such default in dividends did not exist) to serve until the next annual meeting of the stockholders. 
 
 (iv) Termination Removal. Whenever the Company has paid full dividends for at least four consecutive quarterly dividend periods following a Nonpayment on the Series F Preferred Stock and any other class or series of non-cumulative preferred stock ranking on parity with Series F Preferred Stock as to payment of dividends, if any, and has paid cumulative dividends in full on any class or series of cumulative preferred stock ranking on parity with the Series F Preferred Stock as to payment of dividends (in each case, upon which equivalent voting rights to those set forth in Section 7(b)(iii) have been conferred and are exercisable), then the right of the Holders to 

elect the Preferred Stock Directors will cease (but subject always to the same provisions for the vesting of the special voting rights in the case of any similar non-payment of dividends in respect of future Dividend Periods). The terms of office of the Preferred Stock Directors will immediately terminate, and the number of directors constituting the Board of Directors will be reduced accordingly. Any Preferred Stock Director may be removed at any time without cause by the Holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of the Series F Preferred Stock (together with holders of any other class of the Company s authorized preferred stock having equivalent voting rights, whether or not the holders of such preferred stock would be entitled to vote for the election of directors if such default in dividends did not exist) when they have the voting rights described in this Section 7(b). 
 
 (c) Senior Issuances Adverse Changes. So long as any shares of Series F Preferred Stock are outstanding, the vote or consent of the Holders of at least two-thirds of the shares of Series F Preferred Stock at the time outstanding, voting as a class with all other series of preferred stock ranking equally with the Series F Preferred Stock and entitled to vote thereon, given in person or by proxy, either in writing without a meeting or by vote at any meeting called for the purpose, will be necessary for effecting or validating any of the following actions, whether or not such approval is required by Delaware law 
 
 (i) any amendment, alteration or repeal of any provision of the Company s Certificate of Incorporation (including the certificate of designation creating the Series F Preferred Stock) or the Company s by-laws that would alter or change the voting powers, preferences or special rights of the Series F Preferred Stock so as to affect them adversely 
 
 (ii) any amendment or alteration of the Company s certificate of incorporation to authorize or create, or increase the authorized amount of, any shares of, or any securities convertible into shares of, any class or series of the Company s capital stock ranking prior to the Series F Preferred Stock in the payment of dividends or in the distribution of assets on any liquidation, dissolution or winding-up of the Company or 
 
 (iii) the consummation of a binding share exchange or reclassification involving the Series F Preferred Stock or a merger or consolidation of the Company with another entity, except that holders of Series F Preferred Stock will have no right to vote under this provision or otherwise under Delaware law if in each case (i) the Series F Preferred Stock remains outstanding or, in the case of any such merger or consolidation with respect to which the Company is not the surviving or resulting entity, is converted into or exchanged for preferred securities of the surviving or resulting entity or its ultimate parent that is an entity organized and existing under the laws of the United States of America, any state thereof or the District of Columbia and that is a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes (or if such entity is not a corporation the Company having received an opinion of nationally recognized counsel experienced in such matters to the effect that Holders will be subject to tax for U.S. federal income tax purposes with respect to such new preferred securities after such merger or consolidation in the same amount, at the same time and otherwise in the same manner as would have been the case under the Series F Preferred Stock prior to such merger or consolidation), and (ii) such Series F Preferred Stock remaining outstanding or such preferred securities, as the case may be, have such rights, preferences, privileges and voting powers, taken as a whole, as are not materially less favorable to the holders thereof than the rights, preferences, privileges and voting powers of the Series F Preferred Stock taken as a whole provided, however , that any increase in the amount of the authorized or issued Series F Preferred Stock or authorized preferred stock or any securities convertible into preferred stock or the creation and issuance, or an increase in the authorized or issued amount, of other series of preferred stock or any securities convertible into preferred stock ranking equally with and or junior to the Series F Preferred Stock with respect to the payment of dividends (whether such dividends are cumulative or non-cumulative) and or the distribution of assets upon the Company s liquidation, dissolution or winding up will not be deemed to adversely affect the voting powers, preferences or special rights of the Series F Preferred Stock and Holders will have no right to vote on such an increase, creation or issuance. 
 
 If any amendment, alteration, repeal, share exchange, reclassification, merger or consolidation specified in this Section 7(c) would adversely affect one or more but not all series of preferred stock of the Company, then only such series of preferred stock as are adversely affected by and entitled to vote on the matter shall vote on the matter together as a single class (in lieu of all other series of preferred stock). 
 
 (d) No Vote if Redemption. No vote or consent of the Holders shall be required pursuant to Section 7(b) or (c) if, at or prior to the time when the act with respect to such vote or consent would otherwise be required shall be effected, the Company shall have redeemed or shall have called for redemption all outstanding shares of Series F Preferred Stock, with proper notice and sufficient funds having been set aside for such redemption, in each case pursuant to Section 6 above. 

Section 8. Preemption and Conversion Rights. 
 
 The Holders shall not have any rights of preemption or conversion. 
 
 Section 9. Rank. 
 
 Notwithstanding anything set forth in the Certificate of Incorporation or this Certificate of Designation to the contrary, the Board of Directors, the Preferred Stock Committee or any other duly authorized committee thereof, without the vote of the Holders, may authorize and issue additional shares of Junior Stock or Parity Stock. 
 
 Section 10. Repurchase. 
 
 Subject to the limitations imposed herein, the Company may purchase and sell Series F Preferred Stock from time to time to such extent, in such manner, and upon such terms as the Board of Directors, the Preferred Stock Committee or any other duly authorized committee thereof may determine provided, however , that the Company shall not use any of its funds for any such purchase when there are reasonable grounds to believe that the Company is, or by such purchase would be, rendered insolvent provided, further, however , that in the event that the Company beneficially owns any Series F Preferred Stock, the Company will procure that voting rights in respect of such Series F Preferred Stock are not exercised. 
 
 Section 11. Unissued or Reacquired Shares. 
 
 Shares of Series F Preferred Stock not issued or which have been issued and redeemed or otherwise purchased or acquired by the Company shall be restored to the status of authorized but unissued shares of preferred stock without designation as to series.

 The duly appointed Transfer Agent, Registrar and paying agent for the Series F Preferred Stock shall be The Bank of New York Mellon. The Company may, in its sole discretion, remove the Transfer Agent in accordance with the agreement between the Company and the Transfer Agent provided that the Company shall appoint a successor transfer agent who shall accept such appointment prior to the effectiveness of such removal. Upon any such removal or appointment, the Company shall send notice thereof by first-class mail, postage prepaid, to the Holders.

 The shares of such series shall be designated as Series R Participating Cumulative Preferred Stock (the Series R Preferred Stock ), and the number of shares constituting such series shall be 28,000. Such number of shares of the Series R Preferred Stock may be increased or decreased by resolution of the Board of Directors provided that no decrease shall reduce the number of shares of Series R Preferred Stock to a number less than the number of shares then outstanding plus the number of shares issuable upon exercise or conversion of outstanding rights, options or other securities issued by the Corporation. 
 
 Section 2. Dividends and Distributions. 
 
 (a) Subject to the prior and superior rights of the holders of any shares of any class or series of stock of the Corporation ranking prior and superior to the shares of Series R Preferred Stock with respect to dividends, the holders of shares of Series R Preferred Stock, in preference to the holders of shares of any class or series of stock of the Corporation ranking junior to the Series R Preferred Stock in respect thereof, shall be entitled to receive, when, as and if declared by the Board of Directors out of funds legally available for the purpose, regular quarterly dividends payable on such dates each year as designated by the Board of Directors (each such date being referred to herein as a Quarterly Dividend Payment Date ), commencing on the first Quarterly Dividend Payment Date after the first issuance of any share or fraction of a share of Series R Preferred Stock, in an amount per share (rounded to the nearest cent) equal to the greater of (i) 1.00 and (ii) the Multiplier Number times the aggregate per share amount of all cash dividends or other distributions and the Multiplier Number times the aggregate per share amount of all non-cash dividends or other distributions (other than (A) a dividend payable in shares of Common Stock, par value 0.01 per share, of the Corporation (the Common Stock or (B) a subdivision of the outstanding shares of Common Stock (by reclassification or otherwise)), declared on the Common Stock since the immediately preceding Quarterly Dividend Payment Date, or, with respect to the first Quarterly Dividend Payment Date, since the first issuance of any share or fraction of a share of Series R Preferred Stock. As used herein, the Multiplier Number shall be 1,000,000 provided that if, at any time after June 9, 2009, there shall be any change in the Common Stock, whether by reason of stock dividends, stock splits, reverse stock splits, recapitalization, mergers, consolidations, combinations or exchanges of securities, split-ups, split-offs, spin-offs, liquidations or other similar changes in capitalization, or any distribution or issuance of shares of its capital stock in a merger, share exchange, reclassification, or change of the outstanding shares of Common Stock, then in each such event the Board of Directors shall adjust the Multiplier Number to the extent appropriate such that following such adjustment each share of Series R Preferred Stock shall be in the same economic position as prior to such event. 
 
 (b) The Corporation shall declare a dividend or distribution on the Series R Preferred Stock as provided in Section 2(a) immediately after it declares a dividend or distribution on the Common Stock (other than as described in Sections 2(a)(ii)(A) and 2(a)(ii)(B)) provided that if no dividend or distribution shall have been declared on the Common Stock during the period between any Quarterly Dividend Payment Date and the next subsequent Quarterly Dividend Payment Date (or, with respect to the first Quarterly Dividend Payment Date, the period between the first issuance of any share or fraction of a share of Series R Preferred Stock and such first Quarterly Dividend Payment Date), a dividend of 1.00 per share on the Series R Preferred Stock shall nevertheless be payable on such subsequent Quarterly Dividend Payment Date. 
 
 (c) Dividends shall begin to accrue and be cumulative on outstanding shares of Series R Preferred Stock from the Quarterly Dividend Payment Date immediately preceding the date of issuance of such shares of Series R Preferred Stock, unless the date of issuance of such shares is on or before the record date for the first Quarterly Dividend Payment Date, in which case dividends on such shares shall begin to accrue and be cumulative from the date of issue of such shares, or unless the date of issue is a date after the record date for the determination of holders of shares of Series R Preferred Stock entitled to receive a quarterly dividend and on or before such Quarterly Dividend Payment Date, in which case dividends shall begin to accrue and be cumulative from such Quarterly Dividend Payment Date. Accrued but unpaid dividends shall not bear interest. Dividends paid on shares of Series R Preferred Stock in an amount less than the total amount of such dividends at the time accrued and payable on such shares shall be allocated pro rata on a share-by-share basis among all such shares at the time outstanding. The Board of Directors may fix a record date for the determination of holders of shares of Series R Preferred Stock entitled to receive payment of a dividend or distribution declared thereon, which record date shall not be more than 60 days prior to the date fixed for the payment thereof. 
 
 Section 3. Voting Rights. In addition to any other voting rights required by law, the holders of shares of Series R Preferred Stock shall have the following voting rights 

(a) Each share of Series R Preferred Stock shall entitle the holder thereof to a number of votes equal to the Multiplier Number on all matters submitted to a vote of stockholders of the Corporation. 
 
 (b) Except as otherwise provided herein or by law, the holders of shares of Series R Preferred Stock and the holders of shares of Common Stock shall vote together as a single class on all matters submitted to a vote of stockholders of the Corporation. 
 
 (c) (i) If at any time dividends on any Series R Preferred Stock shall be in arrears in an amount equal to six quarterly dividends thereon, the occurrence of such contingency shall mark the beginning of a period (herein called a default period which shall extend until such time when all accrued and unpaid dividends for all previous quarterly dividend periods and for the current quarterly dividend period on all shares of Series R Preferred Stock then outstanding shall have been declared and paid or set apart for payment. During each default period, all holders of Series R Preferred Stock and any other series of Preferred Stock then entitled as a class to elect directors, voting together as a single class, irrespective of series, shall have the right to elect two Directors. 
 
 (ii) During any default period, such voting right of the holders of Series R Preferred Stock may be exercised initially at a special meeting called pursuant to Section 3(c)(iii) hereof or at any annual meeting of stockholders, and thereafter at annual meetings of stockholders provided that neither such voting right nor the right of the holders of any other series of Preferred Stock, if any, to increase, in certain cases, the authorized number of Directors shall be exercised unless the holders of 10 in number of shares of Preferred Stock outstanding shall be present in person or by proxy. The absence of a quorum of holders of Common Stock shall not affect the exercise by holders of Preferred Stock of such voting right. At any meeting at which holders of Preferred Stock shall initially exercise such voting right, they shall have the right, voting as a class, to elect Directors to fill such vacancies, if any, in the Board of Directors as may then exist up to two Directors or, if such right is exercised at an annual meeting, to elect two Directors. If the number which may be so elected at any special meeting does not amount to the required number, the holders of the Preferred Stock shall have the right to make such increase in the number of Directors as shall be necessary to permit the election by them of the required number. After the holders of the Preferred Stock shall have exercised their right to elect Directors in any default period and during the continuance of such period, the number of Directors shall not be increased or decreased except by vote of the holders of Preferred Stock as herein provided or pursuant to the rights of any equity securities ranking senior to or pari passu with the Series R Preferred Stock. 
 
 (iii) Unless the holders of Preferred Stock shall have previously exercised their right to elect Directors during an existing default period, the Board of Directors may order, or any stockholder or stockholders owning in the aggregate not less than 10 of the total number of shares of Preferred Stock outstanding, irrespective of series, may request, the calling of a special meeting of holders of Preferred Stock, which meeting shall thereupon be called by the Chief Executive Officer, a Vice President or the Secretary of the Corporation. Notice of such meeting and of any annual meeting at which holders of Preferred Stock are entitled to vote pursuant to this Section 3(c)(iii) shall be given to each holder of record of Preferred Stock by mailing such notice to him at the address of such holder shown on the registry books of the Corporation. Such meeting shall be called for a time not earlier than 20 days and not later than 60 days after such order or request or in default of the calling of such meeting within 60 days after such order or request, such meeting may be called on similar notice by any stockholder or stockholders owning in the aggregate not less than 10 of the total number of shares of Preferred Stock outstanding, irrespective of series. Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section 3(c)(iii), no such special meeting shall be called during the period within 60 days immediately preceding the date fixed for the next annual meeting of stockholders. 
 
 (iv) In any default period, the holders of Common Stock, and other classes of stock of the Corporation if applicable, shall continue to be entitled to elect the whole number of Directors until the holders of Preferred Stock shall have exercised their right to elect two Directors voting as a class, after the exercise of which right (x) the Directors so elected by the holders of Preferred Stock shall continue in office until their successors shall have been elected by such holders or until the expiration of the default period, and (y) any vacancy in the Board of Directors may (except as provided in Section 3(c)(ii) hereof) be filled by vote of a majority of the remaining Directors theretofore elected by the holders of the class of stock which elected the Director whose office shall have become vacant. References in this Section 3(c) to Directors elected by the holders of a particular class of stock shall include Directors elected by such Directors to fill vacancies as provided in clause (y) of the foregoing sentence. 
 
 (v) Immediately upon the expiration of a default period, (x) the right of the holders of Preferred Stock as a class to elect Directors shall cease, (y) the term of any Directors elected by the holders of Preferred Stock as a class 

shall terminate, and (z) the number of Directors shall be such number as may be provided for in the certificate of incorporation or bylaws irrespective of any increase made pursuant to the provisions of Section 3(c)(ii) (such number being subject, however, to change thereafter in any manner provided by law or in the certificate of incorporation or bylaws).

References herein to the accrual of dividends refer only to the determination of the amount of such dividend and do not imply that any right to a dividend arises prior to the date on which a dividend is declared. 
 
 (c) Priority of Dividends. So long as any share of Convertible Preferred Stock remains outstanding, unless as to a Dividend Payment Date full dividends on all outstanding shares of the Convertible Preferred Stock have been declared and paid or declared and a sum sufficient for the payment of those dividends has been set aside for the Dividend Period then ending, the Company will not, and will cause its subsidiaries not to, during the next succeeding Dividend Period that commences on such Dividend Payment Date, declare or pay any dividend on, make any distributions relating to, or redeem, purchase, acquire or make a liquidation payment relating to, any of Junior Stock, or make any guarantee payment with respect thereto, other than

receive such dividend, notwithstanding the conversion of such shares prior to the Dividend Payment Date.

The Person or Persons entitled to receive the Common Stock and or cash, securities or other property issuable upon conversion of Convertible Preferred Stock shall be treated for all purposes as the record holder(s) of such shares of Common Stock and or securities as of the close of business on any applicable Conversion Date. In the event that a Holder shall not by written notice designate the name in which shares of Common Stock and or cash, securities or other property (including payments of cash in lieu of fractional shares) to be issued or paid upon conversion of shares of Convertible Preferred Stock should be registered or paid or the manner in which such shares should be delivered, the Company shall be entitled to register and deliver such shares, and make such payment, in the name of the Holder and in the manner shown on the records of the Company or, in the case of global certificates, through book-entry transfer through the Depositary.

 (i) The exact Make-Whole Acquisition Stock Prices and Make-Whole Acquisition Effective Dates may not be set forth on the table, in which case 
 
 (A) if the Make-Whole Acquisition Stock Price is between two Make-Whole Acquisition Stock Price amounts on the table or the Make-Whole Acquisition Effective Dates are between two dates on the table, the number of Make-Whole Shares will be determined by straight-line interpolation between the number of Make-Whole Shares set forth for the higher and lower Make-Whole Acquisition Stock Price amounts and the two Make-Whole Acquisition Effective Dates, as applicable, based on a 365-day year

 (h) Partial Make-Whole Acquisition Conversion. In the event that a Make-Whole Acquisition Conversion is effected with respect to shares of Convertible Preferred Stock or a successor security representing less than all the shares of Convertible Preferred Stock or a successor security held by a Holder, upon such Make-Whole Acquisition Conversion the Company or its successor shall execute and the Conversion Agent shall, unless otherwise instructed in writing, countersign and deliver to such Holder, at the expense of the Company or its successors, a certificate evidencing the shares of Convertible Preferred Stock or such successor security held by the Holder as to which a Make-Whole Acquisition Conversion was not effected. 
 
 Section 10. Conversion Upon Fundamental Change. 
 
 (a) Fundamental Change Conversion. If the Reference Price in connection with a Make-Whole Acquisition is less than the Conversion Price (a Fundamental Change ), a Holder may convert each share of Convertible Preferred Stock during the period beginning on the effective date of the Fundamental Change and ending on the date that is 30 days after the effective date of such Fundamental Change at an adjusted Conversion Price equal to the greater of (1) the Reference Price and (2) 18.45, subject to adjustment as described in clause (b) below (the Base Price ). 
 
 (b) Base Price Adjustment. The Base Price shall be adjusted as of any date the Conversion Rate of the Convertible Preferred Stock is adjusted pursuant to Section 12. The adjusted Base Price shall equal the Base Price applicable immediately prior to such adjustment multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the Conversion Rate immediately prior to the adjustment giving rise to the Base Price adjustment and the denominator of which is the Conversion Rate as so adjusted. 
 
 (c) Cash Alternative. In lieu of issuing Common Stock upon conversion in the event of a Fundamental Change, the Company may at its option, and if it obtains any necessary regulatory approval, pay an amount in cash (computed to the nearest cent) equal to the Reference Price for each share of Common Stock otherwise issuable upon conversion.

(h) Partial Fundamental Change Conversion. In the event that a conversion upon a Fundamental Change is effected with respect to shares of Convertible Preferred Stock or a successor security representing less than all the shares of Convertible Preferred Stock or a successor security held by a Holder, upon such conversion the Company or its successor shall execute and the Conversion Agent shall, unless otherwise instructed in writing, countersign and deliver to such Holder, at the expense of the Company, a certificate evidencing the shares of Convertible Preferred Stock or such successor security held by the Holder as to which a conversion upon a Fundamental Change was not effected.

If the Conversion Agent selects a portion of a Holder s Convertible Preferred Stock for partial conversion at the option of the Company and such Holder converts a portion of its shares of Convertible Preferred Stock, the converted portion will be deemed to be from the portion selected for conversion at the option of the Company under this Section 11. 
 
 (c) Conversion Procedure. In order to exercise the conversion right described in this Section 11, the Company shall provide notice of such conversion to each Holder (such notice, a Notice of Conversion at the Option of the Company The Conversion Date shall be a date selected by the Company (the Conversion at the Option of the Company Date and shall be no more than 20 days after the date on which the Company provides such Notice of Conversion at the Option of the Company.

 (i) the Conversion at the Option of the Company Date 
 
 (ii) the number of shares of Common Stock to be issued upon conversion of each share of Convertible Preferred Stock and, if fewer than all the shares of a Holder are to be converted, the number of such shares to be converted and 
 
 (iii) the number of shares of Convertible Preferred Stock to be converted. 
 
 Section 12. Anti-Dilution Adjustments. 
 
 (a) Adjustments. The Conversion Rate will be subject to adjustment, without duplication under the following circumstances

Notwithstanding the foregoing, no adjustment will be made for the issuance of Common Stock as a dividend or distribution to all holders of Common Stock that is made in lieu of a quarterly or annual cash dividend or distribution to such holders, to the extent such dividend or distribution does not exceed the applicable Dividend Threshold Amount. The amount of any such dividend or distribution will equal the number of such shares being issued multiplied by the average of the VWAP of the Common Stock over each of the five consecutive Trading Days prior to the Ex-date for such dividend or distribution. 
 
 (ii) the issuance to all holders of Common Stock of certain rights or warrants entitling them for a period expiring 60 days or less from the date of issuance of such rights or warrants to purchase shares of Common Stock (or securities convertible into Common Stock) at less than (or having a conversion price per share less than) the Current Market Price as of the Record Date, in which event each Conversion Rate will be adjusted based on the following formula

 However, the Conversion Rate will be readjusted to the extent that any such rights or warrants are not exercised prior to their expiration. 
 
 (iii) the dividend or other distribution to all holders of Common Stock of shares of capital stock of the Company (other than common stock) or evidences of its indebtedness or its assets (excluding any dividend, distribution or issuance covered by clauses (i) or (ii) above or (iv) or (v) below) in which event the Conversion Rate will be adjusted based on the following formula

 CR 0 
 the Conversion Rate in effect at the close of business on the Record Date CR 1 
 the Conversion Rate in effect immediately after the Record Date FMV 0

 (iv) the Company makes a distribution consisting exclusively of cash to all holders of Common Stock, excluding (a) any cash dividend on Common Stock to the extent that the aggregate cash dividend per share of Common Stock does not exceed (i) 0.32 in any fiscal quarter in the case of a quarterly dividend or (ii) 1.28 in the prior twelve months in the case of an annual dividend (each such number, the Dividend Threshold Amount ), (b) any cash that is distributed as part of a distribution referred to in clause (iii) above, and (c) any consideration payable in connection with a tender or exchange offer made by the Company or any of its subsidiaries referred to in clause (v) below, in which event, the Conversion Rate will be adjusted based on the following formula

 (v) the Company or one or more of its subsidiaries make purchases of Common Stock pursuant to a tender offer or exchange offer by the Company or a subsidiary of the Company for Common Stock to the extent that the cash and value of any other consideration included in the payment per share of Common Stock validly tendered or exchanged exceeds the VWAP per share of Common Stock on the Trading Day next succeeding the last date on which tenders or exchanges may be made pursuant to such tender or exchange offer (the expiration date ), in which event the Conversion Rate will be adjusted based on the following formula

 (b) Calculation of Adjustments. All adjustments to the Conversion Rate shall be calculated by the Company to the nearest 1 10,000th of one share of Common Stock (or if there is not a nearest 1 10,000th of a share, to the next lower 1 10,000th of a share). No adjustment to the Conversion Rate will be required unless such adjustment would require an increase or decrease of at least one percent provided, however, that any such minor adjustments that are not required to be made will be carried forward and taken into account in any subsequent adjustment, and provided further that any such adjustment of less than one percent that has not been made will be made upon (x) the end of each fiscal year of the Company, (y) the date of any notice of redemption of the Convertible Preferred Stock in accordance with the provisions hereof or any notice of a Make-Whole Acquisition and (z) any Conversion Date.

 (ii) No adjustment of the Conversion Rate need be made as a result of (A) the issuance of the rights (B) the distribution of separate certificates representing the rights (C) the exercise or redemption of the rights in accordance with any rights agreement or (D) the termination or invalidation of the rights, in each case, pursuant to the Company s stockholder rights plan existing on the date of hereof, as amended, modified, or supplemented from time to time, or any newly adopted stockholder rights plans provided, however, that to the extent that the Company has a stockholder rights plan in effect on a Conversion Date (including the Company s rights plan, if any, existing on the date hereof), the Holder shall receive, in addition to the shares of Common Stock, the rights under such rights plan, unless, prior to any such Conversion Date, the rights have separated from the Common Stock, in which case the Conversion Rate will be adjusted at the time of separation as if the Company made a distribution to all holders of Common Stock of shares of capital stock of the Company or evidences of its indebtedness or its assets as described in Section 12.01(a)(iii), subject to readjustment in the event of the expiration, termination or redemption of the rights. 
 
 (iii) No adjustment to the Conversion Rate need be made 
 
 (A) upon the issuance of any shares of Common Stock pursuant to any present or future plan providing for the reinvestment of dividends or interest payable on securities of the Company and the investment of additional optional amounts in Common Stock under any plan 
 
 (B) upon the issuance of any shares of Common Stock or options or rights to purchase those shares pursuant to any present or future employee, director or consultant benefit plan or program of or assumed by the Company or any of its subsidiaries or 
 
 (C) upon the issuance of any shares of Common Stock pursuant to any option, warrant, right, or exercisable, exchangeable or convertible security outstanding as of the date the Convertible Preferred Stock was first issued. 

(iv) No adjustment to the Conversion Rate need be made for a transaction referred to in Section 12.01 (a)(i), (ii), (iii), (iv) or (v) if Holders may participate in the transaction on a basis and with notice that the Board of Directors determines to be fair and appropriate in light of the basis and notice on which holders of Common Stock participate in the transaction. 
 
 (v) No adjustment to the Conversion Rate need be made for a change in the par value or no par value of the Common Stock.

 (vii) Notwithstanding any other provision herein to the contrary, in the event of an adjustment pursuant to Section 12.01(a)(iv) or (v), in no event will the conversion rate following such adjustment exceed 1,897.4084, subject to adjustment pursuant to Section 12.01 (a)(i), (ii) or (iii). 
 
 (d) Record Date. For purposes of this Section 12, Record Date means, with respect to any dividend, distribution or other transaction or event in which the holders of the Common Stock have the right to receive any cash, securities or other property or in which the Common Stock (or other applicable security) is exchanged for or converted into any combination of cash, securities or other property, the date fixed for determination of holders of the Common Stock entitled to receive such cash, securities or other property (whether such date is fixed by the Board of Directors or by statute, contract or otherwise). 
 
 (e) Successive Adjustments. After an adjustment to the Conversion Rate under this Section 12, any subsequent event requiring an adjustment under this Section 12 shall cause an adjustment to such Conversion Rate as so adjusted. 
 
 (f) Multiple Adjustments. For the avoidance of doubt, if an event occurs that would trigger an adjustment to the Conversion Rate pursuant to this Section 12 under more than one subsection hereof, such event, to the extent fully taken into account in a single adjustment, shall not result in multiple adjustments hereunder. 
 
 (g) Other Adjustments. The Company may, but shall not be required to, make such increases in the Conversion Rate, in addition to those required by this Section, as the Board of Directors considers to be advisable in order to avoid or diminish any income tax to any holders of shares of Common Stock resulting from any dividend or distribution of stock or issuance of rights or warrants to purchase or subscribe for stock or from any event treated as such for income tax purposes or for any other reason. 
 
 (h) Notice of Adjustments. Whenever a Conversion Rate is adjusted as provided under Section 12, the Company shall within 10 Business Days following the occurrence of an event that requires such adjustment (or if the Company is not aware of such occurrence, as soon as reasonably practicable after becoming so aware) or the date the Company makes an adjustment pursuant to Section 12(g) 
 
 (i) compute the adjusted applicable Conversion Rate in accordance with Section 12 and prepare and transmit to the Conversion Agent an Officers Certificate setting forth the applicable Conversion Rate, as the case may be, the method of calculation thereof in reasonable detail, and the facts requiring such adjustment and upon which such adjustment is based and 
 
 (ii) provide a written notice to the Holders of the occurrence of such event and a statement in reasonable detail setting forth the method by which the adjustment to the applicable Conversion Rate was determined and setting forth the adjusted applicable Conversion Rate. 
 
 (i) Conversion Agent. The Conversion Agent shall not at any time be under any duty or responsibility to any Holder to determine whether any facts exist that may require any adjustment of the applicable Conversion Rate or with respect to the nature or extent or calculation of any such adjustment when made, or with respect to the method employed in making the same. The Conversion Agent shall be fully authorized and protected in relying on any Officers Certificate delivered pursuant to Section 12(h) and any adjustment contained therein and the Conversion Agent shall not be deemed to have knowledge of any adjustment unless and until it has received such certificate. The Conversion Agent shall not be accountable with respect to the validity or value (or the kind or amount) of any shares of Common Stock, or of any securities or property, that may at the time be issued or delivered with respect to any Convertible Preferred Stock and the Conversion Agent makes no representation with respect thereto. The Conversion Agent shall not be responsible for any failure of the Company to issue, transfer or deliver any shares of Common Stock pursuant to a conversion of 

Convertible Preferred Stock or to comply with any of the duties, responsibilities or covenants of the Company contained in this Section 12.

In lieu of fractional shares otherwise issuable, holders will be entitled to receive an amount in cash equal to the fraction of a share of Common Stock, calculated on an aggregate basis in respect of the shares of Convertible Preferred Stock being converted, multiplied by the Closing Price of the Common Stock on the Trading Day immediately preceding the applicable Conversion Date. 
 
 Section 13. Adjustment for Reorganization Events. 
 
 (a) Reorganization Events. In the event of 
 
 (1) any consolidation or merger of the Company with or into another person (other than a merger or consolidation in which the Company is the continuing corporation and in which the shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to the merger or consolidation are not exchanged for cash, securities other property of the Company or another corporation) 
 
 (2) any sale, transfer, lease or conveyance to another person of all or substantially all the property and assets of the Company or 
 
 (3) any statutory exchange of securities of the Company with another Person (other than in connection with a merger or acquisition) or any binding share exchange which reclassifies or changes its outstanding Common Stock each of which is referred to as a Reorganization Event , each share of the Convertible Preferred Stock outstanding immediately prior to such Reorganization Event will, without the consent of the holders of the Convertible Preferred Stock, become convertible into the kind and amount of securities, cash and other property (the Exchange Property receivable in such Reorganization Event (without any interest thereon, and without any right to dividends or distribution thereon which have a record date that is prior to the applicable Conversion Date) per share of Common Stock by a holder of Common Stock that is not a Person with which the Company consolidated or into which the Company merged or which merged into the Company or to which such sale or transfer was made, as the case may be (any such Person, a Constituent Person ), or an Affiliate of a Constituent Person to the extent such Reorganization Event provides for different treatment of Common Stock held by Affiliates of the Company and non-Affiliates provided that if the kind or amount of securities, cash and other property receivable upon such Reorganization Event is not the same for each share of Common Stock held immediately prior to such Reorganization Event by a Person other than a Constituent Person or an Affiliate thereof, then for the purpose of this Section 13(a), the kind and amount of securities, cash and other property receivable upon such Reorganization Event will be deemed to be the weighted average of the types and amounts of consideration received by the holders of Common Stock that affirmatively make an election (or of all such holders if none make an election). On each Conversion Date following a Reorganization Event, the Conversion Rate then in effect will be applied to the value on such Conversion Date of such securities, cash or other property received per share of Common Stock, as determined in accordance with this Section 13. 
 
 (b) Exchange Property Election. In the event that holders of the shares of Common Stock have the opportunity to elect the form of consideration to be received in such transaction, the consideration that the Holders are entitled to receive shall be deemed to be the types and amounts of consideration received by the holders of the shares of Common Stock that affirmatively make an election (or of all such holders if none make an election). The amount of Exchange Property receivable upon conversion of any Convertible Preferred Stock in accordance with the terms hereof shall be determined based upon the Conversion Rate in effect on such Conversion Date. 
 
 (c) Successive Reorganization Events. The above provisions of this Section 13 shall similarly apply to successive Reorganization Events and the provisions of Section 12 shall apply to any shares of capital stock of the Company (or any successor) received by the holders of the Common Stock in any such Reorganization Event. 
 
 (d) Reorganization Event Notice. The Company (or any successor) shall, within 20 days of the occurrence of any Reorganization Event, provide written notice to the Holders of such occurrence of such event and of the kind and amount of the cash, securities or other property that constitutes the Exchange Property. Failure to deliver such notice shall not affect the operation of this Section 13. 
 
 Section 14. Voting Rights. 
 
 (a) General. The Holders shall not be entitled to vote on any matter except as set forth in Section 14(b) below or as required by Delaware law. 

(b) Special Voting Right. 
 
 (i) Voting Right. If and whenever dividends on the Convertible Preferred Stock or any other class or series of preferred stock that ranks on parity with Convertible Preferred Stock as to payment of dividends, and upon which voting rights equivalent to those granted by this Section 14(b)(i) have been conferred and are exercisable, have not been paid in an aggregate amount equal, as to any class or series, to at least six quarterly Dividend Periods (whether consecutive or not) (a Nonpayment ), the number of directors constituting the Board of Directors shall be increased by two, and the Holders (together with holders of any class or series of the Company s authorized preferred stock having equivalent voting rights), shall have the right, voting separately as a single class without regard to class or series (and with voting rights allocated pro rata based on the liquidation preference of each such class or series), to the exclusion of the holders of Common Stock, to elect two directors of the Company to fill such newly created directorships (and to fill any vacancies in the terms of such directorships), provided that the Holders and the holders of any such other class or series shall not be entitled to elect such directors to the extent such election would cause the Company to violate the corporate governance requirements of the New York Stock Exchange (or other exchange on which the Company s securities may be listed) that listed companies must have a majority of independent directors, and further provided that the Board of Directors shall at no time include more than two such directors. Each such director elected by the Holders and any other class or series of preferred stock that ranks on parity with the Convertible Preferred Stock as to payment of dividends and having equivalent voting rights is a Preferred Stock Director . 
 
 (ii) Election. The election of the Preferred Stock Directors will take place at any annual meeting of stockholders or any special meeting of the Holders and any other class or series of stock of the Company that ranks on parity with Convertible Preferred Stock as to payment of dividends and having equivalent voting rights and for which dividends have not been paid, called as provided herein. At any time after the special voting power has vested pursuant to Section 14(b)(i) above, the secretary of the Company may, and upon the written request of the Holders of at least 20 of the Convertible Preferred Stock or the holders of at least 20 of such other series (addressed to the secretary at the Company s principal office) must (unless such request is received less than 90 days before the date fixed for the next annual or special meeting of the stockholders, in which event such election shall be held at such next annual or special meeting of stockholders), call a special meeting of the Holders and any other class or series of preferred stock that ranks on parity with Convertible Preferred Stock as to payment of dividends and having equivalent voting rights and for which dividends have not been paid for the election of the two directors to be elected by them as provided in Section 14(b)(iii) below. The Preferred Stock Directors shall each be entitled to one vote per director on any matter. 
 
 (iii) Notice of Special Meeting. Notice for a special meeting will be given in a similar manner to that provided in the Company s by-laws for a special meeting of the stockholders. If the secretary of the Company does not call a special meeting within 20 days after receipt of any such request, then any Holder may (at the expense of the Company) call such meeting, upon notice as provided in this Section 14(b)(iii), and for that purpose will have access to the stock register of the Company. The Preferred Stock Directors elected at any such special meeting will hold office until the next annual meeting of the stockholders of the Company unless they have been previously terminated or removed pursuant to Section 14(b)(iv). In case any vacancy in the office of a Preferred Stock Director occurs (other than prior to the initial election of the Preferred Stock Directors), the vacancy may be filled by the written consent of the Preferred Stock Director remaining in office, or if none remains in office, by the vote of the Holders (together with holders of any other class of the Company s authorized preferred stock having equivalent voting rights, whether or not the holders of such preferred stock would be entitled to vote for the election of directors if such default in dividends did not exist) to serve until the next annual meeting of the stockholders. 
 
 (iv) Termination Removal. Whenever the Company has paid full dividends for at least four consecutive quarterly dividend periods following a Nonpayment on the Convertible Preferred Stock and any other class or series of non-cumulative preferred stock ranking on parity with Convertible Preferred Stock as to payment of dividends, if any, and has paid cumulative dividends in full on any class or series of cumulative preferred stock ranking on parity with the Convertible Preferred Stock as to payment of dividends (in each case, upon which equivalent voting rights to those set forth in Section 14(b)(iii) have been conferred and are exercisable), then the right of the Holders to elect the Preferred Stock Directors will cease (but subject always to the same provisions for the vesting of the special voting rights in the case of any similar non-payment of dividends in respect of future Dividend Periods). The terms of office of the Preferred Stock Directors will immediately terminate, and the number of directors constituting the Board of Directors will be reduced accordingly. Any Preferred Stock Director may be removed at any time without cause by the Holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of 

the Convertible Preferred Stock (together with holders of any other class of the Company s authorized preferred stock having equivalent voting rights, whether or not the holders of such preferred stock would be entitled to vote for the election of directors if such default in dividends did not exist) when they have the voting rights described in this Section 14(b). 
 
 (c) Senior Issuances Adverse Changes. So long as any shares of Convertible Preferred Stock are outstanding, the vote or consent of the Holders of at least two-thirds of the shares of Convertible Preferred Stock at the time outstanding, voting as a class with all other series of preferred stock ranking equally with the Convertible Preferred Stock and entitled to vote thereon, given in person or by proxy, either in writing without a meeting or by vote at any meeting called for the purpose, will be necessary for effecting or validating any of the following actions, whether or not such approval is required by Delaware law 
 
 (i) any amendment, alteration or repeal of any provision of the Company s Certificate of Incorporation (including the certificate of designation creating the Convertible Preferred Stock) or the Company s by-laws that would alter or change the voting powers, preferences or special rights of the Convertible Preferred Stock so as to affect them adversely 
 
 (ii) any amendment or alteration of the Company s certificate of incorporation to authorize or create, or increase the authorized amount of, any shares of, or any securities convertible into shares of, any class or series of the Company s capital stock ranking prior to the Convertible Preferred Stock in the payment of dividends or in the distribution of assets on any liquidation, dissolution or winding-up of the Company or 
 
 (iii) the consummation of a binding share exchange or reclassification involving the Convertible Preferred Stock or a merger or consolidation of the Company with another entity, except that holders of Convertible Preferred Stock will have no right to vote under this provision or otherwise under Delaware law if in each case (i) the Convertible Preferred Stock remains outstanding or, in the case of any such merger or consolidation with respect to which the Company is not the surviving or resulting entity, is converted into or exchanged for preferred securities of the surviving or resulting entity or its ultimate parent, that is an entity organized and existing under the laws of the United States of America, any state thereof or the District of Columbia and that is a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes (or if such entity is not a corporation, the Company having received an opinion of nationally recognized counsel experienced in such matters to the effect that Holders will be subject to tax for U.S. federal income tax purposes with respect to such new preferred securities after such merger or consolidation in the same amount, at the same time and otherwise in the same manner as would have been the case under the Convertible Preferred Stock prior to such merger or consolidation), and (ii) such Convertible Preferred Stock remaining outstanding or such preferred securities, as the case may be, have such rights, preferences, privileges and voting powers, taken as a whole, as are not materially less favorable to the holders thereof than the rights, preferences, privileges and voting powers of the Convertible Preferred Stock, taken as a whole 
 
 provided, however, that any increase in the amount of the authorized or issued Convertible Preferred Stock or authorized preferred stock or any securities convertible into preferred stock or the creation and issuance, or an increase in the authorized or issued amount, of other series of preferred stock or any securities convertible into preferred stock ranking equally with and or junior to the Convertible Preferred Stock with respect to the payment of dividends (whether such dividends are cumulative or non-cumulative) and or the distribution of assets upon the Company s liquidation, dissolution or winding up will not be deemed to adversely affect the voting powers, preferences or special rights of the Convertible Preferred Stock and Holders will have no right to vote on such an increase, creation or issuance. 
 
 If any amendment, alteration, repeal, share exchange, reclassification, merger or consolidation specified in this Section 14(c) would adversely affect one or more but not all series of preferred stock of the Company, then only such series of preferred stock as are adversely affected by and entitled to vote on the matter shall vote on the matter together as a single class (in lieu of all other series of preferred stock). 
 
 (d) No Vote if Redemption. No vote or consent of the Holders shall be required pursuant to Section 14(b) or (c) if, at or prior to the time when the act with respect to such vote or consent would otherwise be required shall be effected, the Company shall have redeemed or shall have called for redemption all outstanding shares of Convertible Preferred Stock, with proper notice and sufficient funds having been set aside for such redemption, in each case pursuant to Section 6 above. 
 
 Section 15. Preemption. 

The Holders shall not have any rights of preemption. 
 
 Section 16. Rank. 
 
 Notwithstanding anything set forth in the Certificate of Incorporation or this Certificate of Designation to the contrary, the Board of Directors, the Preferred Stock Committee or any other duly authorized committee thereof, without the vote of the Holders, may authorize and issue additional shares of Junior Stock or Parity Stock. 
 
 Section 17. Repurchase. 
 
 Subject to the limitations imposed herein, the Company may purchase and sell Convertible Preferred Stock from time to time to such extent, in such manner, and upon such terms as the Board of Directors, the Preferred Stock Committee or any other duly authorized committee thereof may determine provided, however, that the Company shall not use any of its funds for any such purchase when there are reasonable grounds to believe that the Company is, or by such purchase would be rendered insolvent provided, further, however, that in the event that the Company beneficially owns any Convertible Preferred Stock, the Company will procure that voting rights in respect of such Convertible Preferred Stock are not exercised. 
 
 Section 18. Unissued or Reacquired Shares. 
 
 Shares of Convertible Preferred Stock not issued or which have been issued and converted, redeemed or otherwise purchased or acquired by the Company shall be restored to the status of authorized but unissued shares of preferred stock without designation as to series. 
 
 Section 19. No Sinking Fund. 
 
 Shares of Convertible Preferred Stock are not subject to the operation of a sinking fund. 
 
 Section 20. Reservation of Common Stock. 
 
 (a) Sufficient Shares. The Company shall at all times reserve and keep available out of its authorized and unissued Common Stock or shares acquired by the Company, solely for issuance upon the conversion of shares of Convertible Preferred Stock as provided in this Certificate of Designation, free from any preemptive or other similar rights, such number of shares of Common Stock as shall from time to time be issuable upon the conversion of all the shares of Convertible Preferred Stock then outstanding, assuming that the Conversion Price equaled the Base Price. For purposes of this Section 20(a), the number of shares of Common Stock that shall be deliverable upon the conversion of all outstanding shares of Convertible Preferred Stock shall be computed as if at the time of computation all such outstanding shares were held by a single Holder. 
 
 (b) Use of Acquired Shares. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company shall be entitled to deliver upon conversion of shares of Convertible Preferred Stock, as herein provided, shares of Common Stock acquired by the Company (in lieu of the issuance of authorized and unissued shares of Common Stock), so long as any such acquired shares are free and clear of all liens, charges, security interests or encumbrances (other than liens, charges, security interests and other encumbrances created by the Holders). 
 
 (c) Free and Clear Delivery. All shares of Common Stock delivered upon conversion of the Convertible Preferred Stock shall be duly authorized, validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable, free and clear of all liens, claims, security interests and other encumbrances (other than liens, charges, security interests and other encumbrances created by the Holders). 
 
 (d) Compliance with Law. Prior to the delivery of any securities that the Company shall be obligated to deliver upon conversion of the Convertible Preferred Stock, the Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to comply with all federal and state laws and regulations thereunder requiring the registration of such securities with, or any approval of or consent to the delivery thereof by, any governmental authority. 
 
 (e) Listing. The Company hereby covenants and agrees that, if at any time the Common Stock shall be listed on the New York Stock Exchange or any other national securities exchange or automated quotation system, the Company will, if permitted by the rules of such exchange or automated quotation system, list and keep listed, so long as the Common Stock shall be so listed on such exchange or automated quotation system, all the Common Stock issuable upon conversion of the Convertible Preferred Stock provided, however, that if the rules of such exchange or automated quotation system require the Company to defer the listing of such Common Stock until the first conversion of Convertible Preferred Stock into Common Stock in accordance with the provisions hereof, the Company covenants to list 

such Common Stock issuable upon conversion of the Convertible Preferred Stock in accordance with the requirements of such exchange or automated quotation system at such time. 
 
 Section 21. Transfer Agent, Conversion Agent, Registrar and Paying Agent. 
 
 The duly appointed Transfer Agent, Conversion Agent, Registrar and paying agent for the Convertible Preferred Stock shall be The Bank of New York Mellon. The Company may, in its sole discretion, remove the Transfer Agent in accordance with the agreement between the Company and the Transfer Agent provided that the Company shall appoint a successor transfer agent who shall accept such appointment prior to the effectiveness of such removal. Upon any such removal or appointment, the Company shall send notice thereof by first-class mail, postage prepaid, to the Holders. 
 
 Section 22. Replacement Certificates. 
 
 (a) Mutilated, Destroyed, Stolen and Lost Certificates.

 (e) Signature. An Officer shall sign any Global Preferred Stock for the Company, in accordance with the Company s by-laws and applicable law, by manual or facsimile signature. If an Officer whose signature is on a Global Preferred Stock no longer holds that office at the time the Transfer Agent countersigned the Global Preferred Stock, the Global Preferred Stock shall be valid nevertheless.

 (c) Merger, Consolidation and Sale of Assets Not Liquidation. For purposes of this Section 5, the sale, conveyance, exchange or transfer (for cash, shares of stock, securities or other consideration) of all or substantially all of the property and assets of the Company shall not be deemed a voluntary or involuntary dissolution, liquidation or winding up of the affairs of the Company, nor shall the merger, consolidation or any other business combination transaction of the Company into or with any other corporation or Person or the merger, consolidation or any other business combination transaction of any other corporation or Person into or with the Company be deemed to be a voluntary or involuntary dissolution, liquidation or winding up of the affairs of the Company.

 Section 7. Voting Rights. 
 
 (a) General. The Holders shall not be entitled to vote on any matter except as set forth in Section 7(b) below or as required by the Delaware General Corporation Law. 
 
 (b) Special Voting Right. 
 
 (i) Voting Right. If and whenever dividends on the Series A Preferred Stock or any other class or series of preferred stock that ranks on parity with Series A Preferred Stock as to payment of dividends and upon which voting rights equivalent to those granted by this Section 7(b)(i) have been conferred and are exercisable (any such class or series being referred to herein as dividend parity stock have not been paid in an aggregate amount equal, as to any class or series, to at least three semi-annual or six quarterly Dividend Periods, as applicable, (whether consecutive or not) (a Nonpayment ), the authorized number of directors constituting the Board of Directors shall be increased by two, and the Holders, together with holders of dividend parity stock, shall have the right, voting separately as a single class without regard to class or series (and with voting rights allocated pro rata based on the liquidation preference of each such class or series), to the exclusion of the holders of Common Stock, to elect two directors of the Company to fill such newly created directorships (and to fill any vacancies in the terms of such directorships), provided that it shall be a qualification for election of any such director that the election of such director shall not cause the Company to violate the corporate governance requirements of the New York Stock Exchange (or other exchange on which the Company s securities may be listed) that listed companies must have a majority of independent directors and further provided that the Board of Directors shall at no time include more than two such directors. Each such director elected by the Holders together with holders of dividend parity stock is a Preferred Stock Director. 

(ii) Election. The election of the Preferred Stock Directors will take place at any annual meeting of stockholders or any special meeting of the Holders and any dividend parity stock, called as provided herein. At any time after the special voting power has vested pursuant to Section 7(b)(i) above, the secretary of the Company may, and upon the written request (addressed to the secretary at the Company s principal office) of the holders of at least 20 of the voting power of the Series A Preferred Stock or the holders of at least 20 of the voting power of any series of dividend parity stock (with such voting power measured based on the voting power to elect Preferred Stock Directors), must (unless such request is received less than 90 days before the date fixed for the next annual or special meeting of the stockholders at which Preferred Stock Directors are to be elected, in which event such election shall be held at such next annual or special meeting of stockholders), call a special meeting of the holders of Series A Preferred Stock and any dividend parity stock for the purposes of electing Preferred Stock Directors.

The Preferred Stock Directors elected at any such special meeting and each Preferred Stock Director elected at a subsequent annual or special meeting of stockholders, will be elected for term expiring upon the earlier of the Preferred Stock Director Termination Date and the next annual meeting of stockholders following such Preferred Stock Director s election. In case any vacancy in the office of a Preferred Stock Director occurs (other than prior to the initial election of the Preferred Stock Directors), the vacancy may be filled by the Preferred Stock Director remaining in office, or if none remains in office, by a plurality of the votes cast by the holders of Series A Preferred Stock and any dividend parity stock, voting together as a single class, and the Preferred Stock Director so appointed or elected to fill such vacancy shall serve for a term expiring at the next annual meeting of the stockholders. Preferred Stock Directors may only be elected by the holders of Series A Preferred Stock and dividend parity stock in accordance with this Section 7. If the holders of Series A Preferred Stock and such dividend parity stock fail to elect a sufficient number of directors to fill all directorships for which they are entitled to elect directors pursuant to this Section 7, then any directorship not so filled shall remain vacant until such time as the holders of Series A Preferred Stock and such dividend parity stock elect a person to fill such directorship in accordance with this Section 7, or such vacancy is otherwise filled in accordance with this Section 7 and no such directorship may be filled by stockholders of the Corporation other than in accordance with this Section 7. 
 
 (iv) Termination Removal. Whenever the Company has paid noncumulative dividends in full for at least two consecutive semi-annual or four consecutive quarterly Dividend Periods following a Nonpayment on the Series A Preferred Stock and on any dividend parity stock entitled to noncumulative dividends and has paid cumulative dividends in full on any dividend parity stock entitled to cumulative dividends, then the right of the Holders to elect the Preferred Stock Directors will cease (but subject always to the same provisions for the vesting of the special voting rights in the case of any similar non-payment of dividends in respect of future Dividend Periods) (the time of such cessation, the Preferred Stock Director Termination Date ). Upon a Preferred Stock Director Termination Date, the terms of office of the Preferred Stock Directors will immediately terminate, the persons then serving as Preferred Stock Directors shall immediately cease to be qualified to hold office as Preferred Stock Directors, the Preferred Stock Directors shall cease to be directors of the Company and the number of directors constituting the Board of Directors shall be automatically reduced, without any action by the Board of Directors or the stockholders of the Company, by the number of Preferred Stock Directors authorized immediately prior to such termination. Any Preferred Stock Director may be removed at any time without cause by the holders of a majority of the voting power of outstanding shares of the capital stock then entitled to vote in the election of Preferred Stock Directors, voting together as a single class (with such voting power measured based on the voting power to elect Preferred Stock Directors). 
 
 (c) Senior Issuances Adverse Changes.

Section 7. Voting Rights . 
 
 (a) General . The Holders shall not be entitled to vote on any matter except as set forth in Section 7(b) below or as required by the Delaware General Corporation Law. 
 
 (b) Special Voting Right . 
 
 (i) Voting Right . If and whenever dividends on the Series B Preferred Stock or any other class or series of preferred stock that ranks on parity with Series B Preferred Stock as to payment of dividends and upon which voting rights equivalent to those granted by this Section 7(b)(i) have been conferred and are exercisable (any such class or series being referred to herein as dividend parity stock have not been paid in an aggregate amount equal, as to any class or series, to at least three semi-annual or six quarterly Dividend Periods, as applicable, (whether consecutive or not) (a Nonpayment ), the authorized number of directors constituting the Board of Directors shall be increased by two, and the Holders, together with holders of dividend parity stock, shall have the right, voting separately as a single class without regard to class or series (and with voting rights allocated pro rata based on the liquidation preference of each such class or series), to the exclusion of the holders of Common Stock, to elect two directors of the Company to fill such newly created directorships (and to fill any vacancies in the terms of such directorships), provided that it shall be a qualification for election of any such director that the election of such director shall not cause the Company to violate the corporate governance requirements of the New York Stock Exchange (or other exchange on which the Company s securities may be listed) that listed companies must have a majority of independent directors and further provided that the Board of Directors shall at no time include more than two such directors. Each such director elected by the Holders together with holders of dividend parity stock is a Preferred Stock Director . 
 
 (ii) Election . The election of the Preferred Stock Directors will take place at any annual meeting of stockholders or any special meeting of the Holders and any dividend parity stock, called as provided herein. At any time after the special voting power has vested pursuant to Section 7(b)(i) above, the secretary of the Company may, and upon the written request (addressed to the secretary at the Company s principal office) of the holders of at least 20 of the voting power of the Series B Preferred Stock or the holders of at least 20 of the voting power of any series of dividend parity stock (with such voting power measured based on the voting power to elect Preferred Stock Directors), must (unless such request is received less than 90 days before the date fixed for the next annual or special meeting of the stockholders at which Preferred Stock Directors are to be elected, in which event such election shall be held at such next annual or special meeting of stockholders), call a special meeting of the holders of Series B Preferred Stock and any dividend parity stock for the purposes of electing Preferred Stock Directors. The Preferred Stock Directors shall each be entitled to one vote per director on any matter. 
 
 (iii) Notice of Special Meeting . Notice for a special meeting to elect Preferred Stock Directors will be given in a similar manner to that provided in the Company s by-laws for a special meeting of the stockholders. If the secretary of the Company does not call a special meeting within 20 days after receipt of any such request, then any Holder may (at the expense of the Company) call such meeting, upon notice as provided in this Section 7(b)(iii), and for that purpose will have access to the stock register of the Company. The Preferred Stock Directors elected at any such special meeting and each Preferred Stock Director elected at a subsequent annual or special meeting of stockholders, will be elected for term expiring upon the earlier of the Preferred Stock 

Director Termination Date and the next annual meeting of stockholders following such Preferred Stock Director's election. In case any vacancy in the office of a Preferred Stock Director occurs (other than prior to the initial election of the Preferred Stock Directors), the vacancy may be filled by the Preferred Stock Director remaining in office, or if none remains in office, by a plurality of the votes cast by the holders of Series B Preferred Stock and any dividend parity stock, voting together as a single class, and the Preferred Stock Director so appointed or elected to fill such vacancy shall serve for a term expiring at the next annual meeting of the stockholders. Preferred Stock Directors may only be elected by the holders of Series B Preferred Stock and dividend parity stock in accordance with this Section 7. If the holders of Series B Preferred Stock and such dividend parity stock fail to elect a sufficient number of directors to fill all directorships for which they are entitled to elect directors pursuant to this Section 7, then any directorship not so filled shall remain vacant until such time as the holders of Series B Preferred Stock and such dividend parity stock elect a person to fill such directorship in accordance with this Section 7, or such vacancy is otherwise filled in accordance with this Section 7 and no such directorship may be filled by stockholders of the Corporation other than in accordance with this Section 7. 
 
 (iv) Termination Removal . Whenever the Company has paid noncumulative dividends in full for at least two consecutive semi-annual or four consecutive quarterly Dividend Periods following a Nonpayment on the Series B Preferred Stock and on any dividend parity stock entitled to noncumulative dividends and has paid cumulative dividends in full on any dividend parity stock entitled to cumulative dividends, then the right of the Holders to elect the Preferred Stock Directors will cease (but subject always to the same provisions for the vesting of the special voting rights in the case of any similar non-payment of dividends in respect of future Dividend Periods) (the time of such cessation, the Preferred Stock Director Termination Date ). Upon a Preferred Stock Director Termination Date, the terms of office of the Preferred Stock Directors will immediately terminate, the persons then serving as Preferred Stock Directors shall immediately cease to be qualified to hold office as Preferred Stock Directors, the Preferred Stock Directors shall cease to be directors of the Company and the number of directors constituting the Board of Directors shall be automatically reduced, without any action by the Board of Directors or the stockholders of the Company, by the number of Preferred Stock Directors authorized immediately prior to such termination. Any Preferred Stock Director may be removed at any time without cause by the holders of a majority of the voting power of outstanding shares of the capital stock then entitled to vote in the election of Preferred Stock Directors, voting together as a single class (with such voting power measured based on the voting power to elect Preferred Stock Directors). 
 (c) Senior Issuances Adverse Changes . So long as any shares of Series B Preferred Stock are outstanding, but subject to the final paragraph of this Section 7(c), in addition to any other vote or consent of holders of the Company s capital stock required by Delaware law, the vote or consent of the holders of at least two-thirds of the voting power of the Series B Preferred Stock and the holders of any other preferred stock entitled to vote thereon, voting together as a single class, given in person or by proxy at an annual or special meeting of stockholders, or given in writing without a meeting, will be necessary for effecting or validating any of the following actions, whether or not such approval is required by Delaware law 
 
 (i) any amendment, alteration or repeal of any provision of the Company s certificate of incorporation (including the certificate of designations creating the Series B Preferred Stock) or the Company s by-laws that would alter or change the voting powers, preferences, economic rights or special rights of the Series B Preferred Stock so as to affect them adversely

consolidation in the same amount, at the same time and otherwise in the same manner as would have been the case under the Series B Preferred Stock prior to such merger or consolidation), and (ii) such Series B Preferred Stock remaining outstanding or such preferred securities, as the case may be, have such rights, preferences, privileges and voting powers, taken as a whole, as are not materially less favorable to the holders thereof than the rights, preferences, privileges and voting powers of the Series B Preferred Stock, taken as a whole

 If any amendment, alteration, repeal, share exchange, reclassification, merger or consolidation specified in this Section 7(c) would adversely affect the Series B Preferred Stock but not all series of preferred stock of the Company, then only such series of preferred stock as are adversely affected by and entitled to vote on the matter shall vote on the matter together with the Series B Preferred Stock as a single class (in lieu of all other series of preferred stock) for purposes of the vote or consent required by this Section 7(c). 
 (d) No Vote if Redemption .

The period from and including the date of issuance of the Series C Preferred Stock or any Dividend Payment Date to, but excluding, the next Dividend Payment Date is a Dividend Period . Dividends on each share of Series C Preferred Stock will accrue on the liquidation preference of 25,000 per share at a rate per annum equal to 5.80 . The record date for payment of dividends on the Series C Preferred Stock will be the record date fixed by the Board of Directors or any other duly authorized committee thereof that is not more than 30 nor less than 10 days prior to such Dividend Payment Date (each, a Dividend Record Date ). Any such day that is a Dividend Record Date will be a Dividend Record Date whether or not such day is a Business Day. The amount of dividends payable will be computed on the basis of a 360-day year of twelve 30-day months. 
 
 (b) Noncumulative Dividends . If the Board of Directors or any duly authorized committee thereof does not declare a dividend on the Series C Preferred Stock for any Dividend Period prior to the related Dividend Payment Date, that dividend will not accrue, and the Company will have no obligation to pay, and Holders shall have no right to receive, a dividend for that Dividend Period on the related Dividend Payment Date or at any future time, whether or not dividends on the Series C Preferred Stock or any other series of preferred stock or common stock are declared for any subsequent period. References herein to the accrual of dividends refer only to the determination of the amount of such dividend and do not imply that any right to a dividend arises prior to the date on which a dividend is declared. 
 
 (c) Priority of Dividends . So long as any share of Series C Preferred Stock remains outstanding, unless as to a Dividend Payment Date full dividends on all outstanding shares of the Series C Preferred Stock have been declared and paid or declared and a sum sufficient for the payment of those dividends has been set aside for the Dividend Period then ending, the Company will not, and will cause its subsidiaries not to, during the next succeeding Dividend Period that commences on such Dividend Payment Date, declare or pay any dividend on, make any distributions relating to, or redeem, purchase, acquire or make a liquidation payment relating to, any Junior Stock, or make any guarantee payment with respect thereto, other than 
 (i) purchases, redemptions or other acquisitions of shares of Junior Stock in connection with any employment contract, benefit plan or other similar arrangement with or for the benefit of employees, officers, directors or consultants 

(ii) purchases of shares of Common Stock pursuant to a contractually binding requirement to buy stock existing prior to the commencement of the then-current Dividend Period, including under a contractually binding stock repurchase plan 
 
 (iii) as a result of an exchange or conversion of any class or series of Junior Stock for any other class or series of Junior Stock 
 
 (iv) the purchase of fractional interests in shares of Junior Stock pursuant to the conversion or exchange provisions of such Junior Stock or the security being converted or exchanged 
 
 (v) the purchase of Junior Stock by an investment banking subsidiary of the Company in connection with the distribution thereof or 
 
 (vi) the purchase of Junior Stock by any investment banking subsidiary of the Company in connection with market-making or other secondary market activities in the ordinary course of the business of such subsidiary. 
 
 The restrictions set forth in the preceding provisions of this Section 4(c) shall not apply to any Junior Stock dividends paid by the Company where the dividend is in the form of the same stock (or the right to buy the same stock) as that on which the dividend is being paid. 
 Except as provided below, for so long as any share of Series C Preferred Stock remains outstanding, if dividends are not declared and paid in full upon the shares of Series C Preferred Stock and any class or series of stock of the Company now existing or hereafter authorized that ranks equally with the Series C Preferred Stock in the payment of dividends, all dividends declared upon shares of Series C Preferred Stock and such other stock will be declared on a proportional basis so that the amount of dividends declared per share will bear to each other the same ratio that accrued dividends for the then-current Dividend Period per share of Series C Preferred Stock and accrued dividends for the then-current Dividend Period per share of such other stock (including, in the case of any such other stock that bears cumulative dividends, all accrued and unpaid dividends) bear to each other. 
 Subject to the foregoing, and not otherwise, such dividends payable in cash, stock or otherwise, as may be determined by the Board of Directors or any duly authorized committee thereof, may be declared and paid on any other class or series of stock of the Company from time to time out of any funds legally available for such payment, and Holders will not be entitled to participate in those dividends. 

Section 5. Liquidation Rights . 
 
 (a) Liquidation . In the event of any voluntary or involuntary liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the affairs of the Company, Holders shall be entitled, out of funds legally available therefor, before any distribution or payment may be made by the Company or set aside for the holders of any Junior Stock and subject to the rights of the holders of any class or series of stock ranking senior to or on parity with Series C Preferred Stock upon liquidation and the rights of the Company s depositors and other creditors, to receive in full a liquidating distribution in the amount of the liquidation preference of 25,000 per share (the Series C Liquidation Preference ), plus any accrued dividends thereon from the last Dividend Payment Date to, but excluding, the date of the liquidation, dissolution or winding up if and to the extent declared but not yet paid. Holders shall not be entitled to any further payments in the event of any such voluntary or involuntary liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the affairs of the Company other than what is expressly provided for in this Section 5. 
 (b) Partial Payment . If the assets of the Company are not sufficient to pay in full the aforesaid liquidation distributions to the Holders and any liquidation distributions owed to holders of any class or series of stock of the Company ranking equally with the Series C Preferred Stock in the distribution of assets on any voluntary or involuntary liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Company, the amounts paid to the Holders and to the holders of all such equally ranking stock shall be pro rata in accordance with the respective aggregate liquidating distributions to which they would otherwise be entitled. 
 
 (d) Merger, Consolidation and Sale of Assets Not Liquidation . For purposes of this Section 5, the sale, conveyance, exchange or transfer (for cash, shares of stock, securities or other consideration) of all or substantially all of the property and assets of the Company shall not be deemed a voluntary or involuntary dissolution, liquidation or winding up of the affairs of the Company, nor shall the merger, consolidation or any other business combination transaction of the Company into or with any other corporation or Person or the merger, consolidation or any other business combination transaction of any other corporation or Person into or with the Company be deemed to be a voluntary or involuntary dissolution, liquidation or winding up of the affairs of the Company. 
 
 Section 6. Redemption . 
 
 (a) Optional Redemption . The Company, at the option of its Board of Directors or any duly authorized committee thereof, may redeem out of funds legally available therefor, (i) in whole or in part, from time to time, the shares of Series C Preferred Stock at the time outstanding, on any Dividend Payment Date on or after April 22, 2018, or (ii) in whole but not in part at any time within 90 days following a Regulatory Capital Event, in each case at a redemption price equal to 25,000 per share plus any declared and unpaid dividends, without accumulation of any undeclared dividends, to but excluding the redemption date, upon notice given as provided in Section 6(b) below. 

(b) Notice of Redemption . Notice of every redemption of shares of Series C Preferred Stock shall be mailed by first class mail, postage prepaid, addressed to the Holders of such shares to be redeemed at their respective last addresses appearing on the stock register of the Company. Such mailing shall be at least 30 days and not more than 60 days before the date fixed for redemption. Any notice mailed as provided in this Section 6(b) shall be conclusively presumed to have been duly given, whether or not the Holder receives such notice, but failure duly to give such notice by mail, or any defect in such notice or in the mailing thereof, to any Holder of shares of Series C Preferred Stock designated for redemption shall not affect the validity of the proceedings for the redemption of any other shares of Series C Preferred Stock. Each notice shall state 
 
 (i) the redemption date 
 
 (ii) the total number of shares of Series C Preferred Stock to be redeemed and, if fewer than all the shares of a Holder are to be redeemed, the number of such shares to be redeemed 
 
 (iii) the redemption price 
 
 (iv) the place or places where the certificates for such shares are to be surrendered for payment of the redemption price, if applicable and 
 
 (v) that dividends on the shares to be redeemed will cease to accrue on the redemption date. 
 
 Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the certificates evidencing the shares of Series C Preferred Stock are held of record by a depositary and any related depository shares are held of record by a Depositary or its nominee, the Company may give such notice in any manner permitted by the Depositary. 
 
 (c) Partial Redemption . In case of any redemption of only part of the shares of Series A Preferred Stock at the time outstanding, the shares of Series C Preferred Stock to be redeemed shall be selected pro rata from the Holders in proportion to the number of shares of Series C Preferred Stock held by such Holders, by lot or in such other manner as the Board of Directors or any duly authorized committee thereof may determine, in its sole discretion, to be fair and equitable. Subject to the provisions of this Section 6, the Board of Directors or any duly authorized committee thereof shall have full power and authority to prescribe the terms and conditions upon which shares of Series C Preferred Stock shall be redeemed from time to time. 
 
 (d) Effectiveness of Redemption . If notice of redemption has been duly given and if on or before the redemption date specified in the notice all funds necessary for the redemption have been set aside by the Company, separate and apart from its other assets, for the pro rata benefit of the Holders of the shares called for redemption, so as to be and continue to be available therefor, or deposited by the Company with a bank or trust company selected by the Board of Directors or any duly authorized committee thereof (the Trust in trust for the pro rata benefit of the 

Holders of the shares called for redemption, then, notwithstanding that any certificate for any share so called for redemption has not been surrendered for cancellation, on and after the redemption date all shares so called for redemption shall cease to be outstanding, all dividends with respect to such shares shall cease to accrue on such redemption date, and all rights with respect to such shares shall forthwith on such redemption date cease and terminate, except only the right of the Holders thereof to receive the amount payable on such redemption from the Trust at any time after the redemption date from the funds so deposited, without interest. The Company shall be entitled to receive, from time to time, from the Trust any interest accrued on such funds, and the Holders of any shares called for redemption shall have no claim to any such interest. Any funds so deposited and unclaimed at the end of three years from the redemption date shall, to the extent permitted by law, be released or repaid to the Company, and in the event of such repayment to the Company, the Holders of the shares so called for redemption shall be deemed to be unsecured creditors of the Company for an amount equivalent to the amount deposited as stated above for the redemption of such shares and so repaid to the Company, but shall in no event be entitled to any interest. 

Section 7. Voting Rights . 
 
 (a) General . The Holders shall not be entitled to vote on any matter except as set forth in Section 7(b) below or as required by the Delaware General Corporation Law. 
 
 (b) Special Voting Right . 
 
 (i) Voting Right . If and whenever dividends on the Series C Preferred Stock or any other class or series of preferred stock that ranks on parity with Series C Preferred Stock as to payment of dividends and upon which voting rights equivalent to those granted by this Section 7(b)(i) have been conferred and are exercisable (any such class or series being referred to herein as dividend parity stock have not been paid in an aggregate amount equal, as to any class or series, to at least three semi-annual or six quarterly Dividend Periods, as applicable, (whether consecutive or not) (a Nonpayment ), the authorized number of directors constituting the Board of Directors shall be increased by two, and the Holders, together with holders of dividend parity stock, shall have the right, voting separately as a single class without regard to class or series (and with voting rights allocated pro rata based on the liquidation preference of each such class or series), to the exclusion of the holders of Common Stock, to elect two directors of the Company to fill such newly created directorships (and to fill any vacancies in the terms of such directorships), provided that it shall be a qualification for election of any such director that the election of such director shall not cause the Company to violate the corporate governance requirements of the New York Stock Exchange (or other exchange on which the Company s securities may be listed) that listed companies must have a majority of independent directors and further provided that the Board of Directors shall at no time include more than two such directors. Each such director elected by the Holders together with holders of dividend parity stock is a Preferred Stock Director . 

(ii) Election . The election of the Preferred Stock Directors will take place at any annual meeting of stockholders or any special meeting of the Holders and any dividend parity stock, called as provided herein. At any time after the special voting power has vested pursuant to Section 7(b)(i) above, the secretary of the Company may, and upon the written request (addressed to the secretary at the Company s principal office) of the holders of at least 20 of the voting power of the Series C Preferred Stock or the holders of at least 20 of the voting power of any series of dividend parity stock (with such voting power measured based on the voting power to elect Preferred Stock Directors), must (unless such request is received less than 90 days before the date fixed for the next annual or special meeting of the stockholders at which Preferred Stock Directors are to be elected, in which event such election shall be held at such next annual or special meeting of stockholders), call a special meeting of the holders of Series C Preferred Stock and any dividend parity stock for the purposes of electing Preferred Stock Directors. The Preferred Stock Directors shall each be entitled to one vote per director on any matter. 
 
 (iii) Notice of Special Meeting . Notice for a special meeting to elect Preferred Stock Directors will be given in a similar manner to that provided in the Company s by-laws for a special meeting of the stockholders. If the secretary of the Company does not call a special meeting within 20 days after receipt of any such request, then any Holder may (at the expense of the Company) call such meeting, upon notice as provided in this Section 7(b)(iii), and for that purpose will have access to the stock register of the Company. The Preferred Stock Directors elected at any such special meeting and each Preferred Stock Director elected at a subsequent annual or special meeting of stockholders, will be elected for term expiring upon the earlier of the Preferred Stock Director Termination Date and the next annual meeting of stockholders following such Preferred Stock Director's election. In case any vacancy in the office of a Preferred Stock Director occurs (other than prior to the initial election of the Preferred Stock Directors), the vacancy may be filled by the Preferred Stock Director remaining in office, or if none remains in office, by a plurality of the votes cast by the holders of Series C Preferred Stock and any dividend parity stock, voting together as a single class, and the Preferred Stock Director so appointed or elected to fill such vacancy shall serve for a term expiring at the next annual meeting of the stockholders. Preferred Stock Directors may only be elected by the holders of Series C Preferred Stock and dividend parity stock in accordance with this Section 7. If the holders of Series C Preferred Stock and such dividend parity stock fail to elect a sufficient number of directors to fill all directorships for which they are entitled to elect directors pursuant to this Section 7, then any directorship not so filled shall remain vacant until such time as the holders of Series C Preferred Stock and such dividend parity stock elect a person to fill such directorship in accordance with this Section 7, or such vacancy is otherwise filled in accordance with this Section 7 and no such directorship may be filled by stockholders of the Corporation other than in accordance with this Section 7. 
 
 (iv) Termination Removal . Whenever the Company has paid noncumulative dividends in full for at least two consecutive semi-annual or four consecutive quarterly Dividend Periods following a Nonpayment on the Series C Preferred Stock and on any 

dividend parity stock entitled to noncumulative dividends and has paid cumulative dividends in full on any dividend parity stock entitled to cumulative dividends, then the right of the Holders to elect the Preferred Stock Directors will cease (but subject always to the same provisions for the vesting of the special voting rights in the case of any similar non-payment of dividends in respect of future Dividend Periods) (the time of such cessation, the Preferred Stock Director Termination Date ). Upon a Preferred Stock Director Termination Date, the terms of office of the Preferred Stock Directors will immediately terminate, the persons then serving as Preferred Stock Directors shall immediately cease to be qualified to hold office as Preferred Stock Directors, the Preferred Stock Directors shall cease to be directors of the Company and the number of directors constituting the Board of Directors shall be automatically reduced, without any action by the Board of Directors or the stockholders of the Company, by the number of Preferred Stock Directors authorized immediately prior to such termination. Any Preferred Stock Director may be removed at any time without cause by the holders of a majority of the voting power of outstanding shares of the capital stock then entitled to vote in the election of Preferred Stock Directors, voting together as a single class (with such voting power measured based on the voting power to elect Preferred Stock Directors). 
 (c) Senior Issuances Adverse Changes . So long as any shares of Series C Preferred Stock are outstanding, but subject to the final paragraph of this Section 7(c), in addition to any other vote or consent of holders of the Company s capital stock required by Delaware law, the vote or consent of the holders of at least two-thirds of the voting power of the Series C Preferred Stock and the holders of any other preferred stock entitled to vote thereon, voting together as a single class, given in person or by proxy at an annual or special meeting of stockholders, or given in writing without a meeting, will be necessary for effecting or validating any of the following actions, whether or not such approval is required by Delaware law 
 
 (i) any amendment, alteration or repeal of any provision of the Company s certificate of incorporation (including the certificate of designations creating the Series C Preferred Stock) or the Company s by-laws that would alter or change the voting powers, preferences, economic rights or special rights of the Series C Preferred Stock so as to affect them adversely 
 
 (ii) any amendment or alteration of the Company s certificate of incorporation to authorize or create, or increase the authorized amount of, any shares of, or any securities convertible into shares of, any class or series of the Company's capital stock ranking prior to the Series C Preferred Stock in the payment of dividends or in the distribution of assets on any liquidation, dissolution, or winding up of the Company or 
 
 (iii) the consummation of a binding share exchange or reclassification involving the Series C Preferred Stock or a merger or consolidation of the Company with another entity, except that holders of Series C Preferred Stock will have no right to vote under this provision or otherwise under Delaware law if in each case (i) the Series C Preferred Stock remains outstanding or, in the case of any such merger or consolidation with 

respect to which the Company is not the surviving or resulting entity, is converted into or exchanged for preferred securities of the surviving or resulting entity or its ultimate parent, that is an entity organized and existing under the laws of the United States of America, any state thereof or the District of Columbia and that is a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes (or if such entity is not a corporation, the Company having received an opinion of nationally recognized counsel experienced in such matters to the effect that Holders will be subject to tax for U.S. federal income tax purposes with respect to such new preferred securities after such merger or consolidation in the same amount, at the same time and otherwise in the same manner as would have been the case under the Series C Preferred Stock prior to such merger or consolidation), and (ii) such Series C Preferred Stock remaining outstanding or such preferred securities, as the case may be, have such rights, preferences, privileges and voting powers, taken as a whole, as are not materially less favorable to the holders thereof than the rights, preferences, privileges and voting powers of the Series C Preferred Stock, taken as a whole 
 provided, however , that, for the avoidance of doubt, any increase in the amount of the authorized or issued Series C Preferred Stock or authorized preferred stock or any securities convertible into preferred stock or the creation and issuance, or an increase in the authorized or issued amount, of other series of preferred stock or any securities convertible into preferred stock ranking equally with and or junior to the Series C Preferred Stock with respect to the payment of dividends (whether such dividends are cumulative or noncumulative) and or the distribution of assets upon the Company s liquidation, dissolution or winding up will not be deemed to adversely affect the voting powers, preferences or special rights of the Series C Preferred Stock, and no stockholder will have the right to vote on such an increase, creation or issuance by reason of this Section 7. 
 If any amendment, alteration, repeal, share exchange, reclassification, merger or consolidation specified in this Section 7(c) would adversely affect the Series C Preferred Stock but not all series of preferred stock of the Company, then only such series of preferred stock as are adversely affected by and entitled to vote on the matter shall vote on the matter together with the Series C Preferred Stock as a single class (in lieu of all other series of preferred stock) for purposes of the vote or consent required by this Section 7(c). 
 (d) No Vote if Redemption . No vote or consent of the Holders shall be required pursuant to Section 7(b) or 7(c) if, at or prior to the time when the act with respect to such vote or consent would otherwise be required shall be effected, the Company shall have redeemed or shall have called for redemption all outstanding shares of Series C Preferred Stock, with proper notice and sufficient funds having been set aside for such redemption, in each case pursuant to Section 6 above. 

Section 8. Preemption and Conversion Rights . 
 
 The Holders shall not have any preemptive rights or conversion rights as a result of the terms hereof. 

Section 9. Rank . 
 
 For the avoidance of doubt, the Board of Directors or any duly authorized committee thereof may, without the vote of the Holders, authorize and issue additional shares of Junior Stock or shares of any class or series of stock of the Company now existing or hereafter authorized that ranks equally with the Series C Preferred Stock in the payment of dividends or in the distribution of assets on any voluntary or involuntary liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Company.

In case any vacancy in the office of a Preferred Stock Director occurs (other than prior to the initial election of the Preferred Stock Directors), the vacancy may be filled by the Preferred Stock Director remaining in office, or if none remains in office, by a plurality of the votes cast by the holders of Series D Preferred Stock and any dividend parity stock, voting together as a single class, and the Preferred Stock Director so appointed or elected to fill such vacancy shall serve for a term expiring at the next annual meeting of the stockholders.

 (c) Merger, Consolidation and Sale of Assets Not Liquidation . For purposes of this Section 5, the sale, conveyance, exchange or transfer (for cash, shares of stock, securities or other consideration) of all or substantially all of the property and assets of the Company shall not be deemed a voluntary or involuntary dissolution, liquidation or winding up of the affairs of the Company, nor shall the merger, consolidation or any other business combination transaction of the Company into or with any other corporation or Person or the merger, consolidation or any other business combination transaction of any other corporation or Person into or with the Company be deemed to be a voluntary or involuntary dissolution, liquidation or winding up of the affairs of the Company.

 (b) Special Voting Right . 
 
 (i) Voting Right . If and whenever dividends on the Series J Preferred Stock or any other class or series of preferred stock that ranks on parity with Series J Preferred Stock as to payment of dividends and upon which voting rights equivalent to those granted by this Section 7(b)(i) have been conferred and are exercisable (any such class or series being referred to herein as dividend parity stock have not been paid in an aggregate amount equal, as to any class or series, to at least three semi-annual or six quarterly Dividend Periods, as applicable, (whether consecutive or not) (a Nonpayment ), the authorized number of directors constituting the Board of Directors shall be increased by two, and the Holders, together with holders of dividend parity stock, shall have the right, voting separately as a single class without regard to class or series (and with voting rights allocated pro rata based on the liquidation preference of each such class or series), to the exclusion of the holders of Common Stock, to elect two directors of the Company to fill such newly created directorships (and to fill any vacancies in the terms of such directorships), provided that it shall be a qualification for election of any such director that the election of such director shall not cause the Company to violate the corporate governance requirements of the New York Stock Exchange (or other exchange on which the Company s securities may be listed) that listed companies must have a majority of independent directors and further provided that the Board of Directors shall at no time include more than two such directors. Each such director elected by the Holders together with holders of dividend parity stock is a Preferred Stock Director . 
 
 (ii) Election . The election of the Preferred Stock Directors will take place at any annual meeting of stockholders or any special meeting of the Holders and any dividend parity stock, called as provided herein. At any time after the special voting power has vested pursuant to Section 7(b)(i) above, the secretary of the Company may, and upon the 

written request (addressed to the secretary at the Company s principal office) of the holders of at least 20 of the voting power of the Series J Preferred Stock or the holders of at least 20 of the voting power of any series of dividend parity stock (with such voting power measured based on the voting power to elect Preferred Stock Directors), must (unless such request is received less than 90 days before the date fixed for the next annual or special meeting of the stockholders at which Preferred Stock Directors are to be elected, in which event such election shall be held at such next annual or special meeting of stockholders), call a special meeting of the holders of Series J Preferred Stock and any dividend parity stock for the purposes of electing Preferred Stock Directors. The Preferred Stock Directors shall each be entitled to one vote per director on any matter. 
 
 (iii) Notice of Special Meeting . Notice for a special meeting to elect Preferred Stock Directors will be given in a similar manner to that provided in the Company s by-laws for a special meeting of the stockholders. If the secretary of the Company does not call a special meeting within 20 days after receipt of any such request, then any Holder may (at the expense of the Company) call such meeting, upon notice as provided in this Section 7(b)(iii), and for that purpose will have access to the stock register of the Company. The Preferred Stock Directors elected at any such special meeting and each Preferred Stock Director elected at a subsequent annual or special meeting of stockholders, will be elected for term expiring upon the earlier of the Preferred Stock Director Termination Date and the next annual meeting of stockholders following such Preferred Stock Director's election. In case any vacancy in the office of a Preferred Stock Director occurs (other than prior to the initial election of the Preferred Stock Directors), the vacancy may be filled by the Preferred Stock Director remaining in office, or if none remains in office, by a plurality of the votes cast by the holders of Series J Preferred Stock and any dividend parity stock, voting together as a single class, and the Preferred Stock Director so appointed or elected to fill such vacancy shall serve for a term expiring at the next annual meeting of the stockholders. Preferred Stock Directors may only be elected by the holders of Series J Preferred Stock and dividend parity stock in accordance with this Section 7. If the holders of Series J Preferred Stock and such dividend parity stock fail to elect a sufficient number of directors to fill all directorships for which they are entitled to elect directors pursuant to this Section 7, then any directorship not so filled shall remain vacant until such time as the holders of Series J Preferred Stock and such dividend parity stock elect a person to fill such directorship in accordance with this Section 7, or such vacancy is otherwise filled in accordance with this Section 7 and no such directorship may be filled by stockholders of the Corporation other than in accordance with this Section 7. 
 
 (iv) Termination Removal . Whenever the Company has paid noncumulative dividends in full for at least two consecutive semi-annual or four consecutive quarterly Dividend Periods following a Nonpayment on the Series J Preferred Stock and on any dividend parity stock entitled to noncumulative dividends and has paid cumulative dividends in full on any dividend parity stock entitled to cumulative dividends, then the right of the Holders to elect the Preferred Stock Directors will cease (but subject always to the same provisions for the vesting of the special voting rights in the case of any 

similar non-payment of dividends in respect of future Dividend Periods) (the time of such cessation, the Preferred Stock Director Termination Date ). Upon a Preferred Stock Director Termination Date, the terms of office of the Preferred Stock Directors will immediately terminate, the persons then serving as Preferred Stock Directors shall immediately cease to be qualified to hold office as Preferred Stock Directors, the Preferred Stock Directors shall cease to be directors of the Company and the number of directors constituting the Board of Directors shall be automatically reduced, without any action by the Board of Directors or the stockholders of the Company, by the number of Preferred Stock Directors authorized immediately prior to such termination. Any Preferred Stock Director may be removed at any time without cause by the holders of a majority of the voting power of outstanding shares of the capital stock then entitled to vote in the election of Preferred Stock Directors, voting together as a single class (with such voting power measured based on the voting power to elect Preferred Stock Directors).

 If any amendment, alteration, repeal, share exchange, reclassification, merger or consolidation specified in this Section 7(c) would adversely affect the Series J Preferred Stock but not all series of preferred stock of the Company, then only such series of preferred stock as are adversely affected by and entitled to vote on the matter shall vote on the matter together with the Series J Preferred Stock as a single class (in lieu of all other series of preferred stock) for purposes of the vote or consent required by this Section 7(c). 
 (d) No Vote if Redemption .

If the Board of Directors or any duly authorized committee thereof does not declare a dividend on the Series K Preferred Stock for any Dividend Period prior to the related Dividend Payment Date, that dividend will not accrue, and the Company will have no obligation to pay, and Holders shall have no right to receive, a dividend for that Dividend Period on the related Dividend Payment Date or at any future time, whether or not dividends on the Series K Preferred Stock or any other series of preferred stock or common stock are declared for any subsequent period. References herein to the accrual of dividends refer only to the determination of the amount of such dividend and do not imply that any right to a dividend arises prior to the date on which a dividend is declared. 
 
 (c) Priority of Dividends . So long as any share of Series K Preferred Stock remains outstanding, unless as to a Dividend Payment Date full dividends on all outstanding shares of the Series K Preferred Stock have been declared and paid or declared and a sum sufficient for the payment of those dividends has been set aside for the Dividend Period then ending, the Company will not, and will cause its subsidiaries not to, during the next succeeding Dividend Period that commences on such Dividend Payment Date, declare or pay any dividend on, make any 

distributions relating to, or redeem, purchase, acquire or make a liquidation payment relating to, any Junior Stock, or make any guarantee payment with respect thereto, other than 
 (i) purchases, redemptions or other acquisitions of shares of Junior Stock in connection with any employment contract, benefit plan or other similar arrangement with or for the benefit of employees, officers, directors or consultants 
 
 (ii) purchases of shares of Common Stock pursuant to a contractually binding requirement to buy stock existing prior to the commencement of the then-current Dividend Period, including under a contractually binding stock repurchase plan 
 
 (iii) as a result of an exchange or conversion of any class or series of Junior Stock for any other class or series of Junior Stock 
 
 (iv) the purchase of fractional interests in shares of Junior Stock pursuant to the conversion or exchange provisions of such Junior Stock or the security being converted or exchanged 
 
 (v) the purchase of Junior Stock by an investment banking subsidiary of the Company in connection with the distribution thereof or 
 
 (vi) the purchase of Junior Stock by any investment banking subsidiary of the Company in connection with market-making or other secondary market activities in the ordinary course of the business of such subsidiary. 
 
 The restrictions set forth in the preceding provisions of this Section 4(c) shall not apply to any Junior Stock dividends paid by the Company where the dividend is in the form of the same stock (or the right to buy the same stock) as that on which the dividend is being paid. 
 Except as provided below, for so long as any share of Series K Preferred Stock remains outstanding, if dividends are not declared and paid in full upon the shares of Series K Preferred Stock and any class or series of stock of the Company now existing or hereafter authorized that ranks equally with the Series K Preferred Stock in the payment of dividends, all dividends declared upon shares of Series K Preferred Stock and such other stock will be declared on a proportional basis so that the amount of dividends declared per share will bear to each other the same ratio that accrued dividends for the then-current Dividend Period per share of Series K Preferred Stock and accrued dividends for the then-current Dividend Period per share of such other stock (including, in the case of any such other stock that bears cumulative dividends, all accrued and unpaid dividends) bear to each other. 
 Subject to the foregoing, and not otherwise, such dividends payable in cash, stock or otherwise, as may be determined by the Board of Directors or any duly authorized committee thereof, may be declared and paid on any other class or series of stock of the Company from time to time out of any funds legally available for such payment, and Holders will not be entitled to participate in those dividends. 

Section 5. Liquidation Rights . 
 
 (a) Liquidation . In the event of any voluntary or involuntary liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the affairs of the Company, Holders shall be entitled, out of funds legally available therefor, before any distribution or payment may be made by the Company or set aside for the holders of any Junior Stock and subject to the rights of the holders of any class or series of stock ranking senior to or on parity with Series K Preferred Stock upon liquidation and the rights of the Company s depositors and other creditors, to receive in full a liquidating distribution in the amount of the liquidation preference of 25,000 per share (the Series K Liquidation Preference ), plus any accrued dividends thereon from the last Dividend Payment Date to, but excluding, the date of the liquidation, dissolution or winding up if and to the extent declared but not yet paid. Holders shall not be entitled to any further payments in the event of any such voluntary or involuntary liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the affairs of the Company other than what is expressly provided for in this Section 5. 
 (b) Partial Payment . If the assets of the Company are not sufficient to pay in full the aforesaid liquidation distributions to the Holders and any liquidation distributions owed to holders of any class or series of stock of the Company ranking equally with the Series K Preferred Stock in the distribution of assets on any voluntary or involuntary liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Company, the amounts paid to the Holders and to the holders of all such equally ranking stock shall be pro rata in accordance with the respective aggregate liquidating distributions to which they would otherwise be entitled. 
 
 (c) Merger, Consolidation and Sale of Assets Not Liquidation . For purposes of this Section 5, the sale, conveyance, exchange or transfer (for cash, shares of stock, securities or other consideration) of all or substantially all of the property and assets of the Company shall not be deemed a voluntary or involuntary dissolution, liquidation or winding up of the affairs of the Company, nor shall the merger, consolidation or any other business combination transaction of the Company into or with any other corporation or Person or the merger, consolidation or any other business combination transaction of any other corporation or Person into or with the Company be deemed to be a voluntary or involuntary dissolution, liquidation or winding up of the affairs of the Company. 

Section 6. Redemption . 
 
 (a) Optional Redemption . The Company, at the option of its Board of Directors or any duly authorized committee thereof, may redeem out of funds legally available therefor, (i) in whole or in part, from time to time, the shares of Series K Preferred Stock at the time outstanding, on any Dividend Payment Date on or after November 15, 2023, or (ii) in whole but not in part at any time within 90 days following a Regulatory Capital Event, in each case at a redemption price equal to 25,000 per share plus any declared and unpaid dividends, without 

accumulation of any undeclared dividends, to but excluding the redemption date, upon notice given as provided in Section 6(b) below. 
 
 (b) Notice of Redemption . Notice of every redemption of shares of Series K Preferred Stock shall be mailed by first class mail, postage prepaid, addressed to the Holders of such shares to be redeemed at their respective last addresses appearing on the stock register of the Company. Such mailing shall be at least 30 days and not more than 60 days before the date fixed for redemption. Any notice mailed as provided in this Section 6(b) shall be conclusively presumed to have been duly given, whether or not the Holder receives such notice, but failure duly to give such notice by mail, or any defect in such notice or in the mailing thereof, to any Holder of shares of Series K Preferred Stock designated for redemption shall not affect the validity of the proceedings for the redemption of any other shares of Series K Preferred Stock. Each notice shall state 
 
 (i) the redemption date 
 
 (ii) the total number of shares of Series K Preferred Stock to be redeemed and, if fewer than all the shares of a Holder are to be redeemed, the number of such shares to be redeemed 
 
 (iii) the redemption price 
 
 (iv) the place or places where the certificates for such shares are to be surrendered for payment of the redemption price, if applicable and 
 
 (v) that dividends on the shares to be redeemed will cease to accrue on the redemption date. 
 
 Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the certificates evidencing the shares of Series K Preferred Stock are held of record by a depositary and any related depository shares are held of record by a Depositary or its nominee, the Company may give such notice in any manner permitted by the Depositary. 
 
 (c) Partial Redemption . In case of any redemption of only part of the shares of Series A Preferred Stock at the time outstanding, the shares of Series K Preferred Stock to be redeemed shall be selected (i) pro rata from the Holders in proportion to the number of shares of Series K Preferred Stock held by such Holders, (ii) by lot or (iii) in such other manner as the Board of Directors or any duly authorized committee thereof may determine, in its sole discretion, to be fair and equitable provided, however, that if for so long as the Series K Preferred Stock or depositary shares in respect thereof are listed on the New York Stock Exchange, the foregoing clause (iii) shall apply only if such method of selection is not then prohibited by any then applicable rule of the New York Stock Exchange or the New York Stock Exchange consents to or grants a waiver or exemption from such rule. Subject to the provisions of this Section 6, the Board of Directors or any duly authorized committee thereof shall have full power and authority 

to prescribe the terms and conditions upon which shares of Series K Preferred Stock shall be redeemed from time to time. 
 
 (d) Effectiveness of Redemption . If notice of redemption has been duly given and if on or before the redemption date specified in the notice all funds necessary for the redemption have been set aside by the Company, separate and apart from its other assets, for the pro rata benefit of the Holders of the shares called for redemption, so as to be and continue to be available therefor, or deposited by the Company with a bank or trust company selected by the Board of Directors or any duly authorized committee thereof (the Trust in trust for the pro rata benefit of the Holders of the shares called for redemption, then, notwithstanding that any certificate for any share so called for redemption has not been surrendered for cancellation, on and after the redemption date all shares so called for redemption shall cease to be outstanding, all dividends with respect to such shares shall cease to accrue on such redemption date, and all rights with respect to such shares shall forthwith on such redemption date cease and terminate, except only the right of the Holders thereof to receive the amount payable on such redemption from the Trust at any time after the redemption date from the funds so deposited, without interest. The Company shall be entitled to receive, from time to time, from the Trust any interest accrued on such funds, and the Holders of any shares called for redemption shall have no claim to any such interest. Any funds so deposited and unclaimed at the end of three years from the redemption date shall, to the extent permitted by law, be released or repaid to the Company, and in the event of such repayment to the Company, the Holders of the shares so called for redemption shall be deemed to be unsecured creditors of the Company for an amount equivalent to the amount deposited as stated above for the redemption of such shares and so repaid to the Company, but shall in no event be entitled to any interest. 

Section 7. Voting Rights . 
 
 (a) General . The Holders shall not be entitled to vote on any matter except as set forth in Section 7(b) below or as required by the Delaware General Corporation Law. 
 
 (b) Special Voting Right . 
 
 (i) Voting Right . If and whenever dividends on the Series K Preferred Stock or any other class or series of preferred stock that ranks on parity with Series K Preferred Stock as to payment of dividends and upon which voting rights equivalent to those granted by this Section 7(b)(i) have been conferred and are exercisable (any such class or series being referred to herein as dividend parity stock have not been paid in an aggregate amount equal, as to any class or series, to at least three semi-annual or six quarterly Dividend Periods, as applicable, (whether consecutive or not) (a Nonpayment ), the authorized number of directors constituting the Board of Directors shall be increased by two, and the Holders, together with holders of dividend parity stock, shall have the right, voting separately as a single class without regard to class or series (and with voting rights allocated pro rata based on the liquidation preference of each such class or series), to the exclusion of the holders of Common Stock, to elect two directors 

of the Company to fill such newly created directorships (and to fill any vacancies in the terms of such directorships), provided that it shall be a qualification for election of any such director that the election of such director shall not cause the Company to violate the corporate governance requirements of the New York Stock Exchange (or other exchange on which the Company s securities may be listed) that listed companies must have a majority of independent directors and further provided that the Board of Directors shall at no time include more than two such directors. Each such director elected by the Holders together with holders of dividend parity stock is a Preferred Stock Director . 
 
 (ii) Election . The election of the Preferred Stock Directors will take place at any annual meeting of stockholders or any special meeting of the Holders and any dividend parity stock, called as provided herein. At any time after the special voting power has vested pursuant to Section 7(b)(i) above, the secretary of the Company may, and upon the written request (addressed to the secretary at the Company s principal office) of the holders of at least 20 of the voting power of the Series K Preferred Stock or the holders of at least 20 of the voting power of any series of dividend parity stock (with such voting power measured based on the voting power to elect Preferred Stock Directors), must (unless such request is received less than 90 days before the date fixed for the next annual or special meeting of the stockholders at which Preferred Stock Directors are to be elected, in which event such election shall be held at such next annual or special meeting of stockholders), call a special meeting of the holders of Series K Preferred Stock and any dividend parity stock for the purposes of electing Preferred Stock Directors. The Preferred Stock Directors shall each be entitled to one vote per director on any matter. 
 
 (iii) Notice of Special Meeting . Notice for a special meeting to elect Preferred Stock Directors will be given in a similar manner to that provided in the Company s by-laws for a special meeting of the stockholders. If the secretary of the Company does not call a special meeting within 20 days after receipt of any such request, then any Holder may (at the expense of the Company) call such meeting, upon notice as provided in this Section 7(b)(iii), and for that purpose will have access to the stock register of the Company. The Preferred Stock Directors elected at any such special meeting and each Preferred Stock Director elected at a subsequent annual or special meeting of stockholders, will be elected for term expiring upon the earlier of the Preferred Stock Director Termination Date and the next annual meeting of stockholders following such Preferred Stock Director's election. In case any vacancy in the office of a Preferred Stock Director occurs (other than prior to the initial election of the Preferred Stock Directors), the vacancy may be filled by the Preferred Stock Director remaining in office, or if none remains in office, by a plurality of the votes cast by the holders of Series K Preferred Stock and any dividend parity stock, voting together as a single class, and the Preferred Stock Director so appointed or elected to fill such vacancy shall serve for a term expiring at the next annual meeting of the stockholders. Preferred Stock Directors may only be elected by the holders of Series K Preferred Stock and dividend parity stock in accordance with this Section 7. If the holders of Series K Preferred Stock and such dividend parity stock fail to elect a sufficient number of directors to fill all directorships for which they are entitled to elect directors pursuant to this Section 7, then any 

directorship not so filled shall remain vacant until such time as the holders of Series K Preferred Stock and such dividend parity stock elect a person to fill such directorship in accordance with this Section 7, or such vacancy is otherwise filled in accordance with this Section 7 and no such directorship may be filled by stockholders of the Corporation other than in accordance with this Section 7. 
 
 (iv) Termination Removal . Whenever the Company has paid noncumulative dividends in full for at least two consecutive semi-annual or four consecutive quarterly Dividend Periods following a Nonpayment on the Series K Preferred Stock and on any dividend parity stock entitled to noncumulative dividends and has paid cumulative dividends in full on any dividend parity stock entitled to cumulative dividends, then the right of the Holders to elect the Preferred Stock Directors will cease (but subject always to the same provisions for the vesting of the special voting rights in the case of any similar non-payment of dividends in respect of future Dividend Periods) (the time of such cessation, the Preferred Stock Director Termination Date ). Upon a Preferred Stock Director Termination Date, the terms of office of the Preferred Stock Directors will immediately terminate, the persons then serving as Preferred Stock Directors shall immediately cease to be qualified to hold office as Preferred Stock Directors, the Preferred Stock Directors shall cease to be directors of the Company and the number of directors constituting the Board of Directors shall be automatically reduced, without any action by the Board of Directors or the stockholders of the Company, by the number of Preferred Stock Directors authorized immediately prior to such termination. Any Preferred Stock Director may be removed at any time without cause by the holders of a majority of the voting power of outstanding shares of the capital stock then entitled to vote in the election of Preferred Stock Directors, voting together as a single class (with such voting power measured based on the voting power to elect Preferred Stock Directors). 
 (c) Senior Issuances Adverse Changes . So long as any shares of Series K Preferred Stock are outstanding, but subject to the final paragraph of this Section 7(c), in addition to any other vote or consent of holders of the Company s capital stock required by Delaware law, the vote or consent of the holders of at least two-thirds of the voting power of the Series K Preferred Stock and the holders of any other preferred stock entitled to vote thereon, voting together as a single class, given in person or by proxy at an annual or special meeting of stockholders, or given in writing without a meeting, will be necessary for effecting or validating any of the following actions, whether or not such approval is required by Delaware law 
 
 (i) any amendment, alteration or repeal of any provision of the Company s certificate of incorporation (including the certificate of designations creating the Series K Preferred Stock) or the Company s by-laws that would alter or change the voting powers, preferences, economic rights or special rights of the Series K Preferred Stock so as to affect them adversely 
 
 (ii) any amendment or alteration of the Company s certificate of incorporation to authorize or create, or increase the authorized amount of, any shares of, or any securities

 (iii) the consummation of a binding share exchange or reclassification involving the Series K Preferred Stock or a merger or consolidation of the Company with another entity, except that holders of Series K Preferred Stock will have no right to vote under this provision or otherwise under Delaware law if in each case (i) the Series K Preferred Stock remains outstanding or, in the case of any such merger or consolidation with respect to which the Company is not the surviving or resulting entity, is converted into or exchanged for preferred securities of the surviving or resulting entity or its ultimate parent, that is an entity organized and existing under the laws of the United States of America, any state thereof or the District of Columbia and that is a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes (or if such entity is not a corporation, the Company having received an opinion of nationally recognized counsel experienced in such matters to the effect that Holders will be subject to tax for U.S. federal income tax purposes with respect to such new preferred securities after such merger or consolidation in the same amount, at the same time and otherwise in the same manner as would have been the case under the Series K Preferred Stock prior to such merger or consolidation), and (ii) such Series K Preferred Stock remaining outstanding or such preferred securities, as the case may be, have such rights, preferences, privileges and voting powers, taken as a whole, as are not materially less favorable to the holders thereof than the rights, preferences, privileges and voting powers of the Series K Preferred Stock, taken as a whole 
 provided, however , that, for the avoidance of doubt, any increase in the amount of the authorized or issued Series K Preferred Stock or authorized preferred stock or any securities convertible into preferred stock or the creation and issuance, or an increase in the authorized or issued amount, of other series of preferred stock or any securities convertible into preferred stock ranking equally with and or junior to the Series K Preferred Stock with respect to the payment of dividends (whether such dividends are cumulative or noncumulative) and or the distribution of assets upon the Company s liquidation, dissolution or winding up will not be deemed to adversely affect the voting powers, preferences or special rights of the Series K Preferred Stock, and no stockholder will have the right to vote on such an increase, creation or issuance by reason of this Section 7. 
 If any amendment, alteration, repeal, share exchange, reclassification, merger or consolidation specified in this Section 7(c) would adversely affect the Series K Preferred Stock but not all series of preferred stock of the Company, then only such series of preferred stock as are adversely affected by and entitled to vote on the matter shall vote on the matter together with the Series K Preferred Stock as a single class (in lieu of all other series of preferred stock) for purposes of the vote or consent required by this Section 7(c). 
 (d) No Vote if Redemption . No vote or consent of the Holders shall be required pursuant to Section 7(b) or 7(c) if, at or prior to the time when the act with respect to such vote or consent would otherwise be required shall be effected, the Company shall have redeemed or 

shall have called for redemption all outstanding shares of Series K Preferred Stock, with proper notice and sufficient funds having been set aside for such redemption, in each case pursuant to Section 6 above. 

Section 8. Preemption and Conversion Rights . 
 
 The Holders shall not have any preemptive rights or conversion rights as a result of the terms hereof.

 Section 10. Reacquired Shares .

 Section 13. Replacement Certificates for Mutilated, Destroyed, Stolen and Lost Certificates . 

If physical certificates are issued, the Company shall replace any mutilated certificate at the Holder s expense upon surrender of that certificate to the Transfer Agent.

 The restrictions set forth in the preceding provisions of this Section 4(c) shall not apply to any Junior Stock dividends paid by the Company where the dividend is in the form of the same stock (or the right to buy the same stock) as that on which the dividend is being paid. 
 Except as provided below, for so long as any share of Series M Preferred Stock remains outstanding, if dividends are not declared and paid in full upon the shares of Series M Preferred Stock and any class or series of stock of the Company now existing or hereafter authorized that ranks equally with the Series M Preferred Stock in the payment of dividends, all dividends declared upon shares of Series M Preferred Stock and such other stock will be declared on a proportional basis so that the amount of dividends declared per share will bear to each other the same ratio that accrued dividends for the then-current Dividend Period per share of Series M Preferred Stock and accrued dividends for the then-current Dividend Period per share of such other stock (including, in the case of any such other stock that bears cumulative dividends, all accrued and unpaid dividends) bear to each other. 

Subject to the foregoing, and not otherwise, such dividends payable in cash, stock or otherwise, as may be determined by the Board of Directors or any duly authorized committee thereof, may be declared and paid on any other class or series of stock of the Company from time to time out of any funds legally available for such payment, and Holders will not be entitled to participate in those dividends.

 (c) Merger, Consolidation and Sale of Assets Not Liquidation . For purposes of this Section 5, the sale, conveyance, exchange or transfer (for cash, shares of stock, securities or other consideration) of all or substantially all of the property and assets of the Company shall not be deemed a voluntary or involuntary dissolution, liquidation or winding up of the affairs of the Company, nor shall the merger, consolidation or any other business combination transaction of the Company into or with any other corporation or Person or the merger, consolidation or any other business combination transaction of any other corporation or Person into or with the Company be deemed to be a voluntary or involuntary dissolution, liquidation or winding up of the affairs of the Company.

Directors or any duly authorized committee thereof may determine, in its sole discretion, to be fair and equitable provided, however, that if for so long as the Series M Preferred Stock or depositary shares in respect thereof are listed on the New York Stock Exchange, the foregoing clause (iii) shall apply only if such method of selection is not then prohibited by any then applicable rule of the New York Stock Exchange or the New York Stock Exchange consents to or grants a waiver or exemption from such rule. Subject to the provisions of this Section 6, the Board of Directors or any duly authorized committee thereof shall have full power and authority to prescribe the terms and conditions upon which shares of Series M Preferred Stock shall be redeemed from time to time. 
 
 (d) Effectiveness of Redemption .

Section 7. Voting Rights . 
 
 (a) General . The Holders shall not be entitled to vote on any matter except as set forth in Section 7(b) below or as required by the Delaware General Corporation Law. 
 
 (b) Special Voting Right . 
 
 (i) Voting Right . If and whenever dividends on the Series M Preferred Stock or any other class or series of preferred stock that ranks on parity with Series M Preferred Stock as to payment of dividends and upon which voting rights equivalent to those granted by this Section 7(b)(i) have been conferred and are exercisable (any such class or series being referred to herein as dividend parity stock have not been paid in an 

aggregate amount equal, as to any class or series, to at least three semi-annual or six quarterly Dividend Periods, as applicable, (whether consecutive or not) (a Nonpayment ), the authorized number of directors constituting the Board of Directors shall be increased by two, and the Holders, together with holders of dividend parity stock, shall have the right, voting separately as a single class without regard to class or series (and with voting rights allocated pro rata based on the liquidation preference of each such class or series), to the exclusion of the holders of Common Stock, to elect two directors of the Company to fill such newly created directorships (and to fill any vacancies in the terms of such directorships), provided that it shall be a qualification for election of any such director that the election of such director shall not cause the Company to violate the corporate governance requirements of the New York Stock Exchange (or other exchange on which the Company s securities may be listed) that listed companies must have a majority of independent directors and further provided that the Board of Directors shall at no time include more than two such directors. Each such director elected by the Holders together with holders of dividend parity stock is a Preferred Stock Director . 
 
 (ii) Election . The election of the Preferred Stock Directors will take place at any annual meeting of stockholders or any special meeting of the Holders and any dividend parity stock, called as provided herein. At any time after the special voting power has vested pursuant to Section 7(b)(i) above, the secretary of the Company may, and upon the written request (addressed to the secretary at the Company s principal office) of the holders of at least 20 of the voting power of the Series M Preferred Stock or the holders of at least 20 of the voting power of any series of dividend parity stock (with such voting power measured based on the voting power to elect Preferred Stock Directors), must (unless such request is received less than 90 days before the date fixed for the next annual or special meeting of the stockholders at which Preferred Stock Directors are to be elected, in which event such election shall be held at such next annual or special meeting of stockholders), call a special meeting of the holders of Series M Preferred Stock and any dividend parity stock for the purposes of electing Preferred Stock Directors. The Preferred Stock Directors shall each be entitled to one vote per director on any matter. 
 
 (iii) Notice of Special Meeting . Notice for a special meeting to elect Preferred Stock Directors will be given in a similar manner to that provided in the Company s by-laws for a special meeting of the stockholders. If the secretary of the Company does not call a special meeting within 20 days after receipt of any such request, then any Holder may (at the expense of the Company) call such meeting, upon notice as provided in this Section 7(b)(iii), and for that purpose will have access to the stock register of the Company. The Preferred Stock Directors elected at any such special meeting and each Preferred Stock Director elected at a subsequent annual or special meeting of stockholders, will be elected for term expiring upon the earlier of the Preferred Stock Director Termination Date and the next annual meeting of stockholders following such Preferred Stock Director's election. In case any vacancy in the office of a Preferred Stock Director occurs (other than prior to the initial election of the Preferred Stock Directors), the vacancy may be filled by the Preferred Stock Director remaining in office, or if none remains in office, by a plurality of the votes cast by the holders of Series M Preferred 

Stock and any dividend parity stock, voting together as a single class, and the Preferred Stock Director so appointed or elected to fill such vacancy shall serve for a term expiring at the next annual meeting of the stockholders. Preferred Stock Directors may only be elected by the holders of Series M Preferred Stock and dividend parity stock in accordance with this Section 7. If the holders of Series M Preferred Stock and such dividend parity stock fail to elect a sufficient number of directors to fill all directorships for which they are entitled to elect directors pursuant to this Section 7, then any directorship not so filled shall remain vacant until such time as the holders of Series M Preferred Stock and such dividend parity stock elect a person to fill such directorship in accordance with this Section 7, or such vacancy is otherwise filled in accordance with this Section 7 and no such directorship may be filled by stockholders of the Corporation other than in accordance with this Section 7. 
 
 (iv) Termination Removal . Whenever the Company has paid noncumulative dividends in full for at least two consecutive semi-annual or four consecutive quarterly Dividend Periods following a Nonpayment on the Series M Preferred Stock and on any dividend parity stock entitled to noncumulative dividends and has paid cumulative dividends in full on any dividend parity stock entitled to cumulative dividends, then the right of the Holders to elect the Preferred Stock Directors will cease (but subject always to the same provisions for the vesting of the special voting rights in the case of any similar non-payment of dividends in respect of future Dividend Periods) (the time of such cessation, the Preferred Stock Director Termination Date ). Upon a Preferred Stock Director Termination Date, the terms of office of the Preferred Stock Directors will immediately terminate, the persons then serving as Preferred Stock Directors shall immediately cease to be qualified to hold office as Preferred Stock Directors, the Preferred Stock Directors shall cease to be directors of the Company and the number of directors constituting the Board of Directors shall be automatically reduced, without any action by the Board of Directors or the stockholders of the Company, by the number of Preferred Stock Directors authorized immediately prior to such termination. Any Preferred Stock Director may be removed at any time without cause by the holders of a majority of the voting power of outstanding shares of the capital stock then entitled to vote in the election of Preferred Stock Directors, voting together as a single class (with such voting power measured based on the voting power to elect Preferred Stock Directors).

 If any amendment, alteration, repeal, share exchange, reclassification, merger or consolidation specified in this Section 7(c) would adversely affect the Series M Preferred Stock 

but not all series of preferred stock of the Company, then only such series of preferred stock as are adversely affected by and entitled to vote on the matter shall vote on the matter together with the Series M Preferred Stock as a single class (in lieu of all other series of preferred stock) for purposes of the vote or consent required by this Section 7(c).

 (c) Merger, Consolidation and Sale of Assets Not Liquidation . For purposes of this Section 5, the sale, conveyance, exchange or transfer (for cash, shares of stock, securities or other consideration) of all or substantially all of the property and assets of the Company shall not be deemed a voluntary or involuntary dissolution, liquidation or winding up of the affairs of the Company, nor shall the merger, consolidation or any other business combination transaction of the Company into or with any other corporation or Person or the merger, consolidation or any other business combination transaction of any other corporation or Person into or with the Company be deemed to be a voluntary or involuntary dissolution, liquidation or winding up of the affairs of the Company.

The Preferred Stock Directors elected at any such special meeting and each Preferred Stock Director elected at a subsequent annual or special meeting of stockholders, will be elected for term expiring upon the earlier of the Preferred Stock Director Termination Date and the next annual meeting of stockholders following such Preferred Stock Director's election. In case any vacancy in the office of a Preferred Stock Director occurs (other than prior to the initial election of the Preferred Stock Directors), the vacancy may be filled by the Preferred Stock Director remaining in office, or if none remains in office, by a plurality of the votes cast by the holders of Series N Preferred Stock and any dividend parity stock, voting together as a single class, and the Preferred Stock Director so appointed or elected to fill such vacancy shall serve for a term expiring at the next annual meeting of the stockholders.

Dividend Periods following a Nonpayment on the Series N Preferred Stock and on any dividend parity stock entitled to noncumulative dividends and has paid cumulative dividends in full on any dividend parity stock entitled to cumulative dividends, then the right of the Holders to elect the Preferred Stock Directors will cease (but subject always to the same provisions for the vesting of the special voting rights in the case of any similar non-payment of dividends in respect of future Dividend Periods) (the time of such cessation, the Preferred Stock Director Termination Date ). Upon a Preferred Stock Director Termination Date, the terms of office of the Preferred Stock Directors will immediately terminate, the persons then serving as Preferred Stock Directors shall immediately cease to be qualified to hold office as Preferred Stock Directors, the Preferred Stock Directors shall cease to be directors of the Company and the number of directors constituting the Board of Directors shall be automatically reduced, without any action by the Board of Directors or the stockholders of the Company, by the number of Preferred Stock Directors authorized immediately prior to such termination. Any Preferred Stock Director may be removed at any time without cause by the holders of a majority of the voting power of outstanding shares of the capital stock then entitled to vote in the election of Preferred Stock Directors, voting together as a single class (with such voting power measured based on the voting power to elect Preferred Stock Directors).

 If any amendment, alteration, repeal, share exchange, reclassification, merger or consolidation specified in this Section 7(c) would adversely affect the Series N Preferred Stock but not all series of preferred stock of the Company, then only such series of preferred stock as are adversely affected by and entitled to vote on the matter shall vote on the matter together with the Series N Preferred Stock as a single class (in lieu of all other series of preferred stock) for purposes of the vote or consent required by this Section 7(c). 
 (d) No Vote if Redemption .

Any notice mailed as provided in this Section 6(b) shall be conclusively presumed to have been duly given, whether or not the Holder receives such notice, but failure duly to give such notice by mail, or any defect in such notice or in the mailing thereof, to any Holder of shares of Series O Preferred Stock designated for redemption shall not affect the validity of the proceedings for the redemption of any other shares of Series O Preferred Stock.

 (iii) the redemption price 
 
 (iv) the place or places where the certificates for such shares are to be surrendered for payment of the redemption price, if applicable and 
 
 (v) that dividends on the shares to be redeemed will cease to accrue on the redemption date. 
 
 Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the certificates evidencing the shares of Series O Preferred Stock are held of record by a depositary and any related depository shares are held of record by a Depositary or its nominee, the Company may give such notice in any manner permitted by the Depositary. 
 
 (c) Partial Redemption . In case of any redemption of only part of the shares of Series O Preferred Stock at the time outstanding, the shares of Series O Preferred Stock to be redeemed shall be selected (i) pro rata from the Holders in proportion to the number of shares of Series O Preferred Stock held by such Holders, (ii) by lot or (iii) in such other manner as the Board of Directors or any duly authorized committee thereof may determine, in its sole discretion, to be fair and equitable provided, however, that if for so long as the Series O Preferred Stock or depositary shares in respect thereof are listed on the New York Stock Exchange, the foregoing clause (iii) shall apply only if such method of selection is not then prohibited by any then applicable rule of the New York Stock Exchange or the New York Stock Exchange consents to or grants a waiver or exemption from such rule. Subject to the provisions of this Section 6, the Board of Directors or any duly authorized committee thereof shall have full power and authority to prescribe the terms and conditions upon which shares of Series O Preferred Stock shall be redeemed from time to time. 
 
 (d) Effectiveness of Redemption . If notice of redemption has been duly given and if on or before the redemption date specified in the notice all funds necessary for the redemption have been set aside by the Company, separate and apart from its other assets, for the pro rata benefit of the Holders of the shares called for redemption, so as to be and continue to be available therefor, 

or deposited by the Company with a bank or trust company selected by the Board of Directors or any duly authorized committee thereof (the Trust in trust for the pro rata benefit of the Holders of the shares called for redemption, then, notwithstanding that any certificate for any share so called for redemption has not been surrendered for cancellation, on and after the redemption date all shares so called for redemption shall cease to be outstanding, all dividends with respect to such shares shall cease to accrue on such redemption date, and all rights with respect to such shares shall forthwith on such redemption date cease and terminate, except only the right of the Holders thereof to receive the amount payable on such redemption from the Trust at any time after the redemption date from the funds so deposited, without interest. The Company shall be entitled to receive, from time to time, from the Trust any interest accrued on such funds, and the Holders of any shares called for redemption shall have no claim to any such interest. Any funds so deposited and unclaimed at the end of three years from the redemption date shall, to the extent permitted by law, be released or repaid to the Company, and in the event of such repayment to the Company, the Holders of the shares so called for redemption shall be deemed to be unsecured creditors of the Company for an amount equivalent to the amount deposited as stated above for the redemption of such shares and so repaid to the Company, but shall in no event be entitled to any interest. 

Section 7. Voting Rights . 
 
 (a) General . The Holders shall not be entitled to vote on any matter except as set forth in Section 7(b) below or as required by the Delaware General Corporation Law. 
 
 (b) Special Voting Right . 
 
 (i) Voting Right . If and whenever dividends on the Series O Preferred Stock or any other class or series of preferred stock that ranks on parity with Series O Preferred Stock as to payment of dividends and upon which voting rights equivalent to those granted by this Section 7(b)(i) have been conferred and are exercisable (any such class or series being referred to herein as dividend parity stock have not been paid in an aggregate amount equal, as to any class or series, to at least three semi-annual or six quarterly Dividend Periods, as applicable, (whether consecutive or not) (a Nonpayment ), the authorized number of directors constituting the Board of Directors shall be increased by two, and the Holders, together with holders of dividend parity stock, shall have the right, voting separately as a single class without regard to class or series (and with voting rights allocated pro rata based on the liquidation preference of each such class or series), to the exclusion of the holders of Common Stock, to elect two directors of the Company to fill such newly created directorships (and to fill any vacancies in the terms of such directorships), provided that it shall be a qualification for election of any such director that the election of such director shall not cause the Company to violate the corporate governance requirements of the New York Stock Exchange (or other exchange on which the Company s securities may be listed) that listed companies must have a majority of independent directors and further provided that the Board of Directors shall at no time include more than two such directors. Each such director elected by the Holders together with holders of dividend parity stock is a Preferred Stock Director . 

(ii) Election . The election of the Preferred Stock Directors will take place at any annual meeting of stockholders or any special meeting of the Holders and any dividend parity stock, called as provided herein. At any time after the special voting power has vested pursuant to Section 7(b)(i) above, the secretary of the Company may, and upon the written request (addressed to the secretary at the Company s principal office) of the holders of at least 20 of the voting power of the Series O Preferred Stock or the holders of at least 20 of the voting power of any series of dividend parity stock (with such voting power measured based on the voting power to elect Preferred Stock Directors), must (unless such request is received less than 90 days before the date fixed for the next annual or special meeting of the stockholders of the Company, in which event such election shall be held at such next annual or special meeting of stockholders), call a special meeting of the holders of Series O Preferred Stock and any dividend parity stock for the purposes of electing Preferred Stock Directors. The Preferred Stock Directors shall each be entitled to one vote per director on any matter. 
 
 (iii) Notice of Special Meeting . Notice for a special meeting to elect Preferred Stock Directors will be given in a similar manner to that provided in the Company s by-laws for a special meeting of the stockholders. If the secretary of the Company does not call a special meeting within 20 days after receipt of any such request, then any Holder may (at the expense of the Company) call such meeting, upon notice as provided in this Section 7(b)(iii), and for that purpose will have access to the stock register of the Company. The Preferred Stock Directors elected at any such special meeting and each Preferred Stock Director elected at a subsequent annual or special meeting of stockholders, will be elected for term expiring upon the earlier of the Preferred Stock Director Termination Date and the next annual meeting of stockholders following such Preferred Stock Director's election. In case any vacancy in the office of a Preferred Stock Director occurs (other than prior to the initial election of the Preferred Stock Directors), the vacancy may be filled by the Preferred Stock Director remaining in office, or if none remains in office, by a plurality of the votes cast by the holders of Series O Preferred Stock and any dividend parity stock, voting together as a single class, and the Preferred Stock Director so appointed or elected to fill such vacancy shall serve for a term expiring at the next annual meeting of the stockholders. Preferred Stock Directors may only be elected by the holders of Series O Preferred Stock and dividend parity stock in accordance with this Section 7. If the holders of Series O Preferred Stock and such dividend parity stock fail to elect a sufficient number of directors to fill all directorships for which they are entitled to elect directors pursuant to this Section 7, then any directorship not so filled shall remain vacant until such time as the holders of Series O Preferred Stock and such dividend parity stock elect a person to fill such directorship in accordance with this Section 7, or such vacancy is otherwise filled in accordance with this Section 7 and no such directorship may be filled by stockholders of the Corporation other than in accordance with this Section 7. 
 
 (iv) Termination Removal . Whenever the Company has paid noncumulative dividends in full for at least two consecutive semi-annual or four consecutive quarterly 

Dividend Periods following a Nonpayment on the Series O Preferred Stock and on any dividend parity stock entitled to noncumulative dividends and has paid cumulative dividends in full on any dividend parity stock entitled to cumulative dividends, then the right of the Holders to elect the Preferred Stock Directors will cease (but subject always to the same provisions for the vesting of the special voting rights in the case of any similar non-payment of dividends in respect of future Dividend Periods) (the time of such cessation, the Preferred Stock Director Termination Date ). Upon a Preferred Stock Director Termination Date, the terms of office of the Preferred Stock Directors will immediately terminate, the persons then serving as Preferred Stock Directors shall immediately cease to be qualified to hold office as Preferred Stock Directors, the Preferred Stock Directors shall cease to be directors of the Company and the number of directors constituting the Board of Directors shall be automatically reduced, without any action by the Board of Directors or the stockholders of the Company, by the number of Preferred Stock Directors authorized immediately prior to such termination. Any Preferred Stock Director may be removed at any time without cause by the holders of a majority of the voting power of outstanding shares of the capital stock then entitled to vote in the election of Preferred Stock Directors, voting together as a single class (with such voting power measured based on the voting power to elect Preferred Stock Directors). 
 (c) Senior Issuances Adverse Changes . So long as any shares of Series O Preferred Stock are outstanding, but subject to the final paragraph of this Section 7(c), in addition to any other vote or consent of holders of the Company s capital stock required by Delaware law, the vote or consent of the holders of at least two-thirds of the voting power of the Series O Preferred Stock and the holders of any other preferred stock entitled to vote thereon, voting together as a single class, given in person or by proxy at an annual or special meeting of stockholders, or given in writing without a meeting, will be necessary for effecting or validating any of the following actions, whether or not such approval is required by Delaware law

 (iii) the consummation of a binding share exchange or reclassification involving the Series O Preferred Stock or a merger or consolidation of the Company with another entity, except that holders of Series O Preferred Stock will have no right to vote under this provision or otherwise under Delaware law if in each case (i) the Series O Preferred Stock remains outstanding or, in the case of any such merger or consolidation with 

respect to which the Company is not the surviving or resulting entity, is converted into or exchanged for preferred securities of the surviving or resulting entity or its ultimate parent, that is an entity organized and existing under the laws of the United States of America, any state thereof or the District of Columbia and that is a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes (or if such entity is not a corporation, the Company having received an opinion of nationally recognized counsel experienced in such matters to the effect that Holders will be subject to tax for U.S. federal income tax purposes with respect to such new preferred securities after such merger or consolidation in the same amount, at the same time and otherwise in the same manner as would have been the case under the Series O Preferred Stock prior to such merger or consolidation), and (ii) such Series O Preferred Stock remaining outstanding or such preferred securities, as the case may be, have such rights, preferences, privileges and voting powers, taken as a whole, as are not materially less favorable to the holders thereof than the rights, preferences, privileges and voting powers of the Series O Preferred Stock, taken as a whole 
 provided, however , that, for the avoidance of doubt, any increase in the amount of the authorized or issued Series O Preferred Stock or authorized preferred stock or any securities convertible into preferred stock or the creation and issuance, or an increase in the authorized or issued amount, of other series of preferred stock or any securities convertible into preferred stock ranking equally with and or junior to the Series O Preferred Stock with respect to the payment of dividends (whether such dividends are cumulative or noncumulative) and or the distribution of assets upon the Company s liquidation, dissolution or winding up will not be deemed to adversely affect the voting powers, preferences or special rights of the Series O Preferred Stock, and no stockholder will have the right to vote on such an increase, creation or issuance by reason of this Section 7. 
 If any amendment, alteration, repeal, share exchange, reclassification, merger or consolidation specified in this Section 7(c) would adversely affect the Series O Preferred Stock but not all series of preferred stock of the Company, then only such series of preferred stock as are adversely affected by and entitled to vote on the matter shall vote on the matter together with the Series O Preferred Stock as a single class (in lieu of all other series of preferred stock) for purposes of the vote or consent required by this Section 7(c). 
 (d) No Vote if Redemption . No vote or consent of the Holders shall be required pursuant to Section 7(b) or 7(c) if, at or prior to the time when the act with respect to such vote or consent would otherwise be required shall be effected, the Company shall have redeemed or shall have called for redemption all outstanding shares of Series O Preferred Stock, with proper notice and sufficient funds having been set aside for such redemption, in each case pursuant to Section 6 above.

specified below in this Section 4, and no more, payable (i) semiannually in arrears on each May 15 and November 15 (each, a Dividend Payment Date ), beginning November 15, 2015, from and including the date of issuance to, but excluding, May 15, 2025 provided, however, if any such day is not a Business Day, then payment of any dividend otherwise payable on that date will be made on the next succeeding day that is a Business Day, without any interest or other payment in respect of such postponement, and (ii) quarterly in arrears on each February 15, May 15, August 15 and November 15, beginning August 15, 2025, from and including May 15, 2025 provided, however , if any such day is not a Business Day, then payment of any dividend otherwise payable on that date will be made on the next succeeding day that is a Business Day, except if that day falls in the next calendar month, in which case, the payment of any dividend otherwise payable will be made on the immediately preceding Business Day, with dividends accruing to the actual payment date (each such day on which dividends are payable for any Dividend Period (as defined below) after the Dividend Period to but excluding May 15, 2025, a Dividend Payment Date ). The period from and including the date of issuance of the Series P Preferred Stock or any Dividend Payment Date to, but excluding, the next Dividend Payment Date is a Dividend Period . Dividends on each share of Series P Preferred Stock will accrue on the liquidation preference of 25,000 per share at a rate per annum equal to (i) 5.950 , for each Dividend Period from and including the date of issuance to, but excluding, May 15, 2025 and (ii) Three-month LIBOR plus 3.905 , for each Dividend Period from and including May 15, 2025. The record date for payment of dividends on the Series P Preferred Stock will be the record date fixed by the Board of Directors or any other duly authorized committee thereof that is not more than 30 nor less than 10 days prior to such Dividend Payment Date (each, a Dividend Record Date ). Any such day that is a Dividend Record Date will be a Dividend Record Date whether or not such day is a Business Day. The amount of dividends payable on or prior to May 15, 2025 will be computed on the basis of a 360-day year of twelve 30-day months. The amount of dividends payable after May 15, 2025 will be computed on the basis of a 360-day year and the actual number of days elapsed. 
 (b) Noncumulative Dividends . If the Board of Directors or any duly authorized committee thereof does not declare a dividend on the Series P Preferred Stock for any Dividend Period prior to the related Dividend Payment Date, that dividend will not accrue, and the Company will have no obligation to pay, and Holders shall have no right to receive, a dividend for that Dividend Period on the related Dividend Payment Date or at any future time, whether or not dividends on the Series P Preferred Stock or any other series of preferred stock or common stock are declared for any subsequent period. References herein to the accrual of dividends refer only to the determination of the amount of such dividend and do not imply that any right to a dividend arises prior to the date on which a dividend is declared. 
 
 (c) Priority of Dividends . So long as any share of Series P Preferred Stock remains outstanding, unless as to a Dividend Payment Date full dividends on all outstanding shares of the Series P Preferred Stock have been declared and paid or declared and a sum sufficient for the payment of those dividends has been set aside for the Dividend Period then ending, the Company will not, and will cause its subsidiaries not to, during the next succeeding Dividend Period that commences on such Dividend Payment Date, declare or pay any dividend on, make any 

distributions relating to, or redeem, purchase, acquire or make a liquidation payment relating to, any Junior Stock, or make any guarantee payment with respect thereto, other than 
 (i) purchases, redemptions or other acquisitions of shares of Junior Stock in connection with any employment contract, benefit plan or other similar arrangement with or for the benefit of employees, officers, directors or consultants 
 
 (ii) purchases of shares of Common Stock pursuant to a contractually binding requirement to buy stock existing prior to the commencement of the then-current Dividend Period, including under a contractually binding stock repurchase plan 
 
 (iii) as a result of an exchange or conversion of any class or series of Junior Stock for any other class or series of Junior Stock 
 
 (iv) the purchase of fractional interests in shares of Junior Stock pursuant to the conversion or exchange provisions of such Junior Stock or the security being converted or exchanged 
 
 (v) the purchase of Junior Stock by an investment banking subsidiary of the Company in connection with the distribution thereof or 
 
 (vi) the purchase of Junior Stock by any investment banking subsidiary of the Company in connection with market-making or other secondary market activities in the ordinary course of the business of such subsidiary. 
 
 The restrictions set forth in the preceding provisions of this Section 4(c) shall not apply to any Junior Stock dividends paid by the Company where the dividend is in the form of the same stock (or the right to buy the same stock) as that on which the dividend is being paid. 
 Except as provided below, for so long as any share of Series P Preferred Stock remains outstanding, if dividends are not declared and paid in full upon the shares of Series P Preferred Stock and any class or series of stock of the Company now existing or hereafter authorized that ranks equally with the Series P Preferred Stock in the payment of dividends, all dividends declared upon shares of Series P Preferred Stock and such other stock will be declared on a proportional basis so that the amount of dividends declared per share will bear to each other the same ratio that accrued dividends for the then-current Dividend Period per share of Series P Preferred Stock and accrued dividends for the then-current Dividend Period per share of such other stock (including, in the case of any such other stock that bears cumulative dividends, all accrued and unpaid dividends) bear to each other. 
 Subject to the foregoing, and not otherwise, such dividends payable in cash, stock or otherwise, as may be determined by the Board of Directors or any duly authorized committee thereof, may be declared and paid on any other class or series of stock of the Company from time to time out of any funds legally available for such payment, and Holders will not be entitled to participate in those dividends. 
 Section 5. Liquidation Rights . 

(a) Liquidation . In the event of any voluntary or involuntary liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the affairs of the Company, Holders shall be entitled, out of funds legally available therefor, before any distribution or payment may be made by the Company or set aside for the holders of any Junior Stock and subject to the rights of the holders of any class or series of stock ranking senior to or on parity with Series P Preferred Stock upon liquidation and the rights of the Company s depositors and other creditors, to receive in full a liquidating distribution in the amount of the liquidation preference of 25,000 per share (the Series P Liquidation Preference ), plus any accrued dividends thereon from the last Dividend Payment Date to, but excluding, the date of the liquidation, dissolution or winding up if and to the extent declared but not yet paid. Holders shall not be entitled to any further payments in the event of any such voluntary or involuntary liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the affairs of the Company other than what is expressly provided for in this Section 5. 
 (b) Partial Payment . If the assets of the Company are not sufficient to pay in full the aforesaid liquidation distributions to the Holders and any liquidation distributions owed to holders of any class or series of stock of the Company ranking equally with the Series P Preferred Stock in the distribution of assets on any voluntary or involuntary liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Company, the amounts paid to the Holders and to the holders of all such equally ranking stock shall be pro rata in accordance with the respective aggregate liquidating distributions to which they would otherwise be entitled. 
 
 (c) Merger, Consolidation and Sale of Assets Not Liquidation . For purposes of this Section 5, the sale, conveyance, exchange or transfer (for cash, shares of stock, securities or other consideration) of all or substantially all of the property and assets of the Company shall not be deemed a voluntary or involuntary dissolution, liquidation or winding up of the affairs of the Company, nor shall the merger, consolidation or any other business combination transaction of the Company into or with any other corporation or Person or the merger, consolidation or any other business combination transaction of any other corporation or Person into or with the Company be deemed to be a voluntary or involuntary dissolution, liquidation or winding up of the affairs of the Company. 

Section 6. Redemption . 
 
 (a) Optional Redemption . The Company, at the option of its Board of Directors or any duly authorized committee thereof, may redeem out of funds legally available therefor, (i) in whole or in part, from time to time, the shares of Series P Preferred Stock at the time outstanding, on any Dividend Payment Date on or after May 15, 2025, or (ii) in whole but not in part at any time within 90 days following a Regulatory Capital Event, in each case at a redemption price equal to 25,000 per share plus any declared and unpaid dividends, without accumulation of any undeclared dividends, to but excluding the redemption date, upon notice given as provided in Section 6(b) below. 
 
 (b) Notice of Redemption . Notice of every redemption of shares of Series P Preferred Stock shall be mailed by first class mail, postage prepaid, addressed to the Holders of such shares 

to be redeemed at their respective last addresses appearing on the stock register of the Company. Such mailing shall be at least 30 days and not more than 60 days before the date fixed for redemption. Any notice mailed as provided in this Section 6(b) shall be conclusively presumed to have been duly given, whether or not the Holder receives such notice, but failure duly to give such notice by mail, or any defect in such notice or in the mailing thereof, to any Holder of shares of Series P Preferred Stock designated for redemption shall not affect the validity of the proceedings for the redemption of any other shares of Series P Preferred Stock. Each notice shall state 
 
 (i) the redemption date 
 
 (ii) the total number of shares of Series P Preferred Stock to be redeemed and, if fewer than all the shares of a Holder are to be redeemed, the number of such shares to be redeemed 
 
 (iii) the redemption price 
 
 (iv) the place or places where the certificates for such shares are to be surrendered for payment of the redemption price, if applicable and 
 
 (v) that dividends on the shares to be redeemed will cease to accrue on the redemption date. 
 
 Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the certificates evidencing the shares of Series P Preferred Stock are held of record by a depositary and any related depository shares are held of record by a Depositary or its nominee, the Company may give such notice in any manner permitted by the Depositary. 
 
 (c) Partial Redemption . In case of any redemption of only part of the shares of Series P Preferred Stock at the time outstanding, the shares of Series P Preferred Stock to be redeemed shall be selected (i) pro rata from the Holders in proportion to the number of shares of Series P Preferred Stock held by such Holders, (ii) by lot or (iii) in such other manner as the Board of Directors or any duly authorized committee thereof may determine, in its sole discretion, to be fair and equitable provided, however, that if for so long as the Series P Preferred Stock or depositary shares in respect thereof are listed on the New York Stock Exchange, the foregoing clause (iii) shall apply only if such method of selection is not then prohibited by any then applicable rule of the New York Stock Exchange or the New York Stock Exchange consents to or grants a waiver or exemption from such rule. Subject to the provisions of this Section 6, the Board of Directors or any duly authorized committee thereof shall have full power and authority to prescribe the terms and conditions upon which shares of Series P Preferred Stock shall be redeemed from time to time. 
 
 (d) Effectiveness of Redemption . If notice of redemption has been duly given and if on or before the redemption date specified in the notice all funds necessary for the redemption have been set aside by the Company, separate and apart from its other assets, for the pro rata benefit of the Holders of the shares called for redemption, so as to be and continue to be available therefor, 

or deposited by the Company with a bank or trust company selected by the Board of Directors or any duly authorized committee thereof (the Trust in trust for the pro rata benefit of the Holders of the shares called for redemption, then, notwithstanding that any certificate for any share so called for redemption has not been surrendered for cancellation, on and after the redemption date all shares so called for redemption shall cease to be outstanding, all dividends with respect to such shares shall cease to accrue on such redemption date, and all rights with respect to such shares shall forthwith on such redemption date cease and terminate, except only the right of the Holders thereof to receive the amount payable on such redemption from the Trust at any time after the redemption date from the funds so deposited, without interest. The Company shall be entitled to receive, from time to time, from the Trust any interest accrued on such funds, and the Holders of any shares called for redemption shall have no claim to any such interest. Any funds so deposited and unclaimed at the end of three years from the redemption date shall, to the extent permitted by law, be released or repaid to the Company, and in the event of such repayment to the Company, the Holders of the shares so called for redemption shall be deemed to be unsecured creditors of the Company for an amount equivalent to the amount deposited as stated above for the redemption of such shares and so repaid to the Company, but shall in no event be entitled to any interest. 

Section 7. Voting Rights . 
 
 (a) General . The Holders shall not be entitled to vote on any matter except as set forth in Section 7(b) below or as required by the Delaware General Corporation Law. 
 
 (b) Special Voting Right . 
 
 (i) Voting Right . If and whenever dividends on the Series P Preferred Stock or any other class or series of preferred stock that ranks on parity with Series P Preferred Stock as to payment of dividends and upon which voting rights equivalent to those granted by this Section 7(b)(i) have been conferred and are exercisable (any such class or series being referred to herein as dividend parity stock have not been paid in an aggregate amount equal, as to any class or series, to at least three semi-annual or six quarterly Dividend Periods, as applicable, (whether consecutive or not) (a Nonpayment ), the authorized number of directors constituting the Board of Directors shall be increased by two, and the Holders, together with holders of dividend parity stock, shall have the right, voting separately as a single class without regard to class or series (and with voting rights allocated pro rata based on the liquidation preference of each such class or series), to the exclusion of the holders of Common Stock, to elect two directors of the Company to fill such newly created directorships (and to fill any vacancies in the terms of such directorships), provided that it shall be a qualification for election of any such director that the election of such director shall not cause the Company to violate the corporate governance requirements of the New York Stock Exchange (or other exchange on which the Company s securities may be listed) that listed companies must have a majority of independent directors and further provided that the Board of Directors shall at no time include more than two such directors. Each such director elected by the Holders together with holders of dividend parity stock is a Preferred Stock Director . 

(ii) Election . The election of the Preferred Stock Directors will take place at any annual meeting of stockholders or any special meeting of the Holders and any dividend parity stock, called as provided herein. At any time after the special voting power has vested pursuant to Section 7(b)(i) above, the secretary of the Company may, and upon the written request (addressed to the secretary at the Company s principal office) of the holders of at least 20 of the voting power of the Series P Preferred Stock or the holders of at least 20 of the voting power of any series of dividend parity stock (with such voting power measured based on the voting power to elect Preferred Stock Directors), must (unless such request is received less than 90 days before the date fixed for the next annual or special meeting of the stockholders of the Company, in which event such election shall be held at such next annual or special meeting of stockholders), call a special meeting of the holders of Series P Preferred Stock and any dividend parity stock for the purposes of electing Preferred Stock Directors. The Preferred Stock Directors shall each be entitled to one vote per director on any matter. 
 
 (iii) Notice of Special Meeting . Notice for a special meeting to elect Preferred Stock Directors will be given in a similar manner to that provided in the Company s by-laws for a special meeting of the stockholders. If the secretary of the Company does not call a special meeting within 20 days after receipt of any such request, then any Holder may (at the expense of the Company) call such meeting, upon notice as provided in this Section 7(b)(iii), and for that purpose will have access to the stock register of the Company. The Preferred Stock Directors elected at any such special meeting and each Preferred Stock Director elected at a subsequent annual or special meeting of stockholders, will be elected for term expiring upon the earlier of the Preferred Stock Director Termination Date and the next annual meeting of stockholders following such Preferred Stock Director's election. In case any vacancy in the office of a Preferred Stock Director occurs (other than prior to the initial election of the Preferred Stock Directors), the vacancy may be filled by the Preferred Stock Director remaining in office, or if none remains in office, by a plurality of the votes cast by the holders of Series P Preferred Stock and any dividend parity stock, voting together as a single class, and the Preferred Stock Director so appointed or elected to fill such vacancy shall serve for a term expiring at the next annual meeting of the stockholders. Preferred Stock Directors may only be elected by the holders of Series P Preferred Stock and dividend parity stock in accordance with this Section 7. If the holders of Series P Preferred Stock and such dividend parity stock fail to elect a sufficient number of directors to fill all directorships for which they are entitled to elect directors pursuant to this Section 7, then any directorship not so filled shall remain vacant until such time as the holders of Series P Preferred Stock and such dividend parity stock elect a person to fill such directorship in accordance with this Section 7, or such vacancy is otherwise filled in accordance with this Section 7 and no such directorship may be filled by stockholders of the Corporation other than in accordance with this Section 7. 
 
 (iv) Termination Removal . Whenever the Company has paid noncumulative dividends in full for at least two consecutive semi-annual or four consecutive quarterly 

Dividend Periods following a Nonpayment on the Series P Preferred Stock and on any dividend parity stock entitled to noncumulative dividends and has paid cumulative dividends in full on any dividend parity stock entitled to cumulative dividends, then the right of the Holders to elect the Preferred Stock Directors will cease (but subject always to the same provisions for the vesting of the special voting rights in the case of any similar non-payment of dividends in respect of future Dividend Periods) (the time of such cessation, the Preferred Stock Director Termination Date ). Upon a Preferred Stock Director Termination Date, the terms of office of the Preferred Stock Directors will immediately terminate, the persons then serving as Preferred Stock Directors shall immediately cease to be qualified to hold office as Preferred Stock Directors, the Preferred Stock Directors shall cease to be directors of the Company and the number of directors constituting the Board of Directors shall be automatically reduced, without any action by the Board of Directors or the stockholders of the Company, by the number of Preferred Stock Directors authorized immediately prior to such termination. Any Preferred Stock Director may be removed at any time without cause by the holders of a majority of the voting power of outstanding shares of the capital stock then entitled to vote in the election of Preferred Stock Directors, voting together as a single class (with such voting power measured based on the voting power to elect Preferred Stock Directors). 
 (c) Senior Issuances Adverse Changes . So long as any shares of Series P Preferred Stock are outstanding, but subject to the final paragraph of this Section 7(c), in addition to any other vote or consent of holders of the Company s capital stock required by Delaware law, the vote or consent of the holders of at least two-thirds of the voting power of the Series P Preferred Stock and the holders of any other preferred stock entitled to vote thereon, voting together as a single class, given in person or by proxy at an annual or special meeting of stockholders, or given in writing without a meeting, will be necessary for effecting or validating any of the following actions, whether or not such approval is required by Delaware law 
 
 (i) any amendment, alteration or repeal of any provision of the Company s certificate of incorporation (including the certificate of designations creating the Series P Preferred Stock) or the Company s by-laws that would alter or change the voting powers, preferences, economic rights or special rights of the Series P Preferred Stock so as to affect them adversely 
 
 (ii) any amendment or alteration of the Company s certificate of incorporation to authorize or create, or increase the authorized amount of, any shares of, or any securities convertible into shares of, any class or series of the Company's capital stock ranking prior to the Series P Preferred Stock in the payment of dividends or in the distribution of assets on any liquidation, dissolution, or winding up of the Company or 
 
 (iii) the consummation of a binding share exchange or reclassification involving the Series P Preferred Stock or a merger or consolidation of the Company with another entity, except that holders of Series P Preferred Stock will have no right to vote under this provision or otherwise under Delaware law if in each case (i) the Series P Preferred Stock remains outstanding or, in the case of any such merger or consolidation with respect to 

which the Company is not the surviving or resulting entity, is converted into or exchanged for preferred securities of the surviving or resulting entity or its ultimate parent, that is an entity organized and existing under the laws of the United States of America, any state thereof or the District of Columbia and that is a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes (or if such entity is not a corporation, the Company having received an opinion of nationally recognized counsel experienced in such matters to the effect that Holders will be subject to tax for U.S. federal income tax purposes with respect to such new preferred securities after such merger or consolidation in the same amount, at the same time and otherwise in the same manner as would have been the case under the Series P Preferred Stock prior to such merger or consolidation), and (ii) such Series P Preferred Stock remaining outstanding or such preferred securities, as the case may be, have such rights, preferences, privileges and voting powers, taken as a whole, as are not materially less favorable to the holders thereof than the rights, preferences, privileges and voting powers of the Series P Preferred Stock, taken as a whole 
 provided, however , that, for the avoidance of doubt, any increase in the amount of the authorized or issued Series P Preferred Stock or authorized preferred stock or any securities convertible into preferred stock or the creation and issuance, or an increase in the authorized or issued amount, of other series of preferred stock or any securities convertible into preferred stock ranking equally with and or junior to the Series P Preferred Stock with respect to the payment of dividends (whether such dividends are cumulative or noncumulative) and or the distribution of assets upon the Company s liquidation, dissolution or winding up will not be deemed to adversely affect the voting powers, preferences or special rights of the Series P Preferred Stock, and no stockholder will have the right to vote on such an increase, creation or issuance by reason of this Section 7. 
 If any amendment, alteration, repeal, share exchange, reclassification, merger or consolidation specified in this Section 7(c) would adversely affect the Series P Preferred Stock but not all series of preferred stock of the Company, then only such series of preferred stock as are adversely affected by and entitled to vote on the matter shall vote on the matter together with the Series P Preferred Stock as a single class (in lieu of all other series of preferred stock) for purposes of the vote or consent required by this Section 7(c). 
 (d) No Vote if Redemption . No vote or consent of the Holders shall be required pursuant to Section 7(b) or 7(c) if, at or prior to the time when the act with respect to such vote or consent would otherwise be required shall be effected, the Company shall have redeemed or shall have called for redemption all outstanding shares of Series P Preferred Stock, with proper notice and sufficient funds having been set aside for such redemption, in each case pursuant to Section 6 above. 

Section 8. Preemption and Conversion Rights . 
 
 The Holders shall not have any preemptive rights or conversion rights as a result of the terms hereof.

 (c) Merger, Consolidation and Sale of Assets Not Liquidation . For purposes of this Section 5, the sale, conveyance, exchange or transfer (for cash, shares of stock, securities or other consideration) of all or substantially all of the property and assets of the Company shall not be deemed a voluntary or involuntary dissolution, liquidation or winding up of the affairs of the Company, nor shall the merger, consolidation or any other business combination transaction of the Company into or with any other corporation or Person or the merger, consolidation or any other business combination transaction of any other corporation or Person into or with the Company be deemed to be a voluntary or involuntary dissolution, liquidation or winding up of the affairs of the Company.

Section 7. Voting Rights . 
 
 (a) General . The Holders shall not be entitled to vote on any matter except as set forth in Section 7(b) below or as required by the Delaware General Corporation Law. 
 
 (b) Special Voting Right . 
 
 (i) Voting Right . If and whenever dividends on the Series Q Preferred Stock or any other class or Series of preferred stock that ranks on parity with Series Q Preferred Stock as to payment of dividends and upon which voting rights equivalent to those granted by this Section 7(b)(i) have been conferred and are exercisable (any such class or series being referred to herein as dividend parity stock have not been paid in an aggregate amount equal, as to any class or series, to at least three semi-annual or six quarterly Dividend Periods, as applicable, (whether consecutive or not) (a Nonpayment ), the authorized number of directors constituting the Board of Directors shall be increased by two, and the Holders, together with holders of dividend parity stock, shall have the right, voting separately as a single class without regard to class or series (and with voting rights allocated pro rata based on the liquidation preference of each such class or series), to the exclusion of the holders of Common Stock, to elect two directors of the Company to fill such newly created directorships (and to fill any vacancies in the terms of such directorships), provided that it shall be a qualification for election of any such director that the election of such director shall not cause the Company to violate the corporate governance requirements of the New York Stock Exchange (or other exchange on which the Company s securities may be listed) that listed companies must have a majority of independent directors and further provided that the Board of Directors shall at no time include more than two such directors. Each such director elected by the Holders together with holders of dividend parity stock is a Preferred Stock Director . 
 
 (ii) Election . The election of the Preferred Stock Directors will take place at any annual meeting of stockholders or any special meeting of the Holders and any dividend parity stock, called as provided herein. At any time after the special voting power has vested pursuant to Section 7(b)(i) above, the secretary of the Company may, and upon the 

written request (addressed to the secretary at the Company s principal office) of the holders of at least 20 of the voting power of the Series Q Preferred Stock or the holders of at least 20 of the voting power of any Series of dividend parity stock (with such voting power measured based on the voting power to elect Preferred Stock Directors), must (unless such request is received less than 90 days before the date fixed for the next annual or special meeting of the stockholders of the Company, in which event such election shall be held at such next annual or special meeting of stockholders), call a special meeting of the holders of Series Q Preferred Stock and any dividend parity stock for the purposes of electing Preferred Stock Directors.

The Preferred Stock Directors elected at any such special meeting and each Preferred Stock Director elected at a subsequent annual or special meeting of stockholders, will be elected for term expiring upon the earlier of the Preferred Stock Director Termination Date and the next annual meeting of stockholders following such Preferred Stock Director's election. In case any vacancy in the office of a Preferred Stock Director occurs (other than prior to the initial election of the Preferred Stock Directors), the vacancy may be filled by the Preferred Stock Director remaining in office, or if none remains in office, by a plurality of the votes cast by the holders of Series Q Preferred Stock and any dividend parity stock, voting together as a single class, and the Preferred Stock Director so appointed or elected to fill such vacancy shall serve for a term expiring at the next annual meeting of the stockholders. Preferred Stock Directors may only be elected by the holders of Series Q Preferred Stock and dividend parity stock in accordance with this Section 7. If the holders of Series Q Preferred Stock and such dividend parity stock fail to elect a sufficient number of directors to fill all directorships for which they are entitled to elect directors pursuant to this Section 7, then any directorship not so filled shall remain vacant until such time as the holders of Series Q Preferred Stock and such dividend parity stock elect a person to fill such directorship in accordance with this Section 7, or such vacancy is otherwise filled in accordance with this Section 7 and no such directorship may be filled by stockholders of the Corporation other than in accordance with this Section 7.

Whenever the Company has paid noncumulative dividends in full for at least two consecutive semi-annual or four consecutive quarterly Dividend Periods following a Nonpayment on the Series Q Preferred Stock and on any dividend parity stock entitled to noncumulative dividends and has paid cumulative dividends in full on any dividend parity stock entitled to cumulative dividends, then the right of the Holders to elect the Preferred Stock Directors will cease (but subject always to the same provisions for the vesting of the special voting rights in the case of any 

similar non-payment of dividends in respect of future Dividend Periods) (the time of such cessation, the Preferred Stock Director Termination Date ). Upon a Preferred Stock Director Termination Date, the terms of office of the Preferred Stock Directors will immediately terminate, the persons then serving as Preferred Stock Directors shall immediately cease to be qualified to hold office as Preferred Stock Directors, the Preferred Stock Directors shall cease to be directors of the Company and the number of directors constituting the Board of Directors shall be automatically reduced, without any action by the Board of Directors or the stockholders of the Company, by the number of Preferred Stock Directors authorized immediately prior to such termination. Any Preferred Stock Director may be removed at any time without cause by the holders of a majority of the voting power of outstanding shares of the capital stock then entitled to vote in the election of Preferred Stock Directors, voting together as a single class (with such voting power measured based on the voting power to elect Preferred Stock Directors).

Section 7. Voting Rights . 
 
 (a) General . The Holders shall not be entitled to vote on any matter except as set forth in Section 7(b) below or as required by the Delaware General Corporation Law. 
 
 (b) Special Voting Right . 
 
 (i) Voting Right . If and whenever dividends on the Series R Preferred Stock or any other class or Series of preferred stock that ranks on parity with Series R Preferred Stock as to payment of dividends and upon which voting rights equivalent to those granted by this Section 7(b)(i) have been conferred and are exercisable (any such class or series being referred to herein as dividend parity stock have not been paid in an aggregate amount equal, as to any class or series, to at least three semi-annual or six quarterly Dividend Periods, as applicable, (whether consecutive or not) (a Nonpayment ), the authorized number of directors constituting the Board of Directors shall be increased by two, and the Holders, together with holders of dividend parity stock, shall have the right, voting separately as a single class without regard to class or series (and with voting rights allocated pro rata based on the liquidation preference of each such class or series), to the exclusion of the holders of Common Stock, to elect two directors of the Company to fill such newly created directorships (and to fill any vacancies in the terms of such directorships), provided that it shall be a qualification for election of any such director that the election of such director shall not cause the Company to violate the corporate governance requirements of the New York Stock Exchange (or other exchange on which the Company s securities may be listed) that listed companies must have a majority of independent directors and further provided that the Board of Directors shall at no time include more than two such directors. Each such director elected by the Holders together with holders of dividend parity stock is a Preferred Stock Director . 

(ii) Election . The election of the Preferred Stock Directors will take place at any annual meeting of stockholders or any special meeting of the Holders and any dividend parity stock, called as provided herein. At any time after the special voting power has vested pursuant to Section 7(b)(i) above, the secretary of the Company may, and upon the written request (addressed to the secretary at the Company s principal office) of the holders of at least 20 of the voting power of the Series R Preferred Stock or the holders of at least 20 of the voting power of any Series of dividend parity stock (with such voting power measured based on the voting power to elect Preferred Stock Directors), must (unless such request is received less than 90 days before the date fixed for the next annual or special meeting of the stockholders of the Company, in which event such election shall be held at such next annual or special meeting of stockholders), call a special meeting of the holders of Series R Preferred Stock and any dividend parity stock for the purposes of electing Preferred Stock Directors. The Preferred Stock Directors shall each be entitled to one vote per director on any matter. 
 
 (iii) Notice of Special Meeting . Notice for a special meeting to elect Preferred Stock Directors will be given in a similar manner to that provided in the Company s by-laws for a special meeting of the stockholders. If the secretary of the Company does not call a special meeting within 20 days after receipt of any such request, then any Holder may (at the expense of the Company) call such meeting, upon notice as provided in this Section 7(b)(iii), and for that purpose will have access to the stock register of the Company. The Preferred Stock Directors elected at any such special meeting and each Preferred Stock Director elected at a subsequent annual or special meeting of stockholders, will be elected for term expiring upon the earlier of the Preferred Stock Director Termination Date and the next annual meeting of stockholders following such Preferred Stock Director's election. In case any vacancy in the office of a Preferred Stock Director occurs (other than prior to the initial election of the Preferred Stock Directors), the vacancy may be filled by the Preferred Stock Director remaining in office, or if none remains in office, by a plurality of the votes cast by the holders of Series R Preferred Stock and any dividend parity stock, voting together as a single class, and the Preferred Stock Director so appointed or elected to fill such vacancy shall serve for a term expiring at the next annual meeting of the stockholders. Preferred Stock Directors may only be elected by the holders of Series R Preferred Stock and dividend parity stock in accordance with this Section 7. If the holders of Series R Preferred Stock and such dividend parity stock fail to elect a sufficient number of directors to fill all directorships for which they are entitled to elect directors pursuant to this Section 7, then any directorship not so filled shall remain vacant until such time as the holders of Series R Preferred Stock and such dividend parity stock elect a person to fill such directorship in accordance with this Section 7, or such vacancy is otherwise filled in accordance with this Section 7 and no such directorship may be filled by stockholders of the Corporation other than in accordance with this Section 7. 
 
 (iv) Termination Removal . Whenever the Company has paid noncumulative dividends in full for at least two consecutive semi-annual or four consecutive quarterly 

Dividend Periods following a Nonpayment on the Series R Preferred Stock and on any dividend parity stock entitled to noncumulative dividends and has paid cumulative dividends in full on any dividend parity stock entitled to cumulative dividends, then the right of the Holders to elect the Preferred Stock Directors will cease (but subject always to the same provisions for the vesting of the special voting rights in the case of any similar non-payment of dividends in respect of future Dividend Periods) (the time of such cessation, the Preferred Stock Director Termination Date ). Upon a Preferred Stock Director Termination Date, the terms of office of the Preferred Stock Directors will immediately terminate, the persons then serving as Preferred Stock Directors shall immediately cease to be qualified to hold office as Preferred Stock Directors, the Preferred Stock Directors shall cease to be directors of the Company and the number of directors constituting the Board of Directors shall be automatically reduced, without any action by the Board of Directors or the stockholders of the Company, by the number of Preferred Stock Directors authorized immediately prior to such termination. Any Preferred Stock Director may be removed at any time without cause by the holders of a majority of the voting power of outstanding shares of the capital stock then entitled to vote in the election of Preferred Stock Directors, voting together as a single class (with such voting power measured based on the voting power to elect Preferred Stock Directors).

 If any amendment, alteration, repeal, share exchange, reclassification, merger or consolidation specified in this Section 7(c) would adversely affect the Series R Preferred Stock but not all Series of preferred stock of the Company, then only such Series of preferred stock as are adversely affected by and entitled to vote on the matter shall vote on the matter together with the Series R Preferred Stock as a single class (in lieu of all other Series of preferred stock) for purposes of the vote or consent required by this Section 7(c). 
 (d) No Vote if Redemption .

 Except as provided below, for so long as any share of Series S Preferred Stock remains outstanding, if dividends are not declared and paid in full upon the shares of Series S Preferred Stock and any class or Series of stock of the Company now existing or hereafter authorized that ranks equally with the Series S Preferred Stock in the payment of dividends, all dividends declared upon shares of Series S Preferred Stock and such other stock will be declared on a proportional basis so that the amount of dividends declared per share will bear to each other the same ratio that accrued dividends for the then-current Dividend Period per share of Series S Preferred Stock and accrued dividends for the then-current Dividend Period per share of such other stock (including, in the case of any such other stock that bears cumulative dividends, all accrued and unpaid dividends) bear to each other. 
 Subject to the foregoing, and not otherwise, such dividends payable in cash, stock or otherwise, as may be determined by the Board of Directors or any duly authorized committee thereof, may be declared and paid on any other class or Series of stock of the Company from time to time out of any funds legally available for such payment, and Holders will not be entitled to participate in those dividends.

 (b) Notice of Redemption . Notice of every redemption of shares of Series S Preferred Stock shall be mailed by first class mail, postage prepaid, addressed to the Holders of such shares 

to be redeemed at their respective last addresses appearing on the stock register of the Company. Such mailing shall be at least 30 days and not more than 60 days before the date fixed for redemption. Any notice mailed as provided in this Section 6(b) shall be conclusively presumed to have been duly given, whether or not the Holder receives such notice, but failure duly to give such notice by mail, or any defect in such notice or in the mailing thereof, to any Holder of shares of Series S Preferred Stock designated for redemption shall not affect the validity of the proceedings for the redemption of any other shares of Series S Preferred Stock. Each notice shall state 
 
 (i) the redemption date 
 
 (ii) the total number of shares of Series S Preferred Stock to be redeemed and, if fewer than all the shares of a Holder are to be redeemed, the number of such shares to be redeemed 
 
 (iii) the redemption price 
 
 (iv) the place or places where the certificates for such shares are to be surrendered for payment of the redemption price, if applicable and 
 
 (v) that dividends on the shares to be redeemed will cease to accrue on the redemption date. 
 
 Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the certificates evidencing the shares of Series S Preferred Stock are held of record by a depositary and any related depository shares are held of record by a Depositary or its nominee, the Company may give such notice in any manner permitted by the Depositary. 
 
 (c) Partial Redemption . In case of any redemption of only part of the shares of Series S Preferred Stock at the time outstanding, the shares of Series S Preferred Stock to be redeemed shall be selected (i) pro rata from the Holders in proportion to the number of shares of Series S Preferred Stock held by such Holders, (ii) by lot or (iii) in such other manner as the Board of Directors or any duly authorized committee thereof may determine, in its sole discretion, to be fair and equitable provided, however, that if for so long as the Series S Preferred Stock or depositary shares in respect thereof are listed on the New York Stock Exchange, the foregoing clause (iii) shall apply only if such method of selection is not then prohibited by any then applicable rule of the New York Stock Exchange or the New York Stock Exchange consents to or grants a waiver or exemption from such rule. Subject to the provisions of this Section 6, the Board of Directors or any duly authorized committee thereof shall have full power and authority to prescribe the terms and conditions upon which shares of Series S Preferred Stock shall be redeemed from time to time. 
 
 (d) Effectiveness of Redemption . If notice of redemption has been duly given and if on or before the redemption date specified in the notice all funds necessary for the redemption have been set aside by the Company, separate and apart from its other assets, for the pro rata benefit of the Holders of the shares called for redemption, so as to be and continue to be available therefor, 

or deposited by the Company with a bank or trust company selected by the Board of Directors or any duly authorized committee thereof (the Trust in trust for the pro rata benefit of the Holders of the shares called for redemption, then, notwithstanding that any certificate for any share so called for redemption has not been surrendered for cancellation, on and after the redemption date all shares so called for redemption shall cease to be outstanding, all dividends with respect to such shares shall cease to accrue on such redemption date, and all rights with respect to such shares shall forthwith on such redemption date cease and terminate, except only the right of the Holders thereof to receive the amount payable on such redemption from the Trust at any time after the redemption date from the funds so deposited, without interest. The Company shall be entitled to receive, from time to time, from the Trust any interest accrued on such funds, and the Holders of any shares called for redemption shall have no claim to any such interest. Any funds so deposited and unclaimed at the end of three years from the redemption date shall, to the extent permitted by law, be released or repaid to the Company, and in the event of such repayment to the Company, the Holders of the shares so called for redemption shall be deemed to be unsecured creditors of the Company for an amount equivalent to the amount deposited as stated above for the redemption of such shares and so repaid to the Company, but shall in no event be entitled to any interest. 

Section 7. Voting Rights . 
 
 (a) General . The Holders shall not be entitled to vote on any matter except as set forth in Section 7(b) below or as required by the Delaware General Corporation Law. 
 
 (b) Special Voting Right . 
 
 (i) Voting Right . If and whenever dividends on the Series S Preferred Stock or any other class or Series of preferred stock that ranks on parity with Series S Preferred Stock as to payment of dividends and upon which voting rights equivalent to those granted by this Section 7(b)(i) have been conferred and are exercisable (any such class or series being referred to herein as dividend parity stock have not been paid in an aggregate amount equal, as to any class or series, to at least three semi-annual or six quarterly Dividend Periods, as applicable, (whether consecutive or not) (a Nonpayment ), the authorized number of directors constituting the Board of Directors shall be increased by two, and the Holders, together with holders of dividend parity stock, shall have the right, voting separately as a single class without regard to class or series (and with voting rights allocated pro rata based on the liquidation preference of each such class or series), to the exclusion of the holders of Common Stock, to elect two directors of the Company to fill such newly created directorships (and to fill any vacancies in the terms of such directorships), provided that it shall be a qualification for election of any such director that the election of such director shall not cause the Company to violate the corporate governance requirements of the New York Stock Exchange (or other exchange on which the Company s securities may be listed) that listed companies must have a majority of independent directors and further provided that the Board of Directors shall at no time include more than two such directors. Each such director elected by the Holders together with holders of dividend parity stock is a Preferred Stock Director . 

(ii) Election . The election of the Preferred Stock Directors will take place at any annual meeting of stockholders or any special meeting of the Holders and any dividend parity stock, called as provided herein. At any time after the special voting power has vested pursuant to Section 7(b)(i) above, the secretary of the Company may, and upon the written request (addressed to the secretary at the Company s principal office) of the holders of at least 20 of the voting power of the Series S Preferred Stock or the holders of at least 20 of the voting power of any Series of dividend parity stock (with such voting power measured based on the voting power to elect Preferred Stock Directors), must (unless such request is received less than 90 days before the date fixed for the next annual or special meeting of the stockholders of the Company, in which event such election shall be held at such next annual or special meeting of stockholders), call a special meeting of the holders of Series S Preferred Stock and any dividend parity stock for the purposes of electing Preferred Stock Directors. The Preferred Stock Directors shall each be entitled to one vote per director on any matter. 
 
 (iii) Notice of Special Meeting . Notice for a special meeting to elect Preferred Stock Directors will be given in a similar manner to that provided in the Company s by-laws for a special meeting of the stockholders. If the secretary of the Company does not call a special meeting within 20 days after receipt of any such request, then any Holder may (at the expense of the Company) call such meeting, upon notice as provided in this Section 7(b)(iii), and for that purpose will have access to the stock register of the Company. The Preferred Stock Directors elected at any such special meeting and each Preferred Stock Director elected at a subsequent annual or special meeting of stockholders, will be elected for term expiring upon the earlier of the Preferred Stock Director Termination Date and the next annual meeting of stockholders following such Preferred Stock Director's election. In case any vacancy in the office of a Preferred Stock Director occurs (other than prior to the initial election of the Preferred Stock Directors), the vacancy may be filled by the Preferred Stock Director remaining in office, or if none remains in office, by a plurality of the votes cast by the holders of Series S Preferred Stock and any dividend parity stock, voting together as a single class, and the Preferred Stock Director so appointed or elected to fill such vacancy shall serve for a term expiring at the next annual meeting of the stockholders. Preferred Stock Directors may only be elected by the holders of Series S Preferred Stock and dividend parity stock in accordance with this Section 7. If the holders of Series S Preferred Stock and such dividend parity stock fail to elect a sufficient number of directors to fill all directorships for which they are entitled to elect directors pursuant to this Section 7, then any directorship not so filled shall remain vacant until such time as the holders of Series S Preferred Stock and such dividend parity stock elect a person to fill such directorship in accordance with this Section 7, or such vacancy is otherwise filled in accordance with this Section 7 and no such directorship may be filled by stockholders of the Corporation other than in accordance with this Section 7. 
 
 (iv) Termination Removal . Whenever the Company has paid noncumulative dividends in full for at least two consecutive semi-annual or four consecutive quarterly 

Dividend Periods following a Nonpayment on the Series S Preferred Stock and on any dividend parity stock entitled to noncumulative dividends and has paid cumulative dividends in full on any dividend parity stock entitled to cumulative dividends, then the right of the Holders to elect the Preferred Stock Directors will cease (but subject always to the same provisions for the vesting of the special voting rights in the case of any similar non-payment of dividends in respect of future Dividend Periods) (the time of such cessation, the Preferred Stock Director Termination Date ). Upon a Preferred Stock Director Termination Date, the terms of office of the Preferred Stock Directors will immediately terminate, the persons then serving as Preferred Stock Directors shall immediately cease to be qualified to hold office as Preferred Stock Directors, the Preferred Stock Directors shall cease to be directors of the Company and the number of directors constituting the Board of Directors shall be automatically reduced, without any action by the Board of Directors or the stockholders of the Company, by the number of Preferred Stock Directors authorized immediately prior to such termination. Any Preferred Stock Director may be removed at any time without cause by the holders of a majority of the voting power of outstanding shares of the capital stock then entitled to vote in the election of Preferred Stock Directors, voting together as a single class (with such voting power measured based on the voting power to elect Preferred Stock Directors). 
 (c) Senior Issuances Adverse Changes . So long as any shares of Series S Preferred Stock are outstanding, but subject to the final paragraph of this Section 7(c), in addition to any other vote or consent of holders of the Company s capital stock required by Delaware law, the vote or consent of the holders of at least two-thirds of the voting power of the Series S Preferred Stock and the holders of any other preferred stock entitled to vote thereon, voting together as a single class, given in person or by proxy at an annual or special meeting of stockholders, or given in writing without a meeting, will be necessary for effecting or validating any of the following actions, whether or not such approval is required by Delaware law 
 
 (i) any amendment, alteration or repeal of any provision of the Company s certificate of incorporation (including the certificate of designations creating the Series S Preferred Stock) or the Company s by-laws that would alter or change the voting powers, preferences, economic rights or special rights of the Series S Preferred Stock so as to affect them adversely 
 
 (ii) any amendment or alteration of the Company s certificate of incorporation to authorize or create, or increase the authorized amount of, any shares of, or any securities convertible into shares of, any class or Series of the Company's capital stock ranking prior to the Series S Preferred Stock in the payment of dividends or in the distribution of assets on any liquidation, dissolution, or winding up of the Company or 
 
 (iii) the consummation of a binding share exchange or reclassification involving the Series S Preferred Stock or a merger or consolidation of the Company with another entity, except that holders of Series S Preferred Stock will have no right to vote under this provision or otherwise under Delaware law if in each case (i) the Series S Preferred Stock remains outstanding or, in the case of any such merger or consolidation with respect to 

which the Company is not the surviving or resulting entity, is converted into or exchanged for preferred securities of the surviving or resulting entity or its ultimate parent, that is an entity organized and existing under the laws of the United States of America, any state thereof or the District of Columbia and that is a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes (or if such entity is not a corporation, the Company having received an opinion of nationally recognized counsel experienced in such matters to the effect that Holders will be subject to tax for U.S. federal income tax purposes with respect to such new preferred securities after such merger or consolidation in the same amount, at the same time and otherwise in the same manner as would have been the case under the Series S Preferred Stock prior to such merger or consolidation), and (ii) such Series S Preferred Stock remaining outstanding or such preferred securities, as the case may be, have such rights, preferences, privileges and voting powers, taken as a whole, as are not materially less favorable to the holders thereof than the rights, preferences, privileges and voting powers of the Series S Preferred Stock, taken as a whole 
 provided, however , that, for the avoidance of doubt, any increase in the amount of the authorized or issued Series S Preferred Stock or authorized preferred stock or any securities convertible into preferred stock or the creation and issuance, or an increase in the authorized or issued amount, of other Series of preferred stock or any securities convertible into preferred stock ranking equally with and or junior to the Series S Preferred Stock with respect to the payment of dividends (whether such dividends are cumulative or noncumulative) and or the distribution of assets upon the Company s liquidation, dissolution or winding up will not be deemed to adversely affect the voting powers, preferences or special rights of the Series S Preferred Stock, and no stockholder will have the right to vote on such an increase, creation or issuance by reason of this Section 7. 
 If any amendment, alteration, repeal, share exchange, reclassification, merger or consolidation specified in this Section 7(c) would adversely affect the Series S Preferred Stock but not all Series of preferred stock of the Company, then only such Series of preferred stock as are adversely affected by and entitled to vote on the matter shall vote on the matter together with the Series S Preferred Stock as a single class (in lieu of all other Series of preferred stock) for purposes of the vote or consent required by this Section 7(c). 
 (d) No Vote if Redemption . No vote or consent of the Holders shall be required pursuant to Section 7(b) or 7(c) if, at or prior to the time when the act with respect to such vote or consent would otherwise be required shall be effected, the Company shall have redeemed or shall have called for redemption all outstanding shares of Series S Preferred Stock, with proper notice and sufficient funds having been set aside for such redemption, in each case pursuant to Section 6 above. 

Section 8. Preemption and Conversion Rights .

The period from and including the date of issuance of the Series T Preferred Stock or any Dividend Payment Date to, but excluding, the next Dividend Payment Date is a Dividend Period . Dividends on each share of Series T Preferred Stock will accrue on the liquidation preference of 25,000 per share at a rate per annum equal to (i) 6.250 , for each Dividend Period from and including the date of issuance to, but excluding, August 15, 2026 and (ii) Three-month LIBOR plus 4.517 , for each Dividend Period from and including August 15, 2026.

 (b) Noncumulative Dividends . If the Board of Directors or any duly authorized committee thereof does not declare a dividend on the Series T Preferred Stock for any Dividend Period prior to the related Dividend Payment Date, that dividend will not accrue, and the Company will have no obligation to pay, and Holders shall have no right to receive, a dividend for that Dividend Period on the related Dividend Payment Date or at any future time, whether or not dividends on the Series T Preferred Stock or any other Series of preferred stock or common stock are declared for any subsequent period. References herein to the accrual of dividends refer only to the determination of the amount of such dividend and do not imply that any right to a dividend arises prior to the date on which a dividend is declared. 
 
 (c) Priority of Dividends . So long as any share of Series T Preferred Stock remains outstanding, unless as to a Dividend Payment Date full dividends on all outstanding shares of the 

Series T Preferred Stock have been declared and paid or declared and a sum sufficient for the payment of those dividends has been set aside for the Dividend Period then ending, the Company will not, and will cause its subsidiaries not to, during the next succeeding Dividend Period that commences on such Dividend Payment Date, declare or pay any dividend on, make any distributions relating to, or redeem, purchase, acquire or make a liquidation payment relating to, any Junior Stock, or make any guarantee payment with respect thereto, other than 
 (i) purchases, redemptions or other acquisitions of shares of Junior Stock in connection with any employment contract, benefit plan or other similar arrangement with or for the benefit of employees, officers, directors or consultants 
 
 (ii) purchases of shares of Common Stock pursuant to a contractually binding requirement to buy stock existing prior to the commencement of the then-current Dividend Period, including under a contractually binding stock repurchase plan

 (vi) the purchase of Junior Stock by any investment banking subsidiary of the Company in connection with market-making or other secondary market activities in the ordinary course of the business of such subsidiary. 
 
 The restrictions set forth in the preceding provisions of this Section 4(c) shall not apply to any Junior Stock dividends paid by the Company where the dividend is in the form of the same stock (or the right to buy the same stock) as that on which the dividend is being paid. 
 Except as provided below, for so long as any share of Series T Preferred Stock remains outstanding, if dividends are not declared and paid in full upon the shares of Series T Preferred Stock and any class or Series of stock of the Company now existing or hereafter authorized that ranks equally with the Series T Preferred Stock in the payment of dividends, all dividends declared upon shares of Series T Preferred Stock and such other stock will be declared on a proportional basis so that the amount of dividends declared per share will bear to each other the same ratio that accrued dividends for the then-current Dividend Period per share of Series T Preferred Stock and accrued dividends for the then-current Dividend Period per share of such other stock (including, in the case of any such other stock that bears cumulative dividends, all accrued and unpaid dividends) bear to each other. 
 Subject to the foregoing, and not otherwise, such dividends payable in cash, stock or otherwise, as may be determined by the Board of Directors or any duly authorized committee thereof, may be declared and paid on any other class or Series of stock of the Company from 

time to time out of any funds legally available for such payment, and Holders will not be entitled to participate in those dividends.

Holders shall not be entitled to any further payments in the event of any such voluntary or involuntary liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the affairs of the Company other than what is expressly provided for in this Section 5. 
 (b) Partial Payment . If the assets of the Company are not sufficient to pay in full the aforesaid liquidation distributions to the Holders and any liquidation distributions owed to holders of any class or Series of stock of the Company ranking equally with the Series T Preferred Stock in the distribution of assets on any voluntary or involuntary liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Company, the amounts paid to the Holders and to the holders of all such equally ranking stock shall be pro rata in accordance with the respective aggregate liquidating distributions to which they would otherwise be entitled. 
 
 (c) Merger, Consolidation and Sale of Assets Not Liquidation . For purposes of this Section 5, the sale, conveyance, exchange or transfer (for cash, shares of stock, securities or other consideration) of all or substantially all of the property and assets of the Company shall not be deemed a voluntary or involuntary dissolution, liquidation or winding up of the affairs of the Company, nor shall the merger, consolidation or any other business combination transaction of the Company into or with any other corporation or Person or the merger, consolidation or any other business combination transaction of any other corporation or Person into or with the Company be deemed to be a voluntary or involuntary dissolution, liquidation or winding up of the affairs of the Company.

Subject to the provisions of this Section 6, the Board of Directors or any duly authorized committee thereof shall have full power and authority to prescribe the terms and conditions upon which shares of Series T Preferred Stock shall be redeemed from time to time. 
 
 (d) Effectiveness of Redemption .

or deposited by the Company with a bank or trust company selected by the Board of Directors or any duly authorized committee thereof (the Trust in trust for the pro rata benefit of the Holders of the shares called for redemption, then, notwithstanding that any certificate for any share so called for redemption has not been surrendered for cancellation, on and after the redemption date all shares so called for redemption shall cease to be outstanding, all dividends with respect to such shares shall cease to accrue on such redemption date, and all rights with respect to such shares shall forthwith on such redemption date cease and terminate, except only the right of the Holders thereof to receive the amount payable on such redemption from the Trust at any time after the redemption date from the funds so deposited, without interest.

Section 7. Voting Rights . 
 
 (a) General . The Holders shall not be entitled to vote on any matter except as set forth in Section 7(b) below or as required by the Delaware General Corporation Law. 
 
 (b) Special Voting Right . 
 
 (i) Voting Right . If and whenever dividends on the Series T Preferred Stock or any other class or Series of preferred stock that ranks on parity with Series T Preferred Stock as to payment of dividends and upon which voting rights equivalent to those granted by this Section 7(b)(i) have been conferred and are exercisable (any such class or series being referred to herein as dividend parity stock have not been paid in an aggregate amount equal, as to any class or series, to at least three semi-annual or six quarterly Dividend Periods, as applicable, (whether consecutive or not) (a Nonpayment ), the authorized number of directors constituting the Board of Directors shall be increased by two, and the Holders, together with holders of dividend parity stock, shall have the right, voting separately as a single class without regard to class or series (and with voting rights allocated pro rata based on the liquidation preference of each such class or series), to the exclusion of the holders of Common Stock, to elect two directors of the Company to fill such newly created directorships (and to fill any vacancies in the terms of such directorships), provided that it shall be a qualification for election of any such director that the election of such director shall not cause the Company to violate the corporate governance requirements of the New York Stock Exchange (or other exchange on which the Company s securities may be listed) that listed companies must have a majority of independent directors and further provided that the Board of Directors shall at no time include more than two such directors. Each such director elected by the Holders together with holders of dividend parity stock is a Preferred Stock Director . 

(ii) Election . The election of the Preferred Stock Directors will take place at any annual meeting of stockholders or any special meeting of the Holders and any dividend parity stock, called as provided herein. At any time after the special voting power has vested pursuant to Section 7(b)(i) above, the secretary of the Company may, and upon the written request (addressed to the secretary at the Company s principal office) of the holders of at least 20 of the voting power of the Series T Preferred Stock or the holders of at least 20 of the voting power of any Series of dividend parity stock (with such voting power measured based on the voting power to elect Preferred Stock Directors), must (unless such request is received less than 90 days before the date fixed for the next annual or special meeting of the stockholders of the Company, in which event such election shall be held at such next annual or special meeting of stockholders), call a special meeting of the holders of Series T Preferred Stock and any dividend parity stock for the purposes of electing Preferred Stock Directors.

Notice for a special meeting to elect Preferred Stock Directors will be given in a similar manner to that provided in the Company s by-laws for a special meeting of the stockholders.

The Preferred Stock Directors elected at any such special meeting and each Preferred Stock Director elected at a subsequent annual or special meeting of stockholders, will be elected for term expiring upon the earlier of the Preferred Stock Director Termination Date and the next annual meeting of stockholders following such Preferred Stock Director's election. In case any vacancy in the office of a Preferred Stock Director occurs (other than prior to the initial election of the Preferred Stock Directors), the vacancy may be filled by the Preferred Stock Director remaining in office, or if none remains in office, by a plurality of the votes cast by the holders of Series T Preferred Stock and any dividend parity stock, voting together as a single class, and the Preferred Stock Director so appointed or elected to fill such vacancy shall serve for a term expiring at the next annual meeting of the stockholders. Preferred Stock Directors may only be elected by the holders of Series T Preferred Stock and dividend parity stock in accordance with this Section 7. If the holders of Series T Preferred Stock and such dividend parity stock fail to elect a sufficient number of directors to fill all directorships for which they are entitled to elect directors pursuant to this Section 7, then any directorship not so filled shall remain vacant until such time as the holders of Series T Preferred Stock and such dividend parity stock elect a person to fill such directorship in accordance with this Section 7, or such vacancy is otherwise filled in accordance with this Section 7 and no such directorship may be filled by stockholders of the Corporation other than in accordance with this Section 7.

Dividend Periods following a Nonpayment on the Series T Preferred Stock and on any dividend parity stock entitled to noncumulative dividends and has paid cumulative dividends in full on any dividend parity stock entitled to cumulative dividends, then the right of the Holders to elect the Preferred Stock Directors will cease (but subject always to the same provisions for the vesting of the special voting rights in the case of any similar non-payment of dividends in respect of future Dividend Periods) (the time of such cessation, the Preferred Stock Director Termination Date ). Upon a Preferred Stock Director Termination Date, the terms of office of the Preferred Stock Directors will immediately terminate, the persons then serving as Preferred Stock Directors shall immediately cease to be qualified to hold office as Preferred Stock Directors, the Preferred Stock Directors shall cease to be directors of the Company and the number of directors constituting the Board of Directors shall be automatically reduced, without any action by the Board of Directors or the stockholders of the Company, by the number of Preferred Stock Directors authorized immediately prior to such termination. Any Preferred Stock Director may be removed at any time without cause by the holders of a majority of the voting power of outstanding shares of the capital stock then entitled to vote in the election of Preferred Stock Directors, voting together as a single class (with such voting power measured based on the voting power to elect Preferred Stock Directors).

which the Company is not the surviving or resulting entity, is converted into or exchanged for preferred securities of the surviving or resulting entity or its ultimate parent, that is an entity organized and existing under the laws of the United States of America, any state thereof or the District of Columbia and that is a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes (or if such entity is not a corporation, the Company having received an opinion of nationally recognized counsel experienced in such matters to the effect that Holders will be subject to tax for U.S. federal income tax purposes with respect to such new preferred securities after such merger or consolidation in the same amount, at the same time and otherwise in the same manner as would have been the case under the Series T Preferred Stock prior to such merger or consolidation), and (ii) such Series T Preferred Stock remaining outstanding or such preferred securities, as the case may be, have such rights, preferences, privileges and voting powers, taken as a whole, as are not materially less favorable to the holders thereof than the rights, preferences, privileges and voting powers of the Series T Preferred Stock, taken as a whole

So long as any share of Series U Preferred Stock remains outstanding, unless as to a dividend payment date full dividends on all outstanding shares of the Series U Preferred Stock have been declared and paid or declared and a sum sufficient for the payment of those dividends has been set aside for the dividend period then ending, the Company will not, and will cause its subsidiaries not to, during the next succeeding dividend period that commences on such dividend payment date during the Fixed Rate Period or dividend period end date during the Floating Rate Period, declare or pay any dividend on, make any distributions relating to, or redeem, purchase, acquire or make a liquidation payment relating to, any Junior Stock, or make any guarantee payment with respect thereto, other than 
 (i) purchases, redemptions or other acquisitions of shares of Junior Stock in connection with any employment contract, benefit plan or other similar arrangement with or for the benefit of employees, officers, directors or consultants 
 
 (ii) purchases of shares of Common Stock pursuant to a contractually binding requirement to buy stock existing prior to the commencement of the then-current dividend period, including under a contractually binding stock repurchase plan 
 
 (iii) as a result of an exchange or conversion of any class or Series of Junior Stock for any other class or Series of Junior Stock 

(iv) the purchase of fractional interests in shares of Junior Stock pursuant to the conversion or exchange provisions of such Junior Stock or the security being converted or exchanged 
 
 (v) the purchase of Junior Stock by an investment banking subsidiary of the Company in connection with the distribution thereof or 
 
 (vi) the purchase of Junior Stock by any investment banking subsidiary of the Company in connection with market-making or other secondary market activities in the ordinary course of the business of such subsidiary. 
 
 The restrictions set forth in the preceding provisions of this Section 4(c) shall not apply to any Junior Stock dividends paid by the Company where the dividend is in the form of the same stock (or the right to buy the same stock) as that on which the dividend is being paid. 
 Except as provided below, for so long as any share of Series U Preferred Stock remains outstanding, if dividends are not declared and paid in full upon the shares of Series U Preferred Stock and any class or series of stock of the Company now existing or hereafter authorized that ranks equally with the Series U Preferred Stock in the payment of dividends, all dividends declared upon shares of Series U Preferred Stock and such other stock will be declared on a proportional basis so that the amount of dividends declared per share will bear to each other the same ratio that accrued dividends for the then-current dividend period per share of Series U Preferred Stock and accrued dividends for the then-current dividend period per share of such other stock (including, in the case of any such other stock that bears cumulative dividends, all accrued and unpaid dividends) bear to each other. 
 Subject to the foregoing, and not otherwise, such dividends payable in cash, stock or otherwise, as may be determined by the Board of Directors or any duly authorized committee thereof, may be declared and paid on any other class or series of stock of the Company from time to time out of any funds legally available for such payment, and Holders will not be entitled to participate in those dividends. 
 Section 5. Liquidation Rights . 
 
 (a) Liquidation . In the event of any voluntary or involuntary liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the affairs of the Company, Holders shall be entitled, out of funds legally available therefor, before any distribution or payment may be made by the Company or set aside for the holders of any Junior Stock and subject to the rights of the holders of any class or series of stock ranking senior to or on parity with Series U Preferred Stock upon liquidation and the rights of the Company s depositors and other creditors, to receive in full a liquidating distribution in the amount of the liquidation preference of 25,000 per share (the Series U Liquidation Preference ), plus any accrued dividends thereon from the last dividend payment date to, but excluding, the date of the liquidation, dissolution or winding up if and to the extent declared but not yet paid. Holders shall not be entitled to any further payments in the event of any such voluntary or involuntary liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the affairs of the Company other than what is expressly provided for in this Section 5. 

(b) Partial Payment . If the assets of the Company are not sufficient to pay in full the aforesaid liquidation distributions to the Holders and any liquidation distributions owed to holders of any class or series of stock of the Company ranking equally with the Series U Preferred Stock in the distribution of assets on any voluntary or involuntary liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Company, the amounts paid to the Holders and to the holders of all such equally ranking stock shall be pro rata in accordance with the respective aggregate liquidating distributions to which they would otherwise be entitled. 
 
 (c) Merger, Consolidation and Sale of Assets Not Liquidation . For purposes of this Section 5, the sale, conveyance, exchange or transfer (for cash, shares of stock, securities or other consideration) of all or substantially all of the property and assets of the Company shall not be deemed a voluntary or involuntary dissolution, liquidation or winding up of the affairs of the Company, nor shall the merger, consolidation or any other business combination transaction of the Company into or with any other corporation or Person or the merger, consolidation or any other business combination transaction of any other corporation or Person into or with the Company be deemed to be a voluntary or involuntary dissolution, liquidation or winding up of the affairs of the Company. 

Section 6. Redemption . 
 
 (a) Optional Redemption . The Company, at the option of its Board of Directors or any duly authorized committee thereof, may redeem out of funds legally available therefor, (i) in whole or in part, from time to time, the shares of Series U Preferred Stock at the time outstanding, on September 12, 2024 and on any dividend period end date on or after December 12, 2024, or (ii) in whole but not in part at any time within 90 days following a Regulatory Capital Event, in each case at a redemption price equal to 25,000 per share plus any declared and unpaid dividends, without accumulation of any undeclared dividends, to, but excluding, the redemption date, upon notice given as provided in Section 6(b) below. 
 
 (b) Notice of Redemption . Notice of every redemption of shares of Series U Preferred Stock shall be mailed by first class mail, postage prepaid, addressed to the Holders of such shares to be redeemed at their respective last addresses appearing on the stock register of the Company. Such mailing shall be at least 15 days and not more than 60 days before the date fixed for redemption. Any notice mailed as provided in this Section 6(b) shall be conclusively presumed to have been duly given, whether or not the Holder receives such notice, but failure duly to give such notice by mail, or any defect in such notice or in the mailing thereof, to any Holder of shares of Series U Preferred Stock designated for redemption shall not affect the validity of the proceedings for the redemption of any other shares of Series U Preferred Stock. Each notice shall state 
 
 (i) the redemption date 
 
 (ii) the total number of shares of Series U Preferred Stock to be redeemed and, if fewer than all the shares of a Holder are to be redeemed, the number of such shares to be redeemed 

(iii) the redemption price 
 
 (iv) the place or places where the certificates for such shares are to be surrendered for payment of the redemption price, if applicable and 
 
 (v) that dividends on the shares to be redeemed will cease to accrue on the redemption date. 
 
 Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the certificates evidencing the shares of Series U Preferred Stock are held of record by a depositary and any related depository shares are held of record by a Depositary or its nominee, the Company may give such notice in any manner permitted by the Depositary. 
 
 (c) Partial Redemption . In case of any redemption of only part of the shares of Series U Preferred Stock at the time outstanding, the shares of Series U Preferred Stock to be redeemed shall be selected (i) pro rata from the Holders in proportion to the number of shares of Series U Preferred Stock held by such Holders, (ii) by lot or (iii) in such other manner as the Board of Directors or any duly authorized committee thereof may determine, in its sole discretion, to be fair and equitable. Subject to the provisions of this Section 6, the Board of Directors or any duly authorized committee thereof shall have full power and authority to prescribe the terms and conditions upon which shares of Series U Preferred Stock shall be redeemed from time to time. 
 
 (d) Effectiveness of Redemption . If notice of redemption has been duly given and if on or before the redemption date specified in the notice all funds necessary for the redemption have been set aside by the Company, separate and apart from its other assets, for the pro rata benefit of the Holders of the shares called for redemption, so as to be and continue to be available therefor, or deposited by the Company with a bank or trust company selected by the Board of Directors or any duly authorized committee thereof (the Trust in trust for the pro rata benefit of the Holders of the shares called for redemption, then, notwithstanding that any certificate for any share so called for redemption has not been surrendered for cancellation, on and after the redemption date all shares so called for redemption shall cease to be outstanding, all dividends with respect to such shares shall cease to accrue on such redemption date, and all rights with respect to such shares shall forthwith on such redemption date cease and terminate, except only the right of the Holders thereof to receive the amount payable on such redemption from the Trust at any time after the redemption date from the funds so deposited, without interest. The Company shall be entitled to receive, from time to time, from the Trust any interest accrued on such funds, and the Holders of any shares called for redemption shall have no claim to any such interest. Any funds so deposited and unclaimed at the end of three years from the redemption date shall, to the extent permitted by law, be released or repaid to the Company, and in the event of such repayment to the Company, the Holders of the shares so called for redemption shall be deemed to be unsecured creditors of the Company for an amount equivalent to the amount deposited as stated above for the redemption of such shares and so repaid to the Company, but shall in no event be entitled to any interest. 

Section 7. Voting Rights . 
 
 (a) General . The Holders shall not be entitled to vote on any matter except as set forth in Section 7(b) below or as required by the Delaware General Corporation Law. 
 
 (b) Special Voting Right . 
 
 (i) Voting Right . If and whenever dividends on the Series U Preferred Stock or any other class or series of preferred stock that ranks on parity with the Series U Preferred Stock as to payment of dividends and upon which voting rights equivalent to those granted by this Section 7(b)(i) have been conferred and are exercisable (any such class or series being referred to herein as dividend parity stock have not been declared and paid in an aggregate amount equal, as to any class or series, to at least three semi-annual or six quarterly dividend periods, as applicable, (whether consecutive or not) (a Nonpayment ), the authorized number of directors constituting the Board of Directors shall be increased by two, and the Holders, together with holders of dividend parity stock, shall have the right, voting separately as a single class without regard to class or series (and with voting rights allocated pro rata based on the liquidation preference of each such class or series), to the exclusion of the holders of Common Stock, to elect two directors of the Company to fill such newly created directorships (and to fill any vacancies in the terms of such directorships), provided that it shall be a qualification for election of any such director that the election of such director shall not cause the Company to violate the corporate governance requirements of the New York Stock Exchange (or other exchange on which the Company s securities may be listed) that listed companies must have a majority of independent directors and further provided that the Board of Directors shall at no time include more than two such directors. Each such director elected by the Holders together with holders of dividend parity stock is a Preferred Stock Director . 
 
 (ii) Election . The election of the Preferred Stock Directors will take place at any annual meeting of stockholders or any special meeting of the Holders and any dividend parity stock, called as provided herein. At any time after the special voting power has vested pursuant to Section 7(b)(i) above, the secretary of the Company may, and upon the written request (addressed to the secretary at the Company s principal office) of the holders of at least 20 of the voting power of the Series U Preferred Stock or the holders of at least 20 of the voting power of any series of dividend parity stock then outstanding (with such voting power measured based on the voting power to elect Preferred Stock Directors), must (unless such request is received less than 90 days before the date fixed for the next annual or special meeting of the stockholders of the Company, in which event such election shall be held at such next annual or special meeting of stockholders), call a special meeting of the holders of Series U Preferred Stock and any dividend parity stock for the purposes of electing Preferred Stock Directors. The Preferred Stock Directors shall each be entitled to one vote per director on any matter. 
 
 (iii) Notice of Special Meeting . Notice for a special meeting to elect Preferred Stock Directors will be given in a similar manner to that provided in the Company s by-laws for a special meeting of the stockholders. If the secretary of the Company does not 

call a special meeting within 20 days after receipt of any such request, then any Holder may (at the expense of the Company) call such meeting, upon notice as provided in this Section 7(b)(iii), and for that purpose will have access to the stock register of the Company. The Preferred Stock Directors elected at any such special meeting and each Preferred Stock Director elected at a subsequent annual or special meeting of stockholders, will be elected for term expiring upon the earlier of the Preferred Stock Director Termination Date and the next annual meeting of stockholders following such Preferred Stock Director's election. In case any vacancy in the office of a Preferred Stock Director occurs (other than prior to the initial election of the Preferred Stock Directors), the vacancy may be filled by the Preferred Stock Director remaining in office, or if none remains in office, by a plurality of the votes cast by the holders of Series U Preferred Stock and any dividend parity stock, voting together as a single class, and the Preferred Stock Director so appointed or elected to fill such vacancy shall serve for a term expiring at the next annual meeting of the stockholders. Preferred Stock Directors may only be elected by the holders of Series U Preferred Stock and dividend parity stock in accordance with this Section 7. If the holders of Series U Preferred Stock and such dividend parity stock fail to elect a sufficient number of directors to fill all directorships for which they are entitled to elect directors pursuant to this Section 7, then any directorship not so filled shall remain vacant until such time as the holders of Series U Preferred Stock and such dividend parity stock elect a person to fill such directorship in accordance with this Section 7, or such vacancy is otherwise filled in accordance with this Section 7 and no such directorship may be filled by stockholders of the Corporation other than in accordance with this Section 7. 
 
 (iv) Termination Removal . Whenever the Company has paid noncumulative dividends in full for at least two consecutive semi-annual or four consecutive quarterly dividend periods following a Nonpayment on the Series U Preferred Stock and on any dividend parity stock entitled to noncumulative dividends and has paid cumulative dividends in full on any dividend parity stock entitled to cumulative dividends, then the right of the Holders to elect the Preferred Stock Directors will cease (but subject always to the same provisions for the vesting of the special voting rights in the case of any similar non-payment of dividends in respect of future dividend periods) (the time of such cessation, the Preferred Stock Director Termination Date ). Upon a Preferred Stock Director Termination Date, the terms of office of the Preferred Stock Directors will immediately terminate, the persons then serving as Preferred Stock Directors shall immediately cease to be qualified to hold office as Preferred Stock Directors, the Preferred Stock Directors shall cease to be directors of the Company and the number of directors constituting the Board of Directors shall be automatically reduced, without any action by the Board of Directors or the stockholders of the Company, by the number of Preferred Stock Directors authorized immediately prior to such termination. Any Preferred Stock Director may be removed at any time without cause by the holders of a majority of the voting power of outstanding shares of the capital stock then entitled to vote in the election of Preferred Stock Directors, voting together as a single class (with such voting power measured based on the voting power to elect Preferred Stock Directors). 

(c) Senior Issuances Adverse Changes . So long as any shares of Series U Preferred Stock are outstanding, but subject to the final paragraph of this Section 7(c), in addition to any other vote or consent of holders of the Company s capital stock required by Delaware law, the vote or consent of the holders of at least two-thirds of the voting power of the Series U Preferred Stock and the holders of any other preferred stock entitled to vote thereon, voting together as a single class, given in person or by proxy at an annual or special meeting of stockholders, or given in writing without a meeting, will be necessary for effecting or validating any of the following actions, whether or not such approval is required by Delaware law 
 
 (i) any amendment, alteration or repeal of any provision of the Company s certificate of incorporation (including the certificate of designations creating the Series U Preferred Stock) or the Company s by-laws that would alter or change the voting powers, preferences, economic rights or special rights of the Series U Preferred Stock so as to affect them adversely 
 
 (ii) any amendment or alteration of the Company s certificate of incorporation to authorize or create, or increase the authorized amount of, any shares of, or any securities convertible into shares of, any class or series of the Company's capital stock ranking prior to the Series U Preferred Stock in the payment of dividends or in the distribution of assets on any liquidation, dissolution, or winding up of the Company or 
 
 (iii) the consummation of a binding share exchange or reclassification involving the Series U Preferred Stock or a merger or consolidation of the Company with another entity, except that holders of Series U Preferred Stock will have no right to vote under this provision or otherwise under Delaware law if in each case (i) the Series U Preferred Stock remains outstanding or, in the case of any such merger or consolidation with respect to which the Company is not the surviving or resulting entity, is converted into or exchanged for preferred securities of the surviving or resulting entity or its ultimate parent, that is an entity organized and existing under the laws of the United States of America, any state thereof or the District of Columbia and that is a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes (or if such entity is not a corporation, the Company having received an opinion of nationally recognized counsel experienced in such matters to the effect that Holders will be subject to tax for U.S. federal income tax purposes with respect to such new preferred securities after such merger or consolidation in the same amount, at the same time and otherwise in the same manner as would have been the case under the Series U Preferred Stock prior to such merger or consolidation), and (ii) such Series U Preferred Stock remaining outstanding or such preferred securities, as the case may be, have such rights, preferences, privileges and voting powers, taken as a whole, as are not materially less favorable to the holders thereof than the rights, preferences, privileges and voting powers of the Series U Preferred Stock, taken as a whole 
 provided, however , that, for the avoidance of doubt, any increase in the amount of the authorized or issued Series U Preferred Stock or authorized preferred stock or any securities convertible into preferred stock or the creation and issuance, or an increase in the authorized or issued amount, of other series of preferred stock or any securities convertible into preferred stock ranking equally with and or junior to the Series U 

Preferred Stock with respect to the payment of dividends (whether such dividends are cumulative or noncumulative) and or the distribution of assets upon the Company s liquidation, dissolution or winding up will not be deemed to adversely affect the voting powers, preferences or special rights of the Series U Preferred Stock, and no stockholder will have the right to vote on such an increase, creation or issuance by reason of this Section 7. 
 If any amendment, alteration, repeal, share exchange, reclassification, merger or consolidation specified in this Section 7(c) would adversely affect one or more but not all series of preferred stock of the Company, then only such series of preferred stock as are adversely affected by and entitled to vote on the matter shall vote on the matter together with the Series U Preferred Stock as a single class (in lieu of all other series of preferred stock) for purposes of the vote or consent required by this Section 7(c). 
 (d) No Vote if Redemption . No vote or consent of the Holders shall be required pursuant to Section 7(b) or 7(c) if, at or prior to the time when the act with respect to such vote or consent would otherwise be required shall be effected, the Company shall have redeemed or shall have called for redemption all outstanding shares of Series U Preferred Stock, with proper notice and sufficient funds having been set aside for such redemption, in each case pursuant to Section 6 above. 

Section 8. Preemption and Conversion Rights . 
 
 The Holders shall not have any preemptive rights or conversion rights as a result of the terms hereof. 

Section 9. Rank . 
 
 For the avoidance of doubt, the Board of Directors or any duly authorized committee thereof may, without the vote of the Holders, authorize and issue additional shares of Junior Stock or shares of any class or series of stock of the Company now existing or hereafter authorized that ranks equally with the Series U Preferred Stock in the payment of dividends or in the distribution of assets on any voluntary or involuntary liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Company.

The Preferred Stock Directors elected at any such special meeting and each Preferred Stock Director elected at a subsequent annual or special meeting of stockholders, will be elected for term expiring upon the earlier of the Preferred Stock Director Termination Date and the next annual meeting of stockholders following such Preferred Stock Director's election. In case any vacancy in the office of a Preferred Stock Director occurs (other than prior to the initial election of the Preferred Stock Directors), the vacancy may be filled by the Preferred Stock Director remaining in office, or if none remains in office, by a plurality of the votes cast by the holders of Series V Preferred Stock and any dividend parity stock, voting together as a single class, and the Preferred Stock Director so appointed or elected to fill such vacancy shall serve for a term expiring at the next annual meeting of the stockholders. Preferred Stock Directors may only be elected by the holders of Series V Preferred Stock and dividend parity stock in accordance with this Section 7. If the holders of Series V Preferred Stock and such dividend parity stock fail to elect a sufficient number of directors to fill all directorships for which they are entitled to elect directors pursuant to this Section 7, then any directorship not so filled shall remain vacant until such time as the holders of Series V Preferred Stock and such dividend parity stock elect a person to fill such directorship in accordance with this Section 7, or such vacancy is otherwise filled in accordance with this Section 7 and no such directorship may be filled by stockholders of the Corporation other than in accordance with this Section 7. 
 
 (iv) Termination Removal . Whenever the Company has paid noncumulative dividends in full for at least two consecutive semi-annual or four consecutive quarterly dividend periods following a Nonpayment on the Series V Preferred Stock and on any dividend parity stock entitled to noncumulative dividends and has paid cumulative dividends in full on any dividend parity stock entitled to cumulative dividends, then the 

right of the Holders to elect the Preferred Stock Directors will cease (but subject always to the same provisions for the vesting of the special voting rights in the case of any similar non-payment of dividends in respect of future dividend periods) (the time of such cessation, the Preferred Stock Director Termination Date ). Upon a Preferred Stock Director Termination Date, the terms of office of the Preferred Stock Directors will immediately terminate, the persons then serving as Preferred Stock Directors shall immediately cease to be qualified to hold office as Preferred Stock Directors, the Preferred Stock Directors shall cease to be directors of the Company and the number of directors constituting the Board of Directors shall be automatically reduced, without any action by the Board of Directors or the stockholders of the Company, by the number of Preferred Stock Directors authorized immediately prior to such termination. Any Preferred Stock Director may be removed at any time without cause by the holders of a majority of the voting power of outstanding shares of the capital stock then entitled to vote in the election of Preferred Stock Directors, voting together as a single class (with such voting power measured based on the voting power to elect Preferred Stock Directors).

 If any amendment, alteration, repeal, share exchange, reclassification, merger or consolidation specified in this Section 7(c) would adversely affect one or more but not all series of preferred stock of the Company, then only such series of preferred stock as are adversely affected by and entitled to vote on the matter shall vote on the matter together with the Series V Preferred Stock as a single class (in lieu of all other series of preferred stock) for purposes of the vote or consent required by this Section 7(c). 
 (d) No Vote if Redemption . No vote or consent of the Holders shall be required pursuant to Section 7(b) or 7(c) if, at or prior to the time when the act with respect to such vote or consent would otherwise be required shall be effected, the Company shall have redeemed or shall have called for redemption all outstanding shares of Series V Preferred Stock, with proper notice and sufficient funds having been set aside for such redemption, in each case pursuant to Section 6 above.

 Except as provided below, for so long as any share of Series W Preferred Stock remains outstanding, if dividends are not declared and paid in full upon the shares of Series W Preferred Stock and any class or series of stock of the Company now existing or hereafter authorized that ranks equally with the Series W Preferred Stock in the payment of dividends, all dividends declared upon shares of Series W Preferred Stock and such other stock will be declared on a proportional basis so that the amount of dividends declared per share will bear to each other the same ratio that accrued dividends for the then-current dividend period per share of Series W Preferred Stock and accrued dividends for the then-current dividend period per share of such other stock (including, in the case of any such other stock that bears cumulative dividends, all accrued and unpaid dividends) bear to each other. 
 Subject to the foregoing, and not otherwise, such dividends payable in cash, stock or otherwise, as may be determined by the Board of Directors or any duly authorized committee thereof, may be declared and paid on any other class or series of stock of the Company from time 

to time out of any funds legally available for such payment, and Holders will not be entitled to participate in those dividends.

Holders shall not be entitled to any further payments in the event of any such voluntary or involuntary liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the affairs of the Company other than what is expressly provided for in this Section 5. 
 (b) Partial Payment . If the assets of the Company are not sufficient to pay in full the aforesaid liquidation distributions to the Holders and any liquidation distributions owed to holders of any class or series of stock of the Company ranking equally with the Series W Preferred Stock in the distribution of assets on any voluntary or involuntary liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Company, the amounts paid to the Holders and to the holders of all such equally ranking stock shall be pro rata in accordance with the respective aggregate liquidating distributions to which they would otherwise be entitled. 
 
 (c) Merger, Consolidation and Sale of Assets Not Liquidation . For purposes of this Section 5, the sale, conveyance, exchange or transfer (for cash, shares of stock, securities or other consideration) of all or substantially all of the property and assets of the Company shall not be deemed a voluntary or involuntary dissolution, liquidation or winding up of the affairs of the Company, nor shall the merger, consolidation or any other business combination transaction of the Company into or with any other corporation or Person or the merger, consolidation or any other business combination transaction of any other corporation or Person into or with the Company be deemed to be a voluntary or involuntary dissolution, liquidation or winding up of the affairs of the Company.

Such mailing shall be at least 5 days and not more than 30 days before the date fixed for redemption. Any notice mailed as provided in this Section 6(b) shall be conclusively presumed to have been duly given, whether or not the Holder receives such notice, but failure duly to give such notice by mail, or any defect in such notice or in the mailing thereof, to any Holder of shares of Series W Preferred Stock designated for redemption shall not affect the validity of the proceedings for the redemption of any other shares of Series W Preferred Stock. Each notice shall state 
 
 (i) the redemption date 
 
 (ii) the total number of shares of Series W Preferred Stock to be redeemed and, if fewer than all the shares of a Holder are to be redeemed, the number of such shares to be redeemed 
 
 (iii) the redemption price 
 
 (iv) the place or places where the certificates for such shares are to be surrendered for payment of the redemption price, if applicable and

 (c) Partial Redemption . In case of any redemption of only part of the shares of Series W Preferred Stock at the time outstanding, the shares of Series W Preferred Stock to be redeemed shall be selected (i) pro rata from the Holders in proportion to the number of shares of Series W Preferred Stock held by such Holders, (ii) by lot or (iii) in such other manner as the Board of Directors or any duly authorized committee thereof may determine, in its sole discretion, to be fair and equitable. Subject to the provisions of this Section 6, the Board of Directors or any duly authorized committee thereof shall have full power and authority to prescribe the terms and conditions upon which shares of Series W Preferred Stock shall be redeemed from time to time. 
 
 (d) Effectiveness of Redemption . If notice of redemption has been duly given and if on or before the redemption date specified in the notice all funds necessary for the redemption have been set aside by the Company, separate and apart from its other assets, for the pro rata benefit of the Holders of the shares called for redemption, so as to be and continue to be available therefor, or deposited by the Company with a bank or trust company selected by the Board of Directors or any duly authorized committee thereof (the Trust in trust for the pro rata benefit of the Holders of the shares called for redemption, then, notwithstanding that any certificate for any share so called for redemption has not been surrendered for cancellation, on and after the 

redemption date all shares so called for redemption shall cease to be outstanding, all dividends with respect to such shares shall cease to accrue on such redemption date, and all rights with respect to such shares shall forthwith on such redemption date cease and terminate, except only the right of the Holders thereof to receive the amount payable on such redemption from the Trust at any time after the redemption date from the funds so deposited, without interest. The Company shall be entitled to receive, from time to time, from the Trust any interest accrued on such funds, and the Holders of any shares called for redemption shall have no claim to any such interest. Any funds so deposited and unclaimed at the end of three years from the redemption date shall, to the extent permitted by law, be released or repaid to the Company, and in the event of such repayment to the Company, the Holders of the shares so called for redemption shall be deemed to be unsecured creditors of the Company for an amount equivalent to the amount deposited as stated above for the redemption of such shares and so repaid to the Company, but shall in no event be entitled to any interest. 

Section 7. Voting Rights . 
 
 (a) General . The Holders shall not be entitled to vote on any matter except as set forth in Section 7(b) below or as required by the Delaware General Corporation Law. 
 
 (b) Special Voting Right . 
 
 (i) Voting Right . If and whenever dividends on the Series W Preferred Stock or any other class or series of preferred stock that ranks on parity with the Series W Preferred Stock as to payment of dividends and upon which voting rights equivalent to those granted by this Section 7(b)(i) have been conferred and are exercisable (any such class or series being referred to herein as dividend parity stock have not been declared and paid in an aggregate amount equal, as to any class or series, to at least three semi-annual or six quarterly dividend periods, as applicable, (whether consecutive or not) (a Nonpayment ), the authorized number of directors constituting the Board of Directors shall be increased by two, and the Holders, together with holders of dividend parity stock, shall have the right, voting separately as a single class without regard to class or series (and with voting rights allocated pro rata based on the liquidation preference of each such class or series), to the exclusion of the holders of Common Stock, to elect two directors of the Company to fill such newly created directorships (and to fill any vacancies in the terms of such directorships), provided that it shall be a qualification for election of any such director that the election of such director shall not cause the Company to violate the corporate governance requirements of the New York Stock Exchange (or other exchange on which the Company s securities may be listed) that listed companies must have a majority of independent directors and further provided that the Board of Directors shall at no time include more than two such directors. Each such director elected by the Holders together with holders of dividend parity stock is a Preferred Stock Director . 
 
 (ii) Election . The election of the Preferred Stock Directors will take place at any annual meeting of stockholders or any special meeting of the Holders and any dividend parity stock, called as provided herein. At any time after the special voting power has vested pursuant to Section 7(b)(i) above, the secretary of the Company may, and upon the written request (addressed to the secretary at the Company s principal office) of the holders of at least 20 of 

the voting power of the Series W Preferred Stock or the holders of at least 20 of the voting power of any series of dividend parity stock then outstanding (with such voting power measured based on the voting power to elect Preferred Stock Directors), must (unless such request is received less than 90 days before the date fixed for the next annual or special meeting of the stockholders of the Company, in which event such election shall be held at such next annual or special meeting of stockholders), call a special meeting of the holders of Series W Preferred Stock and any dividend parity stock for the purposes of electing Preferred Stock Directors. The Preferred Stock Directors shall each be entitled to one vote per director on any matter. 
 
 (iii) Notice of Special Meeting . Notice for a special meeting to elect Preferred Stock Directors will be given in a similar manner to that provided in the Company s by-laws for a special meeting of the stockholders. If the secretary of the Company does not call a special meeting within 20 days after receipt of any such request, then any Holder may (at the expense of the Company) call such meeting, upon notice as provided in this Section 7(b)(iii), and for that purpose will have access to the stock register of the Company. The Preferred Stock Directors elected at any such special meeting and each Preferred Stock Director elected at a subsequent annual or special meeting of stockholders, will be elected for term expiring upon the earlier of the Preferred Stock Director Termination Date and the next annual meeting of stockholders following such Preferred Stock Director's election. In case any vacancy in the office of a Preferred Stock Director occurs (other than prior to the initial election of the Preferred Stock Directors), the vacancy may be filled by the Preferred Stock Director remaining in office, or if none remains in office, by a plurality of the votes cast by the holders of Series W Preferred Stock and any dividend parity stock, voting together as a single class, and the Preferred Stock Director so appointed or elected to fill such vacancy shall serve for a term expiring at the next annual meeting of the stockholders. Preferred Stock Directors may only be elected by the holders of Series W Preferred Stock and dividend parity stock in accordance with this Section 7. If the holders of Series W Preferred Stock and such dividend parity stock fail to elect a sufficient number of directors to fill all directorships for which they are entitled to elect directors pursuant to this Section 7, then any directorship not so filled shall remain vacant until such time as the holders of Series W Preferred Stock and such dividend parity stock elect a person to fill such directorship in accordance with this Section 7, or such vacancy is otherwise filled in accordance with this Section 7 and no such directorship may be filled by stockholders of the Company other than in accordance with this Section 7. 
 
 (iv) Termination Removal . Whenever the Company has paid noncumulative dividends in full for at least two consecutive semi-annual or four consecutive quarterly dividend periods following a Nonpayment on the Series W Preferred Stock and on any dividend parity stock entitled to noncumulative dividends and has paid cumulative dividends in full on any dividend parity stock entitled to cumulative dividends, then the right of the Holders to elect the Preferred Stock Directors will cease (but subject always to the same provisions for the vesting of the special voting rights in the case of any similar non-payment of dividends in respect of future dividend periods) (the time of such cessation, the Preferred Stock Director Termination Date ). Upon a Preferred Stock Director Termination Date, the terms of office of the Preferred Stock Directors will immediately terminate, the persons then serving as Preferred Stock Directors shall immediately cease to be qualified to hold office as Preferred Stock Directors, the Preferred Stock Directors shall cease to be directors of the Company and the number of directors constituting the Board of Directors shall be automatically reduced, without any action by the Board of Directors 

or the stockholders of the Company, by the number of Preferred Stock Directors authorized immediately prior to such termination. Any Preferred Stock Director may be removed at any time without cause by the holders of a majority of the voting power of outstanding shares of the capital stock then entitled to vote in the election of Preferred Stock Directors, voting together as a single class (with such voting power measured based on the voting power to elect Preferred Stock Directors).

 (i) any amendment, alteration or repeal of any provision of the Company s certificate of incorporation (including the certificate of designations creating the Series W Preferred Stock) or the Company s by-laws that would alter or change the voting powers, preferences, economic rights or special rights of the Series W Preferred Stock so as to affect them adversely 
 
 (ii) any amendment or alteration of the Company s certificate of incorporation to authorize or create, or increase the authorized amount of, any shares of, or any securities convertible into shares of, any class or series of the Company's capital stock ranking prior to the Series W Preferred Stock in the payment of dividends or in the distribution of assets on any liquidation, dissolution, or winding up of the Company or 
 
 (iii) the consummation of a binding share exchange or reclassification involving the Series W Preferred Stock or a merger or consolidation of the Company with another entity, except that holders of Series W Preferred Stock will have no right to vote under this provision or otherwise under Delaware law if in each case (i) the Series W Preferred Stock remains outstanding or, in the case of any such merger or consolidation with respect to which the Company is not the surviving or resulting entity, is converted into or exchanged for preferred securities of the surviving or resulting entity or its ultimate parent, that is an entity organized and existing under the laws of the United States of America, any state thereof or the District of Columbia and that is a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes (or if such entity is not a corporation, the Company having received an opinion of nationally recognized counsel experienced in such matters to the effect that Holders will be subject to tax for U.S. federal income tax purposes with respect to such new preferred securities after such merger or consolidation in the same amount, at the same time and otherwise in the same manner as would have been the case under the Series W Preferred Stock prior to such merger or consolidation), and (ii) such Series W Preferred Stock remaining outstanding or such preferred securities, as the case may be, have such rights, preferences, privileges and voting powers, taken as a whole, as are not materially less favorable to the holders thereof than the rights, preferences, privileges and voting powers of the Series W Preferred Stock, taken as a whole 
 provided, however , that, for the avoidance of doubt, any increase in the amount of the authorized or issued Series W Preferred Stock or authorized preferred stock or any securities 

convertible into preferred stock or the creation and issuance, or an increase in the authorized or issued amount, of other series of preferred stock or any securities convertible into preferred stock ranking equally with and or junior to the Series W Preferred Stock with respect to the payment of dividends (whether such dividends are cumulative or noncumulative) and or the distribution of assets upon the Company s liquidation, dissolution or winding up will not be deemed to adversely affect the voting powers, preferences or special rights of the Series W Preferred Stock, and no stockholder will have the right to vote on such an increase, creation or issuance by reason of this Section 7. 
 If any amendment, alteration, repeal, share exchange, reclassification, merger or consolidation specified in this Section 7(c) would adversely affect one or more but not all series of preferred stock of the Company, then only such series of preferred stock as are adversely affected by and entitled to vote on the matter shall vote on the matter together with the Series W Preferred Stock as a single class (in lieu of all other series of preferred stock) for purposes of the vote or consent required by this Section 7(c). 
 (d) No Vote if Redemption . No vote or consent of the Holders shall be required pursuant to Section 7(b) or 7(c) if, at or prior to the time when the act with respect to such vote or consent would otherwise be required shall be effected, the Company shall have redeemed or shall have called for redemption all outstanding shares of Series W Preferred Stock, with proper notice and sufficient funds having been set aside for such redemption, in each case pursuant to Section 6 above. 

Section 8. Preemption and Conversion Rights .

 a. Rate . Holders shall be entitled to receive, when, as and if declared by the Board of Directors or any duly authorized committee thereof, but only out of funds legally available therefor, noncumulative cash dividends on each share of Series X Preferred Stock in the amounts specified below in this Section 4, and no more, payable on the 18th of each February, May, August and November (each, a dividend payment date ), (i) quarterly in arrears from, and including, the date of issuance to, but excluding, February 18, 2026 (the First Reset Date ), at an annual rate of 3.875 on the liquidation preference of 25,000 per share, beginning on May 18, 2021, and (ii) from, and including the First Reset Date, for each reset period, at an annual rate equal to the five-year treasury rate as of the most recent reset dividend determination date (as described below) plus 3.417 on the liquidation preference of 25,000 per share, quarterly in arrears, beginning on May 18, 2026. 
 
 The record date for payment of dividends on the Series X Preferred Stock will be the record date fixed by the Board of Directors or any other duly authorized committee thereof that is not more than 30 nor less than 10 days prior to such dividend payment date (each, a Dividend Record Date ). Any such day that is a Dividend Record Date will be a Dividend Record Date whether or not such day is a business day. 
 
 For any reset period beginning on or after the First Reset Date, the five-year treasury rate will be 
 
 The average of the yields on actively traded U.S. treasury securities adjusted to constant maturity, for five-year maturities, for the five business days appearing under the caption Treasury Constant Maturities in the most recently published statistical release designated H.15 Daily Update or any successor publication which is published by the Federal Reserve Board as of 5 00 p.m. (Eastern Time) as of any date of determination, as determined by the Calculation Agent in its sole discretion. 
 
 If no calculation is provided as described above, then the Company (or such affiliate) will use a substitute or successor rate that it has determined, in its sole discretion after consulting any source it deems to be reasonable, is (i) the industry-accepted substitute or successor for the five-year treasury rate or (ii) if there is no such industry-accepted substitute or successor for the five-year treasury rate, a substitute or successor rate that is most comparable to the five-year treasury rate. Upon selection of a substitute or 
 successor rate, the Company (or such affiliate) may determine, in its sole discretion after consulting any source it deems to be reasonable, the day count convention, the business day convention, the definition of business day, the reset dividend determination date and any other relevant methodology or definition for calculating such substitute or successor rate, including 

any adjustment factor it determines is needed to make such substitute or successor rate comparable to the five-year treasury rate, in a manner that is consistent with any industry-accepted practices for such substitute or successor rate. 
 
 The five-year treasury rate will be determined on each reset dividend determination date. 

With respect to any dividend period, any dividends on the Series X Preferred Stock will be calculated on the basis of a 360-day year of twelve 30-day months, and dividend period means the period from, and including, each dividend payment date to, but excluding, the next succeeding dividend payment date, except for the initial dividend period, which will be the period from, and including, the date of issuance of the Series X Preferred Stock to, but excluding, the first dividend payment date. In the event that any dividend payment date is not a business day, then payment of any dividend payable on such date will be made on the next succeeding business day and without any additional dividend accrual or other payment in respect of any such postponement. 
 
 Any determination, decision or election that may be made by the Company (or one of its affiliates) pursuant to the provisions described above, including any determination with respect to tenor, rate or adjustment or of the occurrence or non-occurrence of an event, circumstance or date and any decision to take or refrain from taking any action or any selection, will be conclusive and binding absent manifest error, will be made in the Company s (or such affiliate s) sole discretion, and, notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Certificate of Designations, shall become effective without consent from the holders of the Series X Preferred Stock or any other party. 
 
 All percentages resulting from any calculation of the dividend rate will be rounded, if necessary, to the nearest 1 100,000 of 1 (.0000001), with five one-millionths of a percentage point rounded upward. All currency amounts used in, or resulting from, the calculation on the Series X Preferred Stock will be rounded to the nearest one-hundredth of a unit. For purposes of rounding, .005 of a unit shall be rounded upward. 
 
 (b) Noncumulative Dividends . If the Board of Directors or any duly authorized committee thereof does not declare a dividend on the Series X Preferred Stock for any dividend period prior to the related dividend payment date, that dividend will not accrue, and the Company will have no obligation to pay, and Holders shall have no right to receive, a dividend for that dividend period on the related dividend payment date or at any future time, whether or not dividends on the Series X Preferred Stock or any other series of preferred stock or common stock are declared for any subsequent period. References herein to the accrual of dividends refer only to the determination of the amount of such dividend and do not imply that any right to a dividend arises prior to the date on which a dividend is declared. 
 
 (c) Priority of Dividends . So long as any share of Series X Preferred Stock remains outstanding, unless as to a dividend payment date full dividends on all outstanding shares of the Series X Preferred Stock have been declared and paid or declared and a sum sufficient for the payment of those dividends has been set aside for the dividend period then ending, the Company 

will not, and will cause its subsidiaries not to, during the next succeeding dividend period, declare or pay any dividend on, make any distributions relating to, or redeem, purchase, acquire or make a liquidation payment relating to, any Junior Stock, or make any guarantee payment with respect thereto, other than 
 (i) purchases, redemptions or other acquisitions of shares of Junior Stock in connection with any employment contract, benefit plan or other similar arrangement with or for the benefit of employees, officers, directors or consultants 
 
 (ii) purchases of shares of Common Stock pursuant to a contractually binding requirement to buy stock existing prior to the commencement of the then-current dividend period, including under a contractually binding stock repurchase plan 
 
 (iii) as a result of an exchange or conversion of any class or series of Junior Stock for any other class or series of Junior Stock 
 
 (iv) the purchase of fractional interests in shares of Junior Stock pursuant to the conversion or exchange provisions of such Junior Stock or the security being converted or exchanged 
 
 (v) the purchase of Junior Stock by an investment banking subsidiary of the Company in connection with the distribution thereof or 
 
 (vi) the purchase of Junior Stock by any investment banking subsidiary of the Company in connection with market-making or other secondary market activities in the ordinary course of the business of such subsidiary. 
 
 The restrictions set forth in the preceding provisions of this Section 4(c) shall not apply to any Junior Stock dividends paid by the Company where the dividend is in the form of the same stock (or the right to buy the same stock) as that on which the dividend is being paid. 
 Except as provided below, for so long as any share of Series X Preferred Stock remains outstanding, if dividends are not declared and paid in full upon the shares of Series X Preferred Stock and any class or series of stock of the Company now existing or hereafter authorized that ranks equally with the Series X Preferred Stock in the payment of dividends, all dividends declared upon shares of Series X Preferred Stock and such other stock will be declared on a proportional basis so that the amount of dividends declared per share will bear to each other the same ratio that accrued dividends for the then-current dividend period per share of Series X Preferred Stock and accrued dividends for the then-current dividend period per share of such other stock (including, in the case of any such other stock that bears cumulative dividends, all accrued and unpaid dividends) bear to each other. 
 Subject to the foregoing, and not otherwise, such dividends payable in cash, stock or otherwise, as may be determined by the Board of Directors or any duly authorized committee thereof, may be declared and paid on any other class or series of stock of the Company from time to time out of any funds legally available for such payment, and Holders will not be entitled to participate in those dividends. 

Section 5. Liquidation Rights . 
 
 (a) Liquidation . In the event of any voluntary or involuntary liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the affairs of the Company, Holders shall be entitled, out of funds legally available therefor, before any distribution or payment may be made by the Company or set aside for the holders of any Junior Stock and subject to the rights of the holders of any class or series of stock ranking senior to or on parity with Series X Preferred Stock upon liquidation and the rights of the Company s depositors and other creditors, to receive in full a liquidating distribution in the amount of the liquidation preference of 25,000 per share (the Series X Liquidation Preference ), plus any accrued dividends thereon from the last dividend payment date to, but excluding, the date of the liquidation, dissolution or winding up if and to the extent declared but not yet paid. Holders shall not be entitled to any further payments in the event of any such voluntary or involuntary liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the affairs of the Company other than what is expressly provided for in this Section 5. 
 (b) Partial Payment . If the assets of the Company are not sufficient to pay in full the aforesaid liquidation distributions to the Holders and any liquidation distributions owed to holders of any class or series of stock of the Company ranking equally with the Series X Preferred Stock in the distribution of assets on any voluntary or involuntary liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Company, the amounts paid to the Holders and to the holders of all such equally ranking stock shall be pro rata in accordance with the respective aggregate liquidating distributions to which they would otherwise be entitled. 
 
 (c) Merger, Consolidation and Sale of Assets Not Liquidation . For purposes of this Section 5, the sale, conveyance, exchange or transfer (for cash, shares of stock, securities or other consideration) of all or substantially all of the property and assets of the Company shall not be deemed a voluntary or involuntary dissolution, liquidation or winding up of the affairs of the Company, nor shall the merger, consolidation or any other business combination transaction of the Company into or with any other corporation or Person or the merger, consolidation or any other business combination transaction of any other corporation or Person into or with the Company be deemed to be a voluntary or involuntary dissolution, liquidation or winding up of the affairs of the Company. 

Section 6. Redemption . 
 
 (a) Optional Redemption . The Company, at the option of its Board of Directors or any duly authorized committee thereof, may redeem out of funds legally available therefor, (i) in whole at any time or in part, from time to time, the shares of Series X Preferred Stock at the time outstanding, on any dividend payment date beginning on or after the First Reset Date, or (ii) in whole but not in part at any time within 90 days following a Regulatory Capital Event, in each case at a redemption price equal to 25,000 per share plus any declared and unpaid dividends, without accumulation of any undeclared dividends, to, but excluding, the redemption date, upon notice given as provided in Section 6(b) below. 
 
 (b) Notice of Redemption . Notice of every redemption of shares of Series X Preferred Stock shall be mailed by first class mail, postage prepaid, addressed to the Holders of such shares to be redeemed at their respective last addresses appearing on the stock register of the Company. 

Such mailing shall be at least 5 days and not more than 30 days before the date fixed for redemption. Any notice mailed as provided in this Section 6(b) shall be conclusively presumed to have been duly given, whether or not the Holder receives such notice, but failure duly to give such notice by mail, or any defect in such notice or in the mailing thereof, to any Holder of shares of Series X Preferred Stock designated for redemption shall not affect the validity of the proceedings for the redemption of any other shares of Series X Preferred Stock. Each notice shall state 
 
 (i) the redemption date 
 
 (ii) the total number of shares of Series X Preferred Stock to be redeemed and, if fewer than all the shares of a Holder are to be redeemed, the number of such shares to be redeemed 
 
 (iii) the redemption price 
 
 (iv) the place or places where the certificates for such shares are to be surrendered for payment of the redemption price, if applicable and 
 
 (v) that dividends on the shares to be redeemed will cease to accrue on the redemption date. 
 
 Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the certificates evidencing the shares of Series X Preferred Stock are held of record by a depositary and any related depository shares are held of record by a Depositary or its nominee, the Company may give such notice in any manner permitted by the Depositary. 
 
 (c) Partial Redemption . In case of any redemption of only part of the shares of Series X Preferred Stock at the time outstanding, the shares of Series X Preferred Stock to be redeemed shall be selected (i) pro rata from the Holders in proportion to the number of shares of Series X Preferred Stock held by such Holders, (ii) by lot or (iii) in such other manner as the Board of Directors or any duly authorized committee thereof may determine, in its sole discretion, to be fair and equitable. Subject to the provisions of this Section 6, the Board of Directors or any duly authorized committee thereof shall have full power and authority to prescribe the terms and conditions upon which shares of Series X Preferred Stock shall be redeemed from time to time. 
 
 (d) Effectiveness of Redemption . If notice of redemption has been duly given and if on or before the redemption date specified in the notice all funds necessary for the redemption have been set aside by the Company, separate and apart from its other assets, for the pro rata benefit of the Holders of the shares called for redemption, so as to be and continue to be available therefor, or deposited by the Company with a bank or trust company selected by the Board of Directors or any duly authorized committee thereof (the Trust in trust for the pro rata benefit of the Holders of the shares called for redemption, then, notwithstanding that any certificate for any share so called for redemption has not been surrendered for cancellation, on and after the redemption date all shares so called for redemption shall cease to be outstanding, all dividends with respect to such shares shall cease to accrue on such redemption date, and all rights with respect to such shares shall forthwith on such redemption date cease and terminate, except only 

the right of the Holders thereof to receive the amount payable on such redemption from the Trust at any time after the redemption date from the funds so deposited, without interest. The Company shall be entitled to receive, from time to time, from the Trust any interest accrued on such funds, and the Holders of any shares called for redemption shall have no claim to any such interest. Any funds so deposited and unclaimed at the end of three years from the redemption date shall, to the extent permitted by law, be released or repaid to the Company, and in the event of such repayment to the Company, the Holders of the shares so called for redemption shall be deemed to be unsecured creditors of the Company for an amount equivalent to the amount deposited as stated above for the redemption of such shares and so repaid to the Company, but shall in no event be entitled to any interest. 

Section 7. Voting Rights . 
 
 (a) General . The Holders shall not be entitled to vote on any matter except as set forth in Section 7(b) below or as required by the Delaware General Corporation Law. 
 
 (b) Special Voting Right . 
 
 (i) Voting Right . If and whenever dividends on the Series X Preferred Stock or any other class or series of preferred stock that ranks on parity with the Series X Preferred Stock as to payment of dividends and upon which voting rights equivalent to those granted by this Section 7(b)(i) have been conferred and are exercisable (any such class or series being referred to herein as dividend parity stock have not been declared and paid in an aggregate amount equal, as to any class or series, to at least three semi-annual or six quarterly dividend periods, as applicable, (whether consecutive or not) (a Nonpayment ), the authorized number of directors constituting the Board of Directors shall be increased by two, and the Holders, together with holders of dividend parity stock, shall have the right, voting separately as a single class without regard to class or series (and with voting rights allocated pro rata based on the liquidation preference of each such class or series), to the exclusion of the holders of Common Stock, to elect two directors of the Company to fill such newly created directorships (and to fill any vacancies in the terms of such directorships), provided that it shall be a qualification for election of any such director that the election of such director shall not cause the Company to violate the corporate governance requirements of the New York Stock Exchange (or other exchange on which the Company s securities may be listed) that listed companies must have a majority of independent directors and further provided that the Board of Directors shall at no time include more than two such directors. Each such director elected by the Holders together with holders of dividend parity stock is a Preferred Stock Director . 
 
 (ii) Election . The election of the Preferred Stock Directors will take place at any annual meeting of stockholders or any special meeting of the Holders and any dividend parity stock, called as provided herein. At any time after the special voting power has vested pursuant to Section 7(b)(i) above, the secretary of the Company may, and upon the written request (addressed to the secretary at the Company s principal office) of the holders of at least 20 of the voting power of the Series X Preferred Stock or the holders of at least 20 of the voting power of any series of dividend parity stock then outstanding (with such voting power measured based on the voting power to elect Preferred Stock Directors), must (unless such request is 

received less than 90 days before the date fixed for the next annual or special meeting of the stockholders of the Company, in which event such election shall be held at such next annual or special meeting of stockholders), call a special meeting of the holders of Series X Preferred Stock and any dividend parity stock for the purposes of electing Preferred Stock Directors. The Preferred Stock Directors shall each be entitled to one vote per director on any matter. 
 
 (iii) Notice of Special Meeting . Notice for a special meeting to elect Preferred Stock Directors will be given in a similar manner to that provided in the Company s by-laws for a special meeting of the stockholders. If the secretary of the Company does not call a special meeting within 20 days after receipt of any such request, then any Holder may (at the expense of the Company) call such meeting, upon notice as provided in this Section 7(b)(iii), and for that purpose will have access to the stock register of the Company. The Preferred Stock Directors elected at any such special meeting and each Preferred Stock Director elected at a subsequent annual or special meeting of stockholders, will be elected for term expiring upon the earlier of the Preferred Stock Director Termination Date and the next annual meeting of stockholders following such Preferred Stock Director's election. In case any vacancy in the office of a Preferred Stock Director occurs (other than prior to the initial election of the Preferred Stock Directors), the vacancy may be filled by the Preferred Stock Director remaining in office, or if none remains in office, by a plurality of the votes cast by the holders of Series X Preferred Stock and any dividend parity stock, voting together as a single class, and the Preferred Stock Director so appointed or elected to fill such vacancy shall serve for a term expiring at the next annual meeting of the stockholders. Preferred Stock Directors may only be elected by the holders of Series X Preferred Stock and dividend parity stock in accordance with this Section 7. If the holders of Series X Preferred Stock and such dividend parity stock fail to elect a sufficient number of directors to fill all directorships for which they are entitled to elect directors pursuant to this Section 7, then any directorship not so filled shall remain vacant until such time as the holders of Series X Preferred Stock and such dividend parity stock elect a person to fill such directorship in accordance with this Section 7, or such vacancy is otherwise filled in accordance with this Section 7 and no such directorship may be filled by stockholders of the Company other than in accordance with this Section 7. 
 
 (iv) Termination Removal . Whenever the Company has paid noncumulative dividends in full for at least two consecutive semi-annual or four consecutive quarterly dividend periods following a Nonpayment on the Series X Preferred Stock and on any dividend parity stock entitled to noncumulative dividends and has paid cumulative dividends in full on any dividend parity stock entitled to cumulative dividends, then the right of the Holders to elect the Preferred Stock Directors will cease (but subject always to the same provisions for the vesting of the special voting rights in the case of any similar non-payment of dividends in respect of future dividend periods) (the time of such cessation, the Preferred Stock Director Termination Date ). Upon a Preferred Stock Director Termination Date, the terms of office of the Preferred Stock Directors will immediately terminate, the persons then serving as Preferred Stock Directors shall immediately cease to be qualified to hold office as Preferred Stock Directors, the Preferred Stock Directors shall cease to be directors of the Company and the number of directors constituting the Board of Directors shall be automatically reduced, without any action by the Board of Directors or the stockholders of the Company, by the number of Preferred Stock Directors authorized immediately prior to such termination. Any Preferred Stock Director may be removed at any time without cause by the holders of a majority of the voting power of outstanding shares of the 

capital stock then entitled to vote in the election of Preferred Stock Directors, voting together as a single class (with such voting power measured based on the voting power to elect Preferred Stock Directors). 
 (c) Senior Issuances Adverse Changes . So long as any shares of Series X Preferred Stock are outstanding, but subject to the final paragraph of this Section 7(c), in addition to any other vote or consent of holders of the Company s capital stock required by Delaware law, the vote or consent of the holders of at least two-thirds of the voting power of the Series X Preferred Stock and the holders of any other preferred stock entitled to vote thereon, voting together as a single class, given in person or by proxy at an annual or special meeting of stockholders, or given in writing without a meeting, will be necessary for effecting or validating any of the following actions, whether or not such approval is required by Delaware law 
 
 (i) any amendment, alteration or repeal of any provision of the Company s certificate of incorporation (including the certificate of designations creating the Series X Preferred Stock) or the Company s by-laws that would alter or change the voting powers, preferences, economic rights or special rights of the Series X Preferred Stock so as to affect them adversely 
 
 (ii) any amendment or alteration of the Company s certificate of incorporation to authorize or create, or increase the authorized amount of, any shares of, or any securities convertible into shares of, any class or series of the Company's capital stock ranking prior to the Series X Preferred Stock in the payment of dividends or in the distribution of assets on any liquidation, dissolution, or winding up of the Company or 
 
 (iii) the consummation of a binding share exchange or reclassification involving the Series X Preferred Stock or a merger or consolidation of the Company with another entity, except that holders of Series X Preferred Stock will have no right to vote under this provision or otherwise under Delaware law if in each case (i) the Series X Preferred Stock remains outstanding or, in the case of any such merger or consolidation with respect to which the Company is not the surviving or resulting entity, is converted into or exchanged for preferred securities of the surviving or resulting entity or its ultimate parent, that is an entity organized and existing under the laws of the United States of America, any state thereof or the District of Columbia and that is a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes (or if such entity is not a corporation, the Company having received an opinion of nationally recognized counsel experienced in such matters to the effect that Holders will be subject to tax for U.S. federal income tax purposes with respect to such new preferred securities after such merger or consolidation in the same amount, at the same time and otherwise in the same manner as would have been the case under the Series X Preferred Stock prior to such merger or consolidation), and (ii) such Series X Preferred Stock remaining outstanding or such preferred securities, as the case may be, have such rights, preferences, privileges and voting powers, taken as a whole, as are not materially less favorable to the holders thereof than the rights, preferences, privileges and voting powers of the Series X Preferred Stock, taken as a whole 
 provided, however , that, for the avoidance of doubt, any increase in the amount of the authorized or issued Series X Preferred Stock or authorized preferred stock or any securities convertible into preferred stock or the creation and issuance, or an increase in the authorized or issued amount, of other series of preferred stock or any securities convertible into preferred stock ranking equally with and or junior to the Series X Preferred Stock with respect to the payment of 

dividends (whether such dividends are cumulative or noncumulative) and or the distribution of assets upon the Company s liquidation, dissolution or winding up will not be deemed to adversely affect the voting powers, preferences or special rights of the Series X Preferred Stock, and no stockholder will have the right to vote on such an increase, creation or issuance by reason of this Section 7. 
 If any amendment, alteration, repeal, share exchange, reclassification, merger or consolidation specified in this Section 7(c) would adversely affect one or more but not all series of preferred stock of the Company, then only such series of preferred stock as are adversely affected by and entitled to vote on the matter shall vote on the matter together with the Series X Preferred Stock as a single class (in lieu of all other series of preferred stock) for purposes of the vote or consent required by this Section 7(c). 
 (d) No Vote if Redemption . No vote or consent of the Holders shall be required pursuant to Section 7(b) or 7(c) if, at or prior to the time when the act with respect to such vote or consent would otherwise be required shall be effected, the Company shall have redeemed or shall have called for redemption all outstanding shares of Series X Preferred Stock, with proper notice and sufficient funds having been set aside for such redemption, in each case pursuant to Section 6 above. 

Section 8. Preemption and Conversion Rights . 
 
 The Holders shall not have any preemptive rights or conversion rights as a result of the terms hereof. 

Section 9. Rank . 
 
 For the avoidance of doubt, the Board of Directors or any duly authorized committee thereof may, without the vote of the Holders, authorize and issue additional shares of Junior Stock or shares of any class or series of stock of the Company now existing or hereafter authorized that ranks equally with the Series X Preferred Stock in the payment of dividends or in the distribution of assets on any voluntary or involuntary liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Company.

The Preferred Stock Directors 

elected at any such special meeting and each Preferred Stock Director elected at a subsequent annual or special meeting of stockholders, will be elected for term expiring upon the earlier of the Preferred Stock Director Termination Date and the next annual meeting of stockholders following such Preferred Stock Director's election. In case any vacancy in the office of a Preferred Stock Director occurs (other than prior to the initial election of the Preferred Stock Directors), the vacancy may be filled by the Preferred Stock Director remaining in office, or if none remains in office, by a plurality of the votes cast by the holders of Series Y Preferred Stock and any dividend parity stock, voting together as a single class, and the Preferred Stock Director so appointed or elected to fill such vacancy shall serve for a term expiring at the next annual meeting of the stockholders. Preferred Stock Directors may only be elected by the holders of Series Y Preferred Stock and dividend parity stock in accordance with this Section 7. If the holders of Series Y Preferred Stock and such dividend parity stock fail to elect a sufficient number of directors to fill all directorships for which they are entitled to elect directors pursuant to this Section 7, then any directorship not so filled shall remain vacant until such time as the holders of Series Y Preferred Stock and such dividend parity stock elect a person to fill such directorship in accordance with this Section 7, or such vacancy is otherwise filled in accordance with this Section 7 and no such directorship may be filled by stockholders of the Company other than in accordance with this Section 7.

Whenever the Company has paid noncumulative dividends in full for at least two consecutive semi-annual or four consecutive quarterly dividend periods following a Nonpayment on the Series Y Preferred Stock and on any dividend parity stock entitled to noncumulative dividends and has paid cumulative dividends in full on any dividend parity stock entitled to cumulative dividends, then the right of the Holders to elect the Preferred Stock Directors will cease (but subject always to the same provisions for the vesting of the special voting rights in the case of any similar non-payment of dividends in respect of future dividend periods) (the time of such cessation, the Preferred Stock Director Termination Date ). Upon a Preferred Stock Director Termination Date, the terms of office of the Preferred Stock Directors will immediately terminate, the persons then serving as Preferred Stock Directors shall immediately cease to be qualified to hold office as Preferred Stock Directors, the Preferred Stock Directors shall cease to be directors of the Company and the number of directors constituting the Board of Directors shall be automatically reduced, without any action by the Board of Directors or the stockholders of the Company, by the number of Preferred Stock Directors authorized immediately prior to such termination. Any Preferred Stock Director may be removed at any time without cause by the holders of a majority of the voting power of outstanding shares of the capital stock then entitled to vote in the election of Preferred Stock Directors, voting together as a single class (with such voting power measured based on the voting power to elect Preferred Stock Directors).

 If any amendment, alteration, repeal, share exchange, reclassification, merger or consolidation specified in this Section 7(c) would adversely affect one or more but not all series of preferred stock of the Company, then only such series of preferred stock as are adversely affected by and entitled to vote on the matter shall vote on the matter together with the Series Y Preferred Stock as a single class (in lieu of all other series of preferred stock) for purposes of the vote or consent required by this Section 7(c). 
 (d) No Vote if Redemption . No vote or consent of the Holders shall be required pursuant to Section 7(b) or 7(c) if, at or prior to the time when the act with respect to such vote

 Except as provided below, for so long as any share of Series Z Preferred Stock remains outstanding, if dividends are not declared and paid in full upon the shares of Series Z Preferred Stock and any class or series of stock of the Company now existing or hereafter authorized that ranks equally with the Series Z Preferred Stock in the payment of dividends, all dividends declared upon shares of Series Z Preferred Stock and such other stock will be declared on a proportional basis so that the amount of dividends declared per share will bear to each other the same ratio that accrued dividends for the then-current dividend period per share of Series Z Preferred Stock and accrued dividends for the then-current dividend period per share of such other stock (including, in the case of any such other stock that bears cumulative dividends, all accrued and unpaid dividends) bear to each other.

 (c) Partial Redemption .

Subject to the provisions of this Section 6, the Board of Directors or any duly authorized committee thereof shall have full power and authority to prescribe the terms and conditions upon which shares of Series Z Preferred Stock shall be redeemed from time to time. 
 
 (d) Effectiveness of Redemption .

The Company shall be entitled to receive, from time to time, from the Trust any interest accrued on such funds, and the Holders of any shares called for redemption shall have no claim to any such interest. Any funds so deposited and unclaimed at the end of three years from the redemption date shall, to the extent permitted by law, be released or repaid to the Company, and in the event of such repayment to the Company, the Holders of the shares so called for redemption shall be deemed to be unsecured creditors of the Company for an amount equivalent to the amount deposited as stated above for the redemption of such shares and so repaid to the Company, but shall in no event be entitled to any interest. 

Section 7. Voting Rights . 
 
 (a) General . The Holders shall not be entitled to vote on any matter except as set forth in Section 7(b) below or as required by the Delaware General Corporation Law. 
 
 (b) Special Voting Right . 
 
 (i) Voting Right . If and whenever dividends on the Series Z Preferred Stock or any other class or series of preferred stock that ranks on parity with the Series Z Preferred Stock as to payment of dividends and upon which voting rights equivalent to those granted by this Section 7(b)(i) have been conferred and are exercisable (any such class or series being referred to herein as dividend parity stock have not been declared and paid in an aggregate amount equal, as to any class or series, to at least three semi-annual or six quarterly dividend periods, as applicable, (whether consecutive or not) (a Nonpayment ), the authorized number of directors constituting the Board of Directors shall be increased by two, and the Holders, together with holders of dividend parity stock, shall have the right, voting separately as a single class without regard to class or series (and with voting rights allocated pro rata based on the liquidation preference of each such class or series), to the exclusion of the holders of Common Stock, to elect two directors of the Company to fill such newly created directorships (and to fill any vacancies in the terms of such directorships), provided that it shall be a qualification for election of any such director that the election of such director shall not cause the Company to violate the corporate governance requirements of the New York Stock Exchange (or other exchange on which the Company s securities may be listed) that listed companies must have a majority of independent directors and further provided that the Board of Directors shall at no time include more than two such directors. Each such director elected by the Holders together with holders of dividend parity stock is a Preferred Stock Director . 
 
 (ii) Election . The election of the Preferred Stock Directors will take place at any annual meeting of stockholders or any special meeting of the Holders and any dividend parity stock, called as provided herein. At any time after the special voting power has vested pursuant to Section 7(b)(i) above, the secretary of the Company may, and upon the written request (addressed to the secretary at the Company s principal office) of the holders of at least 20 of the voting power of the Series Z Preferred Stock or the holders of at least 20 of the voting power of any series of dividend parity stock then outstanding (with such voting power measured based on the voting power to elect Preferred Stock Directors), must (unless such request is received less than 90 days before the date fixed for the next annual or special meeting of the stockholders of the Company, in which event such election shall be held at such next annual or special meeting of stockholders), call a special meeting of the holders of Series Z Preferred Stock and any dividend parity stock for the purposes of electing Preferred Stock Directors. The Preferred Stock Directors shall each be entitled to one vote per director on any matter. 
 
 (iii) Notice of Special Meeting . Notice for a special meeting to elect Preferred Stock Directors will be given in a similar manner to that provided in the Company s by-laws for a special meeting of the stockholders. If the secretary of the Company does not call a special meeting within 20 days after receipt of any such request, then any Holder may (at the expense of the Company) call such meeting, upon notice as provided in this Section 7(b)(iii), and for that purpose will have access to the stock register of the Company. The Preferred Stock Directors 

elected at any such special meeting and each Preferred Stock Director elected at a subsequent annual or special meeting of stockholders, will be elected for term expiring upon the earlier of the Preferred Stock Director Termination Date and the next annual meeting of stockholders following such Preferred Stock Director's election. In case any vacancy in the office of a Preferred Stock Director occurs (other than prior to the initial election of the Preferred Stock Directors), the vacancy may be filled by the Preferred Stock Director remaining in office, or if none remains in office, by a plurality of the votes cast by the holders of Series Z Preferred Stock and any dividend parity stock, voting together as a single class, and the Preferred Stock Director so appointed or elected to fill such vacancy shall serve for a term expiring at the next annual meeting of the stockholders. Preferred Stock Directors may only be elected by the holders of Series Z Preferred Stock and dividend parity stock in accordance with this Section 7. If the holders of Series Z Preferred Stock and such dividend parity stock fail to elect a sufficient number of directors to fill all directorships for which they are entitled to elect directors pursuant to this Section 7, then any directorship not so filled shall remain vacant until such time as the holders of Series Z Preferred Stock and such dividend parity stock elect a person to fill such directorship in accordance with this Section 7, or such vacancy is otherwise filled in accordance with this Section 7 and no such directorship may be filled by stockholders of the Company other than in accordance with this Section 7. 
 
 (iv) Termination Removal . Whenever the Company has paid noncumulative dividends in full for at least two consecutive semi-annual or four consecutive quarterly dividend periods following a Nonpayment on the Series Z Preferred Stock and on any dividend parity stock entitled to noncumulative dividends and has paid cumulative dividends in full on any dividend parity stock entitled to cumulative dividends, then the right of the Holders to elect the Preferred Stock Directors will cease (but subject always to the same provisions for the vesting of the special voting rights in the case of any similar non-payment of dividends in respect of future dividend periods) (the time of such cessation, the Preferred Stock Director Termination Date ). Upon a Preferred Stock Director Termination Date, the terms of office of the Preferred Stock Directors will immediately terminate, the persons then serving as Preferred Stock Directors shall immediately cease to be qualified to hold office as Preferred Stock Directors, the Preferred Stock Directors shall cease to be directors of the Company and the number of directors constituting the Board of Directors shall be automatically reduced, without any action by the Board of Directors or the stockholders of the Company, by the number of Preferred Stock Directors authorized immediately prior to such termination. Any Preferred Stock Director may be removed at any time without cause by the holders of a majority of the voting power of outstanding shares of the capital stock then entitled to vote in the election of Preferred Stock Directors, voting together as a single class (with such voting power measured based on the voting power to elect Preferred Stock Directors). 
 (c) Senior Issuances Adverse Changes . So long as any shares of Series Z Preferred Stock are outstanding, but subject to the final paragraph of this Section 7(c), in addition to any other vote or consent of holders of the Company s capital stock required by Delaware law, the vote or consent of the holders of at least two-thirds of the voting power of the Series Z Preferred Stock and the holders of any other preferred stock entitled to vote thereon, voting together as a single class, given in person or by proxy at an annual or special meeting of stockholders, or given in writing without a meeting, will be necessary for effecting or validating any of the following actions, whether or not such approval is required by Delaware law

 (ii) any amendment or alteration of the Company s certificate of incorporation to authorize or create, or increase the authorized amount of, any shares of, or any securities convertible into shares of, any class or series of the Company's capital stock ranking prior to the Series Z Preferred Stock in the payment of dividends or in the distribution of assets on any liquidation, dissolution, or winding up of the Company or 
 
 (iii) the consummation of a binding share exchange or reclassification involving the Series Z Preferred Stock or a merger or consolidation of the Company with another entity, except that holders of Series Z Preferred Stock will have no right to vote under this provision or otherwise under Delaware law if in each case (i) the Series Z Preferred Stock remains outstanding or, in the case of any such merger or consolidation with respect to which the Company is not the surviving or resulting entity, is converted into or exchanged for preferred securities of the surviving or resulting entity or its ultimate parent, that is an entity organized and existing under the laws of the United States of America, any state thereof or the District of Columbia and that is a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes (or if such entity is not a corporation, the Company having received an opinion of nationally recognized counsel experienced in such matters to the effect that Holders will be subject to tax for U.S. federal income tax purposes with respect to such new preferred securities after such merger or consolidation in the same amount, at the same time and otherwise in the same manner as would have been the case under the Series Z Preferred Stock prior to such merger or consolidation), and (ii) such Series Z Preferred Stock remaining outstanding or such preferred securities, as the case may be, have such rights, preferences, privileges and voting powers, taken as a whole, as are not materially less favorable to the holders thereof than the rights, preferences, privileges and voting powers of the Series Z Preferred Stock, taken as a whole 
 provided, however , that, for the avoidance of doubt, any increase in the amount of the authorized or issued Series Z Preferred Stock or authorized preferred stock or any securities convertible into preferred stock or the creation and issuance, or an increase in the authorized or issued amount, of other series of preferred stock or any securities convertible into preferred stock ranking equally with and or junior to the Series Z Preferred Stock with respect to the payment of dividends (whether such dividends are cumulative or noncumulative) and or the distribution of assets upon the Company s liquidation, dissolution or winding up will not be deemed to adversely affect the voting powers, preferences or special rights of the Series Z Preferred Stock, and no stockholder will have the right to vote on such an increase, creation or issuance by reason of this Section 7. 
 If any amendment, alteration, repeal, share exchange, reclassification, merger or consolidation specified in this Section 7(c) would adversely affect one or more but not all series of preferred stock of the Company, then only such series of preferred stock as are adversely affected by and entitled to vote on the matter shall vote on the matter together with the Series Z Preferred Stock as a single class (in lieu of all other series of preferred stock) for purposes of the vote or consent required by this Section 7(c). 
 (d) No Vote if Redemption . No vote or consent of the Holders shall be required pursuant to Section 7(b) or 7(c) if, at or prior to the time when the act with respect to such vote 

or consent would otherwise be required shall be effected, the Company shall have redeemed or shall have called for redemption all outstanding shares of Series Z Preferred Stock, with proper notice and sufficient funds having been set aside for such redemption, in each case pursuant to Section 6 above.

 a. Rate . Holders shall be entitled to receive, when, as and if declared by the Board of Directors or any duly authorized committee thereof, but only out of funds legally available therefor, noncumulative cash dividends on each share of Series AA Preferred Stock in the amounts specified below in this Section 4, and no more, payable on the 15th of each February, May, August and November (each, a dividend payment date ), (i) quarterly in arrears from, and including, the date of issuance to, but excluding, November 15, 2028 (the First Reset Date ), at an annual rate of 7.625 on the liquidation preference of 25,000 per share, beginning on February 15, 2024, and (ii) from, and including the First Reset Date, for each reset period, at an annual rate equal to the five-year treasury rate as of the most recent reset dividend determination date (as described below) plus 3.211 on the liquidation preference of 25,000 per share, quarterly in arrears, beginning on February 15, 2029. 
 
 The record date for payment of dividends on the Series AA Preferred Stock will be the record date fixed by the Board of Directors or any other duly authorized committee thereof that is not more than 30 nor less than 10 days prior to such dividend payment date (each, a Dividend Record Date ). Any such day that is a Dividend Record Date will be a Dividend Record Date whether or not such day is a business day. 
 
 For any reset period beginning on or after the First Reset Date, the five-year treasury rate will be 
 
 The average of the yields on actively traded U.S. treasury securities adjusted to constant maturity, for five-year maturities, for the five business days appearing under the caption Treasury Constant Maturities in the most recently published statistical release designated H.15 Daily Update or any successor publication which is published by the Federal Reserve Board as of 5 00 p.m. (Eastern Time) as of any date of determination, as determined by the Calculation Agent in its sole discretion. 
 
 If no calculation is provided as described above, then the Company (or such affiliate) will use a substitute or successor rate that it has determined, in its sole discretion after consulting any source it deems to be reasonable, is (i) the industry-accepted substitute or successor for the five-year treasury rate or (ii) if there is no such industry-accepted substitute or successor for the five-year treasury rate, a substitute or successor rate that is most comparable to the five-year treasury rate. Upon selection of a substitute or successor rate, the Company (or such affiliate) may determine, in its sole discretion after consulting any source it deems to be reasonable, the day count convention, the business day convention, the definition of business day, the reset dividend determination date and any other relevant methodology or definition for calculating such substitute or successor rate, including any adjustment factor it determines is needed to make such substitute or successor rate comparable to the five-year treasury rate, in a manner that is consistent with any industry-accepted practices for such substitute or successor rate. 
 
 The five-year treasury rate will be determined on each reset dividend determination date. 

With respect to any dividend period, any dividends on the Series AA Preferred Stock will be calculated on the basis of a 360-day year of twelve 30-day months, and dividend period means the period from, and including, each dividend payment date to, but excluding, the next succeeding dividend payment date, except for the initial dividend period, which will be the period from, and including, the date of issuance of the Series AA Preferred Stock to, but excluding, the first dividend payment date. In the event that any dividend payment date is not a business day, then payment of any dividend payable on such date will be made on the next succeeding business day and without any additional dividend accrual or other payment in respect of any such postponement. 
 
 Any determination, decision or election that may be made by the Company (or one of its affiliates) pursuant to the provisions described above, including any determination with respect to tenor, rate or adjustment or of the occurrence or non-occurrence of an event, circumstance or date and any decision to take or refrain from taking any action or any selection, will be conclusive and binding absent manifest error, will be made in the Company s (or such affiliate s) sole discretion, and, notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Certificate of Designations, shall become effective without consent from the holders of the Series AA Preferred Stock or any other party. 
 
 All percentages resulting from any calculation of the dividend rate will be rounded, if necessary, to the nearest 1 100,000 of 1 (.0000001), with five one-millionths of a percentage point rounded upward. All currency amounts used in, or resulting from, the calculation on the Series AA Preferred Stock will be rounded to the nearest one-hundredth of a unit. For purposes of rounding, .005 of a unit shall be rounded upward. 
 
 (b) Noncumulative Dividends . If the Board of Directors or any duly authorized committee thereof does not declare a dividend on the Series AA Preferred Stock for any dividend period prior to the related dividend payment date, that dividend will not accrue, and the Company will have no obligation to pay, and Holders shall have no right to receive, a dividend for that dividend period on the related dividend payment date or at any future time, whether or not dividends on the Series AA Preferred Stock or any other series of preferred stock or common stock are declared for any subsequent period. References herein to the accrual of dividends refer only to the determination of the amount of such dividend and do not imply that any right to a dividend arises prior to the date on which a dividend is declared. 
 
 (c) Priority of Dividends . So long as any share of Series AA Preferred Stock remains outstanding, unless as to a dividend payment date full dividends on all outstanding shares of the Series AA Preferred Stock have been declared and paid or declared and a sum sufficient for the payment of those dividends has been set aside for the dividend period then ending, the Company will not, and will cause its subsidiaries not to, during the next succeeding dividend period, declare or pay any dividend on, make any distributions relating to, or redeem, purchase, acquire or make a liquidation payment relating to, any Junior Stock, or make any guarantee payment with respect thereto, other than 

(i) purchases, redemptions or other acquisitions of shares of Junior Stock in connection with any employment contract, benefit plan or other similar arrangement with or for the benefit of employees, officers, directors or consultants 
 
 (ii) purchases of shares of Common Stock pursuant to a contractually binding requirement to buy stock existing prior to the commencement of the then-current dividend period, including under a contractually binding stock repurchase plan 
 
 (iii) as a result of an exchange or conversion of any class or series of Junior Stock for any other class or series of Junior Stock 
 
 (iv) the purchase of fractional interests in shares of Junior Stock pursuant to the conversion or exchange provisions of such Junior Stock or the security being converted or exchanged 
 
 (v) the purchase of Junior Stock by an investment banking subsidiary of the Company in connection with the distribution thereof or 
 
 (vi) the purchase of Junior Stock by any investment banking subsidiary of the Company in connection with market-making or other secondary market activities in the ordinary course of the business of such subsidiary. 
 
 The restrictions set forth in the preceding provisions of this Section 4(c) shall not apply to any Junior Stock dividends paid by the Company where the dividend is in the form of the same stock (or the right to buy the same stock) as that on which the dividend is being paid. 
 Except as provided below, for so long as any share of Series AA Preferred Stock remains outstanding, if dividends are not declared and paid in full upon the shares of Series AA Preferred Stock and any class or series of stock of the Company now existing or hereafter authorized that ranks equally with the Series AA Preferred Stock in the payment of dividends, all dividends declared upon shares of Series AA Preferred Stock and such other stock will be declared on a proportional basis so that the amount of dividends declared per share will bear to each other the same ratio that accrued dividends for the then-current dividend period per share of Series AA Preferred Stock and accrued dividends for the then-current dividend period per share of such other stock (including, in the case of any such other stock that bears cumulative dividends, all accrued and unpaid dividends) bear to each other. 
 Subject to the foregoing, and not otherwise, such dividends payable in cash, stock or otherwise, as may be determined by the Board of Directors or any duly authorized committee thereof, may be declared and paid on any other class or series of stock of the Company from time to time out of any funds legally available for such payment, and Holders will not be entitled to participate in those dividends. 
 
 Section 5. Liquidation Rights . 
 
 (a) Liquidation . In the event of any voluntary or involuntary liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the affairs of the Company, Holders shall be entitled, out of funds legally available therefor, before any distribution or payment may be made by the Company or set aside for the holders of any Junior Stock and subject to the rights of the holders of any class or series of stock ranking senior to or on parity with Series AA Preferred Stock upon liquidation and the rights of 

the Company s depositors and other creditors, to receive in full a liquidating distribution in the amount of the liquidation preference of 25,000 per share (the Series AA Liquidation Preference ), plus any accrued dividends thereon from the last dividend payment date to, but excluding, the date of the liquidation, dissolution or winding up if and to the extent declared but not yet paid. Holders shall not be entitled to any further payments in the event of any such voluntary or involuntary liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the affairs of the Company other than what is expressly provided for in this Section 5. 
 (b) Partial Payment . If the assets of the Company are not sufficient to pay in full the aforesaid liquidation distributions to the Holders and any liquidation distributions owed to holders of any class or series of stock of the Company ranking equally with the Series AA Preferred Stock in the distribution of assets on any voluntary or involuntary liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Company, the amounts paid to the Holders and to the holders of all such equally ranking stock shall be pro rata in accordance with the respective aggregate liquidating distributions to which they would otherwise be entitled. 
 
 (c) Merger, Consolidation and Sale of Assets Not Liquidation . For purposes of this Section 5, the sale, conveyance, exchange or transfer (for cash, shares of stock, securities or other consideration) of all or substantially all of the property and assets of the Company shall not be deemed a voluntary or involuntary dissolution, liquidation or winding up of the affairs of the Company, nor shall the merger, consolidation or any other business combination transaction of the Company into or with any other corporation or Person or the merger, consolidation or any other business combination transaction of any other corporation or Person into or with the Company be deemed to be a voluntary or involuntary dissolution, liquidation or winding up of the affairs of the Company. 

Section 6. Redemption . 
 
 (a) Optional Redemption . The Company, at the option of its Board of Directors or any duly authorized committee thereof, may redeem out of funds legally available therefor, (i) in whole at any time or in part, from time to time, the shares of Series AA Preferred Stock at the time outstanding, on any dividend payment date beginning on or after the First Reset Date, or (ii) in whole but not in part at any time within 90 days following a Regulatory Capital Event, in each case at a redemption price equal to 25,000 per share plus any declared and unpaid dividends, without accumulation of any undeclared dividends, to, but excluding, the redemption date, upon notice given as provided in Section 6(b) below. 
 
 (b) Notice of Redemption . Notice of every redemption of shares of Series AA Preferred Stock shall be mailed by first class mail, postage prepaid, addressed to the Holders of such shares to be redeemed at their respective last addresses appearing on the stock register of the Company. Such mailing shall be at least 5 days and not more than 30 days before the date fixed for redemption. Any notice mailed as provided in this Section 6(b) shall be conclusively presumed to have been duly given, whether or not the Holder receives such notice, but failure duly to give such notice by mail, or any defect in such notice or in the mailing thereof, to any Holder of shares of Series AA Preferred Stock designated for redemption shall not affect the validity of the proceedings for the redemption of any other shares of Series AA Preferred Stock. Each notice shall state 

(i) the redemption date 
 
 (ii) the total number of shares of Series AA Preferred Stock to be redeemed and, if fewer than all the shares of a Holder are to be redeemed, the number of such shares to be redeemed 
 
 (iii) the redemption price 
 
 (iv) the place or places where the certificates for such shares are to be surrendered for payment of the redemption price, if applicable and 
 
 (v) that dividends on the shares to be redeemed will cease to accrue on the redemption date. 
 
 Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the certificates evidencing the shares of Series AA Preferred Stock are held of record by a depositary and any related depository shares are held of record by a Depositary or its nominee, the Company may give such notice in any manner permitted by the Depositary. 
 
 (c) Partial Redemption . In case of any redemption of only part of the shares of Series AA Preferred Stock at the time outstanding, the shares of Series AA Preferred Stock to be redeemed shall be selected (i) pro rata from the Holders in proportion to the number of shares of Series AA Preferred Stock held by such Holders, (ii) by lot or (iii) in such other manner as the Board of Directors or any duly authorized committee thereof may determine, in its sole discretion, to be fair and equitable. Subject to the provisions of this Section 6, the Board of Directors or any duly authorized committee thereof shall have full power and authority to prescribe the terms and conditions upon which shares of Series AA Preferred Stock shall be redeemed from time to time. 
 
 (d) Effectiveness of Redemption . If notice of redemption has been duly given and if on or before the redemption date specified in the notice all funds necessary for the redemption have been set aside by the Company, separate and apart from its other assets, for the pro rata benefit of the Holders of the shares called for redemption, so as to be and continue to be available therefor, or deposited by the Company with a bank or trust company selected by the Board of Directors or any duly authorized committee thereof (the Trust in trust for the pro rata benefit of the Holders of the shares called for redemption, then, notwithstanding that any certificate for any share so called for redemption has not been surrendered for cancellation, on and after the redemption date all shares so called for redemption shall cease to be outstanding, all dividends with respect to such shares shall cease to accrue on such redemption date, and all rights with respect to such shares shall forthwith on such redemption date cease and terminate, except only the right of the Holders thereof to receive the amount payable on such redemption from the Trust at any time after the redemption date from the funds so deposited, without interest. The Company shall be entitled to receive, from time to time, from the Trust any interest accrued on such funds, and the Holders of any shares called for redemption shall have no claim to any such interest. Any funds so deposited and unclaimed at the end of three years from the redemption date shall, to the extent permitted by law, be released or repaid to the Company, and in the event of such repayment to the Company, the Holders of the shares so called for redemption shall be deemed to be unsecured creditors of the Company for an amount equivalent to the amount 

deposited as stated above for the redemption of such shares and so repaid to the Company, but shall in no event be entitled to any interest. 

Section 7. Voting Rights . 
 
 (a) General . The Holders shall not be entitled to vote on any matter except as set forth in Section 7(b) below or as required by the Delaware General Corporation Law. 
 
 (b) Special Voting Right . 
 
 (i) Voting Right . If and whenever dividends on the Series AA Preferred Stock or any other class or series of preferred stock that ranks on parity with the Series AA Preferred Stock as to payment of dividends and upon which voting rights equivalent to those granted by this Section 7(b)(i) have been conferred and are exercisable (any such class or series being referred to herein as dividend parity stock have not been declared and paid in an aggregate amount equal, as to any class or series, to at least three semi-annual or six quarterly dividend periods, as applicable, (whether consecutive or not) (a Nonpayment ), the authorized number of directors constituting the Board of Directors shall be increased by two, and the Holders, together with holders of dividend parity stock, shall have the right, voting separately as a single class without regard to class or series (and with voting rights allocated pro rata based on the liquidation preference of each such class or series), to the exclusion of the holders of Common Stock, to elect two directors of the Company to fill such newly created directorships (and to fill any vacancies in the terms of such directorships), provided that it shall be a qualification for election of any such director that the election of such director shall not cause the Company to violate the corporate governance requirements of the New York Stock Exchange (or other exchange on which the Company s securities may be listed) that listed companies must have a majority of independent directors and further provided that the Board of Directors shall at no time include more than two such directors. Each such director elected by the Holders together with holders of dividend parity stock is a Preferred Stock Director . 
 
 (ii) Election . The election of the Preferred Stock Directors will take place at any annual meeting of stockholders or any special meeting of the Holders and any dividend parity stock, called as provided herein. At any time after the special voting power has vested pursuant to Section 7(b)(i) above, the secretary of the Company may, and upon the written request (addressed to the secretary at the Company s principal office) of the holders of at least 20 of the voting power of the Series AA Preferred Stock or the holders of at least 20 of the voting power of any series of dividend parity stock then outstanding (with such voting power measured based on the voting power to elect Preferred Stock Directors), must (unless such request is received less than 90 days before the date fixed for the next annual or special meeting of the stockholders of the Company, in which event such election shall be held at such next annual or special meeting of stockholders), call a special meeting of the holders of Series AA Preferred Stock and any dividend parity stock for the purposes of electing Preferred Stock Directors. The Preferred Stock Directors shall each be entitled to one vote per director on any matter. 
 
 (iii) Notice of Special Meeting . Notice for a special meeting to elect Preferred Stock Directors will be given in a similar manner to that provided in the Company s by-laws for a special meeting of the stockholders. If the secretary of the Company does not call a special 

meeting within 20 days after receipt of any such request, then any Holder may (at the expense of the Company) call such meeting, upon notice as provided in this Section 7(b)(iii), and for that purpose will have access to the stock register of the Company. The Preferred Stock Directors elected at any such special meeting and each Preferred Stock Director elected at a subsequent annual or special meeting of stockholders, will be elected for term expiring upon the earlier of the Preferred Stock Director Termination Date and the next annual meeting of stockholders following such Preferred Stock Director's election. In case any vacancy in the office of a Preferred Stock Director occurs (other than prior to the initial election of the Preferred Stock Directors), the vacancy may be filled by the Preferred Stock Director remaining in office, or if none remains in office, by a plurality of the votes cast by the holders of Series AA Preferred Stock and any dividend parity stock, voting together as a single class, and the Preferred Stock Director so appointed or elected to fill such vacancy shall serve for a term expiring at the next annual meeting of the stockholders. Preferred Stock Directors may only be elected by the holders of Series AA Preferred Stock and dividend parity stock in accordance with this Section 7. If the holders of Series AA Preferred Stock and such dividend parity stock fail to elect a sufficient number of directors to fill all directorships for which they are entitled to elect directors pursuant to this Section 7, then any directorship not so filled shall remain vacant until such time as the holders of Series AA Preferred Stock and such dividend parity stock elect a person to fill such directorship in accordance with this Section 7, or such vacancy is otherwise filled in accordance with this Section 7 and no such directorship may be filled by stockholders of the Company other than in accordance with this Section 7. 
 
 (iv) Termination Removal . Whenever the Company has paid noncumulative dividends in full for at least two consecutive semi-annual or four consecutive quarterly dividend periods following a Nonpayment on the Series AA Preferred Stock and on any dividend parity stock entitled to noncumulative dividends and has paid cumulative dividends in full on any dividend parity stock entitled to cumulative dividends, then the right of the Holders to elect the Preferred Stock Directors will cease (but subject always to the same provisions for the vesting of the special voting rights in the case of any similar non-payment of dividends in respect of future dividend periods) (the time of such cessation, the Preferred Stock Director Termination Date ). Upon a Preferred Stock Director Termination Date, the terms of office of the Preferred Stock Directors will immediately terminate, the persons then serving as Preferred Stock Directors shall immediately cease to be qualified to hold office as Preferred Stock Directors, the Preferred Stock Directors shall cease to be directors of the Company and the number of directors constituting the Board of Directors shall be automatically reduced, without any action by the Board of Directors or the stockholders of the Company, by the number of Preferred Stock Directors authorized immediately prior to such termination. Any Preferred Stock Director may be removed at any time without cause by the holders of a majority of the voting power of outstanding shares of the capital stock then entitled to vote in the election of Preferred Stock Directors, voting together as a single class (with such voting power measured based on the voting power to elect Preferred Stock Directors). 
 
 (c) Senior Issuances Adverse Changes . So long as any shares of Series AA Preferred Stock are outstanding, but subject to the final paragraph of this Section 7(c), in addition to any other vote or consent of holders of the Company s capital stock required by Delaware law, the vote or consent of the holders of at least two-thirds of the voting power of the Series AA Preferred Stock and the holders of any other preferred stock entitled to vote thereon, voting together as a single class, given in person or by proxy at an annual or special meeting of 

stockholders, or given in writing without a meeting, will be necessary for effecting or validating any of the following actions, whether or not such approval is required by Delaware law 
 
 (i) any amendment, alteration or repeal of any provision of the Company s certificate of incorporation (including the certificate of designations creating the Series AA Preferred Stock) or the Company s by-laws that would alter or change the voting powers, preferences, economic rights or special rights of the Series AA Preferred Stock so as to affect them adversely 
 
 (ii) any amendment or alteration of the Company s certificate of incorporation to authorize or create, or increase the authorized amount of, any shares of, or any securities convertible into shares of, any class or series of the Company's capital stock ranking prior to the Series AA Preferred Stock in the payment of dividends or in the distribution of assets on any liquidation, dissolution, or winding up of the Company or 
 
 (iii) the consummation of a binding share exchange or reclassification involving the Series AA Preferred Stock or a merger or consolidation of the Company with another entity, except that holders of Series AA Preferred Stock will have no right to vote under this provision or otherwise under Delaware law if in each case (i) the Series AA Preferred Stock remains outstanding or, in the case of any such merger or consolidation with respect to which the Company is not the surviving or resulting entity, is converted into or exchanged for preferred securities of the surviving or resulting entity or its ultimate parent, that is an entity organized and existing under the laws of the United States of America, any state thereof or the District of Columbia and that is a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes (or if such entity is not a corporation, the Company having received an opinion of nationally recognized counsel experienced in such matters to the effect that Holders will be subject to tax for U.S. federal income tax purposes with respect to such new preferred securities after such merger or consolidation in the same amount, at the same time and otherwise in the same manner as would have been the case under the Series AA Preferred Stock prior to such merger or consolidation), and (ii) such Series AA Preferred Stock remaining outstanding or such preferred securities, as the case may be, have such rights, preferences, privileges and voting powers, taken as a whole, as are not materially less favorable to the holders thereof than the rights, preferences, privileges and voting powers of the Series AA Preferred Stock, taken as a whole 
 provided, however , that, for the avoidance of doubt, any increase in the amount of the authorized or issued Series AA Preferred Stock or authorized preferred stock or any securities convertible into preferred stock or the creation and issuance, or an increase in the authorized or issued amount, of other series of preferred stock or any securities convertible into preferred stock ranking equally with and or junior to the Series AA Preferred Stock with respect to the payment of dividends (whether such dividends are cumulative or noncumulative) and or the distribution of assets upon the Company s liquidation, dissolution or winding up will not be deemed to adversely affect the voting powers, preferences or special rights of the Series AA Preferred Stock, and no stockholder will have the right to vote on such an increase, creation or issuance by reason of this Section 7. 
 If any amendment, alteration, repeal, share exchange, reclassification, merger or consolidation specified in this Section 7(c) would adversely affect one or more but not all series of preferred stock of the Company, then only such series of preferred stock as are adversely affected by and entitled to vote on the matter shall vote on the matter together with the Series AA 

Preferred Stock as a single class (in lieu of all other series of preferred stock) for purposes of the vote or consent required by this Section 7(c). 
 
 (d) No Vote if Redemption . No vote or consent of the Holders shall be required pursuant to Section 7(b) or 7(c) if, at or prior to the time when the act with respect to such vote or consent would otherwise be required shall be effected, the Company shall have redeemed or shall have called for redemption all outstanding shares of Series AA Preferred Stock, with proper notice and sufficient funds having been set aside for such redemption, in each case pursuant to Section 6 above. 

Section 8. Preemption and Conversion Rights . 
 
 The Holders shall not have any preemptive rights or conversion rights as a result of the terms hereof.

 (c) Merger, Consolidation and Sale of Assets Not Liquidation . For purposes of this Section 5, the sale, conveyance, exchange or transfer (for cash, shares of stock, securities or other consideration) of all or substantially all of the property and assets of the Company shall not be deemed a voluntary or involuntary dissolution, liquidation or winding up of the affairs of the Company, nor shall the merger, consolidation or any other business combination transaction of the Company into or with any other corporation or Person or the merger, consolidation or any other business combination transaction of any other corporation or Person into or with the Company be deemed to be a voluntary or involuntary dissolution, liquidation or winding up of the affairs of the Company.

Stock, and no stockholder will have the right to vote on such an increase, creation or issuance by reason of this Section 7. 
 If any amendment, alteration, repeal, share exchange, reclassification, merger or consolidation specified in this Section 7(c) would adversely affect one or more but not all series of preferred stock of the Company, then only such series of preferred stock as are adversely affected by and entitled to vote on the matter shall vote on the matter together with the Series BB Preferred Stock as a single class (in lieu of all other series of preferred stock) for purposes of the vote or consent required by this Section 7(c).

 Except as provided below, for so long as any share of Series CC Preferred Stock remains outstanding, if dividends are not declared and paid in full upon the shares of Series CC Preferred Stock and any class or series of stock of the Company now existing or hereafter authorized that ranks equally with the Series CC Preferred Stock in the payment of dividends, all dividends declared upon shares of Series CC Preferred Stock and such other stock will be declared on a proportional basis so that the amount of dividends declared per share will bear to each other the same ratio that accrued dividends for the then-current dividend period per share of Series CC Preferred Stock and accrued dividends for the then-current dividend period per share of such other stock (including, in the case of any such other stock that bears cumulative dividends, all accrued and unpaid dividends) bear to each other. 
 Subject to the foregoing, and not otherwise, such dividends payable in cash, stock or otherwise, as may be determined by the Board of Directors or any duly authorized committee thereof, may be declared and paid on any other class or series of stock of the Company from time to time out of any funds legally available for such payment, and Holders will not be entitled to participate in those dividends. 
 
 Section 5. Liquidation Rights . 
 
 (a) Liquidation . In the event of any voluntary or involuntary liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the affairs of the Company, Holders shall be entitled, out of funds legally available 

therefor, before any distribution or payment may be made by the Company or set aside for the holders of any Junior Stock and subject to the rights of the holders of any class or series of stock ranking senior to or on parity with Series CC Preferred Stock upon liquidation and the rights of the Company s depositors and other creditors, to receive in full a liquidating distribution in the amount of the liquidation preference of 25,000 per share (the Series CC Liquidation Preference ), plus any accrued dividends thereon from the last dividend payment date to, but excluding, the date of the liquidation, dissolution or winding up if and to the extent declared but not yet paid. Holders shall not be entitled to any further payments in the event of any such voluntary or involuntary liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the affairs of the Company other than what is expressly provided for in this Section 5. 
 (b) Partial Payment . If the assets of the Company are not sufficient to pay in full the aforesaid liquidation distributions to the Holders and any liquidation distributions owed to holders of any class or series of stock of the Company ranking equally with the Series CC Preferred Stock in the distribution of assets on any voluntary or involuntary liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Company, the amounts paid to the Holders and to the holders of all such equally ranking stock shall be pro rata in accordance with the respective aggregate liquidating distributions to which they would otherwise be entitled. 
 
 (c) Merger, Consolidation and Sale of Assets Not Liquidation . For purposes of this Section 5, the sale, conveyance, exchange or transfer (for cash, shares of stock, securities or other consideration) of all or substantially all of the property and assets of the Company shall not be deemed a voluntary or involuntary dissolution, liquidation or winding up of the affairs of the Company, nor shall the merger, consolidation or any other business combination transaction of the Company into or with any other corporation or Person or the merger, consolidation or any other business combination transaction of any other corporation or Person into or with the Company be deemed to be a voluntary or involuntary dissolution, liquidation or winding up of the affairs of the Company. 

Section 6. Redemption . 
 
 (a) Optional Redemption . The Company, at the option of its Board of Directors or any duly authorized committee thereof, may redeem out of funds legally available therefor, (i) in whole at any time or in part, from time to time, the shares of Series CC Preferred Stock at the time outstanding, on any dividend payment date beginning on or after the First Reset Date, or (ii) in whole but not in part at any time within 90 days following a Regulatory Capital Event, in each case at a redemption price equal to 25,000 per share plus any declared and unpaid dividends, without accumulation of any undeclared dividends, to, but excluding, the redemption date, upon notice given as provided in Section 6(b) below. 
 
 (b) Notice of Redemption . Notice of every redemption of shares of Series CC Preferred Stock shall be mailed by first class mail, postage prepaid, addressed to the Holders of such shares to be redeemed at their respective last addresses appearing on the stock register of the Company. Such mailing shall be at least 5 days and not more than 30 days before the date fixed for redemption. Any notice mailed as provided in this Section 6(b) shall be conclusively presumed to have been duly given, whether or not the Holder receives such notice, but failure duly to give such notice by mail, or any defect in such notice or in the mailing thereof, to any Holder of shares of Series CC Preferred Stock designated for redemption shall not affect the validity of the 

proceedings for the redemption of any other shares of Series CC Preferred Stock. Each notice shall state 
 
 (i) the redemption date 
 
 (ii) the total number of shares of Series CC Preferred Stock to be redeemed and, if fewer than all the shares of a Holder are to be redeemed, the number of such shares to be redeemed 
 
 (iii) the redemption price 
 
 (iv) the place or places where the certificates for such shares are to be surrendered for payment of the redemption price, if applicable and 
 
 (v) that dividends on the shares to be redeemed will cease to accrue on the redemption date.

 (c) Partial Redemption . In case of any redemption of only part of the shares of Series CC Preferred Stock at the time outstanding, the shares of Series CC Preferred Stock to be redeemed shall be selected (i) pro rata from the Holders in proportion to the number of shares of Series CC Preferred Stock held by such Holders, (ii) by lot or (iii) in such other manner as the Board of Directors or any duly authorized committee thereof may determine, in its sole discretion, to be fair and equitable. Subject to the provisions of this Section 6, the Board of Directors or any duly authorized committee thereof shall have full power and authority to prescribe the terms and conditions upon which shares of Series CC Preferred Stock shall be redeemed from time to time. 
 
 (d) Effectiveness of Redemption . If notice of redemption has been duly given and if on or before the redemption date specified in the notice all funds necessary for the redemption have been set aside by the Company, separate and apart from its other assets, for the pro rata benefit of the Holders of the shares called for redemption, so as to be and continue to be available therefor, or deposited by the Company with a bank or trust company selected by the Board of Directors or any duly authorized committee thereof (the Trust in trust for the pro rata benefit of the Holders of the shares called for redemption, then, notwithstanding that any certificate for any share so called for redemption has not been surrendered for cancellation, on and after the redemption date all shares so called for redemption shall cease to be outstanding, all dividends with respect to such shares shall cease to accrue on such redemption date, and all rights with respect to such shares shall forthwith on such redemption date cease and terminate, except only the right of the Holders thereof to receive the amount payable on such redemption from the Trust at any time after the redemption date from the funds so deposited, without interest. The Company shall be entitled to receive, from time to time, from the Trust any interest accrued on such funds, and the Holders of any shares called for redemption shall have no claim to any such interest. Any funds so deposited and unclaimed at the end of three years from the redemption 

date shall, to the extent permitted by law, be released or repaid to the Company, and in the event of such repayment to the Company, the Holders of the shares so called for redemption shall be deemed to be unsecured creditors of the Company for an amount equivalent to the amount deposited as stated above for the redemption of such shares and so repaid to the Company, but shall in no event be entitled to any interest. 

Section 7. Voting Rights . 
 
 (a) General . The Holders shall not be entitled to vote on any matter except as set forth in Section 7(b) below or as required by the Delaware General Corporation Law. 
 
 (b) Special Voting Right . 
 
 (i) Voting Right . If and whenever dividends on the Series CC Preferred Stock or any other class or series of preferred stock that ranks on parity with the Series CC Preferred Stock as to payment of dividends and upon which voting rights equivalent to those granted by this Section 7(b)(i) have been conferred and are exercisable (any such class or series being referred to herein as dividend parity stock have not been declared and paid in an aggregate amount equal, as to any class or series, to at least three semi-annual or six quarterly dividend periods, as applicable, (whether consecutive or not) (a Nonpayment ), the authorized number of directors constituting the Board of Directors shall be increased by two, and the Holders, together with holders of dividend parity stock, shall have the right, voting separately as a single class without regard to class or series (and with voting rights allocated pro rata based on the liquidation preference of each such class or series), to the exclusion of the holders of Common Stock, to elect two directors of the Company to fill such newly created directorships (and to fill any vacancies in the terms of such directorships), provided that it shall be a qualification for election of any such director that the election of such director shall not cause the Company to violate the corporate governance requirements of the New York Stock Exchange (or other exchange on which the Company s securities may be listed) that listed companies must have a majority of independent directors and further provided that the Board of Directors shall at no time include more than two such directors. Each such director elected by the Holders together with holders of dividend parity stock is a Preferred Stock Director . 
 
 (ii) Election . The election of the Preferred Stock Directors will take place at any annual meeting of stockholders or any special meeting of the Holders and any dividend parity stock, called as provided herein. At any time after the special voting power has vested pursuant to Section 7(b)(i) above, the secretary of the Company may, and upon the written request (addressed to the secretary at the Company s principal office) of the holders of at least 20 of the voting power of the Series CC Preferred Stock or the holders of at least 20 of the voting power of any series of dividend parity stock then outstanding (with such voting power measured based on the voting power to elect Preferred Stock Directors), must (unless such request is received less than 90 days before the date fixed for the next annual or special meeting of the stockholders of the Company, in which event such election shall be held at such next annual or special meeting of stockholders), call a special meeting of the holders of Series CC Preferred Stock and any dividend parity stock for the purposes of electing Preferred Stock Directors. The Preferred Stock Directors shall each be entitled to one vote per director on any matter. 

(iii) Notice of Special Meeting . Notice for a special meeting to elect Preferred Stock Directors will be given in a similar manner to that provided in the Company s by-laws for a special meeting of the stockholders. If the secretary of the Company does not call a special meeting within 20 days after receipt of any such request, then any Holder may (at the expense of the Company) call such meeting, upon notice as provided in this Section 7(b)(iii), and for that purpose will have access to the stock register of the Company. The Preferred Stock Directors elected at any such special meeting and each Preferred Stock Director elected at a subsequent annual or special meeting of stockholders, will be elected for term expiring upon the earlier of the Preferred Stock Director Termination Date and the next annual meeting of stockholders following such Preferred Stock Director's election. In case any vacancy in the office of a Preferred Stock Director occurs (other than prior to the initial election of the Preferred Stock Directors), the vacancy may be filled by the Preferred Stock Director remaining in office, or if none remains in office, by a plurality of the votes cast by the holders of Series CC Preferred Stock and any dividend parity stock, voting together as a single class, and the Preferred Stock Director so appointed or elected to fill such vacancy shall serve for a term expiring at the next annual meeting of the stockholders. Preferred Stock Directors may only be elected by the holders of Series CC Preferred Stock and dividend parity stock in accordance with this Section 7. If the holders of Series CC Preferred Stock and such dividend parity stock fail to elect a sufficient number of directors to fill all directorships for which they are entitled to elect directors pursuant to this Section 7, then any directorship not so filled shall remain vacant until such time as the holders of Series CC Preferred Stock and such dividend parity stock elect a person to fill such directorship in accordance with this Section 7, or such vacancy is otherwise filled in accordance with this Section 7 and no such directorship may be filled by stockholders of the Company other than in accordance with this Section 7. 
 
 (iv) Termination Removal . Whenever the Company has paid noncumulative dividends in full for at least two consecutive semi-annual or four consecutive quarterly dividend periods following a Nonpayment on the Series CC Preferred Stock and on any dividend parity stock entitled to noncumulative dividends and has paid cumulative dividends in full on any dividend parity stock entitled to cumulative dividends, then the right of the Holders to elect the Preferred Stock Directors will cease (but subject always to the same provisions for the vesting of the special voting rights in the case of any similar non-payment of dividends in respect of future dividend periods) (the time of such cessation, the Preferred Stock Director Termination Date ). Upon a Preferred Stock Director Termination Date, the terms of office of the Preferred Stock Directors will immediately terminate, the persons then serving as Preferred Stock Directors shall immediately cease to be qualified to hold office as Preferred Stock Directors, the Preferred Stock Directors shall cease to be directors of the Company and the number of directors constituting the Board of Directors shall be automatically reduced, without any action by the Board of Directors or the stockholders of the Company, by the number of Preferred Stock Directors authorized immediately prior to such termination. Any Preferred Stock Director may be removed at any time without cause by the holders of a majority of the voting power of outstanding shares of the capital stock then entitled to vote in the election of Preferred Stock Directors, voting together as a single class (with such voting power measured based on the voting power to elect Preferred Stock Directors). 
 
 (c) Senior Issuances Adverse Changes . So long as any shares of Series CC Preferred Stock are outstanding, but subject to the final paragraph of this Section 7(c), in addition to any other vote or consent of holders of the Company s capital stock required by Delaware law, the 

vote or consent of the holders of at least two-thirds of the voting power of the Series CC Preferred Stock and the holders of any other preferred stock entitled to vote thereon, voting together as a single class, given in person or by proxy at an annual or special meeting of stockholders, or given in writing without a meeting, will be necessary for effecting or validating any of the following actions, whether or not such approval is required by Delaware law 
 
 (i) any amendment, alteration or repeal of any provision of the Company s certificate of incorporation (including the certificate of designations creating the Series CC Preferred Stock) or the Company s by-laws that would alter or change the voting powers, preferences, economic rights or special rights of the Series CC Preferred Stock so as to affect them adversely 
 
 (ii) any amendment or alteration of the Company s certificate of incorporation to authorize or create, or increase the authorized amount of, any shares of, or any securities convertible into shares of, any class or series of the Company's capital stock ranking prior to the Series CC Preferred Stock in the payment of dividends or in the distribution of assets on any liquidation, dissolution, or winding up of the Company or 
 
 (iii) the consummation of a binding share exchange or reclassification involving the Series CC Preferred Stock or a merger or consolidation of the Company with another entity, except that holders of Series CC Preferred Stock will have no right to vote under this provision or otherwise under Delaware law if in each case (i) the Series CC Preferred Stock remains outstanding or, in the case of any such merger or consolidation with respect to which the Company is not the surviving or resulting entity, is converted into or exchanged for preferred securities of the surviving or resulting entity or its ultimate parent, that is an entity organized and existing under the laws of the United States of America, any state thereof or the District of Columbia and that is a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes (or if such entity is not a corporation, the Company having received an opinion of nationally recognized counsel experienced in such matters to the effect that Holders will be subject to tax for U.S. federal income tax purposes with respect to such new preferred securities after such merger or consolidation in the same amount, at the same time and otherwise in the same manner as would have been the case under the Series CC Preferred Stock prior to such merger or consolidation), and (ii) such Series CC Preferred Stock remaining outstanding or such preferred securities, as the case may be, have such rights, preferences, privileges and voting powers, taken as a whole, as are not materially less favorable to the holders thereof than the rights, preferences, privileges and voting powers of the Series CC Preferred Stock, taken as a whole 
 provided, however , that, for the avoidance of doubt, any increase in the amount of the authorized or issued Series CC Preferred Stock or authorized preferred stock or any securities convertible into preferred stock or the creation and issuance, or an increase in the authorized or issued amount, of other series of preferred stock or any securities convertible into preferred stock ranking equally with and or junior to the Series CC Preferred Stock with respect to the payment of dividends (whether such dividends are cumulative or noncumulative) and or the distribution of assets upon the Company s liquidation, dissolution or winding up will not be deemed to adversely affect the voting powers, preferences or special rights of the Series CC Preferred Stock, and no stockholder will have the right to vote on such an increase, creation or issuance by reason of this Section 7. 
 If any amendment, alteration, repeal, share exchange, reclassification, merger or consolidation specified in this Section 7(c) would adversely affect one or more but not all series 

of preferred stock of the Company, then only such series of preferred stock as are adversely affected by and entitled to vote on the matter shall vote on the matter together with the Series CC Preferred Stock as a single class (in lieu of all other series of preferred stock) for purposes of the vote or consent required by this Section 7(c). 
 
 (d) No Vote if Redemption . No vote or consent of the Holders shall be required pursuant to Section 7(b) or 7(c) if, at or prior to the time when the act with respect to such vote or consent would otherwise be required shall be effected, the Company shall have redeemed or shall have called for redemption all outstanding shares of Series CC Preferred Stock, with proper notice and sufficient funds having been set aside for such redemption, in each case pursuant to Section 6 above. 

Section 8. Preemption and Conversion Rights . 
 
 The Holders shall not have any preemptive rights or conversion rights as a result of the terms hereof.

Section 10. Reacquired Shares .

 All percentages resulting from any calculation of the dividend rate will be rounded, if necessary, to the nearest 1 100,000 of 1 (.0000001), with five one-millionths of a percentage point rounded upward.

References herein to the accrual of dividends refer only to the determination of the amount of such dividend and do not imply that any right to a dividend arises prior to the date on which a dividend is declared. 
 
 (c) Priority of Dividends . So long as any share of Series DD Preferred Stock remains outstanding, unless as to a dividend payment date full dividends on all outstanding shares of the Series DD Preferred Stock have been declared and paid or declared and a sum sufficient for the payment of those dividends has been set aside for the dividend period then ending, the Company will not, and will cause its subsidiaries not to, during the next succeeding dividend period, declare or pay any dividend on, make any distributions relating to, or redeem, purchase, acquire or make a liquidation payment relating to, any Junior Stock, or make any guarantee payment with respect thereto, other than 

(i) purchases, redemptions or other acquisitions of shares of Junior Stock in connection with any employment contract, benefit plan or other similar arrangement with or for the benefit of employees, officers, directors or consultants 
 
 (ii) purchases of shares of Common Stock pursuant to a contractually binding requirement to buy stock existing prior to the commencement of the then-current dividend period, including under a contractually binding stock repurchase plan

 (vi) the purchase of Junior Stock by any investment banking subsidiary of the Company in connection with market-making or other secondary market activities in the ordinary course of the business of such subsidiary. 
 
 The restrictions set forth in the preceding provisions of this Section 4(c) shall not apply to any Junior Stock dividends paid by the Company where the dividend is in the form of the same stock (or the right to buy the same stock) as that on which the dividend is being paid. 
 Except as provided below, for so long as any share of Series DD Preferred Stock remains outstanding, if dividends are not declared and paid in full upon the shares of Series DD Preferred Stock and any class or series of stock of the Company now existing or hereafter authorized that ranks equally with the Series DD Preferred Stock in the payment of dividends, all dividends declared upon shares of Series DD Preferred Stock and such other stock will be declared on a proportional basis so that the amount of dividends declared per share will bear to each other the same ratio that accrued dividends for the then-current dividend period per share of Series DD Preferred Stock and accrued dividends for the then-current dividend period per share of such other stock (including, in the case of any such other stock that bears cumulative dividends, all accrued and unpaid dividends) bear to each other. 
 Subject to the foregoing, and not otherwise, such dividends payable in cash, stock or otherwise, as may be determined by the Board of Directors or any duly authorized committee thereof, may be declared and paid on any other class or series of stock of the Company from time to time out of any funds legally available for such payment, and Holders will not be entitled to participate in those dividends.

 (c) Merger, Consolidation and Sale of Assets Not Liquidation . For purposes of this Section 5, the sale, conveyance, exchange or transfer (for cash, shares of stock, securities or other consideration) of all or substantially all of the property and assets of the Company shall not be deemed a voluntary or involuntary dissolution, liquidation or winding up of the affairs of the Company, nor shall the merger, consolidation or any other business combination transaction of the Company into or with any other corporation or Person or the merger, consolidation or any other business combination transaction of any other corporation or Person into or with the Company be deemed to be a voluntary or involuntary dissolution, liquidation or winding up of the affairs of the Company.

If and whenever dividends on the Series DD Preferred Stock or any other class or series of preferred stock that ranks on parity with the Series DD Preferred Stock as to payment of dividends and upon which voting rights equivalent to those granted by this Section 7(b)(i) have been conferred and are exercisable (any such class or series being referred to herein as dividend parity stock have not been declared and paid in an aggregate amount equal, as to any class or series, to at least three semi-annual or six quarterly dividend periods, as applicable, (whether consecutive or not) (a Nonpayment ), the authorized number of directors constituting the Board of Directors shall be increased by two, and the Holders, together with holders of dividend parity stock, shall have the right, voting separately as a single class without regard to class or series (and with voting rights allocated pro rata based on the liquidation preference of each such class or series), to the exclusion of the holders of Common Stock, to elect two directors of the Company to fill such newly created directorships (and to fill any vacancies in the terms of such directorships), provided that it shall be a qualification for election of any such director that the election of such director shall not cause the Company to violate the corporate governance requirements of the New York Stock Exchange (or other exchange on which the Company s securities may be listed) that listed companies must have a majority of independent directors and further provided that the Board of Directors shall at no time include more than two such directors. Each such director elected by the Holders together with holders of dividend parity stock is a Preferred Stock Director . 
 
 (ii) Election . The election of the Preferred Stock Directors will take place at any annual meeting of stockholders or any special meeting of the Holders and any dividend parity stock, called as provided herein. At any time after the special voting power has vested pursuant to Section 7(b)(i) above, the secretary of the Company may, and upon the written request (addressed to the secretary at the Company s principal office) of the holders of at least 20 of the voting power of the Series DD Preferred Stock or the holders of at least 20 of the voting power of any series of dividend parity stock then outstanding (with such voting power measured based on the voting power to elect Preferred Stock Directors), must (unless such request is received less than 90 days before the date fixed for the next annual or special meeting of the stockholders of the Company, in which event such election shall be held at such next annual or special meeting of stockholders), call a special meeting of the holders of Series DD Preferred Stock and any dividend parity stock for the purposes of electing Preferred Stock Directors.

meeting within 20 days after receipt of any such request, then any Holder may (at the expense of the Company) call such meeting, upon notice as provided in this Section 7(b)(iii), and for that purpose will have access to the stock register of the Company. The Preferred Stock Directors elected at any such special meeting and each Preferred Stock Director elected at a subsequent annual or special meeting of stockholders, will be elected for term expiring upon the earlier of the Preferred Stock Director Termination Date and the next annual meeting of stockholders following such Preferred Stock Director's election. In case any vacancy in the office of a Preferred Stock Director occurs (other than prior to the initial election of the Preferred Stock Directors), the vacancy may be filled by the Preferred Stock Director remaining in office, or if none remains in office, by a plurality of the votes cast by the holders of Series DD Preferred Stock and any dividend parity stock, voting together as a single class, and the Preferred Stock Director so appointed or elected to fill such vacancy shall serve for a term expiring at the next annual meeting of the stockholders. Preferred Stock Directors may only be elected by the holders of Series DD Preferred Stock and dividend parity stock in accordance with this Section 7. If the holders of Series DD Preferred Stock and such dividend parity stock fail to elect a sufficient number of directors to fill all directorships for which they are entitled to elect directors pursuant to this Section 7, then any directorship not so filled shall remain vacant until such time as the holders of Series DD Preferred Stock and such dividend parity stock elect a person to fill such directorship in accordance with this Section 7, or such vacancy is otherwise filled in accordance with this Section 7 and no such directorship may be filled by stockholders of the Company other than in accordance with this Section 7.

Whenever the Company has paid noncumulative dividends in full for at least two consecutive semi-annual or four consecutive quarterly dividend periods following a Nonpayment on the Series DD Preferred Stock and on any dividend parity stock entitled to noncumulative dividends and has paid cumulative dividends in full on any dividend parity stock entitled to cumulative dividends, then the right of the Holders to elect the Preferred Stock Directors will cease (but subject always to the same provisions for the vesting of the special voting rights in the case of any similar non-payment of dividends in respect of future dividend periods) (the time of such cessation, the Preferred Stock Director Termination Date ). Upon a Preferred Stock Director Termination Date, the terms of office of the Preferred Stock Directors will immediately terminate, the persons then serving as Preferred Stock Directors shall immediately cease to be qualified to hold office as Preferred Stock Directors, the Preferred Stock Directors shall cease to be directors of the Company and the number of directors constituting the Board of Directors shall be automatically reduced, without any action by the Board of Directors or the stockholders of the Company, by the number of Preferred Stock Directors authorized immediately prior to such termination. Any Preferred Stock Director may be removed at any time without cause by the holders of a majority of the voting power of outstanding shares of the capital stock then entitled to vote in the election of Preferred Stock Directors, voting together as a single class (with such voting power measured based on the voting power to elect Preferred Stock Directors).

(f) Involuntary Termination Other than for Gross Misconduct.

 (i) For purposes of this Agreement, a Significant Competitor of the Company means any company or other entity designated by the Committee as such and included on a list of Significant Competitors that will be made available to Participant and that may be updated by the Company from time to time in its discretion. Employment by a Significant Competitor includes service on a board of directors or similar governing body of any Significant Competitor (including subsidiaries or affiliates) that is also listed in the full Compensation Peer Group in Citigroup s most recent annual Proxy Statement. For purposes of this Subsection 3(k), Company means Citigroup and any of its subsidiaries. 
 
 (ii) Whenever the Award continues to be settled pursuant to Subsection 3(j) hereof following a termination of employment, the settlement of the Award will be conditioned upon Participant s providing by each subsequent Scheduled Vesting Date, if requested by the Company, a written certification that Participant has complied with the terms and conditions of Subsection 3(j) hereof in a form satisfactory to the Company. The list of Significant Competitors in effect at the time Participant terminates employment with the Company and the companies listed in the full Compensation Peer Group in Citigroup s most recent annual Proxy Statement at the time Participant terminates employment with the Company will apply to such certification. If an acceptable certification is not provided by a Scheduled Vesting Date, settlement of the Award will cease as of the date that is immediately prior to such Scheduled Vesting Date, the remaining outstanding portion of the Award will be canceled, and Participant will have no further rights of any kind with respect to such Award. 
 
 4. Post-Employment Covenants. 
 
 (a) Solicitation of Employees and Clients . If Participant is subject to the Employment Termination Notice and Nonsolicitation Policy for U.S. Employees Notice Policy ), to the extent permitted by law, Participant agrees to the nonsolicitation obligation described in the Notice Policy. If Participant is not subject to the Notice Policy then for the one-year period following the date Participant s employment with the Company terminates, to the extent permitted by law, Participant agrees that he or she will not (1) engage in any conduct, either individually or in concert with a third party, which, directly or indirectly, causes or attempts to cause any employee to leave the employment of the Company regardless of whether the solicitation for employment originates from the Company employee, or hire, or participate directly or indirectly in the hiring of, on his or her own behalf or on behalf of another person, any person who is or, during the preceding six months was, an employee of the Company, or (2) directly or indirectly, induce or otherwise counsel, advise, encourage or solicit, including through the use of social media, any client of the Company whom Participant serviced or had substantial contact with during his or her employment to terminate its relationship with the Company or to transfer assets away from or otherwise reduce its business with the Company. For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 4(a), shall not apply if Participant s work location is in California or Participant is a California resident on the date of his or her termination of employment by the Company. 
 10 

(b) Cooperation . Upon reasonable request, the Participant shall make himself or herself available to the Company to furnish full and truthful information concerning any event which took place during Participant s employment. Upon reasonable request, as deemed necessary by the Company, the Participant shall make himself or herself available to the Company to furnish full and truthful consultations concerning any potential or actual litigation. Participant shall furnish the information as soon as is practical after a request from the Company is received. The Company shall reimburse Participant for the reasonable cost of all Participant s travel, lodging, meals and any loss of compensation suffered by Participant from his current employer as a result of time spent furnishing information. 

5. Settlement and Transferability. 
 
 (a) If all applicable conditions to settlement of any portion of the Award have been satisfied as of the Scheduled Vesting Date for such portion, the Award will be settled through payment or distribution of cash or Shares (as applicable) as soon thereafter as is administratively practicable, except as may be provided elsewhere in this Agreement, including without limitation clause (y) in the first sentence of Section 2 hereof (a Delayed Settlement ), in any case with interest only as expressly provided for in the Legal Documents. In all circumstances, settlement is subject to receipt by the Company of the information necessary to make required tax payments, compliance with any post-termination stock ownership commitment applicable to the Deferred Stock Award and submission of appropriate documentation of compliance. 
 (b) No portion of the Award may be sold, pledged, hypothecated, assigned, margined or otherwise transferred, other than by will or the laws of descent and distribution, and neither the Award nor any interest or right therein will be subject to the debts, contracts or engagements of Participant or his or her successors in interest or will be subject to disposition by transfer, alienation, anticipation, pledge, encumbrance, assignment or any other means whether such disposition be voluntary or involuntary or by operation of law, by judgment, lien, levy, attachment, garnishment or any other legal or equitable proceedings (including bankruptcy or divorce), and any attempted disposition thereof will be null and void, of no effect, and not binding on the Company in any way. Participant agrees that any purported transfer will be null and void, and will constitute a breach of this Agreement causing damage to the Company for which the remedy will be cancelation of the Award. During Participant s lifetime, all rights with respect to the Award will be exercisable only by Participant, and any and all payments in respect of the Award will be to Participant only. The Company will be under no obligation to entertain, investigate, respect, preserve, protect or enforce any actual or purported rights or interests asserted by any creditor of Participant or any other third party in the Award, and Participant agrees to take all reasonable measures to protect the Company against any such claims being asserted in respect of the Award and to reimburse the Company for any and all reasonable expenses it incurs defending against or complying with any such third-party claims if Participant could have reasonably acted to prevent such claims from being asserted against the Company. 
 
 6. Stockholder Rights and Fractional Shares. 
 
 (a) Participant will have no voting rights as a stockholder of Citigroup over any Shares subject to the Deferred Stock Award, unless and until the Shares subject to the Deferred Stock Award are distributed to the Participant. Dividends will be paid on sale-restricted Shares to the extent dividends are paid to record holders of shares of outstanding Citigroup stock. 6 Participants who are subject to anti-hedging provisions under the Company s trading policies, including the UK, EMEA and other local policies, may not trade in Shares or employ personal hedging or pledging strategies with respect to the Deferred Stock Award, except as otherwise permitted by such policies. 
 
 11 

(b) The Company shall not be obligated to issue any fractional Shares when Shares are deliverable. If the Deferred Stock Award includes or results in an entitlement to a fractional Share for any reason, the Deferred Stock Award shall be settled in full by issuance of the maximum whole number of Shares Participant is entitled to receive and the Company may cancel the fractional Share without any compensation to the Participant. 

_____________________________________ 
 6 Employees who have not been designated as MRTs may be entitled to the payment of dividend-equivalents on their Awards. Dividend-equivalents are paid to employees on or about the time dividends are paid to Citi stockholders unless the Award is subject to a performance vesting condition. For Awards subject to a performance vesting condition, dividend-equivalents are earned and paid after the performance condition is satisfied. 

7. Clawback and Right of Set-Off. 
 
 (a) Clawback . If it is determined by the Committee within the clawback periods outlined in Subsections 2(j) and 2(k), 7 that any Settlement Condition that was treated as satisfied on a Scheduled Vesting Date in connection with the settlement of such portion was, in fact, not satisfied (whether by reason of events occurring prior to, on or after any such Scheduled Vesting Date), Participant is obligated upon demand, to (i) return to Citigroup any Shares distributed to Participant in connection with such settlement or pay to Citigroup an amount equal to the fair market value of such Shares on (x) the applicable Scheduled Vesting Date or (y) the date of such payment, whichever is greater and (ii) pay to Citigroup the gross amount of any cash paid in connection with such settlement, in each case, without reduction for any Shares or cash withheld to satisfy withholding tax or other obligations in connection with such settlement. No portion of the Award shall be deemed to have been fully earned for any purpose unless and until the rights of Citigroup to claw back such portion under this Subsection (a) have lapsed. 
 
 (b) Right of Set-Off . Participant agrees that the Company may, to the extent determined by the Committee to be permitted by applicable law and consistent with the requirements to avoid tax under Section 409A of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the Code ), (x) retain for itself funds or securities otherwise payable to Participant pursuant to the Award or any award under any award program administered by the Company to offset (i) any amounts paid by the Company to a third party pursuant to any award, judgment, or settlement of a complaint, arbitration, or lawsuit of which Participant was the subject or (ii) any outstanding amounts (including, without limitation, travel and entertainment or advance account balances, loans, clawback or other repayment obligations under this Agreement or any award agreement, or any obligations pursuant to a tax-equalization or housing allowance policy or other expatriate benefit) that Participant owes the Company or its affiliates, and (y) if Participant recovers any amount in the nature of severance pay or compensation for hypothetical or potential future services in connection with any legal claim or action alleging violation of law relating to Participant s employment or termination thereof, whether by reason of a decision or settlement of such claim, reduce the amount to be paid in connection with the settlement of the Award following the termination of Participant s employment, on a dollar-for-dollar basis, by the pre-tax amount required to be paid for the Participant s account (including legal fees) in connection with such claim or action. The Company may not retain any funds or securities described in Clause 7(b)(x) hereof, or set-off obligations or liabilities described in such Clause, as described above, until such time as they would otherwise be distributable or payable to Participant in accordance with the applicable award terms. Only after-tax amounts will be applied to set-off any such obligations and liabilities and Participant will remain liable to pay any amounts that are not thereby satisfied in full. 
 
 (c) Dodd-Frank Clawback Provisions . Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary, if Participant is a Covered Individual, as defined in the Citigroup Inc. Dodd-Frank Clawback Provisions (the Clawback Provisions ), Participant s Award and any other compensation paid or payable 
 12 

to Participant pursuant to this Agreement may be subject to recovery by the Company if the Committee determines, in its sole discretion, that Participant received Erroneously Awarded Compensation, as defined by the Clawback Provisions. Furthermore, if Participant is a Covered Individual on the Award Date, or becomes a Covered Individual at any time while this Award is outstanding, then in exchange for the benefits provided by this Award, Participant hereby acknowledges and agrees that the Clawback Provisions shall be applicable to any component of the Participant s DIRAP awards that would otherwise be subject to recovery pursuant to the Clawback Provisions. 
 
 8. Consent to Electronic Delivery. In lieu of receiving documents in paper format, Participant hereby agrees, to the fullest extent permitted by law, to accept electronic delivery of all documents that Citigroup may be required to deliver (including, but not limited to, the Legal Documents and all other forms or communications) in connection with the Award and any other prior or future incentive award or program made or offered by Citigroup or its predecessors or successors.

 9. Plan Administration, Determinations and Interpretations. The Committee has sole, final and binding exclusive discretionary authority to (x) make findings of fact, interpretations, calculations, conclusions and other determinations under or with respect to the Legal Documents and any other communication relating in any way to the Award and (y) establish and operationalize administrative procedures to implement the terms of the Award. 
 
 10. Adjustments to Award. 
 
 (a) Capital Structure. In the event of any change in Citigroup s capital structure on account of (i) any extraordinary dividend, stock dividend, stock split, reverse stock split or any similar equity restructuring or (ii) any combination or exchange of equity securities, merger, consolidation, recapitalization, reorganization, divestiture or other distribution (other than ordinary cash dividends) of assets to stockholders, or any other similar event affecting Citigroup s capital structure (a Capital Restructuring ), to the extent necessary to prevent the enlargement or diminution of the rights of Participants, the Committee will make such appropriate equitable adjustments as may be permitted by the terms of the Stock Incentive Plan and applicable law, to the number or kind of Shares subject to the Deferred Stock Award. 
 
 (b) Equitable Adjustments. In the event of a Capital Restructuring, the Committee will adjust the calculation of Significant Loss, Loss Ratio and any related provision of the Award in a manner consistent with such event, which adjustment will not require the consent of the Participant. 
 
 (c) Modifications. The Committee retains the right to modify the Award if required to comply with applicable law, regulation, or regulatory guidance (including applicable tax law) without Participant s prior consent. Citigroup will furnish or make available to Participant a written notice of any modification, which notice will specify the effective date of such modification. Any other adverse modification not elsewhere described in this Agreement will not be effective without Participant s written consent. 
 
 (d) Adverse Consequences. Neither the Committee nor Citigroup will be liable to Participant for any additional personal tax or other adverse consequences of any adjustments that are made to an Award. 
 
 13 

11. Taxes and Tax Residency Status. 
 
 (a) Compliance. By accepting the Award, Participant agrees to pay all applicable taxes (or hypothetical tax if Participant is subject to tax equalization or tax protection pursuant to a Citigroup Expatriate policy) and to file all required tax returns in all jurisdictions where Participant is subject to tax and or an income tax filing requirement, without regard to the amount withheld or reported. To assist Citigroup in achieving full compliance with its obligations under the laws of all relevant taxing jurisdictions, Participant agrees to keep complete and accurate records of his or her income tax residency status and the number and location of travel and workdays outside of his or her country of income tax residency from the date of the Award until the settlement of the Award and the subsequent sale of any Shares received in connection with the Deferred Stock Award. Participant also agrees to provide, upon request, complete and accurate information about his or her tax residency status to Citigroup during such periods, and confirmation of his or her status as a (i) U.S. citizen, (ii) holder of a U.S. green card, or (iii) citizen or legal resident of a country other than the U.S. Participant will be responsible for any tax due, including penalties and interest, arising from any misstatement by Participant regarding such information. The Award will be subject to cancelation if Participant fails to make any such required payment. 
 
 (b) Deferred Stock Award . To the extent the Company is required to withhold tax in any jurisdiction upon the settlement of the Deferred Stock Award or at such times as otherwise may be required in connection with the Deferred Stock Award, Participant acknowledges that the Company may (but is not required to) provide Participant alternative methods of paying the Company the amount due to the appropriate tax authorities (or to the Company, in the case of hypothetical tax), as determined by the Committee. If no method of tax withholding is specified at or prior to the time any tax (or hypothetical tax) is due on the Deferred Stock Award, or if Participant does not make a timely election, the Company will withhold Shares from the Shares that are distributable to Participant to fund any or any portion of tax that is required by law to be withheld. Whenever withholding in Shares is permitted or mandated by the Committee, the number of Shares to be withheld will be determined by the Company, provided however, if the value of the Shares withheld by the Company exceeds Participant s tax liability as determined by the Company in its sole discretion, then the Company shall pay or distribute to Participant such excess amount in cash, Shares or a combination of the foregoing, as soon as is administratively practicable after all withholding tax requirements are satisfied in all applicable jurisdictions. If Participant is a current or former Citigroup Expatriate subject to tax equalization, Participant agrees to promptly pay to the Company, in cash (or by any other means acceptable to the Committee), the excess of the amount of hypothetical tax due over the tax withheld with respect to the Deferred Stock Award. Participant agrees that the Committee may require that some or all of the tax (or hypothetical tax) withholding obligations in connection with the Deferred Stock Award must be satisfied in cash only, that timely payment of such amounts when due will be considered a condition to settlement of the Deferred Stock Award, and that if the required amounts are not timely remitted to the Company, the Deferred Stock Award may be canceled. Whenever the payment of required withholding tax (or hypothetical tax) in cash is permitted or mandated by the Committee and provision for timely payment of such amounts by Participant has not been made, instead of canceling an equity award (as provided above), the Company may sell on behalf of Participant, at Participant s market risk and expense, the number of Shares subject to the award that at the market sale price obtainable for the Shares on or as soon as practicable after the due date for the tax (or hypothetical tax) owed by Participant, will produce sufficient proceeds to satisfy Participant s tax (or hypothetical tax) obligation, and remit such proceeds to the appropriate tax authorities (or in the case of hypothetical tax, retain such proceeds in satisfaction of Participant s obligation to the Company) any remaining sales proceeds, after deduction for commissions and other reasonable and customary expenses, and any remaining Shares (if otherwise distributable to Participant) will be delivered to Participant. 
 
 12. Entire Agreement No Right to Employment. The Legal Documents set forth the entire understanding between the Company and Participant regarding the Award and supersede all other written, oral, or implied understandings between the parties hereto about the subject matter hereof, including any written or electronic agreement, election form or other communication to, from or between 
 14 

Participant and the Company. Nothing contained herein or in any incentive plan or program documents will confer upon Participant any rights to continued employment or employment in any particular position, at any specific rate of compensation, or for any particular period of time. 
 
 13. Compliance with Regulatory Requirements. The Award may be subject to the applicable law (including tax laws) and regulatory guidance in multiple jurisdictions, and will be administered and interpreted consistently with such law and regulatory guidance, including but not limited to Section 409A and Section 457A of the Code. 
 
 14. Section 409A and Section 457A Compliance. 
 
 (a) Tax Liability. Participant understands that as a result of Section 409A and or Section 457A of the Code, if Participant is a U.S. taxpayer he or she could be subject to adverse tax consequences if the Award or the plans and program documents are not administered in accordance with the requirements to avoid tax under Section 409A or Section 457A. Participant further understands that if Participant is a U.S. taxpayer, and the Award is considered to be a nonqualified deferred compensation plan and Participant s employer is considered to be a nonqualified entity (as such terms are defined in Section 409A and or Section 457A of the Code), Participant could be subject to accelerated income recognition or other adverse tax consequences with respect to all or a portion of the Award if Citigroup fails to modify the Award. Participant acknowledges that there is no guarantee that the Award, or any amendment or modification thereto, will successfully avoid unintended tax consequences to Participant and that the Company does not accept any liability therefor. 
 
 (b) Specified Employees. If the Award is subject to Section 409A of the Code, this Agreement may not be amended, nor may the Award be administered, to provide for any distribution of Shares to occur upon any event that would constitute a separation from service (within the meaning of Section 409A of the Code) if Participant is a specified employee (within the meaning of Treas. Reg. 1.409A-1(i)(1)) at the time of such Participant s separation from service, unless it is provided that the distribution or payment will not be made until the date which is six months from such separation from service, or, if earlier, the date of Participant s death and that during such six-month deferral period, Participant will not be entitled to interest, notional interest, dividends, dividend equivalents, or any compensation for any loss in market value or otherwise which occurs with respect to the Award during such deferral period. 
 
 (d) Delayed Settlement . If the Award is subject to Section 409A of the Code and there is a Delayed Settlement that extends beyond December 31 of the year in which the Scheduled Vesting Date occurs, unless Participant timely complies with the notification and enforcement provisions of Treas. Reg. 1.409A-3(g), the Company has full and sole discretionary authority to modify the Award in order to avoid a violation of Section 409A of the Code. 
 
 15. Arbitration Conflict Governing Law Severability. 
 
 (a) Arbitration. Any and all disputes, claims or controversies related to or arising out of the Award or the Legal Documents, including, without limitation, any claim that an Award, in whole or in part, should have been, but was not made, or that this Agreement or any of the Legal Documents is void, voidable, invalid, unlawful or unenforceable (each a Dispute ), will be finally and conclusively resolved by binding arbitration in accordance with the Company s arbitration policies, as in effect from time to time. In the absence of a Company arbitration policy that is applicable to you or your Award and your work location is outside of the United States at the time of the commencement of a Dispute, you irrevocably agree that (1) any such Dispute will be finally and conclusively resolved on an individual basis by binding arbitration administered by the American Arbitration Association AAA in accordance with its International Dispute Resolution Procedures in effect at the time of commencement of any such arbitration (collectively, the Rules ), except as such Rules are otherwise modified or expanded as set forth in Citi s Arbitration Policy, which is available on Citi For You, (2) the place of such arbitration shall be 
 15 

New York, New York, United States of America, and (3) any claim or dispute concerning the interpretation, application or validity of this provision shall be heard and decided exclusively by the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York (the Southern District ), and by any court having appellate jurisdiction over the Southern District, and in the event that the Southern District lacks jurisdiction over the subject matter of any such action or proceeding, the sole alternative forum for any such action or proceeding shall be the Supreme Court of the State of New York for the County of New York. 
 
 (b) Conflict. This Agreement will control in the event of a conflict between this Agreement and the Prospectus. In the event of a conflict between this Agreement and the Stock Incentive Plan, the Stock Incentive Plan will control. 
 
 (c) Governing Law. This Agreement will be governed by the laws of the State of New York (regardless of conflict of laws principles) as to all matters, including, but not limited to, the construction, application, validity and administration of the Company s incentive award programs. 
 
 (d) Severability. Except as otherwise provided below, Participant understands and acknowledges that the terms and conditions set forth herein, including without limitation Sections 2 through 7 hereof, are included herein for the purpose of ensuring sound incentive compensation practices. Therefore, the terms of this Agreement are intended not to be severable, so that if any provision of this Agreement, including without limitation any provision of Sections 2 through 7 hereof, is held void, unlawful, or unenforceable under any applicable statute or other controlling law (1) the remainder of this Agreement, including in particular but without limitation the obligations of the Company in respect of settlement of the Award, will be invalidated and deemed to be unenforceable and (2) any amount previously paid or distributed in settlement of the Award shall be considered to have been distributed in error and Participant shall repay or return such payment or distribution in accordance with Section 7 hereof. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the parties acknowledge and agree that (a) the arbitration agreement set out in Section 15 hereof is a separate and severable contract between them and that any dispute as to the enforceability or validity of this arbitration agreement, or as to the arbitrability of arbitral jurisdiction over any claim, shall be heard and decided by the arbitrators, and not by any court, and that this arbitration agreement shall survive the termination or expiration of this Agreement, (b) if only the arbitration provision set forth in Section 15 is held to be unenforceable, then Section 15 shall be severable from the remaining provisions of this Agreement.

The Company will be under no obligation to entertain, investigate, respect, preserve, protect or enforce any actual or purported rights or interests asserted by any creditor of Participant or any other third party in the Award, and Participant agrees to take all reasonable measures to protect the Company against any such claims being asserted in respect of the Award and to reimburse the Company for any and all reasonable expenses it incurs defending against or complying with any such third-party claims if Participant could have reasonably acted to prevent such claims from being asserted against the Company. 
 (c) Citigroup may assign the legal obligation to pay Participant s vested Earned Award to Participant s employer without the consent of Participant. 
 
 7. Clawback and Right of Set-Off. 
 (a) Clawback. If it is determined by the Committee not later than three years following the settlement of any portion of the Award (whether following an investigation or otherwise) that any Settlement Condition that was treated as satisfied in connection with the settlement of such portion was, in fact, not satisfied (whether by reason of events occurring prior to, on or after any such Scheduled Vesting Date), Participant is obligated upon demand, to pay to Citigroup (i) any amount paid to Participant in connection with such settlement and (ii) the gross amount paid to any other person in connection with such settlement, in each case, without reduction for any cash withheld to satisfy withholding tax or other obligations in connection with such settlement. No portion of the Award shall be deemed to have been fully earned for any purpose unless and until the rights of Citigroup to claw back such portion under this Subsection 7(a) have lapsed. 
 12 

(b) Right of Set-Off . Participant agrees that the Company may, to the extent determined by the Committee to be permitted by applicable law and consistent with the requirements to avoid tax under Section 409A of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the Code ), (x) retain for itself funds or securities otherwise payable to Participant pursuant to the Award or any award under any award program administered by the Company to offset (i) any amounts paid by the Company to a third party pursuant to any award, judgment, or settlement of a complaint, arbitration, or lawsuit of which Participant was the subject or (ii) any outstanding amounts (including, without limitation, travel and entertainment or advance account balances, loans, clawback or other repayment obligations under this Agreement or any award agreement, or any obligations pursuant to a tax-equalization or housing allowance policy or other expatriate benefit) that Participant owes the Company or its affiliates and (y) if Participant recovers any amount in the nature of severance pay or compensation for hypothetical or potential future services in connection with any legal claim or action alleging violation of law relating to Participant s employment or termination thereof, whether by reason of a decision or settlement of such claim, reduce the amount to be paid in connection with the settlement of the Award following the termination of Participant s employment, on a dollar-for-dollar basis, by the pre-tax amount required to be paid for the Participant s account (including legal fees) in connection with such claim or action. The Company may not retain any funds or securities described in Clause 7(b)(x) hereof, or set-off obligations or liabilities described in such Clause, as described above, until such time as they would otherwise be distributable or payable to Participant in accordance with the applicable award terms. Only after-tax amounts will be applied to set-off any such obligations and liabilities and Participant will remain liable to pay any amounts that are not thereby satisfied in full. 
 
 (c) Dodd-Frank Clawback Provisions . Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary, if Participant is a Covered Individual, as defined in the Citigroup Inc. Dodd-Frank Clawback Provisions (the Clawback Provisions ), Participant s Award and any other compensation paid or payable to Participant pursuant to this Agreement may be subject to recovery by the Company if the Committee determines, in its sole discretion, that Participant received Erroneously Awarded Compensation, as defined by the Clawback Provisions. Furthermore, if Participant is a Covered Individual on the Award Date, or becomes a Covered Individual at any time while this Award is outstanding, then in exchange for the benefits provided by this Award, Participant hereby acknowledges and agrees that the Clawback Provisions shall be applicable to any component of the Participant s DIRAP awards that would otherwise be subject to recovery pursuant to the Clawback Provisions. 
 
 8. Consent to Electronic Delivery. In lieu of receiving documents in paper format, Participant hereby agrees, to the fullest extent permitted by law, to accept electronic delivery of all documents that Citigroup may be required to deliver (including, but not limited to, the Agreement and all other forms or communications) in connection with the Award and any other prior or future incentive award or program made or offered by Citigroup or its predecessors or successors. Electronic delivery of a document to Participant may be via (x) a Company service provider such as DocuSign, or (y) a Company e-mail system or by reference to a location on a Company intranet or secure internet site to which Participant has access. 
 9. Plan Administration, Determinations and Interpretations. The Committee has sole, final and binding exclusive discretionary authority to (x) make findings of fact, interpretations, calculations, conclusions and other determinations under or with respect to the Agreement or 
 13 

any other communication, relating in any way to the Award and (y) establish and operationalize administrative procedures to implement the terms of the Award. 
 10. Adjustments to Awards. 
 
 (a) Capital Structure. In the event of any change in the capitalization of Citigroup on account of (i) an extraordinary dividend, stock dividend, stock split, reverse stock split or similar equity restructuring or (ii) a combination or exchange of equity securities, merger, consolidation, recapitalization, reorganization, divestiture, acquisition or distribution (other than ordinary cash dividends) of assets to stockholders, or other similar event affecting the capitalization of Citigroup, to the extent necessary to prevent the enlargement or diminution of the rights of Participant, the Committee will make appropriate equitable adjustments to the Award (including the determination of Weighted Average RoTCE, RoTCE, and Cumulative TBVPS), which adjustments will not require the consent of Participant. 
 
 (b) Equitable Adjustments. If an event, or series of similar or related events, occurs with respect to the Company that renders, in the determination of the Committee, either or both of the performance measures set forth in Section 2(b) to no longer be appropriate, then the Committee will make appropriate equitable adjustments to the Award (including the determination of Weighted Average RoTCE, RoTCE and Cumulative TBVPS) to the extent necessary to prevent the enlargement or diminution of the rights of Participant. In the event of an unusual or non-recurring event affecting Weighted Average RoTCE, RoTCE, or Cumulative TBVPS or a change in applicable tax laws or accounting principles, the Committee will make appropriate equitable adjustments to the Award (including the determination of Weighted Average RoTCE, RoTCE and Cumulative TBVPS), to the extent necessary to prevent the enlargement or diminution of the rights of Participant, which adjustments will not require the consent of Participant. 
 
 (c) Compliance Modifications. The Committee retains the right to modify the Award if required to comply with applicable law, regulation, or regulatory guidance (including applicable tax law) without the consent of Participant. Citigroup will furnish or make available to Participant a written notice of any modification through a brochure supplement or otherwise, which notice will specify the effective date of such modification. Any other adverse modification not elsewhere described in this Agreement will not be effective without Participant s written consent. 
 
 (d) Comparison Group. If, during the Performance Period, one or more companies in the Comparison Group merges, engages in a spin-off or otherwise experiences a material change in its business activities or it or one of its primary businesses shall terminate or cease due to receivership, bankruptcy, sale, or otherwise, then the Committee shall eliminate such company from the Comparison Group or make other adjustments to the Comparison Group, such as adding an acquirer or a new company to the Comparison Group, to the extent necessary to prevent the enlargement or diminution of the rights of Participants, with any such changes having effect for purposes of all calculations hereunder. In any of these events, the approach to determining percentiles shall also be equitably adjusted by the Committee, to the extent necessary to prevent the enlargement or diminution of the rights of Participants. 
 
 14 

(e) Adverse Consequences. Neither the Committee nor Citigroup will be liable to Participant for any additional personal tax or other adverse consequences of any adjustments that are made to the Award. 
 
 11. Taxes and Tax Residency Status. 
 (a) Compliance. By accepting the Award, Participant agrees to pay all applicable taxes (or hypothetical tax if Participant is subject to tax equalization or tax protection pursuant to a Citigroup Expatriate policy) and to file all required tax returns in all jurisdictions where Participant is subject to tax and or an income tax filing requirement, without regard to the amount withheld or reported. To assist Citigroup in achieving full compliance with its obligations under the laws of all relevant taxing jurisdictions, Participant agrees to keep complete and accurate records of his or her income tax residency status and the number and location of travel and workdays outside of his or her country of income tax residency from the date of the Award until the settlement of the Award. Participant also agrees to provide, upon request, complete and accurate information about his or her tax residency status to Citigroup during such periods, and confirmation of his or her status as a (i) U.S. citizen, (ii) holder of a U.S. green card, or (iii) citizen or legal resident of a country other than the U.S. Participant will be responsible for any tax due, including penalties and interest, arising from any misstatement by Participant regarding such information. The Award will be subject to cancelation if Participant fails to make any such required payment. 
 
 (b) Withholding . To the extent the Company is required to withhold tax in any jurisdiction upon the settlement of the Award or at such times as otherwise may be required in connection with the Award, Participant acknowledges that the Company may (but is not required to) provide Participant alternative methods of paying the Company the amount due to the appropriate tax authorities (or to the Company, in the case of hypothetical tax), as determined by the Committee. If no method of tax withholding is specified at or prior to the time any tax (or hypothetical tax) is due on the Award, or if Participant does not make a timely election, the Company will withhold the applicable amount from the payment made to Participant to fund any or any portion of tax that is required by law to be withheld. If Participant is a current or former Citigroup Expatriate subject to tax equalization, Participant agrees to promptly pay to the Company, in cash (or by any other means acceptable to the Committee), the excess of the amount of hypothetical tax due over the tax withheld with respect to the Award. Participant agrees that the Committee may require that some or all of the tax (or hypothetical tax) withholding obligations in connection with the Award must be satisfied in cash only, that timely payment of such amounts when due will be considered a condition to settlement of the Award, and that if the required amounts are not timely remitted to the Company, the Award may be canceled. 
 
 12. Entire Agreement No Right to Employment. The Legal Documents set forth the entire understanding between the Company and Participant regarding the Award and supersede all other written, oral, or implied understandings between the parties hereto about the subject matter hereof, including any written or electronic agreement, election form or other communication to, from or between Participant and the Company. Nothing contained herein or in any incentive plan or program documents will confer upon Participant any rights to continued employment or employment in any particular position, at any specific rate of compensation, or for any particular period of time. 
 15 

13. Compliance with Regulatory Requirements. The Award may be subject to the applicable law (including tax laws) and regulatory guidance in multiple jurisdictions, and will be administered and interpreted consistently with such law and regulatory guidance, including but not limited to Section 409A and Section 457A of the Code. 
 14. Section 409A and Section 457A Compliance. 
 (a) Tax Liability. Participant understands that as a result of Section 409A and or Section 457A of the Code, if Participant is a U.S. taxpayer he or she could be subject to adverse tax consequences if the Award or the plans and program documents are not administered in accordance with the requirements to avoid tax under Section 409A or Section 457A. Participant further understands that if Participant is a U.S. taxpayer, and the Award is considered to be a nonqualified deferred compensation plan and Participant s employer is considered to be a nonqualified entity (as such terms are defined in Section 409A and or Section 457A of the Code), Participant could be subject to accelerated income recognition or other adverse tax consequences with respect to all or a portion of the Award if Citigroup fails to modify the Award. Participant acknowledges that there is no guarantee that the Award, or any amendment or modification thereto, will successfully avoid unintended tax consequences to Participant and that the Company does not accept any liability therefor. 
 
 (b) Specified Employees. If the Award is subject to Section 409A of the Code, this Agreement may not be amended, nor may the Award be administered, to provide for any payment of the Award to occur upon any event that would constitute a separation from service (within the meaning of Section 409A of the Code) if Participant is a specified employee (within the meaning of Treas. Reg. 1.409A-1(i)(1)) at the time of such Participant s separation from service, unless it is provided that the distribution or payment will not be made until the date which is six months from such separation from service, or, if earlier, the date of Participant s death and that during such six-month deferral period, Participant will not be entitled to interest, notional interest, dividends, dividend equivalents, or any compensation for any loss in market value or otherwise which occurs with respect to the Award during such deferral period. 
 (c) Delayed Settlement . If the Award is subject to Section 409A of the Code and there is a Delayed Settlement that extends beyond December 31 of the year in which the Award Payment Date occurs, unless Participant timely complies with the notification and enforcement provisions of Treas. Reg. 1.409A-3(g), the Company has full and sole discretionary authority to modify the Award in order to avoid a violation of Section 409A of the Code. 
 
 15. Arbitration Conflict Governing Law Severability. 
 (a) Arbitration Any and all disputes, claims or controversies related to or arising out of the Award or the Legal Documents, including, without limitation, any claim that an Award, in whole or in part, should have been, but was not made, or that this Agreement or any of the Legal Documents is void, voidable, invalid, unlawful or unenforceable (each a Dispute ), will be finally and conclusively resolved by binding arbitration in accordance with the Company s arbitration policies, as in effect from time to time.

 (c) Governing Law. This Agreement will be governed by the laws of the State of New York (regardless of conflict of laws principles) as to all matters, including, but not limited to, the construction, application, validity and administration of the Company s incentive award programs. 
 
 (d) Severability. Except as otherwise provided below, Participant understands and acknowledges that the terms and conditions set forth herein, including without limitation Sections 3 through 7 hereof, are included herein for the purpose of ensuring sound incentive compensation practices. Therefore, the terms of this Agreement are intended not to be severable, so that if any provision of this Agreement, including without limitation any provision of Sections 3 through 7 hereof, is held void, unlawful, or unenforceable under any applicable statute or other controlling law (1) the remainder of this Agreement, including in particular but without limitation the obligations of the Company in respect of settlement of the Award, will be invalidated and deemed to be unenforceable and (2) any amount previously paid or distributed in settlement of the Award shall be considered to have been distributed in error and Participant shall repay or return such payment or distribution in accordance with Section 7 hereof.
