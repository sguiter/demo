 Our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States GAAP and with the instructions to Form 10-Q and Article 10 of Regulation S-X for interim financial information. Accordingly, these financial statements do not include all of the information required by GAAP or Securities and Exchange Commission rules and regulations for complete financial statements. In the opinion of management, these financial statements reflect all adjustments (consisting of normal recurring adjustments) necessary for a fair presentation of the results of operations for the interim periods presented. The results of operations for any interim period are not necessarily indicative of results for the full year. These unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with our 2023 consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in our 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K, as amended (our 2023 10-K ). 
 
 The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. Estimates and assumptions are used in accounting for, among other things, the valuation of acquisition-related assets and liabilities, allowances for uncollectible accounts, certain components of revenue, programming and copyright costs, deferred income taxes and related valuation allowances, loss contingencies, fair value measurements, impairment assessments, capitalization of internal costs associated with construction and installation activities, lease terms, useful lives of long-lived assets, share-based compensation and actuarial liabilities associated with certain benefit plans. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

 million and million at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. 
 
 If we transfer goods or services to a customer but do not have an unconditional right to payment, we record a contract asset. Contract assets typically arise from the uniform recognition of introductory promotional discounts over the contract period and accrued revenue for handset sales. Our contract assets were million and million as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. The current and long-term portions of our contract asset balances are included within other current assets and other assets, net, respectively, on our condensed consolidated balance sheets. 
 
 We record deferred revenue when we receive payment prior to transferring goods or services to a customer. We primarily defer revenue for (i) installation and other upfront services and (ii) other services that are invoiced prior to when services are provided. Our deferred revenue balances were million and million as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. The increase in deferred revenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 is primarily due to the net effect of (a) the impact of additions during the period and (b) the recognition of million of revenue that was included in our deferred revenue balance at December 31, 2023. The long-term portions of our deferred revenue balances are included within other long-term liabilities on our condensed consolidated balance sheets. 
 
 Contract Costs 
 
 Our aggregate assets associated with incremental costs to obtain and fulfill our contracts were million and million at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. The current and long-term portions of our assets related to contract costs are included within other current assets and other assets, net, respectively, on our condensed consolidated balance sheets. We amortized million and million during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, and million and million during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively, to operating costs and expenses related to these assets. 
 
 Unsatisfied Performance Obligations 
 
 A large portion of our revenue is derived from customers who are not subject to contracts. Revenue from customers who are subject to contracts is generally recognized over the term of such contracts, which is typically months for our residential service contracts, one to for our mobile service contracts and one to for our B2B service contracts.

 (the Formula E Acquisition ). The purchase consideration for these additional shares totaled million million at the transaction date) and is based upon an equity value of million million at the transaction date). We also acquired Warner Bros. Discovery s million million) shareholder loan to Formula E upon closing of the transaction. 
 
 We will begin consolidating Formula E s results from October 2, 2024. We will recognize goodwill for the excess of the sum of (i) the value of the consideration transferred, (ii) the value of the noncontrolling interest in Formula E and (iii) the acquisition date fair value of our previously-held equity interest in Formula E over the estimated fair value of the assets and liabilities of Formula E at the acquisition date.

 and of Wyre, respectively. In exchange for its ownership of Wyre, Telenet contributed net assets with a fair value of million million at the transaction date), together with annual payments to Fluvius of million million) over the next following the date of the transaction. Telenet and Liberty Global began consolidating Wyre s results upon the closing of the transaction. 
 
 With the closing of the Telenet Wyre Transaction, Telenet early terminated and effectively settled certain pre-existing contractual relationships with Fluvius, principally related to Telenet s leased network, and began consolidating certain infrastructure cable assets contributed by Fluvius to Wyre, as described above. Primarily due to Telenet s aforementioned pre-existing network leasing relationship with Fluvius, the Telenet Wyre Transaction did not have a significant impact on our operating income during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Accordingly, the pro forma effect of the Telenet Wyre Transaction is not presented herein. 
 
 In connection with the Telenet Wyre Transaction, we recognized a net gain of million during the nine months ended September 30, 2023, which represents the difference between the fair value and carrying amount of a pre-existing network leasing relationship between Telenet and Fluvius. No income taxes were required to be provided on this gain.

The U.K. JV Services provided by Liberty Global consist primarily of (i) technology and other services and (ii) capital-related expenditures for assets that will be used by, or will otherwise benefit, the VMO2 JV. Liberty Global charges both fixed and variable fees to the VMO2 JV for the U.K. JV Services provided pursuant to the U.K. JV Framework Agreement. We recorded revenue from the VMO2 JV of million and million during the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and million and million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, primarily related to (a) the U.K. JV Services and (b) beginning in 2024, the sale of customer premises equipment CPE to the VMO2 JV at a mark-up. At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, million and million, respectively, was due from the VMO2 JV related to the aforementioned transactions.

 (a) Amount represents an investment in a leveraged structured note issued by a third-party investment bank, which is accounted for at fair value. The return on the leveraged structured note is based on changes in the fair value of a proportionate amount of debt issued by various Liberty Global consolidated subsidiaries and affiliates (including the VMO2 JV and the VodafoneZiggo JV). The proportionate amount of debt associated with the return on the leveraged structured note may change from time to time as a result of open market purchases, privately negotiated transactions, tender offers, exchange offers, redemptions or prepayments, in each case, completed by Liberty Global consolidated subsidiaries and affiliates. While the structured note itself contains leverage, our at-risk investment is the estimated fair value as reported. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we invested an additional million and redeemed million of the leveraged structured note.

 Counterparty Credit Risk 
 
 We are exposed to the risk that the counterparties to the derivative instruments of our subsidiary borrowing groups will default on their obligations to us. We manage these credit risks through the evaluation and monitoring of the creditworthiness of, and concentration of risk with, the respective counterparties. In this regard, credit risk associated with our derivative instruments is spread across a relatively broad counterparty base of banks and financial institutions, however notwithstanding, given the size of our derivative portfolio, the default of certain counterparties could have a significant impact on our consolidated statements of operations. Collateral is generally not posted by either party under our derivative instruments. At September 30, 2024, our exposure to counterparty credit risk included derivative assets with an aggregate fair value of million.

 Interest Rate Caps, Floors and Collars 
 
 From time to time, we enter into interest rate cap, floor and collar agreements. Purchased interest rate caps and collars lock in a maximum interest rate if variable rates rise, but also allow our company to benefit, to a limited extent in the case of collars, from declines in market rates. Purchased interest rate floors protect us from interest rates falling below a certain level, generally to match a floating rate floor on a debt instrument. At September 30, 2024, we had no interest rate collar agreements, and the total U.S. dollar equivalents of the notional amounts of our purchased interest rate caps and floors were billion and billion, respectively.

On August 16, 2022, the Inflation Reduction Act was signed into law in the U.S. Although this legislation does not increase the U.S. corporate income tax rate, it includes, among other provisions, a corporate alternative minimum tax CAMT on adjusted financial statement income that is effective for tax years beginning after December 31, 2022. CAMT did not have an impact on our consolidated financial statements through September 30, 2024, although we will continue to monitor additional guidance as it is issued to assess the impact to our tax position. We will disregard our CAMT status when evaluating our deferred tax assets under the regular U.S. tax system. 
 
 In December 2021, the Organization for Economic Co-Operation and Development OECD )/G20 Inclusive Framework on Base Erosion and Profit Shifting BEPS released Model Global Anti-Base Erosion GLoBE rules under Pillar Two. These rules provide for the taxation of certain large multinational corporations at a minimum rate of 15.0 , calculated on a jurisdictional basis. Numerous countries in which we operate, including the U.K. and certain European Union E.U. member states, have enacted legislation to implement many aspects of the Pillar Two rules beginning on January 1, 2024, with certain remaining impacts to be effective from January 1, 2025. We do not currently anticipate that Pillar Two legislation will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements, but we will continue to monitor future legislation and any additional guidance that is issued. 
 
 As of September 30, 2024, our unrecognized tax benefits were million, of which million would have a favorable impact on our effective income tax rate if ultimately recognized, after considering amounts that we would expect to be offset by valuation allowances and other factors. During the next 12 months, it is reasonably possible that the resolution of ongoing tax controversies, as well as the expiration of statutes of limitation and other items, could result in reductions to our unrecognized tax benefits related to tax positions taken as of September 30, 2024. The amount of such reductions could range up to million. No assurance can be given as to the nature or impact of any changes in our unrecognized tax positions during the next 12 months. 
 
 We and our subsidiaries file consolidated and standalone income tax returns in various jurisdictions. In the normal course of business, our income tax filings are subject to review by various taxing authorities. In connection with such reviews, disputes could arise with the taxing authorities over the interpretation or application of certain income tax rules related to our business in that tax jurisdiction. Such disputes may result in future tax and interest and penalty assessments by these taxing authorities. The ultimate resolution of tax contingencies will take place upon the earlier of (i) the settlement date with the applicable taxing authorities in either cash or agreement of income tax positions or (ii) the date when the tax authorities are statutorily prohibited from adjusting the company s tax computations. 
 
 In general, tax returns filed by our company or our subsidiaries for years prior to 2016 are no longer subject to examination 
 by tax authorities. Certain of our subsidiaries are currently involved in income tax examinations in various jurisdictions in which we operate, including Ireland, Luxembourg, Switzerland and the U.S. While we do not expect adjustments from the foregoing examinations to have a material impact on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows, no assurance can be given that this will be the case given the amounts involved and the complex nature of the related issues. 
 
 On October 7, 2022, the U.S. Department of Justice filed a suit against Liberty Global, Inc. LGI ), a wholly-owned U.S. subsidiary of Liberty Global, in the U.S. District Court of Colorado for unpaid federal income taxes and penalties for the 2018 tax year of approximately million. This action by the U.S. Department of Justice is related to the November 2020 complaint filed by LGI in the U.S. District Court of Colorado seeking a refund of approximately million of taxes, penalties and interest associated with the application of certain temporary treasury regulations issued in June 2019. In October 2023, the U.S. District Court of Colorado entered judgement against LGI with respect to the refund claim and we appealed this decision to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals in December 2023. No amounts have been accrued by LGI with respect to this matter. We will vigorously defend this matter and continue to actively pursue our claim for refund.

As of September 30, 2024, the remaining number of our Class A and/or Class C common shares that we are authorized to repurchase during 2024 was million. Based on the average of the respective closing share prices as of September 30, 2024, this would equate to additional share repurchases during the remainder of 2024 of approximately million. However, the actual U.S. dollar amount of our share repurchases during the remainder of 2024 will be determined by the actual transaction date share prices during the year and could differ significantly from this amount. 
 
 Telenet Takeover Bid 
 
 On June 8, 2023, following approval by the Belgian Financial Services and Markets Authority, Liberty Global Broadband Holding B.V. LGBH ), an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of Liberty Global, launched a voluntary and conditional public takeover bid for all of the shares of Telenet that we did not already own or that were not held by Telenet (the Telenet Takeover Bid ). Following the conclusion of a simplified squeeze-out procedure, Telenet was delisted from Euronext Brussels at the close of trade on October 13, 2023. The shares of Telenet that were acquired as a result of the simplified squeeze-out procedure were settled on October 19, 2023 and, from that date, Telenet was owned by LGBH. 
 
 The Telenet Takeover Bid was funded through (i) available borrowings and (ii) the existing liquidity of Liberty Global. As of September 30, 2023, the consideration associated with the Telenet Takeover Bid, including certain fees and expenses, totaled million million at the applicable transaction dates), excluding million million at the applicable rate) associated with the shares subject to the squeeze-out procedure.

 Outstanding Exercisable _______________ 
 
 (a) Amounts represent the gross number of shares associated with option, SAR and PSAR awards issued to our current and former employees and our directors. Our company settles SARs and PSARs on a net basis when exercised by the award holder, whereby the number of shares issued represents the excess value of the award based on the market price of the respective Liberty Global shares at the time of exercise relative to the award s exercise price. In addition, the number of shares issued is further reduced by the amount of the employee s required income tax withholding. 
 
 (b) Amounts represent certain share-based awards that continue to be held by former employees of Liberty Global subsequent to certain split-off or disposal transactions. Although future exercises of these awards by former employees will not result in the recognition of share-based compensation expense, such exercises will increase the number of our outstanding common shares.

We reported net losses attributable to Liberty Global shareholders for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Therefore, the potentially dilutive effect at September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023 excludes million and million shares issuable pursuant to outstanding share-based incentive awards in the computation of diluted net loss attributable to Liberty Global shareholders per share, respectively, because their inclusion would have been anti-dilutive to the computation. 
 
 The calculation of diluted EPS excludes aggregate share-based incentive awards of million for the three months ended September 30, 2023 because their effect would have been anti-dilutive.

Programming commitments Network and connectivity commitments Other commitments Total 
 
 Purchase commitments include unconditional and legally binding obligations related to (i) certain service-related commitments, including software development, information technology, maintenance and call center services and (ii) the purchase of network and other equipment and CPE. 
 
 Programming commitments consist of obligations associated with certain of our programming, studio output and sports rights contracts that are enforceable and legally binding on us as we have agreed to pay minimum fees without regard to (i) the actual number of subscribers to the programming services, (ii) whether we terminate service to a portion of our subscribers or dispose of a portion of our distribution systems or (iii) whether we discontinue our premium sports services. Programming commitments do not include increases in future periods associated with contractual inflation or other price adjustments that are not fixed. Accordingly, the amounts reflected in the above table with respect to these contracts are significantly less than the amounts we expect to pay in these periods under these contracts. Historically, payments to programming vendors have represented a significant portion of our operating costs, and we expect this will continue to be the case in future periods. In this regard, our total programming and copyright costs aggregated million and million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. 
 
 Network and connectivity commitments include (i) certain equipment and service-related commitments at Telenet and (ii) certain network capacity arrangements at Sunrise.

associations of municipalities in Belgium, which we refer to as the pure intercommunales or the PICs , announced a non-binding agreement-in-principle to transfer the analog and digital television activities of the PICs, including all existing subscribers, to Telenet. Subsequently, Telenet and the PICs entered into a binding agreement (the 2008 PICs Agreement ), which closed effective October 1, 2008. Beginning in December 2007, Proximus NV/SA Proximus ), the incumbent telecommunications operator in Belgium, instituted several proceedings seeking to block implementation of these agreements. Proximus lodged summary proceedings with the President of the Court of First Instance of Antwerp to obtain a provisional injunction preventing the PICs from effecting the agreement-in-principle and initiated a civil procedure on the merits claiming the annulment of the agreement-in-principle. In March 2008, the President of the Court of First Instance of Antwerp ruled in favor of Proximus in the summary proceedings, which ruling was overturned by the Court of Appeal of Antwerp in June 2008. Proximus brought an appeal judgment before the Belgian Supreme Court, which confirmed the appeal judgment in September 2010. On April 6, 2009, the Court of First Instance of Antwerp ruled in favor of the PICs and Telenet in the civil procedure on the merits, dismissing Proximus request for the rescission of the agreement-in-principle and the 2008 PICs Agreement. On June 12, 2009, Proximus appealed this judgment to the Court of Appeal of Antwerp. In this appeal, Proximus also sought compensation for damages. While these proceedings were suspended indefinitely, other proceedings were initiated, which resulted in a ruling by the Belgian Council of State in May 2014 annulling (i) the decision of the PICs not to organize a public market consultation and (ii) the decision from the PICs board of directors to approve the 2008 PICs Agreement. In December 2015, Proximus resumed the civil proceedings pending with the Court of Appeal of Antwerp seeking to have the 2008 PICs Agreement annulled and claiming damages of billion billion). On December 18, 2017, the Court of Appeal of Antwerp rejected Proximus claim in its entirety. On June 28, 2019, Proximus brought this appeal judgment before the Belgian Supreme Court. On January 22, 2021, the Belgian Supreme Court partially annulled the judgment of the Court of Appeal of Antwerp. The case was referred to the Court of Appeal of Brussels and is currently pending with this Court which will need to make a new decision on the matter within the boundaries of the annulment by the Belgian Supreme Court. It is likely that it will take the Court of Appeal of Brussels several years to decide on the matter. 
 
 No assurance can be given as to the outcome of these or other proceedings. However, an unfavorable outcome of existing or future proceedings could potentially lead to the annulment of the 2008 PICs Agreement. We do not expect the ultimate resolution of this matter to have a material impact on our results of operations, cash flows or financial position. amounts have been accrued by us with respect to this matter as the likelihood of loss is not considered to be probable. 
 
 Telekom Deutschland Litigation. On December 28, 2012, Unitymedia filed a lawsuit against Telekom Deutschland GmbH Telekom Deutschland in which Unitymedia asserted that it pays excessive prices for the co-use of Telekom Deutschland s cable ducts in Unitymedia s footprint. The Federal Network Agency approved rates for the co-use of certain ducts of Telekom Deutschland in March 2011. Based in part on these approved rates, Unitymedia sought a reduction of the annual lease fees by approximately five-sixths. In addition, Unitymedia sought the return of similarly calculated overpayments from 2009 through

 of any amounts recovered, plus of the net present value of certain cost savings in future periods that are attributable to the favorable resolution of this matter, less of associated legal or other third-party fees paid post-completion of the sale of the Vodafone Disposal Group. Any amount we may recover related to this matter will not be reflected in our consolidated financial statements until such time as the final disposition of this matter has been reached. 
 
 Swisscom MVNO Matter. On December 8, 2017, of our subsidiaries, Sunrise GmbH, formerly known as UPC Schweiz GmbH, entered into a mobile virtual network operator MVNO agreement with Swisscom (Schweiz) AG Swisscom ), as subsequently amended (the Swisscom MVNO ), for the provision of mobile network services to certain of Sunrise GmbH s end customers. In January 2023, Swisscom filed a formal lawsuit against Sunrise GmbH, asserting that it is in breach of the Swisscom MVNO and claiming approximately CHF million million) in damages. In April 2024, we agreed with Swisscom to resolve the matter, the terms of which are not material to us and, as a result, the lawsuit against Sunrise GmbH has been withdrawn. 
 
 Other Contingency Matters. In connection with the dispositions of certain of our operations, we provided tax indemnities to the counterparties for certain tax liabilities that could arise from the period we owned the respective operations, the amounts of which could be significant, subject to certain thresholds. No amounts have been accrued by our company related to unasserted claims for indemnification, as the likelihood of any loss is not considered to be probable. Further, Liberty Global may be entitled to certain amounts that our disposed operations may recover from taxing authorities. Any such amounts will not be reflected in our consolidated financial statements until such time as the final disposition of such matters has been reached. 
 
 Other Regulatory Matters. Broadband internet, video distribution, fixed-line telephony, mobile and content businesses are regulated in each of the countries in which we or our affiliates operate. The scope of regulation varies from country to country, although in some significant respects regulation in European markets is harmonized under the regulatory structure of the E.U. Adverse regulatory developments could subject our businesses to a number of risks. Regulation, including conditions imposed on us by competition or other authorities as a requirement to close acquisitions or dispositions, could limit growth, revenue and the number and types of services offered and could lead to increased operating costs and property and equipment additions. Regulation may also restrict our operations and subject them to further competitive pressure, including pricing restrictions, interconnect and other access obligations, and restrictions or controls on content, including content provided by third parties. Failure to comply with current or future regulation could expose our businesses to various penalties. 
 
 In addition to the foregoing items, we have contingent liabilities related to matters arising in the ordinary course of business, including (i) legal proceedings, (ii) issues involving VAT and wage, property, withholding and other tax issues and (iii) disputes over interconnection, programming, copyright and channel carriage fees. While we generally expect that the amounts required to satisfy these contingencies will not materially differ from any estimated amounts we have accrued, no assurance can be given that the resolution of one or more of these contingencies will not result in a material impact on our results of operations, cash flows or financial position in any given period. Due, in general, to the complexity of the issues involved and, in certain cases, the lack of a clear basis for predicting outcomes, we cannot provide a meaningful range of potential losses or cash outflows that might result from any unfavorable outcomes.

Our businesses provide residential and B2B communications services in (i) Switzerland, which we refer to as Sunrise, and Slovakia through Sunrise Holding, (ii) Belgium and Luxembourg through Telenet and (iii) Ireland through VM Ireland. In addition, we own 50 noncontrolling interests in (a) the VMO2 JV, which provides residential and B2B communications services in the U.K., and (b) the VodafoneZiggo JV, which provides residential and B2B communications services in the Netherlands. We also own (1) a 50 noncontrolling voting interest in the AtlasEdge JV, which is a leading European Edge data center platform, and (2) a 25 noncontrolling interest in the nexfibre JV, which is constructing a new fiber network in the U.K. outside of the existing footprint of the VMO2 JV.

 In October 2023, we completed the Telenet Takeover Bid, pursuant to which we increased our ownership interest in Telenet to 100 .

 At September 30, 2024, we owned and operated networks that passed 8,546,000 homes and served 4,008,800 fixed-line customers and 5,932,500 mobile subscribers.

Competition and Other External Factors 
 
 We are experiencing competition in all of the markets in which we or our affiliates operate. This competition, together with macroeconomic and regulatory factors, has adversely impacted our revenue, number of customers and/or average monthly subscription revenue per fixed-line customer or mobile subscriber, as applicable ARPU ). For additional information regarding the revenue impact of changes in the fixed-line customers and ARPU of our consolidated reportable segments, see Discussion and Analysis of our Reportable Segments below . 
 
 We are subject to inflationary pressures with respect to labor, programming and other costs. While we attempt to increase our revenue to offset increases in costs, there is no assurance that we will be able to do so. Therefore, costs could rise faster than associated revenue, thereby resulting in a negative impact on our operating results, cash flows and liquidity. The economic environment in the respective countries in which we operate is a function of government, economic, fiscal and monetary policies and various other factors beyond our control that could lead to inflation. We are unable to predict the extent that price levels might be impacted in future periods by the current state of the economies in the countries in which we operate. 

Material Changes in Results of Operations 
 
 In the following discussion, we quantify the estimated impact of material acquisitions (the Acquisition Impact and dispositions on our operating results. The Acquisition Impact represents our estimate of the difference between the operating results of the periods under comparison that is attributable to an acquisition. In general, we base our estimate of the Acquisition Impact on an acquired entity s operating results during the first three to twelve months following the acquisition date, as adjusted to remove integration costs and any other material unusual or nonoperational items, such that changes from those operating results in subsequent periods are considered to be organic changes. Accordingly, in the following discussion, (i) organic variances attributed to an acquired entity during the first 12 months following the acquisition date represent differences between the Acquisition Impact and the actual results and (ii) the calculation of our organic change percentages includes the organic activity of an acquired entity relative to the Acquisition Impact of such entity. With respect to material dispositions, the organic changes that are discussed below reflect adjustments to exclude the historical prior-year results of any disposed entities to the extent that such entities are not included in the corresponding results for the current-year period. 
 
 Changes in foreign currency exchange rates have a significant impact on our reported operating results as all of our operating segments have functional currencies other than the U.S. dollar. Our primary exposure to foreign exchange FX risk during the three months ended September 30, 2024 was to the euro and Swiss franc, as 56.5 and 45.2 of our reported revenue during the period was derived from subsidiaries whose functional currencies are the euro and Swiss franc, respectively. In addition, our reported operating results are impacted by changes in the exchange rates for certain other local currencies in Europe. The portions of the changes in the various components of our results of operations that are attributable to changes in FX are highlighted under Discussion and Analysis of our Reportable Segments and Discussion and Analysis of our Consolidated Operating Results below. For information regarding our foreign currency risks and the applicable foreign currency exchange rates in effect for the periods covered by this Quarterly Report, see Part I, Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk Foreign Currency Risk below. 
 
 The amounts presented and discussed below represent 100 of each of our consolidated and nonconsolidated reportable segment s results of operations, despite only holding a 50 noncontrolling interest in both the VMO2 JV and the VodafoneZiggo JV. We account for our 50 interest in both the VMO2 JV and the VodafoneZiggo JV as an equity method investment and as such, our share of the operating results of the VMO2 JV and the VodafoneZiggo JV is included in share of results of affiliates, net, in our condensed consolidated statements of operations. The noncontrolling owners interests at Telenet and other less significant majority-owned subsidiaries are reflected in net earnings or loss attributable to noncontrolling interests in our condensed consolidated statements of operations.

Discussion and Analysis of our Reportable Segments 

General 
 
 Our Sunrise, Telenet and VM Ireland reportable segments derive their revenue primarily from residential and B2B communications services. Our Central and Other reportable segment primarily includes (i) revenue associated with services provided to the VMO2 JV, the VodafoneZiggo JV and various third parties related to service agreements, (ii) sales of CPE to the VMO2 JV and the VodafoneZiggo JV, (iii) certain centralized functions, including billing systems, network operations, technology, marketing, facilities, finance and other administrative functions, and (iv) our operations in Slovakia. For detailed information regarding the composition of our reportable segments and how we define and categorize our revenue components, see note 16 to our condensed consolidated financial statements. For information regarding the results of operations of the VMO2 JV and the VodafoneZiggo JV, refer to Discussion and Analysis of our Consolidated Operating Results Share of results of affiliates, net below. 
 
 The tables presented below in this section provide the details of the revenue and Adjusted EBITDA of our reportable segments for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the corresponding periods in 2023. These tables present (i) the amounts reported for the current and comparative periods, (ii) the reported U.S. dollar change and percentage change from period to period and (iii) with respect to our consolidated reportable segments, the organic U.S. dollar change and percentage change from period to period. For our organic comparisons, which exclude the impact of FX, we assume that exchange rates remained constant at the prior-period rate during all periods presented. We also provide a table showing the Adjusted EBITDA margins of our reportable segments for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 at the end of this section. 
 
 Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP measure, which we believe is a meaningful measure because it represents a transparent view of our recurring operating performance that is unaffected by our capital structure and allows management to readily view operating trends from a consolidated view. Investors should view consolidated Adjusted EBITDA as a supplement to, and not a substitute for, GAAP measures of performance included in our condensed consolidated statements of operations. 
 
 The following table provides a reconciliation of net earnings (loss) to Adjusted EBITDA:

Revenue of our Reportable Segments 
 
 General. While not specifically discussed in the below explanations of the changes in the revenue of our reportable segments, we are experiencing competition in all of our markets. This competition has an adverse impact on our ability to increase or maintain our total number of customers and/or our ARPU. 
 
 Variances in the subscription revenue that we receive from our customers are a function of (i) changes in the number of our fixed-line customers or mobile subscribers outstanding during the period and (ii) changes in ARPU. Changes in ARPU can be attributable to (a) changes in prices, (b) changes in bundling or promotional discounts, (c) changes in the tier of services selected, (d) variances in subscriber usage patterns and (e) the overall mix of fixed and mobile products within a segment during the period.

 (a) Residential fixed subscription revenue includes amounts received from subscribers for ongoing services and the recognition of deferred installation revenue over the associated contract period. Residential fixed non-subscription revenue includes, among other items, channel carriage fees, late fees and revenue from the sale of equipment. 
 
 (b) Residential subscription revenue from subscribers who purchase bundled services at a discounted rate is generally allocated proportionally to each service based on the standalone price for each individual service. As a result, changes in the standalone pricing of our fixed and mobile products or the composition of bundles can contribute to changes in our product revenue categories from period to period. 
 
 (c) Residential mobile subscription revenue includes amounts received from subscribers for ongoing services. Residential mobile non-subscription revenue includes, among other items, interconnect revenue and revenue from sales of mobile handsets and other devices. Residential mobile interconnect revenue was 28.3 million and 28.0 million during the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and 88.2 million and 88.5 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. 
 
 (d) B2B subscription revenue represents revenue from (i) services provided to SOHO subscribers and (ii) mobile services provided to medium and large enterprises. SOHO subscribers pay a premium price to receive expanded service levels along with broadband internet, video, fixed-line telephony or mobile services that are the same or similar to the mass marketed products offered to our residential subscribers. A portion of the change in our B2B subscription revenue is attributable to the conversion of certain residential subscribers to SOHO subscribers. B2B non-subscription revenue includes (a) revenue from business broadband internet, video, fixed-line telephony and data services offered to medium and large enterprises and, fixed-line and mobile services on a wholesale basis, to other operators and (b) revenue from long-term leases of portions of our network.

Depreciation and amortization expense 
 
 Our depreciation and amortization expense was 500.6 million and 1,512.7 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, and 584.0 million and 1,681.8 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively. Excluding the effects of FX, depreciation and amortization expense decreased 89.5 million or 15.3 and 182.7 million or 10.9 during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, as compared to the corresponding periods in 2023. These decreases are primarily due to the net effect of (i) decreases associated with certain assets becoming fully depreciated, primarily at Central and Other, Telenet and Sunrise, (ii) increases associated with property and equipment additions related to the installation of CPE, the expansion and upgrade of our networks and other capital initiatives, primarily at Telenet, Sunrise and VM Ireland, and (iii) increases associated with acquisitions, primarily related to the Telenet Wyre Transaction. 

Impairment, restructuring and other operating items, net 
 
 We recognized impairment, restructuring and other operating items, net, of 13.5 million and 51.7 million during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, and 13.7 million) and 6.6 million during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively. 
 
 The amounts for the 2024 periods include (i) restructuring costs of 5.4 million and 24.6 million, respectively, primarily at Central and Other and Telenet, and (ii) a provision for legal contingencies of 17.5 million at Central and Other during the first quarter of 2024. 
 
 The amounts for the 2023 periods include (i) direct acquisition and disposition costs of 4.2 million and 25.7 million, respectively, primarily at Telenet and Central and Other, (ii) restructuring costs of 3.3 million and 24.4 million, respectively, primarily at Sunrise and Telenet, (iii) a 21.3 million credit to abandoned lease expense at Sunrise during the second quarter of 2023 and (iv) a 19.2 million credit related to a settlement at Sunrise during the third quarter of 2023. 
 
 If, among other factors, (i) our equity values were to decline or (ii) the adverse impacts of economic, competitive, regulatory or other factors were to cause our results of operations or cash flows to be worse than anticipated, we could conclude in future periods that impairment charges are required in order to reduce the carrying values of our goodwill and, to a lesser extent, other long-lived assets. Any such impairment charges could be significant. 

Interest expense 
 
 We recognized interest expense of 251.2 million and 756.2 million during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, and 241.4 million and 656.0 million during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively. Excluding the effects of FX, interest expense increased 7.1 million or 2.9 and 97.0 million or 14.8 during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, as compared to the corresponding periods in 2023. These increases are primarily attributable to (i) higher average outstanding debt balances and (ii) for the nine-month period, a higher weighted average interest rate. For additional information regarding our outstanding indebtedness, see note 9 to our condensed consolidated financial statements. 
 
 It is possible that the interest rates on (i) any new borrowings could be higher than the current interest rates on our existing indebtedness and (ii) our variable-rate indebtedness could increase in future periods. As further discussed in note 6 to our condensed consolidated financial statements and under Part I, Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk below, we use derivative instruments to manage our interest rate risks.

 The changes in the VodafoneZiggo JV s revenue during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the corresponding periods in 2023, are primarily due to the net effect of (i) increases in residential mobile revenue, (ii) increases in B2B fixed revenue and (iii) decreases in residential fixed revenue. The changes in the VodafoneZiggo JV s Adjusted EBITDA during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the corresponding periods in 2023, are primarily due to the net effect of (a) the aforementioned changes in revenue, (b) increases in wage costs and (c) higher programming costs. In addition, the reported revenue and Adjusted EBITDA amounts are impacted by FX. 
 
 (b) Represents (i) our 50 share of the results of operations of the VMO2 JV and (ii) 100 of the share-based compensation expense associated with Liberty Global awards granted to VMO2 JV employees who were formerly employees of Liberty Global prior to the VMO2 JV formation, as these awards remain our responsibility.

 The changes in the VMO2 JV s revenue during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the corresponding periods in 2023, are primarily due to the net effect of (i) decreases in mobile revenue due to lower handset sales, (ii) increases in other revenue related to low-margin construction revenue from the nexfibre JV, (iii) increases in residential fixed revenue and (iv) a one-time increase in 2023 of 48 million in other revenue due to a change in the contract terms with a related-party supplier, with each revenue category as defined and reported by the VMO2 JV. The changes in the VMO2 JV s Adjusted EBITDA during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the corresponding periods in 2023, are primarily due to the net effect of (a) the benefit of approximately 18 million and 46 million during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, related to higher capitalized costs by the VMO2 JV due to a change in the terms of a related-party contract under which Liberty Global now sells CPE hardware and embedded essential software to the VMO2 JV and (b) the aforementioned one-time revenue increase in 2023. In addition, the reported revenue and Adjusted EBITDA amounts are impacted by FX. 

Gain on sale of All3Media 
 
 In connection with the sale of All3Media, we recognized a gain of 242.9 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. For additional information, see note 5 to our condensed consolidated financial statements. 

Gain associated with the Telenet Wyre Transaction 
 
 In connection with the Telenet Wyre Transaction, we recognized a net gain of 377.8 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. For additional information, see note 4 to our condensed consolidated financial statements. 

Other income, net 
 
 We recognized other income, net, of 63.9 million and 39.8 million during the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and 191.1 million and 159.5 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. These amounts include (i) interest and dividend income of 57.2 million and 36.5 million during the three-month periods, respectively, and 169.8 million and 140.7 million during the nine-month periods, respectively, and (ii) credits related to the non-service component of our net periodic pension costs of 7.2 million and 6.4 million during the three-month periods, respectively, and 21.5 million and 15.8 million during the nine-month periods, respectively. 

Income tax benefit (expense) 
 
 We recognized income tax benefit (expense) of 0.9 million) and 88.5 million) during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, and 1.7 million and 170.0 million) during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively. 
 
 The income tax expense during the three months ended September 30, 2024 differs from the expected income tax benefit of 352.6 million (based on the U.K. statutory income tax rate of 25.0 ), primarily due to the net negative impact of (i) non-deductible or non-taxable foreign currency exchange results and (ii) certain permanent differences between the financial and tax accounting treatment of items associated with investments in subsidiaries and affiliates. 
 
 73 

The income tax expense during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 differs from the expected income tax benefit of 130.1 million (based on the U.K. statutory income tax rate of 25.0 ), primarily due to the net negative impact of (i) certain permanent differences between the financial and tax accounting treatment of interest and other items, (ii) non-deductible or non-taxable foreign currency exchange results and (iii) certain permanent differences between the financial and tax accounting treatment of items associated with investments in subsidiaries and affiliates. 
 
 The income tax benefit during the three months ended September 30, 2023 differs from the expected income tax expense of 193.0 million (based on the U.K. blended income tax rate of 23.5 ), primarily due to the net positive impact of non-deductible or non-taxable foreign currency exchange results. 
 
 The income tax expense during the nine months ended September 30, 2023 differs from the expected income tax benefit of 54.5 million (based on the U.K. blended income tax rate of 23.5 ), primarily due to the net negative impact of (i) a net increase in valuation allowances and (ii) certain permanent differences between the financial and tax accounting treatment of interest and other items. The net negative impact of these items was partially offset by the net positive impact of non-deductible or non-taxable foreign currency exchange results. 
 
 For additional information concerning our income taxes, see note 11 to our condensed consolidated financial statements. 

Net earnings (loss) 
 
 During the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, we reported net earnings (loss) of 1,410.9 million) and 822.7 million, respectively, consisting of (i) operating income (loss) of 101.3 million and 27.4 million), respectively, (ii) net non-operating income (expense) of 1,511.3 million) and 848.4 million, respectively, and (iii) income tax benefit (expense) of 0.9 million) and 1.7 million, respectively. 
 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, we reported net loss of 608.7 million and 402.1 million, respectively, consisting of (i) operating income (loss) of 143.0 million and 39.2 million), respectively, (ii) net non-operating expense of 663.2 million and 192.9 million, respectively, and (iii) income tax expense of 88.5 million and 170.0 million, respectively. 
 
 Gains or losses associated with (i) changes in the fair values of derivative instruments, (ii) movements in foreign currency exchange rates and (iii) the disposition of assets and changes in ownership are subject to a high degree of volatility and, as such, any gains from these sources do not represent a reliable source of income. In the absence of significant gains in the future from these sources or from other non-operating items, our ability to achieve earnings is largely dependent on our ability to increase our aggregate operating income to a level that more than offsets the aggregate amount of our (a) interest expense, (b) other non-operating expenses and (c) income tax expense. 
 
 Due largely to the fact that we seek to maintain our debt at levels that provide for attractive equity returns, as discussed under Material Changes in Financial Condition Capitalization below, we expect we will continue to report significant levels of interest expense for the foreseeable future. For information concerning our expectations with respect to trends that may affect certain aspects of our operating results in future periods, see the discussion under Overview above. For information concerning the reasons for changes in specific line items in our condensed consolidated statements of operations, see Discussion and Analysis of our Reportable Segments and Discussion and Analysis of our Consolidated Operating Results above. 

Net earnings attributable to noncontrolling interests 
 
 Net earnings attributable to noncontrolling interests was 23.2 million and 163.5 million during the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and 47.3 million and 159.7 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, primarily attributable to certain noncontrolling interests at Telenet.

Material Changes in Financial Condition 

Sources and Uses of Cash 
 
 We are a holding company that is dependent on the capital resources of our subsidiaries to satisfy our liquidity requirements at the corporate level. Each of our significant operating subsidiaries is separately financed within one of our three subsidiary borrowing groups . These borrowing groups include the respective restricted parent and subsidiary entities within Sunrise Holding, Telenet and VM Ireland. Although our borrowing groups typically generate cash from operating activities, the terms of the instruments governing the indebtedness of these borrowing groups may restrict our ability to access the liquidity of these subsidiaries. In addition, our ability to access the liquidity of these and other subsidiaries may be limited by tax and legal considerations, the presence of noncontrolling interests and other factors. 
 
 Cash, cash equivalents and SMAs 
 
 The details of the U.S. dollar equivalent balances of our consolidated cash and cash equivalents at September 30, 2024 are set forth in the following table (in millions): 
 Cash and cash equivalents held by: Liberty Global and unrestricted subsidiaries: 
 Liberty Global (a) 
 8.2 Unrestricted subsidiaries (b) 1,253.6 Total Liberty Global and unrestricted subsidiaries

 (d) The total cash and cash equivalents balance includes 1,289.0 million or 54.7 and 1,034.3 million or 43.9 denominated in euros and U.S. dollars, respectively. 
 
 (e) The balance of our investments held under SMAs is held by unrestricted subsidiaries of Liberty Global and includes 1,067.8 million or 97.6 denominated in U.S. dollars. 
 For additional information regarding our cash and cash equivalents and investments held under SMAs, see the discussion under Part I, Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk Cash and Investments below. 
 
 Liquidity of Liberty Global and its unrestricted subsidiaries 
 
 The 8.2 million of cash held by Liberty Global and, subject to certain tax and legal considerations, the 1,253.6 million of aggregate cash and cash equivalents held by unrestricted subsidiaries, together with the 1,094.5 million of investments held under SMAs, represented available liquidity at the corporate level at September 30, 2024. Our remaining cash and cash equivalents of 1,094.6 million at September 30, 2024 were held by our borrowing groups, as set forth in the table above. As noted above, various factors may limit our ability to access the cash of our borrowing groups. For information regarding certain 
 75 

limitations imposed by our subsidiaries debt instruments at September 30, 2024, see note 9 to our condensed consolidated financial statements. 
 
 Our short-term sources of corporate liquidity include (i) cash and cash equivalents held by Liberty Global and, subject to certain tax and legal considerations, Liberty Global s unrestricted subsidiaries, (ii) investments held under SMAs, (iii) interest and dividend income received on our and, subject to certain tax and legal considerations, our unrestricted subsidiaries cash and cash equivalents and investments, including dividend distributions received from the VMO2 JV or the VodafoneZiggo JV, (iv) cash received with respect to transitional and other services provided to various third parties and (v) interest payments received with respect to the VodafoneZiggo JV Receivables. 
 
 From time to time, Liberty Global and its unrestricted subsidiaries may also receive (i) proceeds in the form of dividend distributions or loan repayments from Liberty Global s borrowing groups or affiliates (including amounts from the VMO2 JV or the VodafoneZiggo JV) upon (a) the completion of recapitalizations, refinancings, asset sales or similar transactions by these entities or (b) the accumulation of excess cash from operations or other means, (ii) proceeds upon the disposition of investments and other assets of Liberty Global and its unrestricted subsidiaries and (iii) proceeds in connection with the incurrence of debt by Liberty Global or its unrestricted subsidiaries or the issuance of equity securities by Liberty Global, including equity securities issued to satisfy subsidiary obligations. No assurance can be given that any external funding would be available to Liberty Global or its unrestricted subsidiaries on favorable terms, or at all. 
 
 At September 30, 2024, our consolidated cash and cash equivalents include 2,348.2 million held by entities that are domiciled outside of Bermuda. Based on our assessment of our ability to access the liquidity of our subsidiaries on a tax efficient basis and our expectations with respect to our corporate liquidity requirements, we do not anticipate that tax considerations will adversely impact our corporate liquidity over the next 12 months. Our ability to access the liquidity of our subsidiaries on a tax efficient basis is a consideration in assessing the extent of our share repurchase program. 
 
 In addition, the amount of cash we receive from our subsidiaries and affiliates to satisfy U.S. dollar-denominated liquidity requirements is impacted by fluctuations in exchange rates, particularly with regard to the translation of euros, British pound sterling and Swiss francs into U.S. dollars. In this regard, the strengthening (weakening) of the U.S. dollar against these currencies will result in decreases (increases) in the U.S. dollars received from the applicable subsidiaries and affiliates to fund the repurchase of our equity securities and other U.S. dollar-denominated liquidity requirements. 
 
 Our short- and long-term liquidity requirements include (i) corporate general and administrative expenses, (ii) interest payments on the Vodafone Collar Loan and (iii) principal payments on the Vodafone Collar Loan to the extent not settled through the delivery of the underlying shares. In addition, Liberty Global and its unrestricted subsidiaries may require cash in connection with (a) the repayment of third-party and intercompany debt, (b) the satisfaction of contingent liabilities, (c) acquisitions, (d) the repurchase of equity and debt securities, (e) other investment opportunities, (f) any funding requirements of our subsidiaries and affiliates or (g) income tax payments. For additional information regarding our intention to repay certain third-party debt in connection with the Spin-off, see note 9 to our condensed consolidated financial statements. 
 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the aggregate amount of our share repurchases, including direct acquisition costs, was 503.1 million. Under our current share repurchase program, we are authorized during 2024 to repurchase up to 10 of our total outstanding shares as of December 31, 2023. For additional information regarding our share repurchase programs, see note 12 to our condensed consolidated financial statements. 
 
 Liquidity of borrowing groups 
 
 The cash and cash equivalents of our borrowing groups are detailed in the table above. In addition to cash and cash equivalents, the primary sources of liquidity of our borrowing groups are cash provided by operations and borrowing availability under their respective debt instruments. For the details of the borrowing availability of our borrowing groups at September 30, 2024, see note 9 to our condensed consolidated financial statements. The aforementioned sources of liquidity may be supplemented in certain cases by contributions and/or loans from Liberty Global and its unrestricted subsidiaries. 
 
 The liquidity of our borrowing groups generally is used to fund (i) property and equipment additions, (ii) debt service requirements and (iii) income tax payments, as well as to settle certain obligations that are not included on our September 30, 2024 condensed consolidated balance sheet. In this regard, we have significant commitments related to (a) purchase obligations associated with CPE and certain service-related commitments, (b) programming, studio output and sports rights contracts and (c) certain operating costs associated with our networks. These obligations are expected to represent a significant liquidity 
 76 

requirement of our borrowing groups, a significant portion of which is due over the next 12 to 24 months. For additional information regarding our commitments, see note 15 to our condensed consolidated financial statements. 
 
 From time to time, our borrowing groups may also require liquidity in connection with (i) acquisitions and other investment opportunities, (ii) loans to Liberty Global or its unrestricted subsidiaries, (iii) capital distributions to Liberty Global and other equity owners or (iv) the satisfaction of contingent liabilities. No assurance can be given that any external funding would be available to our borrowing groups on favorable terms, or at all. 
 
 For additional information regarding our consolidated cash flows, see the discussion under Condensed Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows below. 

Capitalization 
 
 We seek to maintain our debt at levels that provide for attractive equity returns without assuming undue risk. In this regard, we generally seek to cause our operating subsidiaries to maintain their debt at levels that result in a consolidated debt balance (excluding the Vodafone Collar Loan and measured using subsidiary debt figures at swapped foreign currency exchange rates, consistent with the covenant calculation requirements of our subsidiary debt agreements) that is between four and five times our consolidated Adjusted EBITDA, although the timing of our acquisitions and financing transactions and the interplay of average and spot foreign currency rates may impact this ratio. Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP measure, which investors should view as a supplement to, and not a substitute for, GAAP measures of performance included in our condensed consolidated statements of operations. 
 
 Our ability to service or refinance our debt and to maintain compliance with the leverage covenants in the credit agreements and indentures of our borrowing groups is dependent primarily on our ability to maintain or increase the Adjusted EBITDA of our operating subsidiaries and to achieve adequate returns on our property and equipment additions and acquisitions. In addition, our ability to obtain additional debt financing is limited by the incurrence-based leverage covenants contained in the various debt instruments of our borrowing groups. For example, if the Adjusted EBITDA of one of our borrowing groups were to decline, our ability to obtain additional debt could be limited. Under our credit facilities and senior and senior secured notes there is no cross-default risk between subsidiary borrowing groups in the event that one or more of our borrowing groups were to experience significant declines in their Adjusted EBITDA to the extent they were no longer able to service their debt obligations. Any mandatory prepayment events or events of default that may occur would only impact the relevant borrowing group in which these events occur and do not allow for any recourse to other borrowing groups or Liberty Global Ltd. Our credit facilities and senior and senior secured notes require that certain members of the relevant borrowing group guarantee the payment of all sums payable thereunder and such group members are required to grant first-ranking security over their shares or, in certain borrowing groups, over substantially all of their assets to secure the payment of all sums payable thereunder. At September 30, 2024, each of our borrowing groups was in compliance with its debt covenants. In addition, we do not anticipate any instances of non-compliance with respect to the debt covenants of our borrowing groups that would have a material adverse impact on our liquidity during the next 12 months. 
 
 At September 30, 2024, the outstanding principal amount of our consolidated debt, together with our finance lease obligations, aggregated 16.0 billion, including 1.0 billion that is classified as current on our condensed consolidated balance sheet and 1.6 billion that is not due until 2030 or thereafter. All of our consolidated debt and finance lease obligations have been borrowed or incurred by our subsidiaries at September 30, 2024. 
 
 We believe we have sufficient resources to repay or refinance the current portion of our debt and finance lease obligations and to fund our foreseeable liquidity requirements during the next 12 months. However, as our maturing debt grows in later years, we anticipate we will seek to refinance or otherwise extend our debt maturities. No assurance can be given that we will be able to complete these refinancing transactions or otherwise extend our debt maturities. In this regard, it is not possible to predict how political and economic conditions, sovereign debt concerns or any adverse regulatory developments could impact the credit and equity markets we access and, accordingly, our future liquidity and financial position. Our ability to access debt financing on favorable terms, or at all, could be adversely impacted by (i) the financial failure of any of our counterparties, which could (a) reduce amounts available under committed credit facilities and (b) adversely impact our ability to access cash deposited with any failed financial institution, and (ii) tightening of the credit markets. In addition, any weakness in the equity markets could make it less attractive to use our shares to satisfy contingent or other obligations, and sustained or increased competition, particularly in combination with adverse economic or regulatory developments, could have an unfavorable impact on our cash flows and liquidity.

Condensed Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows 
 
 General. Our cash flows are subject to significant variations due to FX. 
 
 Summary. The condensed consolidated statements of cash flows for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 are summarized as follows: 
 Nine months ended September 30, 2024 2023 Change in millions Net cash provided by operating activities 1,241.3 1,326.7 (85.4) Net cash provided (used) by investing activities 334.9 (966.4) 1,301.3 Net cash used by financing activities (650.2) (343.1) (307.1) Effect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash 15.4 (1.1) 16.5 Net increase in cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash 941.4 16.1 925.3 
 
 Operating Activities. The decrease in net cash provided by operating activities is primarily attributable to the net effect of (i) a decrease in cash provided by our Adjusted EBITDA and related working capital items, (ii) a decrease in cash provided due to higher payments of interest, (iii) an increase in cash provided due to higher receipts of interest and (iv) an increase in cash provided due to higher net cash receipts related to derivative instruments. Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP measure, which investors should view as a supplement to, and not a substitute for, GAAP measures of performance included in our condensed consolidated statements of operations. 
 
 Investing Activities. The change in net cash provided (used) by investing activities is primarily attributable to the net effect of (i) an increase in cash of 1,579.7 million associated with (a) lower net cash paid for investments primarily related to our investment in Vodafone in 2023 and (b) higher net cash received from the sale of our investments held under SMAs, (ii) a decrease in cash of 815.2 million due to lower dividend distributions received from the VMO2 JV, (iii) an increase in cash of 411.7 million in connection with the sale of our investment in All3Media during the second quarter of 2024 and (iv) an increase in cash of 100.1 million associated with lower net cash paid for acquisitions. 
 
 The capital expenditures we report in our condensed consolidated statements of cash flows do not include amounts that are financed under capital-related vendor financing or finance lease arrangements. Instead, these amounts are reflected as non-cash additions to our property and equipment when the underlying assets are delivered and as repayments of debt when the principal is repaid. In this discussion, we refer to (i) our capital expenditures as reported in our condensed consolidated statements of cash flows, which exclude amounts financed under capital-related vendor financing or finance lease arrangements, and (ii) our total property and equipment additions, which include our capital expenditures on an accrual basis and amounts financed under capital-related vendor financing or finance lease arrangements. For further details regarding our property and equipment additions, see note 16 to our condensed consolidated financial statements. A reconciliation of our consolidated property and equipment additions to our consolidated capital expenditures, as reported in our condensed consolidated statements of cash flows, is set forth below: 
 Nine months ended September 30, 2024 2023 in millions Property and equipment additions 1,125.4 1,107.7 Assets acquired under capital-related vendor financing arrangements 
 (98.8) (129.9) Assets acquired under finance leases (0.6) (20.8) Changes in current liabilities related to capital expenditures 
 (38.8) 59.2 Capital expenditures, net 987.2 1,016.2 
 
 78 

The increase in our property and equipment additions during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the corresponding period in 2023, is due to (i) an increase due to FX and (ii) an increase in local currency expenditures of our subsidiaries due to the net effect of (a) an increase in new build and upgrade projects, (b) a decrease in expenditures to support new customer products and operational efficiency initiatives, (c) a decrease in expenditures for the purchase and installation of CPE and (d) an increase in baseline expenditures, including network improvements and expenditures for property and facilities and information technology systems. 
 
 Financing Activities. The increase in net cash used by financing activities is primarily attributable to the net effect of (i) an increase in cash used of 2,100.4 million due to higher net repayments of debt, including with respect to our 2023 borrowings related to (a) the Vodafone Collar Loan and (b) the Telenet Takeover Bid, (ii) a decrease in cash used of 872.9 million due to the acquisition of shares in connection with the Telenet Takeover Bid in 2023, (iii) a decrease in cash used of 621.2 million due to lower repurchases of Liberty Global common shares, (iv) a decrease in cash used of 155.7 million due to lower net repayments of vendor financing and (v) a decrease in cash used of 79.7 million due to higher net cash receipts related to derivatives. 

Adjusted Free Cash Flow 
 
 We define adjusted free cash flow as net cash provided by operating activities, plus operating-related vendor financed expenses (which represents an increase in the period to our actual cash available as a result of extending vendor payment terms beyond normal payment terms, which are typically 90 days or less, through non-cash financing activities), less (i) cash payments in the period for capital expenditures, (ii) principal payments on operating- and capital-related amounts financed by vendors and intermediaries (which represents a decrease in the period to our actual cash available as a result of paying amounts to vendors and intermediaries where we previously had extended vendor payments beyond the normal payment terms) and (iii) principal payments on finance leases (which represents a decrease in the period to our actual cash available), each as reported in our condensed consolidated statements of cash flows. Net cash provided by operating activities includes cash paid for third-party costs directly associated with successful and unsuccessful acquisitions and dispositions of 7.6 million and 23.8 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. 
 
 We believe our presentation of adjusted free cash flow, which is a non-GAAP measure, provides useful information to our investors because this measure can be used to gauge our ability to (i) service debt and (ii) fund new investment opportunities after consideration of all actual cash payments related to our working capital activities and expenses that are capital in nature whether paid inside normal vendor payment terms or paid later outside normal vendor payment terms (in which case we typically pay in less than 365 days). Adjusted free cash flow should not be understood to represent our ability to fund discretionary amounts, as we have various mandatory and contractual obligations, including debt repayments, that are not deducted to arrive at these amounts. Investors should view adjusted free cash flow as a supplement to, and not a substitute for, GAAP measures of liquidity included in our condensed consolidated statements of cash flows. Further, our adjusted free cash flow may differ from how other companies define and apply their definition of adjusted free cash flow. 
 
 The following table provides the details of our adjusted free cash flow: 
 Nine months ended September 30, 2024 2023 in millions Net cash provided by operating activities 1,241.3 1,326.7 Operating-related vendor financing additions (a) 579.4 444.5 Cash capital expenditures, net (987.2) (1,016.2) Principal payments on operating-related vendor financing (538.1) (470.9) Principal payments on capital-related vendor financing (122.8) (210.8) Principal payments on finance leases (8.4) (25.3) Adjusted free cash flow 164.2 48.0 
 _______________ 
 
 (a) For purposes of our condensed consolidated statements of cash flows, operating-related vendor financing additions represent operating-related expenses financed by an intermediary that are treated as constructive operating cash outflows and constructive financing cash inflows when the intermediary settles the liability with the vendor. When we pay the 
 79 

financing intermediary, we record financing cash outflows in our consolidated statements of cash flows. For purposes of our adjusted free cash flow definition, we (i) add in the constructive financing cash inflow when the intermediary settles the liability with the vendor as our actual net cash available at that time is not affected and (ii) subsequently deduct the related financing cash outflow when we actually pay the financing intermediary, reflecting the actual reduction to our cash available to service debt or fund new investment opportunities.

Item 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 

General 
 
 The capitalized terms used below have been defined in the notes to our condensed consolidated financial statements. In the following text, the terms we, our, our company and us may refer, as the context requires, to Liberty Global or collectively to Liberty Global and its subsidiaries. 
 
 We are exposed to market risk in the normal course of our business operations due to our investments in various foreign countries and ongoing investing and financing activities. Market risk refers to the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates and stock prices. The risk of loss can be assessed from the perspective of adverse changes in fair values, cash flows and future earnings. As further described below, we have established policies, procedures and processes governing our management of market risks and the use of derivative instruments to manage our exposure to such risks. 
 
 The information in this section should be read in conjunction with the more complete discussion that appears under Part II, Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk in our 2023 10-K. The following discussion updates selected numerical information to September 30, 2024. 
 
 Unless otherwise indicated, convenience translations into U.S. dollars are calculated as of September 30, 2024. 

Cash and Investments 
 
 We invest our cash in highly liquid instruments that meet high credit quality standards. We are exposed to exchange rate risk to the extent that the denominations of our cash and cash equivalent balances, revolving lines of credit and other short-term sources of liquidity do not correspond to the denominations of our and our subsidiaries short-term liquidity requirements. In order to mitigate this risk, we actively manage the denominations of our cash balances in light of our and our subsidiaries forecasted liquidity requirements. At September 30, 2024, 1,289.0 million or 54.7 and 1,034.3 million or 43.9 of our consolidated cash balance was denominated in euros and U.S. dollars, respectively, and 1,067.8 million or 97.6 of our consolidated balance of investments held under SMAs was denominated in U.S. dollars. 
 
 We are exposed to market price fluctuations related to our investment in Vodafone shares, which had an aggregate value of 1,342.5 million at September 30, 2024. Our exposure to market risk is limited for our Vodafone shares, all which are held through the Vodafone Collar. For information regarding the Vodafone Collar, Vodafone Collar Loan and our investment in Vodafone shares, see note 5 to our condensed consolidated financial statements. 

Foreign Currency Risk 
 
 We are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk with respect to our consolidated debt in situations where our debt is denominated in a currency other than the functional currency of the operations whose cash flows support our ability to repay or refinance such debt. For information regarding our use of derivative instruments to manage our foreign currency exchange rate risk, see note 6 to our condensed consolidated financial statements. 
 
 The relationships between the primary currencies of the countries in which we operate and the U.S. dollar, which is our reporting currency, are shown below, per one U.S. dollar: 
 September 30, 2024 December 31, 2023 Spot rates: Euro 0.8970 0.9038 Swiss franc 0.8445 0.8392 British pound sterling 0.7462 0.7835 Polish zloty 3.8403 3.9272

Three months ended September 30, Nine months ended September 30, 2024 2023 2024 2023 Average rates: Euro 0.9101 0.9192 0.9200 0.9232 Swiss franc 0.8657 0.8835 0.8815 0.9025 British pound sterling 0.7689 0.7900 0.7832 0.8039 Polish zloty 3.8977 4.1389 3.9609 4.2337 

Inflation and Foreign Investment Risk 
 
 We are subject to inflationary pressures with respect to labor, programming and other costs. While we attempt to increase our revenue to offset increases in costs, there is no assurance that we will be able to do so. Therefore, costs could rise faster than associated revenue, thereby resulting in a negative impact on our operating results, cash flows and liquidity. The economic environment in the respective countries in which we operate is a function of government, economic, fiscal and monetary policies and various other factors beyond our control that could lead to inflation. We are unable to predict the extent that price levels might be impacted in future periods by the current state of the economies in the countries in which we operate. 

Interest Rate Risks 
 
 We are exposed to changes in interest rates primarily as a result of our borrowing activities, which include fixed-rate and variable-rate borrowings by our borrowing groups. Our primary exposure to variable-rate debt is through the EURIBOR-indexed and Term SOFR-indexed debt of our borrowing groups and the variable-rate debt of certain of our other subsidiaries. 
 
 In general, we enter into derivative instruments to protect against increases in the interest rates on our variable-rate debt. Accordingly, we have entered into various derivative transactions to manage exposure to increases in interest rates. We use interest rate derivative contracts to exchange, at specified intervals, the difference between fixed and variable interest rates calculated by reference to an agreed upon notional principal amount. From time to time, we also use interest rate cap, floor and collar agreements and swaptions that lock in a maximum interest rate if variable rates rise, but also allow our company to benefit, to a limited extent in the case of collars, from declines in market rates. Under our current guidelines, we use various interest rate derivative instruments to mitigate interest rate risk. The final maturity dates of our various portfolios of interest rate derivative instruments might, in some instances, fall short of the respective maturities of the underlying variable-rate debt. In this regard, we use judgment to determine the appropriate composition and maturity dates of our portfolios of interest rate derivative instruments, taking into account the relative costs and benefits of different maturity profiles in light of current and expected future market conditions, liquidity issues and other factors. For additional information concerning the impacts of these interest rate derivative instruments, see note 6 to our condensed consolidated financial statements. 
 
 There have been significant changes in the benchmark interest rates used to set floating rates on our debt and derivative instruments. ICE Benchmark Administration (the entity that administers LIBOR) ceased to publish CHF and GBP LIBOR rates after December 31, 2021, and it ceased to publish USD LIBOR rates after June 30, 2023. The methodology for EURIBOR has been reformed and EURIBOR has been granted regulatory approval to continue to be used. 
 
 We have agreed amendments in respect of all of our debt and derivative instruments to replace the ceased rates. For USD, these reference the Secured Overnight Financing Rate administered by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York or Term SOFR administered by CME Group Benchmark Administration Limited. For CHF, these reference the Swiss Average Rate Overnight administered by the SIX Swiss Exchange. For GBP, these reference the Sterling Overnight Index Average administered by the Bank of England. 
 
 Weighted Average Variable Interest Rate. At September 30, 2024, the outstanding principal amount of our variable-rate indebtedness aggregated 10.4 billion, and the weighted average interest rate (including margin) on such variable-rate indebtedness was approximately 6.6 , excluding the effects of interest rate derivative contracts, deferred financing costs, original issue premiums or discounts and commitment fees, all of which affect our overall cost of borrowing. Assuming no change in the amount outstanding, and without giving effect to any interest rate derivative contracts, deferred financing costs, original issue premiums or discounts and commitment fees, a hypothetical 50 basis point (0.50 increase (decrease) in our weighted average variable interest rate would increase (decrease) our annual consolidated interest expense and cash outflows by 52.0 million. As discussed above and in note 6 to our condensed consolidated financial statements, we use interest rate 
 82 

derivative contracts to manage our exposure to increases in variable interest rates. In this regard, increases in the fair value of these contracts generally would be expected to offset most of the economic impact of increases in the variable interest rates applicable to our indebtedness to the extent and during the period that principal amounts are matched with interest rate derivative contracts. 

Sensitivity Information 
 
 Information concerning the sensitivity of the fair value of certain of our more significant derivative instruments to changes in market conditions is set forth below. The potential changes in fair value set forth below do not include any amounts associated with the remeasurement of the derivative asset or liability into the applicable functional currency. For additional information, see notes 6 and 7 to our condensed consolidated financial statements. 
 
 Sunrise Holding Cross-currency and Interest Rate Derivative Contracts 
 
 Holding all other factors constant, at September 30, 2024: 
 
 (i) an instantaneous increase (decrease) of 10 in the value of the Swiss franc relative to the U.S. dollar would have decreased (increased) the aggregate fair value of the Sunrise Holding cross-currency and interest rate derivative contracts by approximately 433 million 483 million); 
 
 (ii) an instantaneous increase (decrease) of 10 in the value of the Swiss franc relative to the euro would have decreased (increased) the aggregate fair value of the Sunrise Holding cross-currency and interest rate derivative contracts by approximately 252 million 281 million); and 
 
 (iii) an instantaneous increase (decrease) in the relevant base rate of 50 basis points (0.50 would have increased (decreased) the aggregate fair value of the Sunrise Holding cross-currency and interest rate derivative contracts by approximately 83 million 92 million). 
 
 Telenet Cross-currency and Interest Rate Derivative Contracts 
 
 Holding all other factors constant, at September 30, 2024: 
 
 (i) an instantaneous increase (decrease) of 10 in the value of the euro relative to the U.S. dollar would have decreased (increased) the aggregate fair value of the Telenet cross-currency and interest rate derivative contracts by approximately 300 million 335 million); and 
 
 (ii) an instantaneous increase (decrease) in the relevant base rate of 50 basis points (0.50 would have increased (decreased) the aggregate fair value of the Telenet cross-currency and interest rate derivative contracts by approximately 79 million 88 million). 
 
 Vodafone Collar 
 
 Holding all other factors constant, at September 30, 2024, (i) an instantaneous increase of 10 in the per share market price of Vodafone s ordinary shares would have decreased the fair value of the Vodafone Collar by approximately 74 million 82 million) and (ii) an instantaneous decrease of 10 in the per share market price of Vodafone s ordinary shares would have increased the fair value of the Vodafone Collar by approximately 78 million 87 million).

Item 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 
 
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 
 In accordance with Rule 13a-15 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act ), we carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of management, including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer (the Executives ), of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of September 30, 2024. In designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, the Executives recognize that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives, and management is necessarily required to apply judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and objectives. Based on that evaluation, the Executives concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures as of September 30, 2024 effectively provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission s rules and forms. 
 
 Changes in Internal Controls over Financial Reporting 
 
 There have been no changes in our internal controls over financial reporting identified in connection with the evaluation described above that occurred during the fiscal quarter covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal controls over financial reporting.

 (b) Under our current share repurchase program, we are authorized during 2024 to repurchase up to 10 of our total outstanding shares as of December 31, 2023. As of September 30, 2024, the remaining number of our Class A and/or Class C common shares that we are authorized to repurchase during 2024 was 11.3 million. Based on the average of the respective closing share prices as of September 30, 2024, this would equate to additional share repurchases during the remainder of 2024 of approximately 241.4 million. However, the actual U.S. dollar amount of our share repurchases during the remainder of 2024 will be determined by the actual transaction date share prices during the year and could differ significantly from this amount.
