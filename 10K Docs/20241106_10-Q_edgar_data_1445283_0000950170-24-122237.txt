CAUTIONARY STATEMENT 
 
 In February 2024, Kineta, Inc. (the Company initiated a process to explore a range of strategic alternatives to maximize shareholder value. Potential strategic alternatives that may be evaluated include sale of assets of the Company, a sale of the Company, licensing of assets, a merger, liquidation or other strategic action. There is no set timetable for this process and there can be no assurance that this process will result in the Company pursuing a transaction or that any transaction, if pursued, will be completed on attractive terms. Additionally, there can be no assurances that any particular course of action, business arrangement or transaction, or series of transactions, will be pursued, successfully consummated, or lead to increased stockholder value. If the strategic process is unsuccessful, the Company s Board of Directors (the Board may decide to pursue a liquidation or obtain relief under the US Bankruptcy Code. 
 
 Kineta, Inc. cautions that trading in the Company s securities is highly speculative and poses substantial risks. Trading prices for the Company s securities may bear little or no relationship to the actual value realized, if any, by holders of the Company s securities.

 shares of its common stock and received net proceeds of million. The second closing of the Private Placement for an aggregate purchase price of million was expected to occur on April 15, 2024, however, the investors failed to fulfill their contractual obligation to fund and the second closing did not occur. Going Concern and Capital Resources The Company has incurred recurring net losses and negative cash flows from operations since inception and, as of September 30, 2024, had an accumulated deficit of million . The net loss attributable to the Company was million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. As of September 30, 2024, the Company had unrestricted cash of million , and there is substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern. Based on Kineta s current operating plans, Kineta does not have sufficient cash and cash equivalents to fund its operating expenses and capital expenditures for at least the next 12 months from the filing date of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Kineta is exploring strategic alternatives that may include, but are not limited to, sale of assets of the Company, a sale of the Company, licensing of assets, a merger, liquidation or other strategic action. On July 3, 2024 (the Effective Date ), the Company entered into an exclusivity and right of first offer agreement (the TuHURA Agreement by and between the Company and TuHURA Biosciences, Inc., a Delaware corporation TuHURA ). Pursuant to the TuHURA Agreement, among other things, Kineta has granted TuHURA an exclusive right to acquire Kineta s worldwide patents, patent rights, patent applications, product and development program assets, technical and business information, and other rights and assets associated with and derived from its development program related to KVA12123, the Company s VISTA blocking immunotherapy, during the period commencing as of the Effective Date and continuing through the first to occur of (a) the execution of any Definitive Agreement (as defined in the TuHURA Agreement) with respect to a Potential Transaction (as defined in the TuHURA Agreement) by TuHURA or one or more of its affiliates and (b) 11:59 PM Eastern Time on October 1, 2024, subject to extension as noted in the following sentence (the Exclusivity Period ). In the event that the Parties are engaged in good faith discussions regarding a Potential Transaction on the date on which the Exclusivity Period (or any renewal thereof) is scheduled to expire and TuHURA has not yet closed the transactions contemplated by that previously announced agreement and plan of merger by and among TuHURA, Kintara Therapeutics, Inc. Kintara and Kayak Mergeco, Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of Kintara, then on such date, the Exclusivity Period shall automatically renew for an additional ten (10) day period (a Renewal Period (up to a total of two (2) renewal periods for an aggregate of twenty (20) days). In consideration for Kineta s compliance with its obligations set forth in the TuHURA Agreement, TuHURA paid to Kineta million (the Exclusivity Payment in July 2024. The Exclusivity Payment is included on the balance sheets. No later than two (2) business days after a Renewal Period has started (to be confirmed in writing by both Parties), TuHURA shall pay an additional as an additional Exclusivity Payment, in an amount not to exceed for the two (2) available Renewal Periods. The Exclusivity Payment will be credited against the initial cash

in Exclusivity Payments. Kineta may seek additional funds through equity or debt financings or through collaborations, licensing transactions or other sources that may be identified through the Company s strategic process. However, there can be no assurance that Kineta will be able to complete any such transactions on acceptable terms or otherwise. The failure to obtain sufficient funds on commercially acceptable terms when needed would have a material adverse effect on Kineta s business, results of operations, and financial condition. These factors raise substantial doubt about Kineta s ability to continue as a going concern. Kineta does not currently have any commitments for future funding or additional capital. As noted above, the investors failed to fulfill their contractual obligation to consummate the Private Placement. The Company is pursuing litigation or seeking other settlements against the investors for the failure to fund. Due to the lack of commitments for future funding or additional capital, Kineta has paused or significantly scaled back the development or commercialization of its future product candidates or other research and development initiatives. If Kineta is unable to complete a strategic transaction or raise additional capital in sufficient amounts, Kineta will not be able to continue its business and the Company may need to file for bankruptcy protection. Nasdaq Trading Suspension and Delisting As previously disclosed in a Current Report on Form 8-K filed on September 10, 2024, the Company received a determination letter (the Letter from the Nasdaq Listing Qualifications Staff (the Staff of The Nasdaq Stock Market LLC Nasdaq informing the Company that after reviewing the materials submitted by the Company, the Staff had determined to deny the Company s request for continued listing on The Nasdaq Capital Market due to the Company s lack of compliance with Nasdaq Listing Rules 5550(a)(2) and 5550(b)(1). In the Letter, the Staff also notified the Company that trading of its securities would be suspended and the securities would be removed from listing and registration on Nasdaq unless the Company requested an appeal of Nasdaq s determination by September 17, 2024. The Company did not appeal the determination, and therefore, the Company s common stock was suspended from trading on The Nasdaq Capital Market at the opening of business on September 19, 2024. Since September 19, 2024, the Company s common stock has been trading on the OTC Pink Market under the symbol KANT. Effective as of October 25, 2024, the Company s common stock was delisted from Nasdaq. Geopolitical Developments Geopolitical developments, such as the current conflict in Ukraine and the conflict in Israel and the Gaza Strip or deterioration in the bilateral relationship between the United States and China, may impact government spending, international trade and market stability, and cause weaker macro-economic conditions. The impact of these developments, including any resulting sanctions, export controls or other restrictive actions that may be imposed against governmental or other entities in, for example, Russia, have in the past contributed and may in the future contribute to disruption, instability and volatility in the global markets, which in turn could adversely impact the Company s operations and weaken the Company s financial results. Certain political developments may also lead to uncertainty to regulations and rules that may materially affect the Company s business.

million payment. This collaboration focused on the discovery and development of novel candidates for the treatment of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis ALS ). Merck will continue to advance the research program for the ALS pipeline, one of the two pipeline programs licensed under the Merck Neuromuscular License Agreement. As a result, the Company is eligible to receive up to an additional million in development milestones, sales milestones and royalties on net sales. Following this milestone, Merck will assume sole responsibility for all future development and commercialization for the ALS program. The Company recognized licensing revenues of for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024. The Company recognized one-time licensing revenue of million for the three months ended June 30, 2023. Collaboration Revenues In connection with the Merger, the Company became the successor in interest to an exclusive license and research collaboration agreement (the Merck Neuromuscular License Agreement with Merck to support research, development and commercialization of products for treatment of neuromuscular diseases, including amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. The Company recognizes revenue using the cost-to-cost method, which it believes best depicts the transfer of control to the customer. Under the cost-to-cost method, the extent of progress towards completion is measured based on the ratio of actual costs incurred to the total estimated costs expected upon satisfying the identified performance obligation. Under this method, revenue is recognized as a percentage of actual cost incurred to the estimated costs to complete. The Company recognized collaboration revenues of for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024. The Company recognized collaboration revenues of for the three months ended September 30, 2023 and for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. As of June 30, 2023, the Company completed its project services under the Merck Neuromuscular License Agreement. 

for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, which is recorded in other income (expense) in the Statement of Operations. The fair value as of September 30, 2023 was determined using a Monte Carlo simulation based on the contractual funding date of July 25, 2023, minimum contractual purchase price of and historical stock prices. The significant unobservable inputs used in the fair value measurement as of September 30, 2023 were as follows: volatility of , risk-free interest rate of and funding probability of , which resulted in a loss in fair value of million for the three months ended September 30, 2023 and a loss of million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, which is recorded in other income (expense) in the Statement of Operations. The fair value measurement as of September 30, 2023 was approximately million .

The 2020 notes were valued using a discounted cash flow model based on the contractual payment dates, a discount rate and the contractual maturity date.

The Company determined that its obligation to issue additional shares of its common stock in the second closing at a premium to the VWAP was a freestanding financial instrument and a future right, which is subject to fair value. Accordingly, at inception the future right was recorded as an other asset in the Company s consolidated balance sheet at its fair value equal to 10 of the second closing amount, or million. The remaining proceeds from the first closing were allocated to the shares of common stock issued in the first closing and to the warrants as such instruments are equity-classified. The future right was subject to remeasurement at each reporting date and the Company used the Monte Carlo simulation method to determine fair value of approximately million as of December 31, 2023 and as of September 30, 2024 as at that time, the Company did not expect the second closing to occur. The Company incurred insignificant issuance costs related to the Private Placement.

It em 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. 
 
 The following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements and related notes appearing elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Some of the information contained in this discussion and analysis or set forth elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, including information with respect to our plans and strategy for our business, includes forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. As a result of many factors, including those factors set forth in the Risk Factors section of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, our actual results could differ materially from the results described in, or implied by, the forward-looking statements contained in the following discussion and analysis. 
 Overview 
 On February 29, 2024, we announced that we had completed a review of our business, including the status of our programs, resources and 
 capabilities. Following this review, we implemented a significant corporate restructuring to substantially reduce expenses and preserve cash. The restructuring included a reduction in our workforce by approximately 64 and the termination of enrollment of new patients in our ongoing VISTA-101 Phase 1/2 clinical trial evaluating KVA12123 in patients with advanced solid tumors, which has resumed enrollment effective as of August 19, 2024. Patients currently enrolled in the trial will be permitted to continue to participate. We have made this decision, in part, because certain investors have indicated they will not be able to fulfill their contractual obligation to consummate the Private Placement (as defined below). 
 
 Due to the fact that we are unable to consummate the Private Placement, management and the Board has determined that it was in the best interests of the stockholders to seek a strategic alternative so that we could continue to operate. If the strategic process is unsuccessful, the Board may decide to pursue a liquidation or obtain relief under the US Bankruptcy Code. 
 
 On July 3, 2024, we announced that we entered into an exclusivity and right of first offer agreement (the TuHURA Agreement by and between us and TuHURA Biosciences, Inc., a Delaware corporation TuHURA ). 
 
 Pursuant to the TuHURA Agreement, among other things, we have granted TuHURA an exclusive right to acquire our worldwide patents, patent rights, patent applications, product and development program assets, technical and business information, and other rights and assets associated with and derived from our development program related to KVA12123, our VISTA blocking immunotherapy, during the period commencing as of the Effective Date and continuing through the first to occur of (a) the execution of any Definitive Agreement (as defined in the TuHURA Agreement) with respect to a Potential Transaction (as defined in the TuHURA Agreement) by TuHURA or one or more of its affiliates and (b) 11:59 PM Eastern Time on October 1, 2024, subject to extension as noted in the following sentence (the Exclusivity Period ). In the event that the Parties are engaged in good faith discussions regarding a Potential Transaction on the date on which the Exclusivity Period (or any renewal thereof) is scheduled to expire and TuHURA has not yet closed the transactions contemplated by that previously announced agreement and plan of merger by and among TuHURA, Kintara Therapeutics, Inc. Kintara and Kayak Mergeco, Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of Kintara, then on such date, the Exclusivity Period shall automatically renew for an additional ten (10) day period (a Renewal Period (up to a total of two (2) renewal periods for an aggregate of twenty (20) days). 
 
 In consideration for our compliance with our obligations set forth in the TuHURA Agreement, TuHURA paid to us 5.0 million (the Exclusivity Payment ), of which 2.5 million was paid on July 3, 2024 and the remaining 2.5 million was paid on July 15, 2024. No later than two (2) business days after a Renewal Period has started (to be confirmed in writing by both Parties), TuHURA shall pay an additional 150,000 as an additional Exclusivity Payment, in an amount not to exceed 300,000 for the two (2) available Renewal Periods. The Exclusivity Payment will be credited against the initial cash consideration that may be payable to Kineta pursuant to any Definitive Agreement (if any) between Kineta and TuHURA and/or its affiliates with respect to a Potential Transaction. 
 
 The Company cautions that trading in the Company s securities is highly speculative and poses substantial risks. Trading prices for the Company s securities may bear little or no relationship to the actual value realized, if any, by holders of the Company s securities. In the event of liquidation, bankruptcy or other wind-down event, holders of our securities will likely suffer a total loss of their investment. Accordingly, the Company urges extreme caution with respect to existing and future investments in its securities. 
 
 We are a clinical-stage biotechnology company with a mission to develop next-generation immunotherapies that transform patients lives. We have leveraged our expertise in innate immunity and are focused on discovering and developing potentially differentiated immunotherapies that address the mechanisms of cancer immune resistance: 
 Immunosuppression; 

Exhausted T cells; and 

Poor tumor immunogenicity 

Our pipeline of assets and research interests includes (i) KVA12123, a monoclonal antibody mAb immunotherapy targeting VISTA (V-domain Ig suppressor of T cell activation) and (ii) an anti-CD27 agonist mAb immunotherapy. These immunotherapies have the potential to address disease areas with unmet medical needs and significant commercial potential. 
 KVA12123 is a VISTA blocking immunotherapy in development as an intravenous infusion dosed every two weeks. We dosed the first patient in a Phase 1/2 clinical trial of KVA12123 in the United States in April 2023. The ongoing Phase 1/2 clinical study is designed to evaluate KVA12123 as a monotherapy and in combination with the immune checkpoint inhibitor pembrolizumab in patients with advanced solid tumors. Initial monotherapy 
 21 

safety, pharmacokinetic and biomarker data were presented at the Society for Immunotherapy of Cancer s (SITC) annual meeting in November 2023. KVA12123 was designed to be a differentiated VISTA blocking immunotherapy to address the problem of immunosuppression in the TME. It is a fully human engineered IgG1 monoclonal antibody that binds to VISTA through a unique epitope and across neutral and acidic pHs. KVA12123 may be an effective immunotherapy for many types of cancer, including non-small cell lung cancer NSCLC ), colorectal cancer CRC ), ovarian cancer OC ), renal cell carcinoma RCC and head and neck squamous cell carcinoma HNSCC ). These indications represent a significant unmet medical need with a large worldwide commercial opportunity for KVA12123. 
 
 We are also developing an anti-CD27 agonist mAb immunotherapy to address the problem of exhausted T cells. The nominated lead candidate is a fully human mAb that demonstrates nanomolar nM binding affinity to CD27 in humans. In preclinical studies, our lead anti-CD27 candidate demonstrated antitumor efficacy as a single agent and in combination with other immunotherapies in multiple solid and hematological preclinical tumor models. CD27 is a clinically validated target that may be an effective immunotherapy for advanced solid tumors including RCC, CRC and OC. We continue to conduct preclinical studies to optimize its lead anti-CD27 agonist mAb clinical candidate and to evaluate it in combination with other checkpoint inhibitors. 
 
 According to Market Data Forecast, the immuno-oncology market generated sales of approximately 111 billion in 2023 and is forecast to reach 201 billion in 2028. If we successfully complete the clinical trial program for KVA12123 and if we subsequently obtain regulatory approval for KVA12123, we will focus on initial target indications in NSCLC, CRC and OC. Initially, the clinical development of KVA12123 will be as a second-line therapy in these indications. These three cancer therapy segments represent a forecasted 48 billion market opportunity in 2027 according to GlobalData. 
 
 We are a leader in the field of innate immunity and are focused on developing potentially differentiated immunotherapies. With KVA12123 in clinical development and the lead anti-CD27 agonist mAb in preclinical development, we believe we are positioned to achieve multiple value-driving catalysts. We have assembled an experienced management team, a seasoned research and clinical team, an immuno-oncology focused scientific advisory board, and a leading intellectual property position to advance our pipeline of potential novel immunotherapies for cancer patients. 
 Since our inception in 2007, we have devoted substantially all of our resources to raising capital, licensing certain technology and intellectual property rights, identifying and developing potential product candidates, conducting research and development activities, including preclinical studies and clinical trials, organizing and staffing operations and providing general and administrative support for these operations. 
 We have no products approved for commercial sale and have not generated any revenue from product sales. To date, revenue has been generated from the out-licensing of certain rights to third parties, providing research services under licensing and collaboration agreements as well as revenue from government grants. 
 We have never been profitable and have incurred operating losses in each period since inception. Our net losses were 14.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 11.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. As of September 30, 2024, we had an accumulated deficit of 180.4 million. 
 We expect to incur significant expenses and continued operating losses for at least the next several years as we initiate and continue the clinical development of, and seek regulatory approval for, our product candidates and add personnel necessary to advance our pipeline of clinical-stage product candidates. In addition, operating as a publicly-traded company will involve the hiring of additional financial and other personnel, and the incurrence of substantial other costs associated with operating as a public company. We expect that our operating losses will fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter and year to year due to timing of clinical development programs and efforts to achieve regulatory approval. 
 From inception to September 30, 2024, we have raised cash from sales and issuances of common stock and borrowings under notes payable. As of September 30, 2024, we had cash of 1.9 million, and there is substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. For more information, see the risk factor in Item 1A. of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q entitled, Kineta identified conditions and events that raise substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern, Kineta needs substantial additional funding, and if Kineta is unable to raise capital when needed or on favorable terms, its business, financial condition, and results of operation could be materially and adversely affected . 
 Private Placement 
 In connection and concurrently with the execution of the Merger Agreement (as defined above), we entered into a financing agreement, dated as of June 5, 2022, as amended on October 24, 2022, December 5, 2022, March 29, 2023, May 1, 2023, July 21, 2023 and October 13, 2023 (such financing agreement, as amended, the Securities Purchase Agreement with certain investors to sell shares of our common stock to such investors in a private placement (the Private Placement ). We and the investors entered into an amendment to the Securities Purchase Agreement on October 13, 2023 to, among other things, extend the date of the second closing from October 31, 2023 to April 15, 2024. 
 The first closing of the Private Placement occurred on December 16, 2022 and we issued 649,346 shares of our common stock and received net proceeds of 7.4 million. The second closing of the Private Placement for an aggregate purchase price of 22.5 million was expected to occur on April 15, 2024, however, the investors failed to fulfill their contractual obligation to fund and the second closing did not occur. We have reached a settlement with one investor and have initiated litigation against the other investors which failed to fund their obligations. 
 Geopolitical Developments 
 22 

Geopolitical developments, such as the Russian invasion of Ukraine, the conflict in Israel and the Gaza Strip or deterioration in the bilateral relationship between the United States and China, may impact government spending, international trade and market stability, and cause weaker macro-economic conditions. The impact of these developments, including any resulting sanctions, export controls or other restrictive actions that may be imposed against governmental or other entities in, for example, Russia, have in the past contributed and may in the future contribute to disruption, instability and volatility in the global markets, which in turn could adversely impact our operations and weaken our financial results. Certain political developments may also lead to uncertainty to regulations and rules that may materially affect our business. 
 
 Nasdaq Suspension and Delisting 
 
 As previously disclosed in a Current Report on Form 8-K filed on September 10, 2024, the Company received a determination letter (the Letter from the Nasdaq Listing Qualifications Staff (the Staff of The Nasdaq Stock Market LLC Nasdaq informing the Company that after reviewing the materials submitted by the Company, the Staff had determined to deny the Company s request for continued listing on The Nasdaq Capital Market due to the Company s lack of compliance with Nasdaq Listing Rules 5550(a)(2) and 5550(b)(1). In the Letter, the Staff also notified the Company that trading of its securities would be suspended and the securities would be removed from listing and registration on Nasdaq unless the Company requested an appeal of Nasdaq s determination by September 17, 2024. The Company did not appeal the determination, and therefore, the Company s common stock was suspended from trading on The Nasdaq Capital Market at the opening of business on September 19, 2024. Since September 19, 2024, the Company s common stock has been trading on the OTC Pink Market under the symbol KANT. Effective as of October 25, 2024, the Company s common stock was delisted from Nasdaq. 
 Financial Operations Overview 
 Revenues 
 To date, we have not generated any revenue from product sales and do not expect to generate any revenue from product sales in the near future. Our revenues have been primarily derived from our collaboration, research and license agreements as well as grants awarded by government agencies. 
 We have completed research and development services under the grant agreements and do not expect to recognize any revenue during 2024. 
 Operating Expenses 
 Research and Development Expenses 
 Research and development expenses represent costs incurred in connection with the discovery, research, preclinical and clinical development, and manufacture of our product candidates. We recognize all research and development costs as they are incurred. Research and development expenses consist primarily of the following: 
 salaries, bonuses, benefits, stock-based compensation, research and consulting arrangements and other related costs for individuals involved in research and development activities; 

external research and development expenses incurred under agreements with contract research organizations, investigative sites and other scientific development services; 

costs incurred under agreements with contracted research and manufacturing organizations for developing and manufacturing materials for preclinical studies, clinical trials and laboratory supplies; 

licensing agreements and associated costs; 

costs related to compliance with regulatory requirements; 

facilities and other allocated expenses for rent and insurance; and 

other expenses incurred to advance research and development activities including manufacturing costs associated with production, scale up, testing and optimization of methods associated with the production of materials. 

Subject to receiving adequate funding, we expect our research and development expenses to increase in the future as we advance our product candidates into and through clinical trials and pursue regulatory approvals, which will require a significant investment in costs of clinical trials, regulatory support and contract manufacturing. In addition, we continue to evaluate opportunities to acquire or in-license other product candidates and technologies, which may result in higher research and development expenses due to license fee and/or milestone payments, as well as added clinical development costs. 
 As we are working on multiple research and development programs at any one time, we track our external expenses by the stage of program, clinical or preclinical. However, our internal expenses, including unallocated costs, personnel costs and infrastructure costs, are not directly related to any one program and are deployed across multiple programs. As such, we do not track internal expenses on a specific program basis. 
 The process of conducting clinical trials necessary to obtain regulatory approval is costly and time consuming. We may never succeed in timely developing and achieving regulatory approval for our product candidates. The probability of success of our product candidates may be affected by numerous factors, including clinical data, competition, manufacturing capability and commercial viability. As a result, we are unable to determine the duration and completion costs of our development projects or when and to what extent we will generate revenue from the commercialization and sale 
 23 

of any of our future product candidates. 
 General and Administrative Expenses 
 General and administrative expenses consist primarily of employee-related expenses, including salaries, benefits and stock-based compensation for personnel in executive, finance and accounting, and other administrative functions, as well as fees paid for legal, accounting and tax services, consulting fees and facilities costs not otherwise included in research and development expenses. Legal costs include general corporate legal fees and patent costs. We also incur expenses to operate as a public company, including expenses related to compliance with the rules and regulations of the SEC and the OTC Market Group, Inc., additional insurance, investor relations and other administrative expenses and professional services. Subject to receiving adequate funding, we expect our general and administrative expenses to be lower in 2024 as a result of the corporate restructuring announced in February 2024. 
 Other (Expense) Income 
 Interest Income 
 Interest income consists of interest earned on short-term money market accounts. 
 Interest Expense 
 Interest expense consists of interest charged on outstanding invoices and outstanding borrowings under several notes payable agreements. 
 Change in Fair Value Measurement of Rights from Private Placement 
 Change in fair value of other asset relates to the remeasurement of the rights from Private Placement that we determined was a derivative, which required the asset to be accounted for at fair value. Until settlement, the rights from Private Placement is remeasured at fair value at each reporting period with the changes in fair value recorded in the statement of operations. As of September 30, 2024, the rights from Private Placement was deemed to have no value as the second closing of the Private Placement was not expected to occur, and therefore the rights from Private Placement was written off and recorded in the statement of operations. 
 
 Change in Fair Value Measurement of Notes Payable 
 Change in fair value of notes payable relates to the remeasurement of the notes payable that we elected to account for under the fair value option. Until settlement, these notes payable are remeasured at fair value at each reporting period with the changes in fair value recorded in the statement of operations. 
 Other (Expense) Income, Net 
 Other (expense) income, net consists of interest income and other items that are of a non-recurring nature and primarily relate to items that are immaterial. 
 Net (Loss) Income Attributable to Noncontrolling Interest 
 Net (loss) income attributable to noncontrolling interest reflects investors share of net (loss) income in our majority owned subsidiary.

Revenues 
 
 Licensing revenues were zero for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024. Licensing revenues were zero for the three months ended September 30, 2023 and 5.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The licensing revenues in 2023 were due to the achievement of a development milestone pursuant to the Merck Neuromuscular License Agreement. 
 
 Collaboration revenues were zero for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024. Collaboration revenues were zero for the three months ended September 30, 2023 and 442,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 as a result of research services provided in 2023 under the Merck Neuromuscular License Agreement pursuant to which the Company became a successor in interest in connection with the Merger. Upon completion of the Merger, we had 442,000 in deferred revenue under the Merck Neuromuscular License Agreement. As of December 31, 2023, we have completed the project services and had zero in deferred revenue under the Merck Neuromuscular License Agreement. We do not expect to earn any revenue from this license in 2024.

Research and development expenses were 0.9 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 1.9 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023 and decreased by 1.0 million, or 53 . The decrease in direct external program expenses of 0.6 million was primarily due to lower activities for KVA12123, our lead product candidate, as we had curtailed the clinical trial and suspended patient enrollment in the clinical trial from March to August 2024 due to failure to receive funding in April 2024 as expected. The decrease in our internal and unallocated research and development expenses of 365,000 was primarily due to lower personnel-related costs due to lower headcount and lower facilities allocations expense as we transitioned to clinical trials in 2023 and ceased using our laboratory space. 
 
 Research and development expenses were 4.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 7.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 and decreased by 2.8 million, or 38 . The decrease in direct external program expenses of 1.6 million was primarily due to lower activities for KVA12123, our lead product candidate, and ALS program expenses incurred to complete project services in 2023 under the Merck Neuromuscular License Agreement, partially offset by higher costs for CD27 due to licensing costs. The decrease in our internal and unallocated research and development expenses of 1.2 million was primarily due to lower facilities allocations expense as we transitioned to clinical trials in 2023 and ceased using our laboratory space and lower personnel-related costs due to lower headcount. Subject to receiving adequate funding, we expect our direct external program expenses to increase for the remainder of 2024 as we enroll additional patients in our clinical trials of KVA12123. 
 General and Administrative Expenses 
 General and administrative expenses were 1.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023 and decreased by 0.9 million, or 44 . This decrease was primarily due to a decrease in personnel costs of 694,000 and other administrative expenses of 226,000. Personnel costs decreased primarily due to lower salaries and benefits of 473,000 and lower stock-based compensation of 221,000 due to lower headcount in 2024 as compared to 2023. 
 General and administrative expenses were 6.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 9.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 and decreased by 3.0 million, or 32 . This decrease was primarily due to a decrease in personnel costs of 3.0 million. Personnel costs decreased primarily due to lower stock-based compensation of 2.0 million as the result of stock-compensation expense related to RSUs with performance conditions for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 and lower salaries and benefits of 974,000 due to lower headcount in 2024 as compared to 2023. We expect our general and administrative expenses to continue to be lower than 2023 as the result of lower headcount as compared to 2023 and other cost-reduction measures implemented to preserve cash. 
 
 Other Income and expense, net 
 Interest Income 
 Interest income was 33,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 104,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2023 and decreased by 71,000. Interest income was 97,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 225,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 and decreased by 128,000. Interest income decreased due to lower balances in interest-bearing accounts during 2024. 
 
 Interest Expense 
 Interest expense was a credit of 242,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 21,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2023 and decreased by 263,000. Interest expense was a credit of 168,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 65,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 and decreased by 233,000. Interest expense decreased primarily due to interest on outstanding vendor invoices not required to be paid that was previously accrued. 
 Change in Fair Value Measurement of Private Placement 
 Change in fair value of other asset was zero for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and a gain of 1.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. Change in fair value of other asset was a loss of 3.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and a loss of 180,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. We determined the fair value of the rights from Private Placement to be zero as of March 31, 2024 as the second closing of the Private Placement did not occur in April 2024 as expected. As a result, we wrote off the balance of the rights from Private Placement during the three months ended March 31, 2024. 
 Going Concern and Capital Resources 
 
 Exploring Strategic Alternatives 
 
 We require substantial additional capital to sustain our operations and pursue our growth strategy, including the development of our product candidates. We are exploring strategic alternatives that may include, but are not limited to, sale of assets of the Company, a sale of the Company, licensing of assets, a merger, liquidation or other strategic action. If a strategic process is unsuccessful, the Board may decide to pursue a liquidation or obtain relief under the US Bankruptcy Code. These factors raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. 
 
 26 

Sources of Liquidity 
 Since our inception through September 30, 2024, our operations have been financed primarily by net cash proceeds from the sale and issuance of our common stock and borrowings under notes payable. We have also received upfront and milestone payments from our license agreements. As of September 30, 2024, we had 1.9 million in cash and an accumulated deficit of 180.4 million. Subject to receiving adequate funding, we expect that our operating expenses will increase, and, as a result, anticipate that we will continue to incur increasing losses for the foreseeable future. Therefore, we will need to raise additional capital to fund our operations, which may be through the issuance of additional equity or through borrowings. 
 
 In July 2024, we received a 5.0 million Exclusivity Payment from TuHURA in connection with the TuHURA Agreement and are negotiating a Potential Transaction (as defined in the TuHURA Agreement) with TuHURA. In October 2024, TuHURA exercised its right to extend the TuHURA Agreement and paid us 300,000 in Exclusivity Payments. 
 Future Funding Requirements 
 Our revenues to date have been primarily derived from our collaboration, research and license agreements as well as grants awarded by government agencies. We, however, have not generated any revenue from product sales, and do not know when, or if, we will generate any revenue from product sales. We do not expect to generate any revenue from product sales unless and until we obtain regulatory approval of and commercialize any of our product candidates. At the same time, we expect our expenses to increase in connection with our ongoing development activities, particularly as we continue the research, development and clinical trials of, and seeks regulatory approval for, our product candidates. In addition, subject to obtaining regulatory approval of any of our product candidates, we anticipate that we will need substantial additional funding in connection with our continuing operations. We plan to continue to fund our operations and capital requirements through equity and/or debt financing, but there are no assurances that we will be able to raise sufficient amounts of funding in the future on acceptable terms, or at all. 
 Our future funding requirements will depend on many factors, including: 
 the progress, timing, scope, results and costs of the clinical trials of VISTA and preclinical studies or clinical trials of other potential product candidates we may choose to pursue in the future, including the ability to enroll patients in a timely manner for our clinical trials; 

the costs and timing of obtaining clinical and commercial supplies and validating the commercial manufacturing process for VISTA and any other product candidates we may identify and develop; 

the cost, timing and outcomes of regulatory approvals; 

the timing and amount of any milestone, royalty or other payments we are required to make pursuant to current or any future collaboration or license agreements; 

costs of acquiring or in-licensing other product candidates and technologies; 

the terms and timing of establishing and maintaining collaborations, licenses and other similar arrangements; 

the costs associated with attracting, hiring and retaining existing and additional qualified personnel as our business grows; 

efforts to enhance operational systems and hire additional personnel to satisfy our obligations as a public company, including enhanced internal controls over financial reporting; and 

the cost of preparing, filing, prosecuting, defending and enforcing any patent claims and other intellectual property rights. 

As of September 30, 2024, we had cash of 1.9 million, and there is substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. Based on our current operating plans, we do not have sufficient cash and cash equivalents to fund our operating expenses and capital expenditures for at least the next 12 months from the filing date of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. 
 We are exploring strategic alternatives that may include, but are not limited to, sale of assets of the Company, a sale of the Company, licensing of assets, a merger, liquidation or other strategic action. 
 
 In July 2024, we received a 5.0 million Exclusivity Payment from TuHURA in connection with the TuHURA Agreement and are negotiating a Potential Transaction (as defined in the TuHURA Agreement) with TuHURA. In October 2024, TuHURA exercised its right to extend the TuHURA Agreement and paid us 300,000 in Exclusivity Payments. 
 
 We may seek additional funds through equity or debt financings or through collaborations, licensing transactions or other sources that may be identified through our strategic process. However, there can be no assurance that we will be able to complete any such transactions on acceptable terms or otherwise. The failure to obtain sufficient funds on commercially acceptable terms when needed would have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition. These factors raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. 
 
 We do not currently have any commitments for future funding or additional capital. As noted above, the investors failed to fulfill their contractual obligation to consummate the Private Placement. We are pursuing litigation or seeking other settlements against the investors for the failure to fund. Due to the lack of commitments for future funding or additional capital, we have paused or significantly scaled back the development or commercialization of our future product candidates or other research and development initiatives. If we are unable to complete a strategic transaction or raise additional capital in sufficient amounts, we will not be able to continue our business and we may need to file for bankruptcy protection.

 See Note 5 to our consolidated financial statements included in this Quarterly Report for additional information regarding our notes payable. 
 Other Contractual Obligations and Commitments 
 Our cash requirements greater than 12 months are related to other contractual obligations and commitments related to license agreements. 
 We have entered into a number of strategic license agreements pursuant to which we have acquired rights to specific assets, technology and intellectual property. In accordance with these agreements, we are obligated to pay, among other items, future contingent payments that are dependent upon future events such as our achievement of certain development, regulatory and commercial milestones royalties, and sublicensing revenue in the future, as applicable. As of September 30, 2024, the timing and likelihood of achieving the milestones and generating future product sales, and therefore payments that may become payable to these third parties, are uncertain. 
 We leased office and laboratory space for our corporate headquarters in Seattle, Washington under a lease agreement that expired on July 31, 2024. This lease was not renewed and no other facility lease was entered into as the Company employees are working remotely. 
 
 28 

On September 13, 2024 (the Agreement Effective Date ), we entered into a Settlement Agreement (the Agreement with ARE-SEATTLE No. 17, LLC (the Landlord ), the landlord of our former premises in Seattle, Washington. Under the terms of the Agreement, we have agreed to pay the Landlord the outstanding monetary obligation of 679,000 (the Outstanding Debt pursuant to that certain Lease Agreement, by and between us and the Landlord, dated as of November 19, 2010, as amended through June 30, 2020 (collectively, the Lease as follows: (i) the Landlord s application of the security deposit in the amount of 70,000, (ii) our payment to the Landlord of 85,000 (the First Payment no later than five (5) business days after the Agreement Effective Date, and (iii) our payment to the Landlord of the Outstanding Debt balance of 524,000 (the Second Payment and together with the First Payment, the Payment Milestones no later than February 1, 2025. The Agreement stipulates that upon the receipt by the Landlord of the Payment Milestones, the Landlord will fully discharge and forever release us from any claim, cause of action, or judgment, legal or equitable, in contract or tort, direct or indirect, presently asserted or not, known or unknown, through the date of the Agreement related to our monetary obligations under the Lease. We paid the First Payment to the Landlord on September 18, 2024. 
 
 Additionally, under the Agreement, as consideration for the Landlord s agreement to delay collection of the Outstanding Debt and to not assess additional interest and late fees with respect to the Outstanding Debt, we executed a Confession of Judgment (the Confession in favor of the Landlord, and as consideration for our agreement to execute the Confession, the Landlord agreed not to file any lawsuit or other legal action against us related to the Outstanding Debt, or to otherwise cause the Confession to be entered into any legal action or proceeding unless we fail to satisfy the Payment Milestones. The Agreement specifies that except as it relates to the matters contemplated in the Agreement, no action by the parties is to be construed as an admission of liability by any party as it relates to such parties rights or obligations under the Lease. 
 
 We entered into the Agreement to avoid the costs and uncertainties of legal proceedings, reflecting the Company s commitment to responsibly managing its financial obligations and disputes as we continue to explore strategic alternatives. 
 In addition, we enter into agreements in the normal course of business with various third parties for preclinical research studies, clinical trials, testing and other research and development services. Such agreements generally provide for termination upon notice, although obligate us to reimburse vendors for any time or costs incurred through the date of termination. 
 Critical Accounting Estimates 
 Our management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities and expenses, and related disclosures. Our estimates are based on historical experience and on various assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities and the recording of expenses that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ materially from these estimates. Our critical accounting estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 were consistent with those in Part II, Item 7 of our Annual Report on Form 10-K. 
 
 Ite m 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk. 
 We are a smaller reporting company, as defined in Rule 12b-2 under the Exchange Act, for this reporting period and are not required to provide the information required under this item. 
 I tem 4. Controls and Procedures. 
 
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 
 Prior to completion of the Merger, we were a private company and had limited accounting and financial reporting personnel and other resources with which to address our internal controls and related procedures. In connection with the audit of our financial statements for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, our management and our independent registered public accounting firm identified material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting. A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting as defined under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act and by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of our annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. The material weaknesses for the year ended December 31, 2023 relate to accounting for complex financial instruments related to the derivative asset, accounting for offering costs and accounting for allocated facilities costs. The material weakness for the year ended December 31, 2022 relates to accounting for complex financial instruments related to warrants issued to certain existing stockholders. The material weaknesses are still present and have not been remediated. 
 
 Our management, with the participation of our President and Chief Financial Officer, has evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) as of the end of the fiscal quarter ended September 30, 2024. Based on this evaluation and for the reasons set forth above, our President and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of September 30, 2024. 
 
 We are in the process of implementing measures designed to improve our internal control over financial reporting to remediate the material weaknesses. For example, we began to address the material weaknesses by implementing certain Sarbanes-Oxley controls during the first half of 
 29 

2022. In October 2022, we hired a Chief Financial Officer to enhance internal controls and address the material weaknesses and other control deficiencies identified during the 2021 audit of the financial statements. We have designed and implemented improved processes and internal controls, including ongoing senior management review and audit committee oversight. We have also implemented and upgraded accounting and reporting systems to improve accounting and financial reporting processes. Additionally, we have enhanced, developed and implemented formal policies, processes and documentation procedures relating to our financial processes, including the oversight of third-party service providers. Our actions are subject to ongoing executive management review and will also be subject to audit committee oversight. 
 
 Notwithstanding the material weaknesses in internal control over financial reporting described above, our management has concluded that our consolidated financial statements included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q are fairly stated in all material respects in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. 

Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 
 Except as disclosed above, there has been no change in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the third quarter of 2024 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over current or future financial reporting.

PART II - OTHER INFORMATION 
 Ite m 1. Legal Proceedings. 
 On March 20, 2024, Kineta filed a complaint in the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware against Growth Value Development Inc. GVDI ), alleging breach of contract in connection with GVDI s recent repudiation of its obligation to provide a substantial tranche of funding for Kineta as required under the Securities Purchase Agreement. The complaint provides that Kineta will seek specific performance of GVDI s obligations under the Securities Purchase Agreement and damages equal to the amount of the unpaid funding and any damages resulting from GVDI s breach. 
 
 On May 30, 2024, Kineta filed a complaint in the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware against Myron Wolff, alleging breach of contract in connection with Myron Wolff s recent repudiation of its obligation to provide a substantial tranche of funding for Kineta as required under the Securities Purchase Agreement. The complaint provides that Kineta will seek specific performance of Myron Wolff s obligations under the Securities Purchase Agreement and damages equal to the amount of the unpaid funding and any damages resulting from Myron Wolff s breach. 
 
 Except as disclosed in the preceding paragraphs, Kineta is currently not a party to any other material legal proceedings. From time to time, however, Kineta may be a party to litigation or subject to claims incident to the ordinary course of business. Although the results of litigation and claims cannot be predicted with certainty, Kineta currently believes that the final outcome of these ordinary course matters will not have a material adverse effect on Kineta s business. Regardless of the outcome, litigation can have an adverse impact on Kineta because of defense and settlement costs, diversion of management resources and other factors. 
 It em 1A. Risk Factors. 
 
 Except as set forth below, there have been no material changes to our risk factors included in our 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K. The following risk factor, together with the risks and uncertainties referenced above, should be considered carefully before making an investment decision. Any of these factors could result in a significant or material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition. Additional risk factors not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also impair our business or results of operations. We may disclose changes to such risk factors or disclose additional risk factors from time to time in our future filings with the SEC. 
 
 Our common stock trades on an over-the-counter market, which has adversely affected our stock price and the liquidity of our stock and could impact our ability to obtain financing could be impaired. 
 
 The Company s common stock was suspended from trading on The Nasdaq Capital Market at the opening of business on September 19, 2024 and delisted from Nasdaq effective as of October 25, 2024. Since September 19, 2024, the Company s common stock has been trading on the OTC Pink Market under the symbol KANT. Such market is currently the only trading market for our common stock, which subjects the Company and our stockholders to certain significant risks including: 
 
 limited availability of market quotations for our common stock; 

reduced liquidity for our common stock, including reduced availability of buyers or sellers of our common stock; 

limited amount of news and analyst coverage or no coverage at all; 

decreased ability to issue additional securities or obtain additional financing in the future; and 

our common stock are no longer covered securities under the National Securities Markets Improvement Act of 1996, and therefore subject to regulation in each state in which we offer securities. 

We can provide no assurance that our common stock will continue to trade on this market or any other market, whether broker-dealers will continue to provide public quotes of our common stock on this market, whether the trading volume of our common stock will be sufficient to provide for an efficient trading market or whether quotes for our common stock will continue on this market in the future, which could result in significantly lower trading volumes and reduced liquidity for investors seeking to buy or sell our common stock. The ability of our investors to access the capital markets may be severely limited or eliminated. 
 
 Because of the trading volatility often associated with low-priced stocks not listed on a national securities exchange, many brokerage houses and institutional investors have internal policies and practices that either prohibit them from investing in low-priced stocks or tend to discourage individual brokers from recommending low-priced stocks to their customers. Some of those policies and practices may make the processing of trades in low-priced stocks economically unattractive to brokers. Additionally, because brokers commissions on low-priced stocks generally represent a higher percentage of the stock price than commissions on higher-priced stocks, a low average price per share of common stock can result in individual stockholders paying transaction costs representing a higher percentage of their total share value than would be the case if the share price were higher. 
 
 In addition, the National Securities Markets Improvement Act of 1996, which is a federal statute, prevents or preempts the states from regulating the sale of certain securities, which are referred to as covered securities. Because our common stock is not listed on The Nasdaq Capital Market, our common stock is not a covered security, and therefore, we are subject to regulation in each state in which we offer our securities. Accordingly, the types of financings that we may engage in are limited. 
 
 31 

As a public company and notwithstanding the delisting of our common stock from The Nasdaq Capital Market, we continue to incur significant legal, accounting and other expenses and we are required to bear all of the internal and external costs of preparing filings in compliance with our obligations under the securities laws. 
 
 Our common stock is subject to the penny stock rules of the SEC and the trading market in the securities is limited, which makes transactions in the stock cumbersome and may reduce the value of an investment in the stock. 
 
 Rule 15g-9 under the Exchange Act, establishes the definition of a penny stock, for the purposes relevant to us, as any equity security that has a market price of less than 5.00 per share or with an exercise price of less than 5.00 per share, subject to certain exceptions. For any transaction involving a penny stock, unless exempt, the rules require: (a) that a broker or dealer approve a person s account for transactions in penny stocks; and (b) the broker or dealer receive from the investor a written agreement to the transaction, setting forth the identity and quantity of the penny stock to be purchased. 
 
 In order to approve a person s account for transactions in penny stocks, the broker or dealer must: (a) obtain financial information and investment experience objectives of the person and (b) make a reasonable determination that the transactions in penny stocks are suitable for that person and the person has sufficient knowledge and experience in financial matters to be capable of evaluating the risks of transactions in penny stocks. 
 
 The broker or dealer must also deliver, prior to any transaction in a penny stock, a disclosure schedule prescribed by the SEC relating to the penny stock market, which, in highlight form: (a) sets forth the basis on which the broker or dealer made the suitability determination; and (b) confirms that the broker or dealer received a signed, written agreement from the investor prior to the transaction. Generally, brokers may be less willing to execute transactions in securities subject to the penny stock rules. This may make it more difficult for investors to dispose of our common stock and cause a decline in the market value of our common stock. 
 
 Disclosure also has to be made about the risks of investing in penny stocks in both public offerings and in secondary trading and about the commissions payable to both the broker or dealer and the registered representative, current quotations for the securities and the rights and remedies available to an investor in cases of fraud in penny stock transactions. Finally, monthly statements have to be sent disclosing recent price information for the penny stock held in the account and information on the limited market in penny stocks. 
 
 The second closing of the Private Placement did not close as anticipated, and Kineta currently does not have any commitments for future funding or additional capital. 
 
 As previously disclosed, we entered into the Securities Purchase Agreement with certain investors to sell shares of our common stock to such investors in the Private Placement. The first closing of the Private Placement occurred on December 16, 2022 and we issued 649,346 shares of our common stock and received net proceeds of 7.4 million. The second closing of the Private Placement for an aggregate purchase price of 22.5 million was scheduled to occur on April 15, 2024, however, the investors failed to fulfill their contractual obligation to fund and the second closing did not occur. Kineta does not have any commitments for future funding or additional capital. Kineta is pursuing litigation or seeking other settlements against the investors for the failure to fund. Due to the lack of commitments for future funding or additional capital, Kineta has paused or significantly scaled back the development or commercialization of its future product candidates or other research and development initiatives. If Kineta is unable to complete a strategic transaction or raise additional capital in sufficient amounts, Kineta will not be able to continue its business and the Company may need to file for bankruptcy protection. 
 
 Kineta identified conditions and events that raise substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern, Kineta needs substantial additional funding, and if Kineta is unable to raise capital when needed or on favorable terms, its business, financial condition, and results of operation could be materially and adversely affected. 
 
 Kineta may be forced to wind-down its operations if it is unable to consummate a strategic transaction and/or obtain sufficient funding. 
 
 As of September 30, 2024, Kineta had 1.9 million in cash, and there is substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern. In July 2024, Kineta received cash proceeds of 5.0 million from TuHURA, however, based on Kineta s current operating plans, Kineta does not have sufficient cash and cash equivalents to fund its operating expenses and capital expenditures for at least the next 12 months from the filing date of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. 
 
 Kineta is exploring strategic alternatives that may include, but are not limited to, sale of assets of the Company, a sale of the Company, licensing of assets, a merger, liquidation or other strategic action. 
 
 Kineta may seek additional funds through equity or debt financings or through collaborations, licensing transactions or other sources that may be identified through the Company s strategic process. However, there can be no assurance that Kineta will be able to complete any such transactions on acceptable terms or otherwise. The failure to obtain sufficient funds on commercially acceptable terms when needed would have a material adverse effect on Kineta s business, results of operations, and financial condition. These factors raise substantial doubt about Kineta s ability to continue as a going concern. 
 
 Kineta does not currently have any commitments for future funding or additional capital. As noted above, the investors failed to fulfill their contractual obligation to consummate the Private Placement. The Company is pursuing litigation or seeking other settlements against the investors for the failure to fund. Due to the lack of commitments for future funding or additional capital, Kineta has paused or significantly scaled back the development or commercialization of its future product candidates or other research and development initiatives. If Kineta is unable to complete a 
 32 

strategic transaction or raise additional capital in sufficient amounts, Kineta will not be able to continue its business and the Company may need to file for bankruptcy protection.
