 Warrants 
 In connection with debt refinancing and amendment activities, the Company issued warrants to purchase shares of the Common Stock in December 2018 which are exercisable until December 27, 2028 (the "December 2018 Warrants , in June 2020 which are exercisable until June 16, 2030 (the "June 2020 Warrants") and issued the June 2023 Warrants and May 2024 Warrants are until June 1, 2033 and May 24, 2034, respectively (collectively, the Lender Warrants ). In July 2024, the Company issued warrants which are exercisable until July 11, 2034 and additional warrants were issued in August 2024 which are exercisable until August 13, 2034 (the August 2024 Warrants ). 
 
 As part of the August 2024 Warrants, the Company agreed to lower the exercise price of certain outstanding warrants to purchase an aggregate of shares of Common Stock held by the Term Loan lenders or their affiliates to per share (the Amended and Restated Warrants ). Other than lowering the exercise price and inserting certain restrictions on adjustments in the event of dilutive issuances at a price lower than the amended exercise price, the terms of the Amended and Restated Warrants are substantially similar to those contained in the original warrants.

 Upon exercise, the aggregate exercise price of the Lender Warrants may be paid, at each warrant holder s election, in cash or on a net issuance basis, based upon the fair market value of the Common Stock at the time of exercise. The exercise price and the number of shares underlying the Lender Warrants are subject to adjustment in the event of specified events, including dilutive issuances of equity instruments at a price lower than the exercise price of the respective warrants (the "Down Round Feature"), repricing of existing equity-linked instruments at a price lower than the exercise price of the respective warrants (the "Warrant Repricing Feature"), a subdivision or combination of the Common Stock, a reclassification of the Common Stock or specified dividend payments. The Company's warrants also have a provision that determines the potential stock price used when applying the Black-Scholes valuation model to determine the settlement price of the warrants in Successor Major Transactions ("SMT"), as defined in the respective warrant agreements, which include a change in control or liquidation (the "Warrant Settlement Price Provision"). The Warrant Settlement Price Provision requires the use of the greater of the closing price of the Common Stock on the trading day immediately preceding the date on which an SMT is consummated, the closing market price of the Common Stock following the first public announcement of an SMT or the closing market of the Common Stock immediately preceding the announcement of an SMT. Due to these terms, equity classification was precluded, and these warrants are carried as liabilities at fair value. 
 The Company also issued warrants to purchase the Common Stock in June 2020 and June 2023 to advisors of the Company at an exercise price of and , respectively (collectively the "Other Warrants"). The Company has concluded that the Other Warrants do not contain provisions that would require liability classification under Topic 480 or Topic 718 and have been equity classified. 
 Registration Rights Agreements 
 
 The Lender Warrants grant the holders certain registration rights for the shares of Common Stock issuable upon the exercise of the applicable warrants, including (a) the ability of a holder to request that the Company file a Form S-1 registration statement with respect to at least of the registrable securities held by such holder as of the issuance date of the applicable warrants; (b) the ability of a holder to request that the Company file a Form S-3 registration statement with respect to outstanding registrable securities if at any time the Company is eligible to use

 The Company had outstanding market based restricted stock units as of September 30, 2024 that were eligible to vest into shares of the Common Stock subject to the achievement of certain stock price targets in addition to a time-based vesting period. These contingently issuable shares are excluded from the computation of diluted earnings per share if, based on current period results, the shares would not be issuable if the end of the reporting period were the end of the contingency period. There were shares of contingently issuable market-based restricted stock units that were excluded from the table above as the market conditions were not satisfied as of September 30, 2024.

The effective tax rates differed from the federal statutory tax rate of 21 during each of these periods due primarily to unbenefited losses experienced in jurisdictions with valuation allowances on deferred tax assets as well as the forecasted mix of earnings in domestic and international jurisdictions. 
 
 As of September 30, 2024, including interest and penalties, the Company had million of unrecognized tax benefits, million of which, if recognized, would favorably affect the effective tax rate without consideration of the valuation allowance. As of September 30, 2024, the Company had accrued interest and penalties related to these unrecognized tax benefits of million. The Company recognizes interest and penalties related to income tax matters in the income tax provision in the condensed consolidated statements of operations. As of September 30, 2024, million of unrecognized tax benefits were recorded as a contra deferred tax asset in other long-term assets in the condensed consolidated balance sheet and million (including interest and penalties) were recorded in other long-term liabilities in the condensed consolidated balance sheets. During the next 12 months, it is reasonably possible that approximately million of tax benefits, inclusive of interest and penalties, that are currently unrecognized could be recognized as a result of the expiration of applicable statutes of limitations. Upon recognition of the tax benefit related to the expiring statutes of limitation, million will be offset by the establishment of a related valuation allowance. The net tax benefit recognized in the statements of operation is estimated to be million.

 Product Revenue 
 In the three months ended September 30, 2024, product revenue decreased 6.2 million, or 14 , as compared to the same period in fiscal 2024.. The primary driver of the decrease was in Primary storage systems as customers transition to subscription-based offerings. We expect the product revenue portion of our Primary and Secondary storage systems to decrease as we continue to transition to subscription-based offerings. 
 Service and subscription revenue increased 0.8 million, or 3 , in the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in fiscal 2024. This increase was due to new support bookings and the transition towards subscription-based licensing, partially offset by certain long-lived products reaching their end-of-service-life. 
 Royalty Revenue 
 We receive royalties from third parties that license our linear-tape open media patents through our membership in the linear-tape open consortium. Royalty revenue saw a small increase of 0.1 million, or 6 , in the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in fiscal 2024 due to product mix.

 Gross profit and margin percentages are key metrics that management monitors to assess the performance on the business. 
 Product Gross Margin 
 Product gross margin decreased by 5.2 million, or by 940 basis points, for the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared with the same period in fiscal 2024.. This decrease was primarily due to a less favorable mix of revenues, weighted towards our lower margin product lines, which were partially offset from improvements in our operational efficiency and logistics costs. 
 Service and Subscription Gross Margin 
 Service and subscription gross margins increased 360 basis points for the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared with the same period in fiscal 2024. This increase was primarily driven by the increase in service revenues as well as improvements in our operations efficiency.

 In the three months ended September 30, 2024, sales and marketing expenses decreased 2.1 million, or 14 , as compared with the same period in fiscal 2024 This decrease was primarily driven by improved operational efficiency and increased leverage of our channel. 
 In the three months ended September 30, 2024, general and administrative expenses increased 3.7 million, or 36 , as compared with the same period in fiscal 2024 This increase was primarily driven by non-recurring costs related to our previously announced restatement of our historical financial statements, and other related projects. 
 In the three months ended September 30, 2024, research and development expenses decreased 0.9 million, or 10 , as compared with the same period in fiscal 2024 This decrease was the result of the continued consolidation of acquisition costs, and efficiencies realized through improved organization design. 
 In the three months ended September 30, 2024, restructuring expenses decreased 1.0 million, or 71 as compared with the same period in fiscal 2024 The decrease was the result of cost reduction initiatives in the previous year.

 Three Months Ended September 30, (dollars in thousands) 2024 of pretax income 2023 of pretax income Change Change Income tax provision 370 (3) 533 (19) (163) (31) 
 The income tax provision for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 is primarily influenced by foreign and state income taxes. Due to our history of net losses in the United States, the protracted period for utilizing tax attributes in certain foreign jurisdictions, and the difficulty in predicting future results, we believe that we cannot rely on projections of future taxable income to realize most of our deferred tax assets. Accordingly, we have established a full valuation allowance against our U.S. and certain foreign net deferred tax assets. Significant management judgment is required in assessing our ability to realize any future benefit from our net deferred tax assets. We intend to maintain this valuation allowance until sufficient positive evidence exists to support its reversal. Our income tax expense recorded in the future will be reduced to the extent that sufficient positive evidence materializes to support a reversal of, or decrease in, our valuation allowance.

 Product Revenue 
 In the six months ended September 30, 2024, product revenue decreased 23.7 million, or 23 , as compared to the same period in fiscal 2024. The primary driver of the decrease was a 20 million decrease in demand from our large hyperscale customers, as well as more general decreases in the overall tape market with declines in media and devices revenue. Outside of the Tape and Hyperscale business, our remaining Secondary and Primary storage systems are also offered as a subscription. We expect the product revenue portion of our Primary and Secondary storage systems to decrease as we continue to transition to subscription-based offerings. 
 Service Revenue 
 We offer a broad range of services including product maintenance, implementation, and training as well as software subscriptions. Service revenue is primarily comprised of customer field support contracts which provide standard support services for our hardware. Standard service contracts may be extended or include enhanced service, such as faster service response times. 
 Service and subscription revenue decreased 2.7 million, or 4 , in the six months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in fiscal 2024. This decrease was primarily driven by certain long-lived products reaching their end-of-service-life, partially offset by increases in subscription-based revenue.

 The change in other income (expense), net during the six months ended September 30, 2024 compared with the same period in fiscal 2024 was related primarily to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates during the three months ended September 30, 2024. 
 
 Interest Expense 
 Six Months Ended September 30, (dollars in thousands) 2024 of revenue 2023 of revenue Change Change Interest expense (9,921) (7) (7,055) (4) (2,866) 41 
 In the six months ended September 30, 2024, interest expense increased 2.9 million, or 41 , as compared with the same period in fiscal 2024 due to a higher effective interest rate on our Term Loan. 
 
 Warrant liabilities 
 Six Months Ended September 30, (dollars in thousands) 2024 of revenue 2023 of revenue Change Change Change in fair value of warrant liabilities 5,216 4 5,128 3 88 2 
 
 In September 30, 2024, the change in fair value of warrant liabilities increased 0.1 million, or 2 , as compared with the same period in fiscal 2024 due to a lower average stock price in the second fiscal quarter of 2024. 
 
 Loss on Debt Extinguishment 
 Six Months Ended September 30, (dollars in thousands) 2024 of revenue 2023 of revenue Change Change Loss on debt extinguishment (3,003) 2 (3,003) 100 
 In the six months ended September 30, 2024, loss on debt extinguishment was related to a prepayment of our Term Loan. 
 
 Income Taxes 
 Six Months Ended September 30, (dollars in thousands) 2024 of pretax income 2023 of pretax income Change Change Income tax provision 605 (2) 1,063 (9) (458) (43) 
 The income tax provision for the six months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 is primarily influenced by foreign and state income taxes. Due to our history of net losses in the United States, the protracted period for utilizing tax attributes in certain foreign jurisdictions, and the difficulty in predicting future results, we believe that we cannot rely on projections of future taxable income to realize most of our deferred tax assets. Accordingly, we have established a full valuation allowance against our U.S. and certain foreign net deferred tax assets. Significant management

Table of Contents 

 judgment is required in assessing our ability to realize any future benefit from our net deferred tax assets. We intend to maintain this valuation allowance until sufficient positive evidence exists to support its reversal. Our income tax expense recorded in the future will be reduced to the extent that sufficient positive evidence materializes to support a reversal of, or decrease in, our valuation allowance. 

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES 
 We consider liquidity in terms of the sufficiency of internal and external cash resources to fund our operating, investing and financing activities. Our principal sources of liquidity include cash from operating activities, cash and cash equivalents on our balance sheet and amounts available under our revolving credit facility agreement with PNC Bank, National Association as amended from time to time (the PNC Credit Facility ). We require significant cash resources to meet obligations to pay principal and interest on our outstanding debt, provide for our research and development activities, fund our working capital needs, and make capital expenditures. Our future liquidity requirements will depend on multiple factors, including our research and development plans and capital asset needs. 
 We had cash and cash equivalents of 16.7 million as of September 30, 2024, which consisted primarily of bank deposits and money market accounts. As of September 30, 2024, our total outstanding Term Loan debt was 104.7 million and PNC Credit Facility borrowings were 28.4 million. As of September 30, 2024 we had 0.1 million available to borrow under the PNC Credit Facility. 
 We are subject to various debt covenants under our debt agreements. Our failure to comply with our debt covenants could materially and adversely affect our financial condition and ability to service our obligations. For additional information about our debt, see the sections entitled Risk Factors Risks Related to Our Indebtedness and Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Liquidity and Capital Resources in the Annual Report. 
 
 Cash Flows 
 
 The following table summarizes our consolidated cash flows for the periods indicated. 
 
 Six Months Ended September 30, (in thousands) 2024 2023 Cash provided by (used in): Operating activities (17,194) (11,345) Investing activities (3,228) (3,925) Financing activities 11,525 14,838 Effect of exchange rate changes (3) 11 Net increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash (8,900) (421) 
 
 Cash Used In Operating Activities 
 
 Net cash used in operating activities was 17.2 million for the six months ended September 30, 2024. This use of cash was primarily attributed to lower earnings. 
 
 Net cash used in operating activities was 11.3 million for the six months ended September 30, 2023. This use of cash was primarily attributed to cash used in operations excluding changes in assets and liabilities of 6.9 million in addition to cash used from working capital changes. 
 
 Cash Used in Investing Activities 
 
 Net cash used in investing activities was 3.2 million in the six months ended September 30, 2024, which was attributable to capital expenditures. 
 
 26 

Table of Contents 

 Net cash used in investing activities was 3.9 million in the six months ended September 30, 2023, which was attributable to capital expenditures. 
 
 Cash Provided by Financing Activities 
 
 Net cash provided by financing activities was 11.5 million for the six months ended September 30, 2024, which was related primarily to borrowings on our Term Loan. 
 
 Net cash provided by financing activities was 14.8 million for the six months ended September 30, 2023, which was related primarily to borrowings on our Term Loan of 14.1 million net of issuance costs. 
 
 Commitments and Contingencies 
 
 Our contingent liabilities consist primarily of certain financial guarantees, both express and implied, related to product liability and potential infringement of intellectual property. We have little history of costs associated with such indemnification requirements and contingent liabilities associated with product liability may be mitigated by our insurance coverage. In the normal course of business to facilitate transactions of our services and products, we indemnify certain parties with respect to certain matters, such as intellectual property infringement or other claims. We also have indemnification agreements with our current and former officers and directors. It is not possible to determine the maximum potential amount under these indemnification agreements due to the limited history of our indemnification claims, and the unique facts and circumstances involved in each particular agreement. Historically, payments made by us under these agreements have not had a material impact on our operating results, financial position or cash flows. 
 
 We are also subject to ordinary course litigation. 
 
 Off Balance Sheet Arrangements 
 
 Except for the indemnification commitments described under Commitments and Contingencies above, we do not currently have any other off-balance sheet arrangements and do not have any holdings in variable interest entities. 
 
 Contractual Obligations 
 
 We have contractual obligations and commercial commitments, some of which, such as purchase obligations, are not recognized as liabilities in our financial statements. There have not been any material changes to the contractual obligations disclosed in the Annual Report. 
 
 Critical Accounting Estimates and Policies 
 The preparation of our consolidated financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make judgments, estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate estimates, which are based on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. We consider certain accounting policies to be critical to understanding our financial statements because the application of these policies requires significant judgment on the part of management, which could have a material impact on our financial statements if actual performance should differ from historical experience or if our assumptions were to change. Our accounting policies that include estimates that require management s subjective or complex judgments about the effects of matters that are inherently uncertain are summarized in the Annual Report under the section entitled Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Critical Accounting Estimates and Policies. For additional information on our significant accounting policies, see Note 1 to our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report.

 ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 
 There have been no material changes to our quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk from those described under Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations included in the Form 10-K, which such section is incorporated herein by reference. 

ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 Our management, with the participation of our principal executive and principal financial officers, evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934), as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report. Based on such evaluation, our principal executive and principal financial officers have concluded that as of such date, our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective at the reasonable assurance level due to the material weaknesses described below. 
 
 Notwithstanding the identified material weaknesses, management, including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer have determined, that the condensed consolidated financial statements included in this Form 10-Q fairly represent in all material respects the financial condition, results of operations and cash flows of the Company as of, and for, for the periods presented in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. 
 
 Material Weaknesses in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
 
 The following material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting, as initially disclosed in Part II, Item 9A, Controls and Procedures of the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended March 31, 2024 had not been remediated as of September 30, 2024. Specifically: 
 The Company s accounting practices and procedures for applying standalone selling price under Accounting Standards Codification Topic 606 Revenue from Contracts with Customers Topic 606 were not adequate to conclude on the application of standalone selling price consistent with the generally accepted application of the guidance in Topic 606. 
 The Company did not maintain effective controls over the accuracy of the inputs in the sales order entry process to ensure accuracy of the price, quantity, and related customer data. 
 Remediation Plan 
 The Company is implementing enhancements to its internal controls to remediate these material weaknesses in its internal control over financial reporting, including: 
 Review and update significant relevant accounting policies, procedures and controls. 
 Provide additional training to individuals involved in the assessments for these topics. 
 Engage with external third parties to assist with assessments for these topics, where necessary. 
 
 The Company is committed to maintaining a strong internal control environment and believes the remediation efforts, will represent significant improvements in its controls over the control environment. These steps will take time to be fully implemented and confirmed to be effective and sustainable. Additional controls may also be required over time. While the Company believes that these efforts will improve its internal control over financial reporting, the Company will not be able to conclude whether the steps the Company is taking will remediate the material weakness in internal control over financial reporting until a sufficient period has passed to allow management to test the design and operational effectiveness of the new and enhanced controls. Until the remediation steps set forth above are fully implemented and tested, the material weaknesses will continue to exist. 
 
 Remediation of Warrant Agreement Accounting Material Weakness 
 
 During the quarter ended September 30, 2024, the Company completed remediation measures to address the previously identified material weakness related to its accounting practices and procedures for warrant agreements under Accounting Standards Codification Topic 815, Contracts in Entity's Own Equity ("Topic 815"). These remediation efforts included updating relevant accounting policies, engaging third-party specialists to interpret technical guidance on warrant agreements and draft documentation to support the accounting conclusions, providing additional training for key personnel, and conducting a thorough review and approval process by management for all analyses and conclusions. Consequently, management has determined that the previously reported material weakness in internal control over financial reporting related to the Company s accounting 
 28 

Table of Contents 

 practices for warrant agreements has been remediated as of September 30, 2024. Management believes that these control enhancements are now sufficient to prevent and detect potential material misstatements in a timely manner, thereby remediating the warrant agreement material weakness. 
 
 Changes in Internal Control 
 
 Except for remediation of the warrant agreement material weakness described above and the ongoing remediation measures to address the remaining material weaknesses, in connection with the evaluation required by Rule 13a-15(d) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, there were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the quarter ended September 30, 2024 that materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 
 
 Limitations on Effectiveness of Controls 
 
 Our management does not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures or our internal control over financial reporting will prevent or detect all errors and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within our company have been detected. The design of any system of controls is also based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions. Over time, controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. Because of the inherent limitations in a cost-effective control system, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected. 

ITEM 5. OTHER INFORMATION 
 On November 9, 2023, the Leadership and Compensation Committee of the Board approved and adopted the Quantum Corporation Executive Compensation Recoupment Policy (the Clawback Policy ), which was established in accordance with the listing requirements of The Nasdaq Stock Market LLC. The Clawback Policy provides for the recovery or clawback of certain erroneously awarded incentive-based compensation in the event that the Company is required to prepare an accounting restatement.

Executive Compensation Recoupment Policy 

1. Purpose 
 
 Quantum Corporation, a Delaware corporation (the Company), has adopted this Executive Compensation Recoupment Policy (this Policy) to comply with Section 954 of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010, as codified by Section 10D of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act), and the Nasdaq Stock Exchange (Nasdaq) Listing Rule 5608. This Policy provides for the Company s recoupment of Incentive-Based Compensation paid erroneously to Covered Executives in the event of a Restatement. Capitalized terms will have the meanings set forth in Section 12. 
 
 This Policy is intended to be in addition to, and does not replace or supersede, the Company s compensation clawback policy previously adopted by the Company as required by the Stipulation and Agreement of Settlement entered into on April 11, 2019. 
 
 2. Administration 
 
 This Policy will be administered by the Leadership and Compensation Committee (the Committee) of the Board of Directors of the Company (the Board). The Committee is authorized and directed to consult with the full Board or such other committee of the Board (such as the Audit Committee), as may be necessary or appropriate as to matters within the scope of such other committee s responsibility and authority. 
 
 Subject to any limitation under applicable law, the Committee may authorize and empower any officer or employee of the Company to take any and all actions necessary or appropriate to carry out the purpose and intent of this Policy (other than with respect to any recovery under this Policy involving such officer or employee). 
 
 The Committee is authorized to interpret and construe this Policy and to make all determinations necessary, appropriate, or advisable for the administration of this Policy. This Policy will be interpreted in a manner that is consistent with the requirements of Section 10D of the Exchange Act, any applicable rules or standards adopted by the Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC), and Nasdaq Rules. Any determinations made by the Committee will be final and binding on all affected individuals. 
 
 3. Recoupment of Incentive-Based Compensation 
 
 In the event of a Restatement, the Committee will require that the Covered Executive promptly repay or forfeit to the Company, on a pre-tax basis, the full amount of the excess of (a) the amount of any Incentive-Based Compensation received by the Covered Executive during a Clawback Period that was calculated based on the erroneous data in the original financial statements that were subsequently restated over (b) the amount of such Incentive-Based Compensation to which the Covered Executive would have been entitled to receive based on the restated financial statements (such excess amount, the Recoverable Incentive-Based Compensation). 
 
 In the case of compensation based on stock price or total shareholder return, the amount subject to recoupment will be based on a reasonable estimate of the effect of the Restatement on the Company s stock price or total shareholder return upon which the Incentive-Based Compensation was received. If any performance-based restricted stock units or other equity-based compensation is subject to recoupment, then the Recoverable Incentive-Based Compensation may be in the form of shares of Company stock, the value of such shares, based on the fair market value of such shares on the settlement date or a combination of the foregoing, in the discretion of the Committee, taking into account any sales of shares by the Covered Executive. 
 
 Such recoupment will apply on a no-fault basis that is, regardless of whether any misconduct occurred or a Covered Executive officer s responsibility for the Restatement. In addition, the Company s obligation to recoup Recoverable Incentive-Based Compensation is not dependent on if or when restated financial statements are filed with the SEC. 

Executive Compensation Recoupment Policy 

4. Recoupment Methods 
 
 Subject to Section 3, the Committee will determine, in its sole discretion, the timing and method or methods for recouping Recoverable Incentive-Based Compensation pursuant to this Policy. The Committee will have no obligation to apply the same method of recoupment to each affected Covered Employee in connection with any Restatement. 
 
 Except as provided in Section 5, in no event may the Company accept an amount that is less than the amount of Recoverable Incentive-Based Compensation in satisfaction of the Covered Executive s obligations under this Policy. To the extent that a Covered Executive fails to repay all Recoverable Incentive-Based Compensation to the Company when due, the Company will take all actions reasonable and appropriate to recover such amounts. 
 
 5. Exceptions to Recovery for Impracticability 
 
 The Committee will recover any Recoverable Incentive-Based Compensation unless such recovery would be impracticable, as determined in good faith by either the Committee or a majority of the independent directors serving on the Board in accordance with Rule 10D-1 of the Exchange Act and applicable securities exchange rules. 
 
 Specifically, no recovery will be required pursuant to this Policy if (a) the direct expense paid to a third-party to assist in enforcing this Policy would exceed the amount of the Recoverable Incentive-Based Compensation and the Company (i) makes a reasonable attempt to recover the Recoverable Incentive-Based Compensation and (ii) documents such reasonable attempts, which documentation will be provided to the national securities exchange on which the Company s securities are then listed, or (b) recovery would likely cause an otherwise tax-qualified retirement plan, under which benefits are broadly available to employees, to fail to meet the requirements of Section 401(a)(13) or Section 411(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, and the regulations thereunder. 
 
 6. Acknowledgment by Covered Executives and Notice 
 
 The Company will provide notice to, and seek acknowledgment of this Policy, from each Covered Executive, in substantially the form attached hereto as Exhibit A , provided that the failure to provide a notice or obtain an acknowledgment will not impact the Company s ability to enforce or apply this Policy. 
 
 In addition, before the Company takes any action to seek recovery of Recoverable Incentive-Based Compensation pursuant to this Policy or any other action provided for hereunder against a Covered Executive, the Company will provide notice of such clawback or other action. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, the Company s failure to provide notice will have no impact on the applicability or enforceability of this Policy. 
 
 7. Other Recoupment Rights 
 
 The Board intends that this Policy shall be applied to the fullest extent of the law. Any right of recovery under this Policy is in addition to, and not in lieu of, any other rights or remedies that the Company may have pursuant to the terms of any other policy of the Company or any provision in any employment agreement, equity award agreement, compensatory plan, agreement or similar arrangement, and any other legal rights and remedies available to the Company, or any actions that may be imposed by law enforcement agencies, regulators, administrative bodies, or other authorities. 
 
 8. No Indemnification or Reimbursement of Covered Executives 
 
 Neither the Company nor any of its affiliates shall be permitted to (a) insure or indemnify any Covered Executive against the loss of any Recoverable Incentive-Based Compensation that is repaid, returned or recovered pursuant to the terms of this Policy, or any claims relating to the Company s enforcement of its rights under this Policy, or (b) pay or 
 2 

Executive Compensation Recoupment Policy 

reimburse any Covered Executive for premiums incurred or paid for any insurance policy to fund such Covered Executive s potential recovery obligations. 
 
 9. Amendment 
 
 The Committee may amend this Policy from time to time in its discretion, and will amend this Policy as it deems necessary to reflect the regulations adopted by the SEC under Section 10D of the Exchange Act and to comply with any rules or standards adopted by a national securities exchange on which the Company s securities are then listed. 
 
 10. Successors 
 
 This Policy shall be binding and enforceable against all Covered Executives and their beneficiaries, heirs, executors, administrators or other legal representatives. 
 
 11. Effective Date 
 
 This Policy was adopted by the Company on November 9, 2023, and applies to Incentive-Based Compensation that is granted, earned, or vested by Covered Executives on or after October 2, 2023 (the Effective Date). 
 
 12. Definitions 
 
 For purposes of this Policy 
 
 (a) Covered Executive means current and former executive officers who are, or were at any time, during an applicable Clawback Period, executive officers as defined in Rule 10D-1(d) of the Exchange Act. Subsequent changes in a Covered Executive s employment status, including retirement or termination of employment (including after serving in an interim capacity), do not affect the Company s rights to recover Incentive-Based Compensation pursuant to this Policy. 
 
 (b) Clawback Period means the three (3) completed fiscal years immediately preceding the Restatement Date, and any transition period (that results from a change in the Company s fiscal year) of less than nine months within or immediately following such three (3) completed fiscal years. 
 
 (c) A financial reporting measure means any measure that is determined and presented in accordance with the accounting principles used in preparing the Company s financial statements, and any measures that are derived wholly or in part from such measures, including, but not limited to, stock price and total shareholder return (and any measures that are derived wholly or in part from stock price or total shareholder return). For the avoidance of doubt, (i) financial reporting measures include non-GAAP financial measures for purposes of Regulation G of the Exchange Act, as well other measures, metrics and ratios that are not non-GAAP measures, and (ii) financial reporting measures may or may not be included in a filing with the SEC, and may be presented outside the financial statements. 
 
 (d) GAAP means U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles. 
 
 (e) Incentive-Based Compensation means any compensation that is granted, earned, or vested on or after the Effective Date based wholly or in part upon the attainment of a financial reporting measure based on or derived from financial information for any fiscal period ending on or after the Effective Date, including but not limited to cash incentive awards under the Executive Incentive Compensation Plan or any successor plan and performance-based restricted stock units granted under the Stock Incentive Plan or any successor plan. For the avoidance of doubt, Incentive-Based Compensation does not include (i) salary (except to the extent that a Covered Executive receives a salary increase earned wholly or in part based on the attainment of a financial reporting measure performance goal), (ii) bonuses paid solely at the discretion of the Board or the Committee and that is not paid from a bonus pool which is determined by satisfying a financial reporting measure performance goal, (iii) bonuses awarded based solely on 
 3 

Executive Compensation Recoupment Policy 

completion of a specified period of service, (iv) bonuses awarded based solely on subjective standards, strategic measures, or operational measures, or (v) equity awards for which the grant is not contingent upon achieving any financial reporting measure performance goal and vesting is contingent solely upon completion of a specified service period and or attaining one or more nonfinancial reporting measures. 
 
 (f) Incentive-Based Compensation will be deemed to have been received during the fiscal period during which the financial reporting measure specified in the compensation award is attained, even if the grant or payment of such Incentive-Based Compensation occurs after the end of such fiscal period. 
 
 (g) Restatement means an accounting restatement of the Company s financial statements due to the Company s material non-compliance with any financial reporting requirement under the U.S. federal securities laws, including any required accounting restatement to correct an error in previously issued financial statements that is material to the previously issued financial statements (often referred to as a Big R restatement), or that would result in a material misstatement if the correction of the error was recognized in the current period or left uncorrected in the current period (often referred to as a little R restatement). 
 
 (h) Restatement Date means the earlier of (i) the date the Board, a Board committee, or officer(s) authorized to take such action if Board action is not required, concludes, or reasonably should have concluded, that a Restatement is required, or (ii) the date a court, regulator, or other legally authorized body directs the Company to undertake a Restatement. For purposes of clause (ii), the date of the initial court order or other regulatory agency action would be the measurement date for the Clawback Period, but the application of this Policy would occur only after such order is final and non-appealable.
