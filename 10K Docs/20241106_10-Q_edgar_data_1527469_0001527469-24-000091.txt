 Term or Acronym Definition Net invested assets Represent the investments that directly back our net reserve liabilities as well as surplus assets. Net invested assets include (a) total investments on the condensed consolidated balance sheets, with available-for-sale securities, trading securities and mortgage loans at cost or amortized cost, excluding derivatives, (b) cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash, (c) investments in related parties, (d) accrued investment income, (e) VIE assets, liabilities and noncontrolling interest adjustments, (f) net investment payables and receivables, (g) policy loans ceded (which offset the direct policy loans in total investments) and (h) an adjustment for the allowance for credit losses. Net invested assets exclude the derivative collateral offsetting the related cash positions. We include the investments supporting assumed funds withheld and modco agreements and exclude the investments related to ceded reinsurance transactions in order to match the assets with the income received. Net invested assets include our economic ownership of ACRA investments but do not include the investments associated with the noncontrolling interests. Net investment earned rate Computed as the income from our net invested assets divided by the average net invested assets for the relevant period, presented on an annualized basis for interim periods. The adjustments to net investment income to arrive at our net investment earnings add (a) alternative investment gains and losses, (b) gains and losses related to certain equity securities, (c) net VIE impacts (revenues, expenses and noncontrolling interest), (d) forward points gains and losses on foreign exchange derivative hedges, (e) amortization of premium/discount on held-for-trading securities and (f) the change in fair value of reinsurance assets, and remove the proportionate share of the ACRA net investment income associated with the noncontrolling interests. Net investment earned rate includes the income and assets supporting our change in fair value of reinsurance assets by evaluating the underlying investments of the funds withheld at interest receivables and including the net investment income from those underlying investments which does not correspond to the US GAAP presentation of change in fair value of reinsurance assets. Net investment earned rate excludes the income and assets on business related to ceded reinsurance transactions. Net investment spread Net investment spread measures our investment performance plus our strategic capital management fees less our total cost of funds, presented on an annualized basis for interim periods. Net reserve liabilities Represent our policyholder liability obligations net of reinsurance and used to analyze the costs of our liabilities. Net reserve liabilities include (a) interest sensitive contract liabilities, (b) future policy benefits, (c) net market risk benefits, (d) long-term repurchase obligations, (e) dividends payable to policyholders and (f) other policy claims and benefits, offset by reinsurance recoverable, excluding policy loans ceded. Net reserve liabilities include our economic ownership of ACRA reserve liabilities but do not include the reserve liabilities associated with the noncontrolling interests. Net reserve liabilities are net of the ceded liabilities to third-party reinsurers as the costs of the liabilities are passed to such reinsurers and, therefore, we have no net economic exposure to such liabilities, assuming our reinsurance counterparties perform under our agreements. Net reserve liabilities include the underlying liabilities assumed through modco reinsurance agreements in order to match the liabilities with the expenses incurred. Payout annuities Annuities with a current cash payment component, which consist primarily of single premium immediate annuities, supplemental contracts and structured settlements Policy loan A loan to a policyholder under the terms of, and which is secured by, a policyholder s policy RBC Risk-based capital RILA Registered index-linked annuity, which is an insurance contract similar to an FIA that has the potential for higher returns but also has the potential risk of loss to principal and related earnings, subject to a floor RMBS Residential mortgage-backed securities RML Residential mortgage loan Sales All money paid into an individual annuity, including money paid into new contracts with initial purchase occurring in the specified period and existing contracts with initial purchase occurring prior to the specified period (excluding internal transfers) Spread Related Earnings, or SRE Pre-tax non-GAAP measure used to evaluate our financial performance excluding market volatility (other than with respect to alternative investments) as well as integration, restructuring, stock compensation and certain other expenses which are not part of our underlying profitability drivers.

 The unrealized losses on AFS securities can primarily be attributed to changes in market interest rates since the application of pushdown accounting or acquisition. We did not recognize the unrealized losses in income, unless as required for hedge accounting, as we intend to hold these securities and it is not more likely than not we will be required to sell a security before the recovery of its amortized cost.

 We primarily invest in commercial mortgage loans on income producing properties, including office and retail buildings, apartments, hotels, and industrial properties. We diversify the commercial mortgage loan portfolio by geographic region and property type to reduce concentration risk. We evaluate mortgage loans based on relevant current information to confirm if properties are performing at a consistent and acceptable level to secure the related debt.

Investment Funds Our investment fund portfolio strategy primarily focuses on core holdings of strategic origination and retirement services platforms, equity and credit funds, and other funds. Strategic origination platforms include investments sourced by affiliated platforms that originate loans to third parties and in which we gain exposure directly to the loan or indirectly through our ownership of the origination platform and/or securitizations of assets originated by the origination platform. Retirement services platforms include investments in equity of financial services companies. Our credit strategy comprises direct origination, asset-backed, multi credit and opportunistic credit funds focused on generating returns through high-quality credit underwriting and origination. Our equity strategy comprises private equity, hybrid value, secondaries equity, real estate equity, impact investing platform, infrastructure and clean transition equity funds that raise capital from investors to pursue control-oriented investments across the universe of private assets. Our investment funds can meet the definition of a VIE, which are discussed further in Note 4 Variable Interest Entities . Our investment funds do not specify timing of distributions on the funds underlying assets.

 Derivatives Designated as Hedges 
 
 Cash Flow Hedges We use interest rate swaps to convert floating-rate interest payments to fixed-rate interest payments to reduce exposure to interest rate changes. The interest rate swaps will expire by July 2031. During the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, we recognized gains of million and million, respectively, in other comprehensive income (OCI) associated with these hedges. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, we recognized gains of million and losses of million, respectively, in OCI associated with these hedges. There were amounts deemed ineffective during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. As of September 30, 2024, amounts were expected to be reclassified to income within the next 12 months. 
 
 Fair Value Hedges We use foreign currency forward contracts, foreign currency swaps, foreign currency interest rate swaps and interest rate swaps that are designated and accounted for as fair value hedges to hedge certain exposures to foreign currency risk and interest rate risk. The foreign currency forward price is agreed upon at the time of the contract and payment is made at a specified future date.

These derivatives are included in foreign currency translation and other adjustments on the condensed consolidated statements of comprehensive income (loss). As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the cumulative foreign currency translations recorded in AOCI related to these net investment hedges were gains of million and million, respectively. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 , there were amounts deemed ineffective. 
 
 Derivatives Not Designated as Hedges 
 
 Equity options We use equity indexed options to economically hedge fixed indexed annuity products that guarantee the return of principal to the policyholder and credit interest based on a percentage of the gain in a specified market index, primarily the S P 500. To hedge against adverse changes in equity indices, we enter into contracts to buy equity indexed options. The contracts are net settled in cash based on differentials in the indices at the time of exercise and the strike price. 
 
 Futures Futures contracts are purchased to hedge the growth in interest credited to the customer as a direct result of increases in the related indices. We enter into exchange-traded futures with regulated futures commission clearing brokers who are members of a trading exchange. Under exchange-traded futures contracts, we agree to purchase a specified number of contracts with other parties and to post variation margin on a daily basis in an amount equal to the difference in the daily fair values of those contracts. 
 
 Interest rate swaps We use interest rate swaps to reduce market risks from interest rate changes and to alter interest rate exposure arising from duration mismatches between assets and liabilities. With an interest rate swap, we agree with another party to exchange the difference between fixed-rate and floating-rate interest amounts tied to an agreed-upon notional principal amount at specified intervals. 
 
 Other swaps Other swaps include total return swaps, credit default swaps and swaptions. We purchase total rate of return swaps to gain exposure and benefit from a reference asset or index without ownership. Credit default swaps provide a measure of protection against the default of an issuer or allow us to gain credit exposure to an issuer or traded index. We use credit default swaps coupled with a bond to synthetically create the characteristics of a reference bond. Swaptions provide an option to enter into an interest rate swap and are used to hedge against interest rate exposure. 
 
 Embedded derivatives We have embedded derivatives which are required to be separated from their host contracts and reported as derivatives. Host contracts include reinsurance agreements structured on a modco or funds withheld basis and indexed annuity products.

 ) ) ) Total gains (losses) on derivatives not designated as hedges ) ) 1 Included in interest sensitive contract benefits on the condensed consolidated statements of income. 

Credit Risk We may be exposed to credit-related losses in the event of counterparty nonperformance on derivative financial instruments. Generally, the current credit exposure of our derivative contracts is the fair value at the reporting date less any collateral received from the counterparty. 
 
 We manage credit risk related to over-the-counter derivatives by entering into transactions with creditworthy counterparties. Where possible, we maintain collateral arrangements and use master netting agreements that provide for a single net payment from one counterparty to another at each due date and upon termination. We have also established counterparty exposure limits, where possible, in order to evaluate if there is sufficient collateral to support the net exposure. 
 
 Collateral arrangements typically require the posting of collateral in connection with its derivative instruments. Collateral agreements often contain posting thresholds, some of which may vary depending on the posting party s financial strength ratings. Additionally, a decrease in our financial strength rating to a specified level can result in settlement of the derivative position.

 Significant Unobservable Inputs Significant unobservable inputs occur when we cannot obtain or corroborate the quantitative detail of the inputs. This applies to fixed maturity securities, equity securities, mortgage loans and certain investment funds, as well as embedded derivatives in liabilities. Additional significant unobservable inputs are described below. 
 
 AFS, trading and equity securities We use discounted cash flow models to calculate the fair value for certain fixed maturity and equity securities. The discount rate is a significant unobservable input because the credit spread includes adjustments made to the base rate. The base rate represents a market comparable rate for securities with similar characteristics. This excludes assets for which fair value is provided by independent broker quotes, but includes assets for which fair value is provided by affiliated quotes. 
 
 Mortgage loans We use discounted cash flow models from independent commercial pricing services to calculate the fair value of our mortgage loan portfolio. The discount rate is a significant unobservable input. This approach uses market transaction information and client portfolio-oriented information, such as prepayments or defaults, to support the valuations. 
 
 Investment funds We use various methods of valuing our investment funds from both independent pricing services and affiliated modeling.

 Deferred costs related to universal life-type policies and investment contracts with significant revenue streams from sources other than investment of the policyholder funds, including traditional deferred annuities and indexed annuities, are amortized on a constant-level basis for a cohort of contracts using initial premium or deposit. Significant inputs and assumptions are required for determining the expected duration of the cohort and involves using accepted actuarial methods to determine decrement rates related to policyholder behavior for lapses, withdrawals (surrenders) and mortality. The assumptions used to determine the amortization of DAC and DSI are consistent with those used to estimate the related liability balance. 
 
 Deferred costs related to investment contracts without significant revenue streams from sources other than investment of policyholder funds are amortized using the effective interest method, which primarily includes funding agreements. The effective interest method requires inputs to project future cash flows, which for funding agreements includes contractual terms of notional value, periodic interest payments based on either fixed or floating interest rates, and duration. For other investment-type contracts which include immediate annuities and assumed endowments without significant mortality risks, assumptions are required related to policyholder behavior for lapses and withdrawals (surrenders).

The following is a reconciliation of market risk benefits to the condensed consolidated balance sheets. Market risk benefit assets are included in other assets on the condensed consolidated balance sheets.

 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, net market risk benefit liabilities increased by million, which was primarily driven by million of issuances, million in fees collected from policyholders, and million of interest accrual. 
 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2023, net market risk benefit liabilities increased by million, which was primarily driven by million in fees collected from policyholders, a million change in instrument-specific credit risk related to tightening of credit spreads and million of interest accrual, partially offset by a decrease of million related to changes in the risk-free discount rate across the curve. 
 
 The determination of the fair value of market risk benefits requires the use of inputs related to fees and assessments and assumptions in determining the projected benefits in excess of the projected account balance. Judgment is required for both economic and actuarial assumptions, which can be either observable or unobservable, that impact future policyholder account growth. 
 
 Economic assumptions include interest rates and implied volatilities throughout the duration of the liability. For indexed annuities, assumptions also include projected equity returns which impact cash flows attributable to indexed strategies, implied equity volatilities, expected index credits on the next policy anniversary date and future equity option costs. Assumptions related to the level of option budgets used for determining the future equity option costs and the impact on future policyholder account value growth are considered unobservable inputs. 
 
 Policyholder behavior assumptions are unobservable inputs and are established using accepted actuarial valuation methods to estimate withdrawals (surrender rate) and income rider utilization. Assumptions are generally based on industry data and pricing assumptions which are updated for actual experience, if necessary. Actual experience may be limited for recently issued products. 
 
 All inputs are used to project excess benefits and fees over a range of risk-neutral, stochastic interest rate scenarios. For indexed annuities, stochastic equity return scenarios are also included within the range. A risk margin is incorporated within the discount rate to reflect uncertainty in the projected cash flows such as variations in policyholder behavior, as well as a credit spread to reflect nonperformance risk, which is considered an unobservable input. We use our public credit rating relative to the US Treasury curve as of the valuation date to reflect our nonperformance risk in the fair value estimate of market risk benefits.

 The UK enacted legislation in July 2023 implementing certain provisions of the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development s Pillar Two global minimum tax initiative (Pillar Two) that will apply to multinational enterprises for accounting periods beginning on or after December 31, 2023. On February 22, 2024, the UK enacted certain amendments to its Pillar Two legislation which similarly take effect for accounting periods beginning on or after December 31, 2023. We are continuing to evaluate the potential impact on future periods of Pillar Two, pending legislative adoption by individual countries, as such legislative changes could result in changes to our effective tax rate. The Company evaluated the enacted legislation and concluded there was no material impact to the effective tax rate for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024. 
 
 On December 27, 2023, the Government of Bermuda enacted the Corporate Income Tax Act of 2023 (Bermuda CIT). Commencing on January 1, 2025, the Bermuda CIT will generally impose a 15 corporate income tax on in-scope entities that are resident in Bermuda or have a Bermuda permanent establishment, without regard to any assurances that have been given pursuant to the Exempted Undertakings Tax Protection Act 1966. We recorded material deferred tax assets as of December 31, 2023 as a result of the passage of the Bermuda CIT, primarily related to an estimated opening tax loss carryforward under Bermuda CIT. Throughout 2024, we will evaluate and record any applicable adjustments to these deferred tax assets. We evaluated the existing deferred tax assets and determined that no adjustments were necessary as of September 30, 2024.

Additionally, we pay a sub-allocation fee based on specified asset class tiers ranging from to of the book value of such assets, with the higher percentages in this range for asset classes that are designed to have more alpha generating abilities. Effective December 31, 2023, in addition to the base and sub-allocation fees specified above, we pay Apollo a target annual performance fee of million, with the amount of the annual performance fee ranging from between and of such target amount, based on our spread related earnings for the year relative to our targets, beginning with the performance period for the second half of 2023.

During the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, we incurred management fees, inclusive of the base, sub-allocation and performance fees, of million and million, respectively. Management fees are included within net investment income on the condensed consolidated statements of income. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, management fees payable were million and million, respectively, and are included in other liabilities on the condensed consolidated balance sheets. Such amounts include fees incurred attributable to Athene Co-Invest Reinsurance Affiliate Holding Ltd.

 In addition to the assets on our condensed consolidated balance sheets managed by Apollo, Apollo manages the assets underlying our funds withheld receivable. For these assets, the third-party cedants pay Apollo fees based upon the same fee construct we have with Apollo. Such fees directly reduce the settlement payments that we receive from the third-party cedant and, as such, we indirectly pay those fees. Finally, Apollo charges management fees and carried interest on Apollo-managed funds and other entities in which we invest. Neither the fees paid by such third-party cedants nor the fees or carried interest paid by such Apollo-managed funds or other entities are included in the investment management fee amounts noted above.

Additionally, of the members of our board of directors (including Mr. Belardi) are employees of or consultants to Apollo. In order to protect against potential conflicts of interest resulting from transactions into which we have entered and will continue to enter into with the Apollo Group, our bylaws require us to maintain a conflicts committee comprised solely of directors who are not general partners, directors (other than independent directors of AGM), managers, officers or employees of any member of the Apollo Group.

 Apollo Aligned Alternatives Aggregator, L.P. (AAA) We consolidate AAA as a VIE and AAA holds the majority of our alternative investments portfolio. Apollo established AAA to provide a single vehicle through which investors participate in a portfolio of alternative investments, including those managed by Apollo. Additionally, we believe AAA enhances Apollo s ability to increase alternative assets under management (AUM) by raising capital from third parties, which allows us to achieve greater scale and diversification for alternatives. During the third quarter of 2024, AAA underwent a restructuring which resulted in a change in consolidation that reduced our noncontrolling interests by million and does not represent a withdrawal from AAA.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, pursuant to the cooperation agreement, Athora is only required to use its reasonable best efforts to cause its subsidiaries to adhere to the provisions set forth in the cooperation agreement and therefore Athora s ability to cause its subsidiaries to act pursuant to the cooperation agreement may be limited by, among other things, legal prohibitions or the inability to obtain the approval of the board of directors or other applicable governing body of the applicable subsidiary, which approval is solely at the discretion of such governing body. As of September 30, 2024 , we have not exercised our right of first refusal to reinsure liabilities ceded to Athora s insurance or reinsurance subsidiaries.

 Strategic Partnership We have an agreement pursuant to which we may invest up to billion in funds managed by Apollo entities (Strategic Partnership). This arrangement is intended to permit us to invest across the Apollo alternatives platform into credit-oriented, strategic and other alternative investments in a manner and size that is consistent with our existing investment strategy. Fees for such investments payable by us to Apollo would be more favorable to us than market rates, and consistent with our existing alternative investments, investments made under the Strategic Partnership require approval of ISG and remain subject to our existing governance processes, including approval by our conflicts committee where applicable. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we held million and million, respectively, of investments under the Strategic Partnership and these investments are typically included as investments of consolidated VIEs or related party investment funds on the condensed consolidated balance sheets.

 billion, of which billion is deferred until February 8, 2026, and billion is deferred until February 8, 2028. In March 2024, in connection with Atlas concluding its investment management agreement with CS, the deferred purchase obligation amount was reduced to billion. In addition, certain strategic investors have made equity commitments to Atlas which therefore obligates these investors for a portion of the deferred purchase obligation. This deferred purchase price is an obligation first of Atlas, and (as a result of additional guarantees provided by AAA, Apollo Asset Management, Inc. (AAM) and AHL) second of AAA, third of AAM, fourth of AHL and fifth of AARe. AARe and AAM have each issued an assurance letter to CS to guarantee the full amount. Our guarantees are not probable of payment, hence there are liabilities recorded for the guarantees on the condensed consolidated financial statements. 
 
 Guaranty Association Assessments Guaranty associations may subject member insurers, including us, to assessments that require the insurers to pay funds to cover contractual obligations under insurance policies issued by insurance companies that become impaired or insolvent. The assessments are based on an insurer s proportionate share of premiums written in that state during a specified one-year or three-year period for lines of business in which the impaired or insolvent insurer engaged, subject to prescribed limits. On December 30, 2022, the North Carolina Wake County Superior Court entered an Order of Liquidation (Liquidation Order) against Bankers Life Insurance Company (BLIC) and Colorado Bankers Life Insurance Company (CBLIC), which was affirmed by the North Carolina Court of Appeals on March 5, 2024. On April 9, 2024, GBIG Holdings, LLC (GBIG), the sole shareholder of BLIC and CBLIC, filed a Petition for Discretionary Review requesting the North Carolina Supreme Court review the decision by the North Carolina Court of Appeals to affirm the Liquidation Order. On July 11, 2024, GBIG filed a Motion to Withdraw its Petition for Discretionary Review. We are not a party to this litigation. The North Carolina Supreme Court granted the Motion to Withdraw on August 23, 2024, which makes the Liquidation Order effective on November 30, 2024. Shortly thereafter, guaranty associations began levying assessments and we expect those assessments to continue for the foreseeable future. As of September 30, 2024, we have recorded a liability of million, based on our current best estimate of these assessments. The actual amount of assessments levied against us during the year ended December 31, 2024 or in future years in connection with the BLIC and CBLIC insolvencies may vary from this estimate. We expect to recover million of assessments paid through future premium tax credits.

 Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 

Overview 
 
 We are a leading financial services company that specializes in issuing, reinsuring and acquiring retirement savings products designed for the increasing number of individuals and institutions seeking to fund retirement needs. AGM is the beneficial owner of 100 of our common stock and controls all of the voting power to elect members to our board of directors. We focus on generating spread income by combining our two core competencies of (1) sourcing long-term, persistent liabilities and (2) using the global scale and reach of Apollo s asset management business to actively source or originate assets with our preferred risk and return characteristics. Our steady and significant base of earnings generates capital that we opportunistically invest across our business to source attractively priced liabilities and capitalize on opportunities. 
 
 We have established a significant base of earnings and, as of September 30, 2024, have an expected annual net investment spread, which measures our investment performance plus strategic capital management fees less the total cost of our liabilities, of 1 2 over the estimated 8.4 year weighted-average life of our net reserve liabilities. The weighted-average life includes deferred annuities, pension group annuities, funding agreements, payout annuities, life insurance contracts and other products. 
 
 Our total assets have grown to 355.0 billion as of September 30, 2024. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we generated an annualized net investment spread of 1.76 . 
 
 The following table presents the inflows and outflows generated from our organic and inorganic channels as well as the breakout between Athene, the ACRA noncontrolling interests and third-party reinsurers:

 (8,158) (10,738) (26,333) (26,752) 1 Funding agreements are comprised of funding agreements issued under our FABN program, secured and other funding agreements, funding agreements issued to the FHLB and long-term repurchase agreements. 
 2 Gross outflows include full and partial policyholder withdrawals on deferred annuities, death benefits, pension group annuity benefit payments, payments on payout annuities, payments related to interest, maturities and repurchases of funding agreements and block reinsurance outflows. 
 3 Effective July 1, 2023, ALRe sold 50 of ACRA 2 s economic interests to ADIP II. Effective December 31, 2023, ACRA 2 repurchased a portion of its shares held by ALRe, which increased ADIP II s ownership of economic interests in ACRA 2 to 60 , with ALRe owning the remaining 40 of the economic interests. 
 4 During the first quarter of 2024, we entered into a modco reinsurance agreement with Catalina to cede a quota share of our retail deferred annuity business issued on or after January 1, 2024.

 Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 

Our organic channels, including retail, flow reinsurance and institutional products, provided gross inflows of 56.8 billion and 43.6 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, which were underwritten to attractive returns. Gross organic inflows increased 13.2 billion, or 30 from the prior year, reflecting the strength of our multi-channel distribution platform and our ability to quickly pivot into optimal and profitable channels as opportunities arise. Withdrawals on our deferred annuities, death benefits, pension group annuity benefit payments, payments on payout annuities, payments related to interest, maturities and repurchases of funding agreements and block reinsurance outflows (collectively, gross outflows), in the aggregate were 26.3 billion and 26.8 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The decrease in gross outflows of 419 million was primarily driven by the VIAC recapture transaction in the third quarter of 2023 as well as a decrease in outflows related to policies underlying certain reinsurance blocks compared to 2023, partially offset by an increase in funding agreement maturities in 2024 and an increase in annuity policies which have reached the end of the surrender charge periods in a higher rate environment. We believe that our credit profile, current product offerings and product design capabilities, as well as our growing reputation as both a seasoned funding agreement issuer and a reliable pension group annuity counterparty, will continue to enable us to grow our existing organic channels and source additional volumes of profitably underwritten liabilities in various market environments. We intend to continue to grow organically by expanding each of our retail, flow reinsurance and institutional distribution channels. We believe that we have the right people, infrastructure, scale and capital discipline to position us for continued growth. 
 
 Within our retail channel, we had fixed annuity sales of 27.8 billion and 21.9 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The increase in our retail channel was driven by record sales of our fixed indexed annuity (FIA) products as well as increased multi-year guaranteed annuity (MYGA) sales compared to 2023. Overall sales were strong across our bank, independent marketing organization (IMO) and broker-dealer channels, exhibiting strong sales execution, the current rate environment, growing product offerings and our continued expansion into large financial institutions. We have maintained our disciplined approach to pricing and our targeted underwritten returns. We aim to continue to grow our retail channel by deepening our relationships with our approximately 38 IMOs and with our growing network of 18 banks and 149 broker-dealers, collectively representing approximately 139,000 independent agents. Our strong financial position and diverse, capital-efficient products allow us to be dependable partners with IMOs, banks and broker-dealers as well as to consistently write new business. We expect our retail channel to continue to benefit from our credit profile, product launches and continuous product enhancements as we look to capture new potential distribution opportunities. We believe this can support sales growth at our targeted returns from increased volumes via existing IMO relationships and allow continued expansion of our bank and broker-dealer channels. 
 
 Within our flow reinsurance channel, we target reinsurance business consistent with our preferred liability characteristics, which provides us another opportunistic channel to source liabilities with attractive crediting rates. We generated inflows through our flow reinsurance channel of 4.5 billion and 7.7 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The decrease in our flow reinsurance channel from 2023 was primarily driven by continued increased competitive dynamics in the current year. We expect that our credit profile and our reputation as a solutions provider will help us continue to source additional reinsurance partners, which will further diversify our flow reinsurance channel. 
 
 Within our institutional channel, we generated inflows of 24.5 billion and 14.0 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The increase in our institutional channel was driven by higher funding agreement inflows, partially offset by lower pension group annuity inflows. We issued funding agreements in the aggregate principal amount of 23.6 billion and 4.9 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The increase in our funding agreement channel from the prior year was driven by record inflows related to a resurgence in FABN issuance, as well as an increase in secured and other funding agreement and FHLB issuances, in 2024 amid more favorable market conditions. Funding agreement inflows for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 consisted of 9.2 billion of FABN issuances, 7.6 billion of secured and other funding agreement issuances, 6.8 billion of FHLB issuances and no long-term repurchase agreement issuances. As of September 30, 2024, we had funding agreements outstanding of 23.0 billion under our FABN program, 14.1 billion of secured and other funding agreements, 13.0 billion with the FHLB and 2.7 billion of long-term repurchase agreements . We issued group annuity contracts in the aggregate principal amount of 871 million and 9.1 billion during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The decrease in our pension group annuity channel was primarily related to closing a 7.6 billion transaction, our largest single pension group annuity transaction to date, in the second quarter of 2023. The pension group annuity channel was also impacted by the competitive market environment, along with other factors, in 2024 . Since entering the pension group annuity market in 2017, we have closed 49 deals resulting in the issuance or reinsurance of group annuities of 52.6 billion with more than 555,000 plan participants as of September 30, 2024. We expect to grow our institutional channel by continuing to engage in pension group annuity transactions and programmatic issuances of funding agreements. 
 
 Our inorganic channel has contributed significantly to our growth through both acquisitions and block reinsurance transactions. We plan to continue to grow and diversify our business, both organically and inorganically, with a focus on international expansion, particularly in Asia. We believe our corporate development team, with support from Apollo, has an industry-leading ability to source, underwrite and expeditiously close transactions. With support from Apollo, we are a solutions provider with a proven track record of closing transactions, which we believe makes us the ideal partner to insurance companies seeking to restructure their business. We expect that our inorganic channel will continue to be an important source of profitable growth in the future. 
 
 To support our growth strategies and capital deployment opportunities, we established ACRA 1 as a long-duration, on-demand capital vehicle. We own 36.55 of the economic interests in ACRA 1, with the remaining 63.45 of the economic interests being owned by ADIP I, a series of funds managed by Apollo. During the commitment period, ACRA 1 participated in certain transactions by drawing a portion of the required capital for such transactions from third-party investors equal to ADIP I s proportionate economic interest in ACRA 1. The commitment period for ACRA 1 expired in August 2023.

 Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 

To further support our growth and capital deployment opportunities following the deployment of capital by ACRA 1, we funded ACRA 2 in December 2022 as another long-duration, on-demand capital vehicle. Effective July 1, 2023, ALRe sold 50 of its non-voting, economic interests in ACRA 2 to ADIP II for 640 million. Effective December 31, 2023, ACRA 2 repurchased a portion of its shares held by ALRe, which increased ADIP II s ownership of economic interests in ACRA 2 to 60 , with ALRe owning the remaining 40 of the economic interests. Effective October 1, 2024, ACRA 2 repurchased a portion of its shares held by ALRe, which increased ADIP II s ownership of economic interests in ACRA 2 to 63 , with ALRe owning the remaining 37 of the economic interests. ALRe holds all of ACRA 2 s voting interests. ACRA 2 participates in certain transactions by drawing a portion of the required capital for such transactions from third-party investors equal to ADIP II s proportionate economic interest in ACRA 2. 
 
 These stockholder-friendly, strategic capital solutions allow us the flexibility to simultaneously deploy capital across multiple accretive avenues, while maintaining a strong financial position. 
 
 Executing our growth strategy requires that we have sufficient capital available to deploy. We believe that we have significant capital available to support our growth aspirations. As of September 30, 2024, we estimate that we had approximately 8.4 billion in capital available to deploy, consisting of approximately 2.0 billion in excess equity capital, 2.9 billion in untapped leverage capacity (assuming an adjusted leverage ratio of not more than 30 , subject to maintaining a sufficient level of capital required to maintain our desired financial strength ratings from rating agencies), and 3.5 billion in available undrawn capital at ACRA. 
 
 Athene Annuity Life Company (AAIA) and Athene Annuity Life Assurance Company (AADE) Merger 
 As discussed previously in our 2023 Annual Report, on December 20, 2023, AAIA and AADE executed an agreement and plan of merger. On October 11, 2024, AADE merged with and into AAIA, with AAIA as the surviving entity following the receipt of all required regulatory approvals. The merger was completed to streamline the Company s operational processes, enhance operational efficiency, and reduce administrative costs. 

Industry Trends and Competition 
 
 Economic and Market Conditions 
 
 As a leading financial services company specializing in retirement services, we are affected by the condition of global financial markets and the economy. Price fluctuations within equity, credit, commodity and foreign exchange markets, as well as interest rates and global inflation, which may be volatile and mixed across geographies, can significantly impact the performance of our business, including, but not limited to, the valuation of investments, and related income we may recognize. 
 
 Adverse economic conditions may result from domestic and global economic and political developments, including plateauing or decreasing economic growth and business activity, civil unrest, geopolitical tensions or military action, such as the armed conflicts in the Middle East and between Ukraine and Russia, and corresponding sanctions imposed on Russia by the United States and other countries, and new or evolving legal and regulatory requirements on business investment, hiring, migration, labor supply and global supply chains. 
 
 We carefully monitor economic and market conditions that could potentially give rise to global market volatility and affect our business operations, investment portfolios and derivatives, which includes global inflation. US inflation has continued to ease in 2024 with the US Bureau of Labor Statistics reporting the annual US inflation rate decreased to 2.4 as of September 30, 2024, compared to 3.0 as of June 30, 2024. As a result of the continued decline in US inflation, in September 2024, the US Federal Reserve lowered the benchmark interest rate target range to 4.7 5 to 5.00 from a target range of 5.25 to 5.50 , marking the first cut in rates since the pandemic. 
 
 Equity market performance was strong during the third quarter of 2024. In the US, the S P 500 Index increased by 5.5 during the quarter, following an increase of 3.9 in the second quarter of 2024. In terms of economic conditions in the US, the Bureau of Economic Analysis reported real GDP increased at an annual rate of 2.8 in the third quarter of 2024, following an increase of 3.0 in the second quarter of 2024. As of October 2024, the International Monetary Fund estimated that the US economy will expand by 2.8 in 2024 and 2.2 in 2025. The US Bureau of Labor Statistics reported that the US unemployment rate remained at 4.1 as of September 30, 2024. Oil finished the third quarter of 2024 down 16.4 from the second quarter of 2024. 
 
 Foreign exchange rates can materially impact the valuations of our investments and liabilities that are denominated in currencies other than the US dollar. The US dollar weakened in the third quarter of 2024 compared to the euro and Japanese yen. Relative to the US dollar, the euro appreciated 3.9 in the third quarter of 2024, after depreciating 0.7 in the second quarter of 2024. Relative to the US dollar, the Japanese yen appreciated 11.9 in the third quarter of 2024, after depreciating 5.9 in the second quarter of 2024. We generally undertake hedging activities to mitigate foreign exchange currency risk. 
 
 Interest Rate Environment 
 
 Rates decreased during the third quarter of 2024 with the US 10-year Treasury yield at 3.81 compared to 4.36 at the end of the second quarter of 2024, primarily due to the US Federal Reserve s decision to lower the benchmark interest rate target range by 50 basis points at its September meeting.

 Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 

Our investment portfolio consists predominantly of fixed maturity investments. See Investment Portfolio . If prevailing interest rates were to rise, we believe the yield on our new investment purchases may also rise and our investment income from floating rate investments would increase, while the value of our existing investments may decline. If prevailing interest rates were to decline significantly, the yield on our new investment purchases may decline and our investment income from floating rate investments would decrease, while the value of our existing investments may increase. 
 
 We address interest rate risk through managing the duration of the liabilities we source with assets we acquire through asset liability management (ALM) modeling. As part of our investment strategy, we purchase floating rate investments, which we expect would perform well in a rising interest rate environment and which we expect would underperform in a declining rate environment. We manage our interest rate risk in a declining rate environment through hedging activity or the issuance of additional floating rate liabilities to lower our overall net floating rate position. As of September 30, 2024, our net invested asset portfolio included 49.8 billion of floating rate investments, or 21 of our net invested assets, and our net reserve liabilities included 35.0 billion of floating rate liabilities at notional, or 15 of our net invested assets, resulting in 14.8 billion of net floating rate assets, or 6 of our net invested assets. 
 
 If prevailing interest rates were to rise, we believe our products would be more attractive to consumers and our sales would likely increase. If prevailing interest rates were to decline, it is likely that our products would be less attractive to consumers and our sales would likely decrease. In periods of prolonged low interest rates, the net investment spread may be negatively impacted by reduced investment income to the extent that we are unable to adequately reduce policyholder crediting rates due to policyholder guarantees in the form of minimum crediting rates or otherwise due to market conditions. See Note 7 Long-duration Contracts to the condensed consolidated financial statements for policyholder account balances by range of guaranteed minimum crediting rates and the related distance to those respective guaranteed minimums. The policyholder account balances represent deferred annuities, funding agreements and other investment-type products. A significant majority of our deferred annuity products have crediting rates that we may reset annually upon renewal, following the expiration of the current guaranteed period. While we have the contractual ability to lower these crediting rates to the guaranteed minimum levels, our willingness to do so may be limited by competitive pressures. Our funding agreements and other investment-type products, as well as our remaining liabilities associated with immediate annuities, pension group annuity obligations and life contracts, provide us little to no discretionary ability to change the rates of interest payable to the respective policyholder or institution. 
 
 See Part I Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risks in this report and Part II Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risks in our 2023 Annual Report, which include a discussion regarding interest rate and other significant risks and our strategies for managing these risks. 
 
 Demographics 
 
 Over the next four decades, the retirement-age population is expected to experience unprecedented growth. Technological advances and improvements in healthcare are projected to continue to contribute to increasing average life expectancy, and aging individuals must be prepared to fund retirement periods that will last longer than ever before. Further, many working households in the US do not have adequate retirement savings. As a tool for addressing the unmet need for retirement planning, we believe that many Americans have begun to look to tax-efficient savings products with low-risk or guaranteed return features and potential equity market upside. Our tax-efficient savings products are well positioned to meet this increasing customer demand. 
 
 Competition 
 
 We operate in highly competitive markets. We face a variety of large and small industry participants, including diversified financial institutions, insurance and reinsurance companies and private equity firms. These companies compete in one form or another for the growing pool of retirement assets driven by a number of external factors such as the continued aging of the population and the reduction in safety nets provided by governments and private employers. In the markets in which we operate, scale and the ability to provide value-added services and build long-term relationships are important factors to compete effectively. We believe that our leading presence in the retirement market, diverse range of capabilities and broad distribution network uniquely position us to effectively serve consumers increasing demand for retirement solutions, particularly in the fixed annuity market. 
 
 According to the Life Insurance and Market Research Association (LIMRA), total annuity market sales in the US were 216.6 billion for the six months ended June 30, 2024, a 19.6 increase from the same time period in 2023, as higher interest rates resulted in continued growth in the US annuity market. In the total annuity market, for the six months ended June 30, 2024 (the most recent period for which specific market share data is available), we were the largest provider of annuities based on sales of 18.7 billion, translating to an 8.6 market share. For the six months ended June 30, 2023, we were the largest provider of annuities based on sales of 15.5 billion, translating to an 8.5 market share. 
 
 According to LIMRA, total fixed annuity market sales in the US were 156.7 billion for the six months ended June 30, 2024, a 17.6 increase from the same time period in 2023. In the total fixed annuity market, for the six months ended June 30, 2024 (the most recent period for which specific market share data is available), we were the largest provider of fixed annuities based on sales of 18.2 billion, translating to an 11.6 market share. For the six months ended June 30, 2023, we were the largest provider of fixed annuities based on sales of 15.0 billion, translating to an 11.3 market share.

According to LIMRA, total fixed indexed annuity market sales in the US were 59.3 billion for the six months ended June 30, 2024, a 22.5 increase from the same time period in 2023. For the six months ended June 30, 2024 (the most recent period for which specific market share data is available), we were the largest provider of FIAs based on sales of 7.6 billion, translating to a 12.8 market share. For the six months ended June 30, 2023, we were the second largest provider of FIAs based on sales of 5.0 billion, translating to a 10.3 market share. 
 
 According to LIMRA, total registered indexed linked annuity (RILA) market sales in the US were 30.8 billion for the six months ended June 30, 2024, a 41.7 increase from the same time period in 2023. For the six months ended June 30, 2024 (the most recent period for which specific market share data is available), we were the tenth largest provider of RILAs based on sales of 568 million, translating to a 1.8 market share. For the six months ended June 30, 2023, we were the eleventh largest provider of RILAs based on sales of 420 million, translating to a 1.9 market share. We believe RILAs represent a significant growth opportunity for Athene. 

Key Operating and Non-GAAP Measures 
 
 In addition to our results presented in accordance with US GAAP, we present certain financial information that includes non-GAAP measures. Management believes the use of these non-GAAP measures, together with the relevant US GAAP measures, provides information that may enhance an investor s understanding of our results of operations and the underlying profitability drivers of our business. The majority of these non-GAAP measures are intended to remove from the results of operations the impact of market volatility (other than with respect to alternative investments), which consists of investment gains (losses), net of offsets, and non-operating change in insurance liabilities and related derivatives, both defined below, as well as integration, restructuring, stock compensation and certain other expenses which are not part of our underlying profitability drivers, as such items fluctuate from period to period in a manner inconsistent with these drivers. These measures should be considered supplementary to our results in accordance with US GAAP and should not be viewed as a substitute for the corresponding US GAAP measures. See Non-GAAP Measure Reconciliations for the appropriate reconciliations to the most directly comparable US GAAP measures. 
 
 Spread Related Earnings (SRE) 
 
 Spread related earnings is a pre-tax non-GAAP measure used to evaluate our financial performance including the impact of any reinsurance transactions and excluding market volatility and expenses related to integration, restructuring, stock compensation and other expenses. Our spread related earnings equals net income available to AHL common stockholder adjusted to eliminate the impact of the following: 
 
 Investment Gains (Losses), Net of Offsets Consists of the realized gains and losses on the sale of AFS securities, the change in fair value of reinsurance assets, unrealized gains and losses, changes in the provision for credit losses and other investment gains and losses. Unrealized, allowances and other investment gains and losses are comprised of the fair value adjustments of trading securities (other than certain equity tranche securities) and mortgage loans, investments held under the fair value option, derivative gains and losses not hedging FIA index credits, all foreign exchange impacts and the change in provision for credit losses recognized in operations net of the change in AmerUs Closed Block fair value reserve related to the corresponding change in fair value of investments. Investment gains and losses are net of offsets related to the market value adjustments (MVA) associated with surrenders or terminations of contracts. 
 
 Non-operating Change in Insurance Liabilities and Related Derivatives 
 
 Change in Fair Values of Derivatives and Embedded Derivatives FIAs Consists of impacts related to the fair value accounting for derivatives hedging the FIA index credits and the related embedded derivative liability fluctuations from period to period. The index reserve is measured at fair value for the current period and all periods beyond the current policyholder index term. However, the FIA hedging derivatives are purchased to hedge only the current index period. Upon policyholder renewal at the end of the period, new FIA hedging derivatives are purchased to align with the new term. The difference in duration between the FIA hedging derivatives and the index credit reserves creates a timing difference in earnings. This timing difference of the FIA hedging derivatives and index credit reserves is included as a non-operating adjustment. 
 
 We primarily hedge with options that align with the index terms of our FIA products (typically 1 2 years). On an economic basis, we believe this is suitable because policyholder accounts are credited with index performance at the end of each index term. However, because the term of an embedded derivative in an FIA contract is longer-dated, there is a duration mismatch which may lead to mismatches for accounting purposes. 
 
 Non-operating Change in Funding Agreements Consists of timing differences caused by changes to interest rates on variable funding agreements and funding agreement backed notes and the associated reserve accretion patterns of those contracts. Further included are adjustments for gains associated with our repurchases of funding agreement backed notes. 
 
 Change in Fair Value of Market Risk Benefits Consists primarily of volatility in capital market inputs used in the measurement at fair value of our market risk benefits, including certain impacts from changes in interest rates, equity returns and implied equity volatilities.

 Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 

Non-operating Change in Liability for Future Policy Benefits Consists of the non-economic loss incurred at issuance for certain pension group annuities and other payout annuities with life contingencies when valuation interest rates prescribed by US GAAP are lower than the net investment earned rates, adjusted for profit, assumed in pricing. For such contracts with non-economic US GAAP losses, the SRE reserve accretes interest using an imputed discount rate that produces zero gain or loss at issuance. 
 
 Integration, Restructuring, and Other Non-operating Expenses Consists of restructuring and integration expenses related to acquisitions and block reinsurance costs as well as certain other expenses, which are not predictable or related to our underlying profitability drivers. 
 
 Stock Compensation Expense Consists of stock compensation expenses associated with our share incentive plans, including long-term incentive expenses, which are not related to our underlying profitability drivers and fluctuate from time to time due to the structure of our plans. 
 
 Income Tax (Expense) Benefit Consists of the income tax effect of all income statement adjustments and is computed by applying the appropriate jurisdiction s tax rate to all adjustments subject to income tax. 
 
 We consider these adjustments to be meaningful adjustments to net income available to AHL common stockholder for the reasons discussed in greater detail above. Accordingly, we believe using a measure which excludes the impact of these items is useful in analyzing our business performance and the trends in our results of operations. Together with net income available to AHL common stockholder, we believe spread related earnings provides a meaningful financial metric that helps investors understand our underlying results and profitability. Spread related earnings should not be used as a substitute for net income available to AHL common stockholder. 
 
 Net Investment Spread 
 
 Net investment spread is a key measure of profitability used in analyzing the trends of our core business operations. Net investment spread measures our investment performance plus our strategic capital management fees, less our total cost of funds. Net investment earned rate is a key measure of our investment performance while cost of funds is a key measure of the cost of our policyholder benefits and liabilities. Strategic capital management fees consist of management fees received by us for business managed for others. 
 
 Net investment earned rate is a non-GAAP measure we use to evaluate the performance of our net invested assets. Net investment earned rate is computed as the income from our net invested assets divided by the average net invested assets, for the relevant period. To enhance the ability to analyze these measures across periods, interim periods are annualized. The adjustments to net investment income to arrive at our net investment earnings add (a) alternative investment gains and losses, (b) gains and losses related to certain equity securities, (c) net VIE impacts (revenues, expenses and noncontrolling interests), (d) forward points gains and losses on foreign exchange derivative hedges, (e) amortization of premium/discount on held-for-trading securities and (f) the change in fair value of reinsurance assets, and remove the proportionate share of the ACRA net investment income associated with the noncontrolling interests. We include the income and assets supporting our change in fair value of reinsurance assets by evaluating the underlying investments of the funds withheld at interest receivables and we include the net investment income from those underlying investments which does not correspond to the US GAAP presentation of change in fair value of reinsurance assets. We exclude the income and assets on business related to ceded reinsurance transactions. We believe the adjustments for reinsurance provide a net investment earned rate on the assets for which we have economic exposure. We believe a measure like net investment earned rate is useful in analyzing the trends of our core business operations, profitability and pricing discipline. While we believe net investment earned rate is a meaningful financial metric and enhances our understanding of the underlying profitability drivers of our business, it should not be used as a substitute for net investment income presented under US GAAP. 
 
 Cost of funds includes liability costs related to cost of crediting on both deferred annuities and institutional products as well as other liability costs, but does not include the proportionate share of the ACRA cost of funds associated with the noncontrolling interests. Cost of crediting on deferred annuities is the interest credited to the policyholders on our fixed strategies as well as the option costs on the indexed annuity strategies. With respect to FIAs, the cost of providing index credits includes the expenses incurred to fund the annual index credits, and where applicable, minimum guaranteed interest credited. Cost of crediting on institutional products is comprised of (1) pension group annuity costs, including interest credited, benefit payments and other reserve changes, net of premiums received when issued, and (2) funding agreement costs, including the interest payments and other reserve changes. Additionally, cost of crediting includes forward points gains and losses on foreign exchange derivative hedges. Other liability costs include DAC, DSI and VOBA amortization, certain market risk benefit costs, the cost of liabilities on products other than deferred annuities and institutional products, premiums and certain product charges and other revenues. We include the costs related to business added through assumed reinsurance transactions and exclude the costs on business related to ceded reinsurance transactions. Cost of funds is computed as the total liability costs divided by the average net invested assets for the relevant period. To enhance the ability to analyze these measures across periods, interim periods are annualized. We believe a measure like cost of funds is useful in analyzing the trends of our core business operations, profitability and pricing discipline. While we believe cost of funds is a meaningful financial metric and enhances our understanding of the underlying profitability drivers of our business, it should not be used as a substitute for total benefits and expenses presented under US GAAP.

Other Operating Expense s 
 
 Other operating expenses excludes interest expense, policy acquisition expenses, net of deferrals, integration, restructuring and other non-operating expenses, stock compensation and long-term incentive plan expenses and the proportionate share of the ACRA operating expenses associated with the noncontrolling interests. We believe a measure like other operating expenses is useful in analyzing the trends of our core business operations and profitability. While we believe other operating expenses is a meaningful financial metric and enhances our understanding of the underlying profitability drivers of our business, it should not be used as a substitute for policy and other operating expenses presented under US GAAP. 
 
 Adjusted Senior Debt-to-Capital Ratio 
 
 Adjusted senior debt-to-capital ratio is a non-GAAP measure used to evaluate our capital structure excluding the impacts of AOCI and the cumulative changes in fair value of funds withheld and modco reinsurance assets as well as mortgage loan assets, net of tax. Adjusted senior debt-to-capital ratio is calculated as senior debt at notional value divided by adjusted capitalization. Adjusted capitalization includes our adjusted AHL common stockholder s equity, preferred stock and the notional value of our total debt. Adjusted AHL common stockholder s equity is calculated as the ending AHL stockholders equity excluding AOCI, the cumulative changes in fair value of funds withheld and modco reinsurance assets and mortgage loan assets as well as preferred stock. These adjustments fluctuate period to period in a manner inconsistent with our underlying profitability drivers as the majority of such fluctuation is related to the market volatility of the unrealized gains and losses associated with our AFS securities, reinsurance assets and mortgage loans. Except with respect to reinvestment activity relating to acquired blocks of businesses, we typically buy and hold investments to maturity throughout the duration of market fluctuations, therefore, the period-over-period impacts in unrealized gains and losses are not necessarily indicative of current operating fundamentals or future performance. Adjusted senior debt-to-capital ratio should not be used as a substitute for the debt-to-capital ratio. However, we believe the adjustments to stockholders equity and debt are significant to gaining an understanding of our capitalization, debt utilization and debt capacity. 
 
 Adjusted Leverage Ratio 
 
 Adjusted leverage ratio is a non-GAAP measure used to evaluate our capital structure excluding the impacts of AOCI and the cumulative changes in fair value of funds withheld and modco reinsurance assets as well as mortgage loan assets, net of tax. Adjusted leverage ratio is calculated as total debt at notional value adjusted to exclude 50 of the notional value of subordinated debt as an equity credit plus 50 of preferred stock divided by adjusted capitalization. Adjusted capitalization includes our adjusted AHL common stockholder s equity, preferred stock and the notional value of our total debt. Adjusted AHL common stockholder s equity is calculated as the ending AHL stockholders equity excluding AOCI, the cumulative changes in fair value of funds withheld and modco reinsurance assets and mortgage loan assets as well as preferred stock. These adjustments fluctuate period to period in a manner inconsistent with our underlying profitability drivers as the majority of such fluctuation is related to the market volatility of the unrealized gains and losses associated with our AFS securities, reinsurance assets and mortgage loans. Except with respect to reinvestment activity relating to acquired blocks of businesses, we typically buy and hold investments to maturity throughout the duration of market fluctuations, therefore, the period-over-period impacts in unrealized gains and losses are not necessarily indicative of current operating fundamentals or future performance. Adjusted leverage ratio should not be used as a substitute for the leverage ratio. However, we believe the adjustments to stockholders equity and debt are significant to gaining an understanding of our capitalization, debt and preferred stock utilization and overall leverage capacity, because they provide insight into how rating agencies measure our capitalization, which is a consideration in how we manage our leverage capacity. 
 
 Net Invested Assets 
 
 I n managing our business, we analyze net invested assets, which does not correspond to total investments, including investments in related parties, as disclosed in our condensed consolidated financial statements and notes thereto. Net invested assets represent the investments that directly back our net reserve liabilities as well as surplus assets. Net invested assets is used in the computation of net investment earned rate, which allows us to analyze the profitability of our investment portfolio. Net invested assets include (a) total investments on the condensed consolidated balance sheets, with AFS securities, trading securities and mortgage loans at cost or amortized cost, excluding derivatives, (b) cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash, (c) investments in related parties, (d) accrued investment income, (e) VIE assets, liabilities and noncontrolling interest adjustments, (f) net investment payables and receivables, (g) policy loans ceded (which offset the direct policy loans in total investments) and (h) an adjustment for the allowance for credit losses. Net invested assets exclude the derivative collateral offsetting the related cash positions. We include the underlying investments supporting our assumed funds withheld and modco agreements and exclude the underlying investments related to ceded reinsurance transactions in our net invested assets calculation in order to match the assets with the income received. We believe the adjustments for reinsurance provide a view of the assets for which we have economic exposure. Net invested assets include our proportionate share of ACRA investments, based on our economic ownership, but do not include the proportionate share of investments associated with the noncontrolling interests. Our net invested assets are averaged over the number of quarters in the relevant period to compute our net investment earned rate for such period. While we believe net invested assets is a meaningful financial metric and enhances our understanding of the underlying drivers of our investment portfolio, it should not be used as a substitute for total investments, including related parties, presented under US GAAP.

Net Reserve Liabilities 
 
 In managing our business, we also analyze net reserve liabilities, which does not correspond to total liabilities as disclosed in our condensed consolidated financial statements and notes thereto. Net reserve liabilities represent our policyholder liability obligations net of reinsurance and are used to analyze the costs of our liabilities. Net reserve liabilities include (a) interest sensitive contract liabilities, (b) future policy benefits, (c) net market risk benefits, (d) long-term repurchase obligations, (e) dividends payable to policyholders and (f) other policy claims and benefits, offset by reinsurance recoverable, excluding policy loans ceded. Net reserve liabilities include our proportionate share of ACRA reserve liabilities, based on our economic ownership, but do not include the proportionate share of reserve liabilities associated with the noncontrolling interests. Net reserve liabilities are net of the ceded liabilities to third-party reinsurers as the costs of the liabilities are passed to such reinsurers and, therefore, we have no net economic exposure to such liabilities, assuming our reinsurance counterparties perform under our agreements. For such transactions, US GAAP requires the ceded liabilities and related reinsurance recoverables to continue to be recorded in our consolidated financial statements despite the transfer of economic risk to the counterparty in connection with the reinsurance transaction. We include the underlying liabilities assumed through modco reinsurance agreements in our net reserve liabilities calculation in order to match the liabilities with the expenses incurred. While we believe net reserve liabilities is a meaningful financial metric and enhances our understanding of the underlying profitability drivers of our business, it should not be used as a substitute for total liabilities presented under US GAAP. 
 
 Sales 
 
 Sales statistics do not correspond to revenues under US GAAP but are used as relevant measures to understand our business performance as it relates to inflows generated during a specific period of time. Our sales statistics include inflows for fixed rate annuities and FIAs and align with the LIMRA definition of all money paid into an individual annuity, including money paid into new contracts with initial purchase occurring in the specified period and existing contracts with initial purchase occurring prior to the specified period (excluding internal transfers). We believe sales is a meaningful metric that enhances our understanding of our business performance and is not the same as premiums presented in our condensed consolidated statements of income.

 In this section, references to 2024 refer to the three months ended September 30, 2024 and references to 2023 refer to the three months ended September 30, 2023. 
 
 Net Income Available to Athene Holding Ltd. Common Stockholder 
 
 Net income available to Athene Holding Ltd. common stockholder increased by 138 million, or 31 , to 580 million in 2024 from 442 million in 2023. The increase in net income available to Athene Holding Ltd. common stockholder was primarily driven by a 5.1 billion increase in revenues, partially offset by a 3.9 billion increase in benefits and expenses, a 1.0 billion increase in net income attributable to noncontrolling interests and a 29 million increase in income tax expense. 
 
 Revenues 
 
 Revenues increased by 5.1 billion to 6.5 billion in 2024 from 1.4 billion in 2023. The increase was primarily driven by an increase in investment related gains (losses), an increase in net investment income, an increase in premiums and an increase in VIE investment related gains (losses), partially offset by a decrease in other revenues.

 Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 

Investment related gains (losses) increased by 4.2 billion to 1.5 billion in 2024 from (2.6) billion in 2023 , primarily due to the favorable change in fair value of mortgage loans, FIA hedging derivatives, reinsurance assets and trading securities, partially offset by unfavorable net foreign exchange impacts. The change in fair value of mortgage loans increased 1.7 billion, the change in fair value of reinsurance assets increased 1.5 billion and the change in fair value of trading securities increased 144 million , primarily driven by a decrease in US Treasury rates in 2024 compared to an increase in 2023. The change in fair value of FIA hedging derivatives increased 1.6 billion, primarily driven by favorable performance of the equity indices upon which our call options are based. Th e largest percentage of our call options are based on the S P 500 index, which increased 5.5 in 2024, compared to a decrease of 3.6 in 2023. The unfavorable net foreign exchange impacts were primarily related to the weakening of the US dollar against foreign currencies in 2024 compared to 2023. 
 
 Net investment income increased by 849 million to 3.8 billion in 2024 from 2.9 billion in 2023, primarily driven by significant growth in our investment portfolio attributable to strong net flows during the previous twelve months and higher rates on new deployment in comparison to our existing portfolio related to the higher interest rate environment. These increases were partially offset by higher investment management fees driven by the significant growth in our investment portfolio. 
 
 Premiums increased by 363 million to 389 million in 2024 from 26 million in 2023 , primarily driven by a 294 million increase in pension group annuity premiums compared to 2023, as well as an increase in life premiums attributable to a block reinsurance transaction completed in the fourth quarter of 2023. 
 
 VIE investment related gains (losses) increased by 219 million to 469 million in 2024 from 250 million in 2023, primarily driven by unrealized gains on assets held by AAA and a favorable change in the fair value of mortgage loans held in VIEs related to a decrease in US Treasury rates in 2024 compared to an increase in 2023. 
 
 Other revenues decreased by 560 million to 4 million in 2024 from 564 million in 2023, primarily driven by the 555 million gain on the settlement of the VIAC recapture agreement in 2023. 
 
 Benefits and Expenses 
 
 Benefits and expenses increased by 3.9 billion to 4.8 billion in 2024 from 943 million in 2023. The increase was primarily driven by an increase in interest sensitive contract benefits, an increase in market risk benefits remeasurement (gains) losses, an increase in future policy and other policy benefits, an increase in policy and other operating expenses and an increase in DAC, DSI and VOBA amortization . Our annual unlocking of assumptions resulted in an increase in total benefits and expenses of 31 million compared to a decrease of 22 million in 2023. The 2024 unlocking was driven by an increase of 62 million in market risk benefits, an increase of 21 million related to DAC, DSI and VOBA and an increase of 8 million in interest sensitive contract benefits, partially offset by a decrease of 60 million in future policy and other policy benefits, compared to a decrease of 94 million in interest sensitive contract benefits and a decrease of 45 million in future policy and other policy benefits, partially offset by an increase of 81 million in market risk benefits and an increase of 36 million related to DAC, DSI and VOBA in 2023. 
 
 Interest sensitive contract benefits increased by 2.3 billion to 2.6 billion in 2024 from 333 million in 2023, primarily driven by an increase in the change in our fixed indexed annuity reserves, significant growth in our deferred annuity and funding agreement blocks of business, higher rates on new deferred annuity and funding agreement issuances in comparison to our existing blocks of business and an unfavorable change in unlocking. The change in our fixed indexed annuity reserves includes the impact from changes in the fair value of FIA embedded derivatives. The increase in the change in fair value of FIA embedded derivatives of 1.5 billion was primarily due to the performance of the equity indices to which our FIA policies are linked. The largest percentage of our FIA policies are linked to the S P 500 index, which increased 5.5 in 2024, compared to a decrease of 3.6 in 2023. The change in fair value of FIA embedded derivatives was also driven by the unfavorable change in discount rates used in our embedded derivative calculations as 2024 experienced a decrease in discount rates compared to an increase in 2023. These impacts were partially offset by the favorable impact of rates on policyholder projected benefits. The fair value of FIA embedded derivatives unlocking in 2024 was 67 million unfavorable primarily due to changes to projected interest crediting, while 2023 unlocking was 20 million favorable primarily due to changes to projected interest crediting, partially offset by an increase in lapse and risk margin assumptions. The negative VOBA unlocking related to our interest sensitive contract liabilities in 2024 was 59 million favorable mainly due to updated economics and an increase in lapse assumptions, while 2023 unlocking was 74 million favorable mainly due to an increase in lapse assumptions. 
 
 Market risk benefits remeasurement (gains) losses increased by 965 million to 524 million in 2024 from (441) million in 2023. The losses in 2024 compared to gains in 2023 were primarily driven by an unfavorable change in the fair value of market risk benefits, partially offset by a favorable change in unlocking. The change in fair value of market risk benefits was 1.0 billion unfavorable compared to 2023 due to a decrease in the risk-free discount rate across the curve, which is used in the fair value measurement of the liability for market risk benefits. This impact was partially offset by a favorable change in fair value of market risk benefits of 69 million related to the favorable equity market performance compared to 2023. The market risk benefits unlocking in 2024 was 62 million unfavorable primarily due to an increase in the income rider utilization assumption increasing projected claims, partially offset by favorable changes in lapse and enhanced income utilization assumptions, while 2023 unlocking was 81 million unfavorable primarily due to an increase in the income rider utilization assumption increasing projected claims, partially offset by favorable changes in lapse and income rider restart assumptions.

 Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 

Future policy and other policy benefits increased by 425 million to 793 million in 2024 from 368 million in 2023, primarily driven by a 294 million increase in pension group annuity obligations compared to 2023 and an increase in the change in the AmerUs Closed Block fair value liability, partially offset by a favorable change in unlocking . The change in the AmerUs Closed Block fair value liability was primarily due to a decrease in US Treasury rates in 2024 compared to an increase in 2023. Unlocking in 2024 was 60 million favorable consisting of 104 million of favorable future policy benefit reserve unlocking, partially offset by 44 million of unfavorable negative VOBA and deferred profit liability unlocking. The favorable unlocking primarily related to favorable projected mortality lowering future benefit payments, partially offset by an increase in the lump sum payment utilization assumption. Unlocking in 2023 was 45 million favorable consisting of 297 million of favorable future policy benefit reserve unlocking, partially offset by 252 million of unfavorable negative VOBA and deferred profit liability unlocking. The favorable unlocking primarily related to higher interest rates and favorable mortality experience lowering future benefit payments. 
 
 Policy and other operating expenses increased by 215 million to 687 million in 2024 from 472 million in 2023, primarily driven by the recognition of 172 million of expense related to estimated guaranty association assessments we expect to be levied against us in connection with the Bankers Life Insurance Company and Colorado Bankers Life Insurance Company insolvencies, as well as an increase in general operating expenses attributable to growth in the business. 
 
 DAC, DSI and VOBA amortization increased by 33 million to 244 million in 2024 from 211 million in 2023 , primarily due to growth in our retail channel, partially offset by lower VOBA amortization and a favorable change in unlocking. Unlocking in 2024 was 21 million unfavorable mainly related to changes to projected interest crediting and an increase in lapse assumptions, while unlocking in 2023 was 36 million unfavorable mainly related to an increase in lapse assumptions and changes to projected interest crediting. 
 
 Income Tax Expense 
 
 Income tax expense increased by 29 million to 191 million in 2024 from 162 million in 2023, primarily driven the favorable changes in the fair value of mortgage loans and reinsurance assets as well as the increase in net investment income, partially offset by an increase in income attributable to the noncontrolling interests, additional policyholder and other reserve liability costs and the gain on the settlement of the VIAC recapture agreement in 2023. Our effective tax rate in the third quarter of 2024 was 11 compared to 33 in 2023. The income tax expense was calculated by applying the 21 US statutory rate to the income of our US and foreign subsidiaries, net of noncontrolling interests. 
 
 Net Income (Loss) Attributable to Noncontrolling Interests 
 
 Net income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests increased by 1.0 billion to 859 million in 2024 from (155) million in 2023, primarily due to the favorable change in fair value of reinsurance assets related to a decrease in US Treasury rates in 2024 compared to an increase in 2023, an increase in income attributable to the ACRA 2 noncontrolling interest related to the 10 increase in ADIP II s ownership of ACRA 2 effective December 31, 2023, and a higher allocation of income to the AAA noncontrolling interest driven by the continued increase in the noncontrolling interest ownership of AAA .

 Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 

Investment related gains (losses) increased by 4.3 billion to 3.1 billion in 2024 from (1.2) billion in 2023 , primarily due to the change in fair value of FIA hedging derivatives, mortgage loans, reinsurance assets and trading securities, as well as a favorable change in the provision for credit l osses, partially offset by unfavorable net foreign exchange impacts. The change in fair value of FIA hedging derivatives increased 2.0 billion, primarily driven by the favorable performance of the equity indices upon which our call options are based. The largest percentage of our call options are based on the S P 500 index, which increased 20.8 in 2024, compared to an increase of 11.7 in 2023. The change in fair value of mortgage loans increased 1.6 billion, the change in fair value of reinsurance assets increased 1.0 billion and the change in fair value of trading securities increased 79 million primarily driven by a decrease in US Treasury rates in 2024 compared to an increase in 2023. The favorable change in the provision for credit losses of 123 million was primarily driven by intent-to-sell impairments in 2023 related to the timing of the recapture of certain business by VIAC and impacts from the Silicon Valley Bank failure. The unfavorable net foreign exchange impacts were primarily related to the weakening of the US dollar against foreign currencies in 2024 compared to 2023. 
 
 Net investment income increased by 2.5 billion to 10.6 billion in 2024 from 8.1 billion in 2023, primarily driven by significant growth in our investment portfolio attributable to strong net flows during the previous twelve months, higher rates on new deployment in comparison to our existing portfolio related to the higher interest rate environment and higher floating rate income. These increases were partially offset by higher investment management fees driven by the significant growth in our investment portfolio. 
 
 VIE investment related gains (losses) increased by 365 million to 1.1 billion in 2024 from 744 million in 2023, primarily driven by unrealized gains on assets held by AAA and a favorable change in the fair value of mortgage loans held in VIEs related to a decrease in US Treasury rates in 2024 compared to an increase in 2023. 
 
 Benefits and Expenses 
 
 Benefits and expenses decreased by 3.3 billion to 12.4 billion in 2024 from 15.7 billion in 2023. The decrease was primarily driven by a decrease in future policy and other policy benefits, partially offset by an increase in interest sensitive contract benefits, an increase in market risk benefits remeasurement (gains) losses, an increase in policy and other operating expenses and an increase in DAC, DSI and VOBA amortization . Our annual unlocking of assumptions resulted in an increase in total benefits and expenses of 31 million compared to a decrease of 22 million in 2023. The 2024 unlocking was driven by an increase of 62 million in market risk benefits, an increase of 21 million related to DAC, DSI and VOBA and an increase of 8 million in interest sensitive contract benefits, partially offset by a decrease of 60 million in future policy and other policy benefits, compared to a decrease of 94 million in interest sensitive contract benefits and a decrease of 45 million in future policy and other policy benefits, partially offset by an increase of 81 million in market risk benefits and an increase of 36 million related to DAC, DSI and VOBA in 2023. 
 
 Future policy and other policy benefits decreased by 7.9 billion to 2.4 billion in 2024 from 10.3 billion in 2023, primarily driven by an 8.2 billion decrease in pension group annuity obligation s compared to 2023 an d a favorable change in unlocking, partially offset by a 211 million increase in accrued interest and an increase in the change in the AmerUs Closed Block fair value liability. The increase in accrued interest was primarily attributable to a larger outstanding balance in 2024 compared to 2023. The change in the AmerUs Closed Block fair value liability was primarily due to a decrease in US Treasury rates in 2024 compared to an increase in 2023. Unlocking in 2024 was 60 million favorable consisting of 104 million of favorable future policy benefit reserve unlocking, partially offset by 44 million of unfavorable negative VOBA and deferred profit liability unlocking. The favorable unlocking primarily related to favorable projected mortality lowering future benefit payments, partially offset by an increase in the lump sum payment utilization assumption. Unlocking in 2023 was 45 million favorable consisting of 297 million of favorable future policy benefit reserve unlocking, partially offset by 252 million of unfavorable negative VOBA and deferred profit liability unlocking. The favorable unlocking primarily related to higher interest rates and favorable mortality experience lowering future benefit payments. 
 
 Interest sensitive contract benefits increased by 3.7 billion to 7.3 billion in 2024 from 3.6 billion in 2023, primarily driven by an increase in the change in our fixed indexed annuity reserves, significant growth in our deferred annuity and funding agreement blocks of business, higher rates on new deferred annuity and funding agreement issuances in comparison to our existing blocks of business, increased costs on floating rate funding agreements and an unfavorable change in unlocking. The change in our fixed indexed annuity reserves includes the impact from changes in the fair value of FIA embedded derivatives. The increase in the change in fair value of FIA embedded derivatives of 993 million was primarily due to the performance of the equity indices to which our FIA policies are linked. The largest percentage of our FIA policies are linked to the S P 500 index, which increased 20.8 in 2024, compared to an increase of 11.7 in 2023. The change in fair value of FIA embedded derivatives was also driven by the unfavorable change in discount rates used in our embedded derivative calculations as 2024 experienced a decrease in discount rates compared to an increase in 2023. These impacts were partially offset by the favorable impact of rates on policyholder projected benefits. The fair value of FIA embedded derivatives unlocking in 2024 was 67 million unfavorable primarily due to changes to projected interest crediting, while 2023 unlocking was 20 million favorable primarily due to changes to projected interest crediting, partially offset by an increase in lapse and risk margin assumptions. The negative VOBA unlocking related to our interest sensitive contract liabilities in 2024 was 59 million favorable mainly due to updated economics and an increase in lapse assumptions, while 2023 unlocking was 74 million favorable mainly due to an increase in lapse assumptions.

Market risk benefits remeasurement (gains) losses increased by 520 million to 354 million in 2024 from (166) million in 2023. The losses in 2024 compared to gains in 2023 were primarily driven by an unfavorable change in the fair value of market risk benefits, partially offset by a favorable change in unlocking. The change in fair value of market risk benefits was 573 million un favorable compared to 2023 due to a decrease in the risk-free discount rate across the curve, which is used in the fair value measurement of the liability for market risk benefits. This impact was partially offset by a favorable change in the fair value of market risk benefits of 89 million related to the favorable equity market performance compared to 2023. The market risk benefits unlocking in 2024 was 62 million unfavorable primarily due to an increase in the income rider utilization assumption increasing projected claims, partially offset by favorable changes in lapse and enhanced income utilization assumptions, while 2023 unlocking was 81 million unfavorable primarily due to an increase in the income rider utilization assumption increasing projected claims, partially offset by favorable changes in lapse and income rider restart assumptions. 
 
 Policy and other operating expenses increased by 294 million to 1.7 billion in 2024 from 1.4 billion in 2023, primarily driven by the recognition of 172 million of expense related to estimated guaranty association assessments we expect to be levied against us in connection with the Bankers Life Insurance Company and Colorado Bankers Life Insurance Company insolvencies, as well as an increase in general operating expenses attributable to growth in the business. 
 
 DAC, DSI and VOBA amortization increased by 176 million to 678 million in 2024 from 502 million in 2023 , primarily due to growth in our retail channel, partially offset by a favorable change in unlocking. Unlocking in 2024 was 21 million unfavorable mainly related to changes to projected interest crediting and an increase in lapse assumptions, while unlocking in 2023 was 36 million unfavorable mainly related to an increase in lapse assumptions and changes to projected interest crediting. 
 
 Income Tax Expense 
 
 Income tax expense increased by 201 million to 659 million in 2024 from 458 million in 2023, primarily driven by the favorable change in fair value of reinsurance assets and mortgage loans as well as an increase in net investment income, partially offset by an increase in income attributable to the noncontrolling interests, additional policyholder and other reserve liability costs and the gain on the settlement of the VIAC recapture agreement in 2023 . Our effective tax rate in 2024 was 15 compared to 18 in 2023. The income tax expense was calculated by applying the 21 US statutory rate to the income of our US and foreign subsidiaries, net of noncontrolling interests. 
 
 Net Income (Loss) Attributable to Noncontrolling Interests 
 
 Net income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests increased by 1.0 billion to 1.4 billion in 2024 from 354 million in 2023, primarily due to the favorable change in fair value of reinsurance assets related to a decrease in US Treasury rates in 2024 compared to an increase in 2023, an increase in income attributable to the ACRA 2 noncontrolling interest, which was established in the third quarter of 2023, with ADIP II increasing its ownership stake in ACRA 2 to 60 effective December 31, 2023, and a higher allocation of income to the AAA noncontrolling interest driven by the continued increase in the noncontrolling interest ownership of AAA.

Cost of funds increased 599 million, primarily driven by growth in and higher rates on new deferred annuity issuances, growth in and higher rates on new institutional business, including the additional costs of swapping to or issuing funding agreements as floating rate to mitigate SRE sensitivity to floating rate assets, an increase in business mix to institutional business at higher crediting rates and the 114 million operating gain on the settlement of the VIAC recapture agreement in 2023. These impacts were partially offset by a favorable change in unlocking as well as a favorable impact to pension group annuity balances related to a refinement in methodology. Unlocking, net of the noncontrolling interests, was favorable 16 million primarily related to favorable projected mortality lowering future benefit payments, updated economics and favorable changes in lapse and enhanced income utilization assumptions. These impacts were largely offset by an increase in the income rider utilization assumption increasing projected claims, an increase in the lump sum payment utilization assumption and changes to projected interest crediting. Unlocking, net of the noncontrolling interests, in 2023 was unfavorable 24 million primarily related to an increase in the income rider utilization assumption increasing projected claims. This impact was partially offset by favorable changes in lapse and income rider restart assumptions, as well as higher interest rates and favorable mortality experience lowering future benefit payments. 
 
 Interest and other financing costs increased 12 million related to interest expense on our debt issuances in the fourth quarter of 2023 and the first quarter of 2024, partially offset by lower interest expense resulting from a decrease in short-term repurchase agreements outstanding in 2024 compared to 2023. 
 
 Net investment earnings increased 577 million, primarily driven by 30.5 billion of growth in our average net invested assets, higher rates on new deployment compared to our existing portfolio related to the higher interest rate environment and an increase in alternative net investment income. The increase in alternative net investment income compared to 2023 was primarily driven by favorable performance within strategic origination platforms and credit, largely offset by less favorable performance within equity and retirement services platforms. The increase in income from strategic origination platforms was mainly attributable to a Wheels valuation increase in 2024, unfavorable performance from Aqua Finance, Inc. (Aqua Finance) in 2023 related to macroeconomic headwinds for consumer loan origination and favorable performance from other strategic origination platforms related to the funding of recent investments. The decrease in income from equity was largely driven by underperformance within private equity and real assets compared to 2023, while the decrease in income from retirement services platforms was primarily related to continued inflationary and regulatory pressures impacting the valuation of Athora. 
 
 Strategic capital management fees increased 8 million due to additional fees received from ADIP II related to new business ceded to ACRA 2 over the previous twelve months as well as the 10 increase in ADIP II s ownership of ACRA 2 effective December 31, 2023.

 Net investment spread decreased 30 basis points to 1.83 in 2024 from 2.13 in 2023, primarily driven by higher cost of funds, partially offset by a higher net investment earned rate. 
 
 Cost of funds increased 67 basis points to 3.34 in 2024 from 2.67 in 2023 , primarily driven by higher rates on new deferred annuity issuances, higher rates on new institutional business, including the additional costs of swapping to or issuing funding agreements as floating rate to mitigate SRE sensitivity to floating rate assets, an increase in business mix to institutional business at higher crediting rates and the 114 million operating gain on the settlement of the VIAC recapture agreement in 2023 . These impacts were partially offset by a favorable change in unlocking, as well as a favorable impact to pension group annuity balances related to a refinement in methodology. 
 
 Net investment earned rate increased 36 basis points to 5.12 in 2024 from 4.76 in 2023, primarily due to higher returns in both our fixed income and alternative investment portfolios. Fixed income and other net investment earned rate was 4.96 in 2024, an increase from 4.58 in 2023, primarily driven by higher rates on new deployment compared to our existing portfolio related to the higher interest rate environment. A lternative net investment earned rate was 8.19 in 2024, an increase from 7.75 in 2023, primarily driven by favorable performance within strategic origination platforms and credit, largely offset by less favorable performance within equity and retirement services platforms. The higher return on strategic origination platforms was mainly attributable to a Wheels valuation increase in 2024, unfavorable performance from Aqua Finance in 2023 related to macroeconomic headwinds for consumer loan origination and favorable performance from other strategic origination platforms related to the funding of recent investments. The lower return on equity was largely driven by underperformance within private equity and real assets compared to 2023, while the lower return on retirement services platforms was primarily related to continued inflationary and regulatory pressures impacting the valuation of Athora.

Adjustments to Net Income Available to Athene Holding Ltd. Common Stockholder 
 
 The adjustments to net income available to Athene Holding Ltd. common stockholder are comprised of investment gains (losses), net of offsets; non-operating change in insurance liabilities and related derivatives; inte gration, restructuring and other non-operating expenses; stock compensation expense and the non-operating income tax expense (benefit) related to these adjustments. The increase in adjustments to net income available to Athene Holding Ltd. common stockholder in 2024 compared to 2023 was primarily driven by an increase in investment gains (losses), net of offsets, partially offset by a decrease in non-operating change in insurance liabilities and related derivatives and an increase in integration, restructuring and other non-operating expenses . Our annual unlocking of assumptions, net of the noncontrolling interests, resulted in a decrease in our adjustments to net income (loss) available to AHL common stockholder of 11 million compared to an increase of 71 million in 2023. The 2024 unlocking was driven by 26 million unfavorable FIA embedded derivative unlocking, partially offset by 14 million favorable market risk benefits unlocking and 1 million favorable liability for future policy benefits unlocking, compared to 71 million favorable FIA embedded derivative unlocking in 2023. 
 
 Investment gains (losses), net of offsets, increased 1.3 billion, primarily due to the favorable changes in fair value of mortgage loans, reinsurance assets and trading securities, partially offset by the 441 million non-operating gain on the settlement of the VIAC recapture agreement in 2023, unfavorable net foreign exchange impacts and higher realized losses related to the sale of mortgage loans and corporate securities. The favorable changes in fair value of mortgage loans of 1.5 billion, reinsurance assets of 828 million and trading securities were primarily driven by a decrease in US Treasury rates in 2024 compared to an increase in 2023. The unfavorable net foreign exchange impacts were primarily related to the weakening of the US dollar against foreign currencies in comparison to 2023. 
 
 Non-operating change in insurance liabilities and related derivatives decreased 944 million, primarily due to the unfavorable change in fair value of market risk benefits and a decrease in net FIA derivatives. The 929 million unfavorable change in fair value of market risk benefits was primarily driven by a decrease in the risk-free discount rate across the curve, which is used in the fair value measurement of the liability for market risk benefits, partially offset by favorable equity market performance compared to 2023 and a favorable change in unlocking . The fair value of market risk benefits unlocking, net of the noncontrolling interests, in 2024 was 14 million favorable primarily due to updated economics, while 2023 unlocking resulted in no market risk benefit impacts. The 55 million unfavorable change in net FIA derivatives was primarily driven by the change in discount rates used in our embedded derivative calculations as 2024 experienced a decrease in discount rates compared to an increase in 2023, and an unfavorable change in unlocking, largely offset by the performance of the equity indices to which our FIA policies are linked and the favorable impact of rates on policyholder projected benefits. The largest percentage of our FIA policies are linked to the S P 500 index, which increased 5.5 in 2024, compared to a decrease of 3.6 in 2023. The fair value of FIA embedded derivative unlocking, net of the noncontrolling interests, in 2024 was 26 million unfavorable primarily due to changes to projected interest crediting, while 2023 unlocking was 71 million favorable primarily due to changes to projected interest crediting, partially offset by an increase in lapse and risk margin assumptions. 
 
 Integration, restructuring and other non-operating expenses increased 163 million, primarily due to the recognition of 172 million of expense related to estimated guaranty association assessments we expect to be levied against us in connection with the Bankers Life Insurance Company and Colorado Bankers Life Insurance Company insolvencies.

 SRE increased by 25 million, or 1 , to 2.4 billion in 2024 from 2.4 billion in 2023. The increase in SRE was primarily driven by higher net investment earnings, higher strategic capital management fees and lower interest and other financing costs, partially offset by higher cost of funds. 
 
 Net investment earnings increased 1.5 billion, primarily driven by 23.9 billion of growth in our average net invested assets, higher rates on new deployment compared to our existing portfolio related to the higher interest rate environment and higher floating rate income, partially offset by an increase in income attributable to the ACRA noncontrolling interests following the sale of a 50 interest in ACRA 2 to ADIP II effective July 1, 2023 and the subsequent increase in the ADIP II ownership of ACRA 2 to 60 effective December 31, 2023, as well as slightly lower alternative net investment income. The decrease in alternative net investment income compared to 2023 was primarily driven by less favorable performance within retirement services platforms and equity, largely offset by favorable performance within strategic origination platforms and credit. The decrease in income from retirement services platforms was primarily related to continued inflationary and regulatory pressures impacting the valuation of Athora, while the decrease in income from equity was largely driven by underperformance within private equity compared to 2023. The increase in income from strategic origination platforms was mainly attributable to a Wheels valuation increase in 2024, as well as unfavorable performance from Aqua Finance in 2023 related to macroeconomic headwinds for consumer loan origination, partially offset by outsized performance from MidCap Financial in 2023. 
 
 Strategic capital management fees increased 27 million due to additional fees received from ADIP II as a result of the sale of a 50 interest in ACRA 2 to ADIP II effective July 1, 2023 and the subsequent increase in the ADIP II ownership of ACRA 2 to 60 effective December 31, 2023, as well as new business ceded to ACRA 2 over the previous twelve months.

 Net investment spread decreased 22 basis points to 1.76 in 2024 from 1.98 in 2023, primarily driven by higher cost of funds, partially offset by a higher net investment earned rate. 
 
 Cost of funds increased by 62 basis points to 3.24 in 2024, from 2.62 in 2023 , primarily driven by higher rates on new deferred annuity issuances, higher rates on new institutional business, including the additional costs of swapping to or issuing funding agreements as floating rate to mitigate SRE sensitivity to floating rate assets, an increase in business mix to institutional business at higher crediting rates and the 114 million operating gain on the settlement of the VIAC recapture agreement in 2023 . These impacts were partially offset by an increase in costs attributable to the ACRA noncontrolling interests following the sale of a 50 interest in ACRA 2 to ADIP II effective July 1, 2023 and the subsequent increase in the ADIP II ownership of ACRA 2 to 60 effective December 31, 2023, as well as a favorable change in unlocking and a favorable impact to pension group annuity balances related to a refinement in methodology. 
 
 Net investment earned rate increased 39 basis points to 4.96 in 2024 from 4.57 in 2023, primarily due to higher returns in our fixed income portfolio and slightly favorable performance within our alternative investment portfolio, partially offset by an increase in income attributable to the ACRA noncontrolling interests following the sale of a 50 interest in ACRA 2 to ADIP II effective July 1, 2023 and the subsequent increase in the ADIP II ownership of ACRA 2 to 60 effective December 31, 2023 . Fixed income and other net investment earned rate was 4.82 in 2024, an increase from 4.40 in 2023, primarily driven by higher rates on new deployment compared to our existing portfolio related to the higher interest rate environment and higher floating rate income. A lternative net investment earned rate was 7.69 in 2024, an increase from 7.46 in 2023, as slightly lower income was earned on average alternative net invested assets that decreased 432 million compared to 2023. The slightly lower alternative net investment income compared to 2023 was primarily driven by less favorable performance within retirement services platforms and equity, largely offset by favorable performance within strategic origination platforms and credit. The lower return on retirement services platforms was primarily related to continued inflationary and regulatory pressures impacting the valuation of Athora, while the lower return on equity was largely driven by underperformance within private equity compared to 2023. The higher return on strategic origination platforms was mainly attributable to a Wheels valuation increase in 2024, as well as unfavorable performance from Aqua Finance in 2023 related to macroeconomic headwinds for consumer loan origination, partially offset by outsized performance from MidCap Financial in 2023.

Adjustments to Net Income Available to Athene Holding Ltd. Common Stockholder 
 
 The increase in adjustments to net income available to Athene Holding Ltd. common stockholder in 2024 compared to 2023 was primarily driven by an increase in investment gains (losses), net of offsets, partially offset by a decrease in non-operating change in insurance liabilities and related derivatives and an increase in integration, restructuring and other non-operating expenses . Our annual unlocking of assumptions, net of the noncontrolling interests, resulted in a decrease in our adjustments to net income (loss) available to AHL common stockholder of 11 million compared to an increase of 71 million in 2023. The 2024 unlocking was driven by 26 million unfavorable FIA embedded derivative unlocking, partially offset by 14 million favorable market risk benefits unlocking and 1 million favorable liability for future policy benefits unlocking, compared to 71 million favorable FIA embedded derivative unlocking in 2023. 
 
 Investment gains (losses), net of offsets, increased 1.3 billion, primarily due to the favorable changes in fair value of mortgage loans, reinsurance assets and trading securities as well as a favorable change in the provision for credit losses, partially offset by the 441 million non-operating gain on the settlement of the VIAC recapture agreement in 2023, unfavorable net foreign exchange impacts and higher realized losses related to the sale of mortgage loans and corporate securities. The favorable changes in fair value of mortgage loans of 1.4 billion, reinsurance assets of 557 million and trading securities were primarily due to a decrease in US Treasury rates in 2024 compared to an increase in 2023. The favorable change in the provision for credit losses of 135 million was primarily driven by intent-to-sell impairments in 2023 related to the timing of the recapture of certain business by VIAC and impacts from the Silicon Valley Bank failure. The unfavorable net foreign exchange impacts were primarily related to the weakening of the US dollar against foreign currencies in comparison to 2023. 
 
 Non-operating change in insurance liabilities and related derivatives decreased 237 million, primarily due to the unfavorable change in fair value of market risk benefits, partially offset by the increase in net FIA derivatives. The 523 million unfavorable change in fair value of market risk benefits was primarily driven by a decrease in the risk-free discount rate across the curve, which is used in the fair value measurement of the liability for market risk benefits, partially offset by favorable equity market performance compared to 2023 and a favorable change in unlocking. The fair value of market risk benefits unlocking, net of the noncontrolling interests, in 2024 was 14 million favorable primarily due to updated economics, while 2023 unlocking resulted in no market risk benefit impacts. The 206 million favorable change in net FIA derivatives was primarily driven by the performance of the equity indices to which our FIA policies are linked. The largest percentage of our FIA policies are linked to the S P 500 index, which increased 20.8 in 2024, compared to an increase of 11.7 in 2023. The change in net FIA derivatives was also driven by the favorable impact of rates on policyholder projected benefits, partially offset by the unfavorable change in discount rates used in our embedded derivative calculations as 2024 experienced a decrease in discount rates compared to an increase in 2023, and unfavorable unlocking. The fair value of FIA embedded derivative unlocking, net of the noncontrolling interests, in 2024 was 26 million unfavorable primarily due to changes to projected interest crediting, while 2023 unlocking was 71 million favorable primarily due to changes to projected interest crediting, partially offset by an increase in lapse and risk margin assumptions. 
 
 Integration, restructuring and other non-operating expenses increased 167 million, primarily due to the recognition of 172 million of expense related to estimated guaranty association assessments we expect to be levied against us in connection with the Bankers Life Insurance Company and Colorado Bankers Life Insurance Company insolvencies. 

Investment Portfolio 
 
 We had total investments, including related parties and consolidated VIEs, of 308.0 billion and 259.3 billion as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. Our investment strategy seeks to achieve sustainable risk-adjusted returns through the disciplined management of our investment portfolio against our long-duration liabilities, coupled with the diversification of risk. The investment strategies utilized by our investment manager focus primarily on a buy and hold asset allocation strategy that may be adjusted periodically in response to changing market conditions and the nature of our liability profile. Substantially all of our investment portfolio is managed by Apollo, which provides a full suite of services for our investment portfolio, including direct investment management, asset allocation, mergers and acquisitions asset diligence and certain operational support services, including investment compliance, tax, legal and risk management support. Our relationship with Apollo allows us to take advantage of our generally persistent liability profile by identifying investment opportunities with an emphasis on earning incremental yield by taking measured liquidity and complexity risk rather than assuming incremental credit risk. Apollo s investment team and credit portfolio managers utilize their deep experience to assist us in sourcing and underwriting complex asset classes. Apollo has selected a diverse array of primarily high-grade fixed income assets including corporate bonds, structured securities and commercial and residential real estate loans, among others. We also maintain holdings in floating rate and less rate-sensitive instruments, including CLOs, non-agency RMBS and various types of structured products. In addition to our fixed income portfolio, we opportunistically allocate approximately 5 of our portfolio to alternative investments where we primarily focus on fixed income-like, cash flow-based investments. 
 
 Net investment income on the condensed consolidated statements of income includes management fees under our investment management arrangements with Apollo. We incurred management fees, inclusive of base, sub-allocation and performance fees, of 327 million and 249 million, respectively, during the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, and 920 million and 703 million, respectively, during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, and 2023. The total amounts we incurred, directly and indirectly, from Apollo and its affiliates were 330 million and 275 million, respectively, for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, and 964 million and 836 million, respectively, for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, and 2023. Such amounts include (1) fees associated with investment management agreements (excluding sub-advisory fees paid to ISG for the benefit of third-party sub-advisors), which include fees charged by Apollo to third-party cedants with respect to assets supporting obligations reinsured to us but exclude fees charged by Apollo to third-party reinsurers supporting ceded obligations, (2) fees associated with fund investments (including those fund investments held by AAA), which include

management fees, carried interest (including unrealized but accrued carried interest fees) and other fees on Apollo-managed funds and our other alternative investments and (3) other fees resulting from shared services, advisory and other agreements with Apollo or its affiliates; net of fees incurred directly and indirectly attributable to ACRA, based upon the economic ownership of the noncontrolling interests in ACRA. 
 
 Our net invested assets, which are those that directly back our net reserve liabilities as well as surplus assets, were 242.7 billion and 217.4 billion as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. Apollo s knowledge of our funding structure and regulatory requirements allows it to design customized strategies and investments for our portfolio. Apollo manages our asset portfolio within the limits and protocols set forth in our Investment and Credit Risk Policy. Under this policy, we set limits on investments in our portfolio by asset class, such as corporate bonds, emerging markets securities, municipal bonds, non-agency RMBS, CMBS, CLOs, commercial mortgage whole loans and mezzanine loans and investment funds. We also set credit risk limits for exposure to a single issuer, which vary based on the issuer s ratings. Our strategic investments are also governed by our Strategic Investment Risk Policy which provides for special governance and risk management procedures for these transactions. In addition, our investment portfolio is constrained by its scenario-based capital ratio limits and its liquidity limits.

 The increase in our total investments, including related parties and consolidated VIEs, as of September 30, 2024 of 48.7 billion compared to December 31, 2023 was primarily driven by significant growth from gross organic inflows of 56.8 billion in excess of gross liability outflows of 26.3 billion, unrealized gains on AFS securities during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 of 3.8 billion, as well as unrealized gains on mortgage loans and reinsurance assets attributable to a decrease in US Treasury rates and credit spread tightening in 2024, and an increase in derivative assets primarily related to the impact of favorable equity market performance in 2024 on our call options. Additionally, total investments, including related parties and consolidated VIEs, increased due to the issuance of debt in the first quarter of 2024, reinvestment

of earnings and an increase in VIE investment funds attributable to favorable performance of the underlying assets within AAA in 2024 and net contributions from third-party investors into AAA, partially offset by our distribution of certain investments to AGM as a dividend and the resulting deconsolidation of Apollo Rose as a VIE. 
 
 Our investment portfolio consists largely of high quality fixed maturity securities, loans and short-term investments, as well as additional opportunistic holdings in investment funds and other instruments, including equity holdings. Fixed maturity securities and loans include publicly issued corporate bonds, government and other sovereign bonds, privately placed corporate bonds and loans, mortgage loans, CMBS, RMBS, CLOs and ABS. 
 
 While the substantial majority of our investment portfolio has been allocated to corporate bonds and structured credit products, a key component of our investment strategy is the opportunistic acquisition of investment funds with attractive risk and return profiles. Our investment fund portfolio consists of funds or similar equity structures that employ various strategies including equity and credit funds. We have a strong preference for alternative investments that have some or all of the following characteristics, among others: (1) investments that constitute a direct investment or an investment in a fund with a high degree of co-investment; (2) investments with credit- or debt-like characteristics (for example, a stipulated maturity and par value), or alternatively, investments with reduced volatility when compared to pure equity; or (3) investments that we believe have less downside risk. 
 
 We hold derivatives for economic hedging purposes to reduce our exposure to the cash flow variability of assets and liabilities, equity market risk, foreign exchange risk, interest rate risk and credit risk. Our primary use of derivative instruments relates to providing the income needed to fund the annual index credits on our FIA products. We primarily use fixed indexed options to economically hedge indexed annuity products that guarantee the return of principal to the policyholder and credit interest based on a percentage of the gain in a specific market index. We also use derivative instruments, such as forward contracts and swaps, to hedge foreign currency exposure resulting from foreign denominated assets and liabilities and to help manage our net floating rate position. 
 
 With respect to derivative positions, we transact with highly rated counterparties, and expect the counterparties to fulfill their obligations under the contracts. We generally use industry standard agreements and annexes with bilateral collateral provisions to further reduce counterparty credit exposure. 
 
 Related Party Investments 
 
 We hold investments in related party assets primarily comprised of AFS securities, trading securities, funds withheld at interest receivables, mortgage loans within our triple net lease investment, short-term investments, and investment funds, which primarily include investments over which Apollo can exercise influence. As of September 30, 2024, these investments totaled 45.9 billion, or 12.9 of our total assets. Related party AFS and trading securities primarily consist of structured securities for which Apollo is the manager of the underlying securitization vehicle and securities issued by Apollo direct origination platforms including Wheels and MidCap Financial. In each case, the underlying collateral, borrower or other credit party is generally unaffiliated with us. The funds withheld at interest related party amounts are comprised of the Venerable reinsurance portfolios, which are considered related party even though a significant majority of the underlying assets within the investment portfolios do not have a related party affiliation. Related party investment funds include strategic investments in direct origination and retirement services platforms and investments in Apollo managed funds. Short-term investments include reverse repurchase agreements in Atlas, which is owned by AAA. 
 
 A summary of our related party investments reflecting the nature of the affiliation is as follows:

As of September 30, 2024, a 5.4 billion funds withheld reinsurance asset with Venerable was included in our US GAAP related party investments. Venerable is a related party due to our minority equity investment in its holding company s parent, VA Capital. For US GAAP, each funds withheld and modified coinsurance reinsurance portfolio is treated as one asset rather than reporting the underlying investments in the portfolio. For our non-GAAP measure of net invested assets, we provide visibility into the underlying assets within these reinsurance portfolios. The below table looks through to the underlying assets within our reinsurance portfolios to determine the related party status. As of September 30, 2024, 31.2 billion, or 12.8 of our total net invested assets were related party investments. Of these, approximately 18.4 billion, or 7.6 of our net invested assets, were structured securities for which Apollo or an affiliated direct origination platform was the manager of the underlying securitization vehicle, but the underlying collateral, borrower or other credit party is generally unaffiliated with us. Related party investments in strategic affiliated companies or Apollo funds represented 12.8 billion, or 5.2 of our net invested assets.

AFS Securities 
 
 We invest in AFS securities and attempt to source investments that match our future cash flow needs. However, we may sell any of our investments in advance of maturity to timely satisfy our liabilities as they become due or to respond to a change in the credit profile or other characteristics of the particular investment. 
 
 AFS securities are carried at fair value, less allowances for expected credit losses, on our condensed consolidated balance sheets. Changes in fair value of our AFS securities are charged or credited to other comprehensive income (loss), net of tax. All changes in the allowance for expected credit losses, whether due to passage of time, change in expected cash flows, or change in fair value are recorded through the provision for credit losses within investment related gains (losses) on the condensed consolidated statements of income.

The fair value of our AFS securities, including related parties, was 182.6 billion and 148.3 billion as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. The increase was mainly driven by the deployment of strong organic inflows in excess of liability outflows as well as unrealized gains on AFS securities during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 of 3.8 billion attributable to a decrease in US Treasury rates and credit spread tightening in 2024. 
 
 The Securities Valuation Office (SVO) of the National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC) is responsible for the credit quality assessment and valuation of securities owned by state regulated insurance companies. Insurance companies report ownership of securities to the SVO when such securities are eligible for filing on the relevant schedule of the NAIC Financial Statement. The SVO conducts credit analysis on these securities for the purpose of assigning an NAIC designation and/or unit price. Generally, the process for assigning an NAIC designation varies based upon whether a security is considered filing exempt (General Designation Process). Subject to certain exceptions, a security is typically considered filing exempt if it has been rated by a Nationally Recognized Statistical Rating Organization (NRSRO). For securities that are not filing exempt, insurance companies assign temporary designations based upon a subjective evaluation of credit quality. The insurance company generally must then submit the securities to the SVO within 120 days of acquisition to receive an NAIC designation. For securities considered filing exempt, the SVO utilizes the NRSRO rating and assigns an NAIC designation based upon the following system: 
 NAIC designation NRSRO equivalent rating 1 A-G AAA/AA/A 2 A-C BBB 3 A-C BB 4 A-C B 5 A-C CCC 6 CC and lower

 Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 

An important exception to the General Designation Process occurs in the case of certain loan-backed and structured securities (LBaSS). The NRSRO ratings methodology is focused on the likelihood of recovery of all contractual payments, including principal at par, regardless of an investor s carrying value. In effect, the NRSRO rating assumes that the holder is the original purchaser at par. In contrast, the SVO s LBaSS methodology is focused on determining the risk associated with the recovery of the amortized cost of each security. Because the NAIC s methodology explicitly considers amortized cost and the likelihood of recovery of such amount, we view the NAIC s methodology as the most appropriate means of evaluating the credit quality of our fixed maturity portfolio since a portion of our holdings were purchased and are carried at significant discounts to par. 
 
 The SVO has developed a designation process and provides instruction on modeled LBaSS. For modeled LBaSS, the process is specific to the non-agency RMBS and CMBS asset classes. To establish ratings at the individual security level, the SVO obtains loan-level analysis of each RMBS and CMBS using a selected vendor s proprietary financial model. The SVO ensures that the vendor has extensive internal quality-control processes in place and the SVO conducts its own quality-control checks of the selected vendor s valuation process. The SVO has retained the services of Blackrock, Inc. (Blackrock) to model non-agency RMBS and CMBS owned by US insurers for all years presented herein. Blackrock provides five prices (breakpoints), based on each US insurer s statutory book value price, to utilize in determining the NAIC designation for each modeled LBaSS. 
 
 The NAIC designation determines the associated level of risk-based capital that an insurer is required to hold for all securities owned by the insurer. In general, under the modeled LBaSS process, the larger the discount to par value at the time of determination, the higher the NAIC designation the LBaSS will have.

With respect to modeled LBaSS, the NAIC designation methodology differs in significant respects from the NRSRO rating methodology. 

Consistent with the NAIC Process and Procedures Manual, an NRSRO rating was assigned based on the following criteria: (a) the equivalent S P rating when the security is rated by one NRSRO; (b) the equivalent S P rating of the lowest NRSRO when the security is rated by two NRSROs; and (c) the equivalent S P rating of the second lowest NRSRO when the security is rated by three or more NRSROs. If the lowest two NRSRO ratings are equal, then such rating will be the assigned rating. NRSRO ratings available for the periods presented were S P, Fitch, Moody s Investor Service, DBRS, and Kroll Bond Rating Agency, Inc. 
 
 The portion of our AFS portfolio that was considered below investment grade based on NRSRO ratings was 3.9 and 4.7 , as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. The primary driver of the difference in the percentage of securities considered below investment grade by NRSRO as compared to the securities considered below investment grade by the NAIC is the difference in methodologies between the NRSRO and NAIC for RMBS due to investments acquired and/or carried at a discount to par value, as previously discussed. 
 
 As of each of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, non-rated securities were comprised 64 of corporate private placement securities for which we have not sought individual ratings from an NRSRO, and 23 and 22 , respectively, of RMBS, many of which were acquired at a discount to par. We rely on internal analysis and designations assigned by the NAIC to evaluate the credit risk of our portfolio. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, 89 and 92 , respectively, of the non-rated securities were designated NAIC 1 or 2. 
 
 Asset-backed Securities We invest in ABS which are securitized by pools of assets such as consumer loans, automobile loans, student loans, insurance-linked securities, operating cash flows of corporations and cash flows from various types of business equipment. Our ABS holdings were 33.0 billion and 21.8 billion as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively.

The NAIC designation methodology differs in significant respects from the NRSRO rating methodology. 

As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, a substantial majority of our AFS ABS portfolio, 97.3 and 94.7 , respectively, was invested in assets considered to be investment grade based upon both the application of the NAIC s methodology and NRSRO ratings. The increase in our ABS portfolio was mainly driven by the deployment of strong organic inflows in excess of liability outflows as well as unrealized gains attributable to a decrease in US Treasury rates and credit spread tightening in 2024. 
 
 Collateralized Loan Obligations We also invest in CLOs which pay principal and interest from cash flows received from underlying corporate loans. These holdings were 33.4 billion and 24.5 billion as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively.

As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, 93.6 and 94.1 , respectively, of our AFS CMBS portfolio was invested in assets considered to be investment grade based upon application of the NAIC s methodology, while 91.3 and 88.8 , as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively, of securities were considered investment grade based upon NRSRO ratings. The increase in our CMBS portfolio was mainly driven by the deployment of strong organic inflows in excess of liability outflows as well as unrealized gains attributable to a decrease in US Treasury rates and credit spread tightening in 2024. 
 
 Residential Mortgage-backed Securities A portion of our AFS portfolio is invested in RMBS, which are securities constructed from pools of residential mortgages. These holdings were 8.1 billion and 7.6 billion as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively.

The NAIC designation methodology differs in significant respects from the NRSRO rating methodology. 

A significant majority of our RMBS portfolio, 92.5 and 91.1 as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively, was invested in assets considered to be investment grade based upon application of the NAIC s methodology. The NAIC s methodology with respect to RMBS gives explicit effect to the amortized cost at which an insurance company carries each such investment. Because we invested in RMBS after the stresses related to US housing had caused significant downward pressure on prices of RMBS, we carry some of our investments in RMBS at significant discounts to par value, which results in an investment grade NAIC designation. In contrast, our understanding is that in setting ratings, the NRSRO focuses on the likelihood of recovering all contractual payments including principal at par value. As a result of this fundamental difference in approach, NRSRO characterized 74.5 and 70.4 of our RMBS portfolio as investment grade as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. The increase in our RMBS portfolio was mainly driven by the deployment of strong organic inflows in excess of liability outflows as well as unrealized gains attributable to a decrease in US Treasury rates and credit spread tightening in 2024. 
 
 Unrealized Losses 
 
 Our investments in AFS securities, including related parties, are reported at fair value with changes in fair value recorded in other comprehensive income (loss). Certain of our AFS securities, including related parties, have experienced declines in fair value that we consider temporary in nature. These investments are held to support our product liabilities, and we currently have the intent and ability to hold these securities until recovery of the amortized cost basis prior to sale or maturity. As of September 30, 2024, our AFS securities, including related parties, had a fair value of 182.6 billion, which was 5.1 below amortized cost of 192.4 billion. As of December 31, 2023, our AFS securities, including related parties, had a fair value of 148.3 billion, which was 8.4 below amortized cost of 162.0 billion. Our fair value of AFS securities as of both September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 were below amortized cost due to the investment portfolio being marked to fair value on January 1, 2022 in conjunction with purchase accounting, with subsequent losses driven by the significant increase in US Treasury rates.

 The gross unrealized losses on AFS securities, including related parties, were 11.6 billion and 14.4 billion as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. The decrease in unrealized losses on AFS securities was primarily attributable to a decrease in US Treasury rates and credit spread tightening in 2024. 
 
 Provision for Credit Losses 
 
 For our credit loss accounting policies and the assumptions used in the allowances, see Note 1 Business, Basis of Presentation and Significant Accounting Policies and Note 2 Investments to the condensed consolidated financial statements . 
 
 As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we held an allowance for credit losses on AFS securities of 678 million and 591 million, respectively. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we recorded an increase in the allowance for credit losses on AFS securities of 87 million, of which 91 million had an income statement impact and (4) million related to PCD securities and other changes. The increase in the allowance for credit losses on AFS securities was primarily related to impacts from corporate securities and CMBS. During the nine months ended September 30, 2023, we recorded an increase in provision for credit losses on AFS securities of 120 million, of which 89 million had an income statement impact and 31 million related to PCD securities and other changes. The increase in the allowance for credit losses on AFS securities was primarily related to impacts from the Silicon Valley Bank failure and deterioration in China s residential real estate market. The intent-to-sell impairments for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 were 24 million and 148 million, respectively. The decrease in our intent-to-sell impairments was primarily driven by the timing of the recapture of certain business by VIAC and impacts from the Silicon Valley Bank failure in 2023.

International Exposure 
 
 A portion of our AFS securities is invested in securities with international exposure. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, 38 and 34 , respectively, of the carrying value of our AFS securities, including related parties, was comprised of securities of issuers based outside of the US and debt securities of foreign governments. These securities generally are either denominated in US dollars or do not expose us to significant foreign currency risk as a result of foreign currency swap and forward arrangements. 
 
 The following table presents our international exposure in our AFS portfolio, including related parties, by country or region of issuance: 
 September 30, 2024 December 31, 2023 (In millions, except percentages) Amortized Cost Fair Value Percent of Total Amortized Cost Fair Value Percent of Total Country Ireland 10,263 10,387 14.8 7,350 7,099 13.9 Other Europe 16,487 15,502 22.2 13,670 12,245 24.0 Total Europe 26,750 25,889 37.0 21,020 19,344 37.9 Non-US North America 37,107 36,732 52.6 24,041 23,044 45.1 Australia New Zealand 3,308 3,055 4.4 3,504 3,153 6.2 Asia/Pacific 2,119 1,892 2.7 2,348 2,219 4.3 Central South America 1,561 1,407 2.0 1,630 1,438 2.8 Africa Middle East 1,162 900 1.3 2,276 1,911 3.7 Total 72,007 69,875 100.0 54,819 51,109 100.0 
 
 Approximately 97.8 and 97.9 of these securities are investment grade by NAIC designation as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. As of September 30, 2024, 10 of our AFS securities, including related parties, were invested in CLOs of Cayman Islands issuers (included in Non-US North America) for which the underlying investments are largely loans to US issuers and 28 were invested in securities of other non-US issuers. 
 
 The majority of our investments in Ireland are comprised of Euro denominated CLOs, for which the SPV is domiciled in Ireland, but the underlying leveraged loans involve borrowers from the broader European region. 
 
 Trading Securities 
 
 Trading securities, including related parties and consolidated VIEs, were 4.7 billion as of each of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. Trading securities are primarily comprised of AmerUs Closed Block securities for which we have elected the fair value option valuation, certain equity tranche securities, structured securities with embedded derivatives and investments which support various reinsurance arrangements. 
 
 Mortgage Loans 
 
 The following is a summary of our mortgage loan portfolio by collateral type, including assets held by related parties and consolidated VIEs:

 Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 

We invest a portion of our investment portfolio in mortgage loans, which are generally comprised of high quality commercial first lien and mezzanine real estate loans. Our mortgage loan holdings, including related parties and consolidated VIEs, were 62.2 billion and 47.6 billion as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. This included 1.1 billion and 1.4 billion of mezzanine mortgage loans as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. We have acquired mortgage loans through acquisitions and reinsurance arrangements, as well as through an active program to invest in new mortgage loans. We invest in commercial mortgage loans (CML) on income producing properties including hotels, apartments, retail and office buildings, and other commercial and industrial properties. Our residential mortgage loan (RML) portfolio primarily consists of first lien RMLs collateralized by properties located in the US. Loan-to-value ratios at the time of loan approval are generally 75 or less. 
 
 We have elected the fair value option on our mortgage loan portfolio; therefore, we have no allowance for credit losses for commercial and residential mortgage loans. Interest income on mortgage loans is accrued on the principal amount of the loan based on the loan s contractual interest rate. Interest income and prepayment fees are reported in net investment income on the condensed consolidated statements of income. Changes in the fair value of the mortgage loan portfolio are reported in investment related gains (losses) on the condensed consolidated statements of income. 
 
 It is our policy to cease to accrue interest on loans that are over 90 days delinquent. For loans less than 90 days delinquent, interest is accrued unless it is determined that the accrued interest is not collectible. If a loan becomes over 90 days delinquent, it is our general policy to initiate foreclosure proceedings unless a workout arrangement to bring the loan current is in place. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we had 1.0 billion and 543 million, respectively, of mortgage loans that were 90 days past due, of which 205 million and 125 million, respectively, were in the process of foreclosure. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, 97 million and 124 million of mortgage loans that were 90 days past due were related to Government National Mortgage Association early buyouts that are fully or partially guaranteed and are accruing interest. 
 
 Investment Funds 
 
 Our investment fund portfolio strategy primarily focuses on core holdings of strategic origination and retirement services platforms, equity and credit funds, and other funds. Strategic origination platforms include investments sourced by affiliated platforms that originate loans to third parties and in which we gain exposure directly to the loan or indirectly through our ownership of the origination platform and/or securitizations of assets originated by the origination platform. Retirement services platforms include investments in equity of financial services companies. Our credit strategy comprises direct origination, asset-backed, multi credit and opportunistic credit funds focused on generating returns through high-quality credit underwriting and origination. Our equity strategy comprises private equity, hybrid value, secondaries equity, real estate equity, impact investing platform, infrastructure and clean transition equity funds that raise capital from investors to pursue control-oriented investments across the universe of private assets. Our investment funds can meet the definition of a VIE, and in certain cases, these investment funds are consolidated in our financial statements because we meet the criteria of the primary beneficiary.

Overall, total investment funds, including related parties and consolidated VIEs, were 18.8 billion and 17.7 billion, as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. See Note 2 Investments to the condensed consolidated financial statements for further discussion regarding how we account for our investment funds. Our investment fund portfolio is subject to a number of market-related risks including interest rate risk and equity market risk. Interest rate risk represents the potential for changes in the investment fund s net asset values resulting from changes in the general level of interest rates. Equity market risk represents the potential for changes in the investment fund s net asset values resulting from changes in equity markets or from other external factors which influence equity markets. These risks expose us to potential volatility in our earnings period-over-period. We actively monitor our exposure to these risks. The increase in investment funds, including related parties and consolidated VIEs, was primarily driven by favorable performance of the underlying assets within AAA in 2024 and net contributions from third-party investors into AAA, partially offset by the distribution of certain investments to AGM as a dividend and the resulting deconsolidation of Apollo Rose as a VIE. 
 
 Funds Withheld at Interest 
 
 Funds withheld at interest represent a receivable for amounts contractually withheld by ceding companies in accordance with modco and funds withheld reinsurance agreements in which we act as the reinsurer. Generally, assets equal to statutory reserves are withheld and legally owned by the ceding company. We hold funds withheld at interest receivables, including those held with Venerable, Lincoln and Jackson. As of September 30, 2024, the majority of the ceding companies holding the assets pursuant to such reinsurance agreements had a financial strength rating of A or better (based on an AM Best scale). 
 
 The funds withheld at interest is comprised of the host contract and an embedded derivative. We are subject to the investment performance on the withheld assets with the total return directly impacting the host contract and the embedded derivative. Interest accrues at a risk-free rate on the host receivable and is recorded as net investment income in the condensed consolidated statements of income. The embedded derivative in our reinsurance agreements is similar to a total return swap on the income generated by the underlying assets held by the ceding companies. The change in the embedded derivative is recorded in investment related gains (losses) in the condensed consolidated statements of income. Although we do not legally own the underlying investments in the funds withheld at interest, in each instance, the ceding company has hired Apollo to manage the withheld assets in accordance with our investment guidelines. 
 
 The following summarizes the underlying investment composition of the funds withheld at interest, including related parties: 
 September 30, 2024 December 31, 2023 (In millions, except percentages) Carrying Value Percent of Total Carrying Value Percent of Total Fixed maturity securities Corporate 13,466 50.5 14,840 48.1 ABS 2,996 11.2 3,285 10.6 CLO 1,610 6.0 2,612 8.5 CMBS 797 3.0 688 2.2 RMBS 540 2.0 580 1.9 Foreign governments 327 1.2 328 1.1 US state, municipal and political subdivisions 180 0.7 188 0.6 Mortgage loans 4,464 16.7 5,277 17.1 Investment funds 879 3.3 827 2.7 Equity securities 279 1.1 351 1.1 Short-term investments 357 1.4 228 0.7 Derivative assets 103 0.4 113 0.4 Cash and cash equivalents 803 3.0 1,622 5.3 Other assets and liabilities (126) (0.5) (106) (0.3) Total funds withheld at interest, including related parties 26,675 100.0 30,833 100.0 
 
 As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we held 26.7 billion and 30.8 billion, respectively, of funds withheld at interest receivables, including related parties. Approximately 95.1 and 95.0 of the fixed maturity securities within the funds withheld at interest are investment grade by NAIC designation as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. The decrease in funds withheld at interest, including related parties, was primarily driven by run-off of the underlying blocks of business, partially offset by unrealized gains during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 attributable to a decrease in US Treasury rates and credit spread tightening in 2024.

Derivative Instruments 
 
 We hold derivative instruments for economic hedging purposes to reduce our exposure to the cash flow variability of assets and liabilities, equity market risk, foreign exchange risk, interest rate risk and credit risk. The types of derivatives we may use include interest rate swaps, foreign currency swaps and forward contracts, total return swaps, credit default swaps, variance swaps, futures and equity options. 
 
 A discussion regarding our derivative instruments and how such instruments are used to manage risk is included in Note 3 Derivative Instruments to the condensed consolidated financial statements. 
 
 As part of our risk management strategies, management continually evaluates our derivative instrument holdings and the effectiveness of such holdings in addressing risks identified in our operations. 
 
 Net Invested Assets 
 
 The following summarizes our net invested assets:

Our net invested assets were 242.7 billion and 217.4 billion as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. As of September 30, 2024, corporate securities included 27.7 billion of private placements, which represented 11.4 of our net invested assets. The increase in net invested assets was primarily driven by growth from net organic inflows of 40.1 billion in excess of net liability outflows of 21.6 billion, reinvestment of earnings and the issuance of debt in the first quarter of 2024, partially offset by the distribution of certain investments to AGM as a dividend and a decrease in short-term repurchase agreements outstanding in 2024. 
 
 In managing our business, we utilize net invested assets as presented in the above table. Net invested assets do not correspond to total investments, including related parties, on our condensed consolidated balance sheets, as discussed previously in Key Operating and Non-GAAP Measures . Net invested assets represent the investments that directly back our net reserve liabilities and surplus assets. We believe this view of our portfolio provides a view of the assets for which we have economic exposure. We adjust the presentation for assumed and ceded reinsurance transactions to include or exclude the underlying investments based upon the contractual transfer of economic exposure to such underlying investments. We also adjust for VIEs to show the net investment in the funds, which are included in the alternative investments line above as well as adjusting for the allowance for credit losses. Net invested assets include our proportionate share of ACRA investments, based on our economic ownership, but exclude the proportionate share of investments associated with the noncontrolling interests. 
 
 Net invested assets is utilized by management to evaluate our investment portfolio. Net invested assets is used in the computation of net investment earned rate, which allows us to analyze the profitability of our investment portfolio. Net invested assets is also used in our risk management processes for asset purchases, product design and underwriting, stress scenarios, liquidity and ALM.

 2 Other primarily includes royalties. 

Net alternative investments were 11.4 billion and 11.7 billion as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively, representing 4.7 and 5.4 of our net invested asset portfolio as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. As of September 30, 2024, we held approximately 77 of our net alternative investments through AAA and had a gross ownership percentage in AAA of approximately 62 . The decrease in net alternative investments was primarily driven by the distribution of FWD and our Catalina common equity interests to AGM as a dividend, the sale of our Challenger Life Company Limited (Challenger) common equity interests and the reclassification of our remaining Catalina and Challenger redeemable preferred equity securities to fixed and other net invested assets. These impacts were partially offset by a contribution to AAA on September 30, 2024 as well as favorable performance of the underlying assets within AAA. 
 
 Net alternative investments do not correspond to the total investment funds, including related parties and consolidated VIEs, on our condensed consolidated balance sheets. As previously discussed in the net invested assets section, we adjust the US GAAP presentation for assumed and ceded reinsurance as well as VIEs. We include certain equity securities in alternative investments due to their underlying characteristics and equity-like features.

Through our relationship with Apollo, we have indirectly invested in companies that meet the key characteristics we look for in net alternative investments. Athora, our largest alternative investment, is a strategic investment. 
 
 Athora 
 
 Athora is a specialized insurance and reinsurance group fully focused on the European market. Athora s principal operational subsidiaries are Athora Netherlands N.V. in the Netherlands, Athora Belgium SA in Belgium, Athora Lebensversicherung AG in Germany, Athora Ireland plc in Ireland and Athora Life Re Ltd. in Bermuda. Athora deploys capital and resources to further its mission to build a stand-alone independent and integrated insurance and reinsurance business. Athora s growth is achieved primarily through acquisitions, portfolio transfers and reinsurance. Athora is building a European insurance brand and has successfully acquired, integrated and transformed multiple insurance companies. 
 
 Our alternative investment in Athora had a carrying value of 1.1 billion as of each of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. Our investment in Athora represents our proportionate share of its net asset value, which largely reflects any contributions to and distributions from Athora and changes in its fair value. Athora returned a net investment earned rate of (0.72) and 5.47 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and 1.71 and 8.20 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Alternative investment income from Athora was (1) million and 16 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and 16 million and 68 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The decrease in alternative investment income for both periods was primarily driven by continued inflationary and regulatory pressures in 2024.

Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 
 There are two forms of liquidity relevant to our business: funding liquidity and balance sheet liquidity. Funding liquidity relates to the ability to fund operations. Balance sheet liquidity relates to our ability to liquidate or rebalance our balance sheet without incurring significant costs from fees, bid-offer spreads, or market impact. We manage our liquidity position by matching projected cash demands with adequate sources of cash and other liquid assets. Our principal sources of liquidity, in the ordinary course of business, are operating cash flows and holdings of cash, cash equivalents and other readily marketable assets. 
 
 Our investment portfolio is structured to ensure a strong liquidity position over time to permit timely payment of policy and contract benefits without requiring asset sales at inopportune times or at depressed prices. In general, liquid assets include cash and cash equivalents, highly rated bonds, short-term investments, unaffiliated preferred stock and public common stock, all of which generally have liquid markets with a large number of buyers, but excludes pledged assets, mainly associated with funding agreement and repurchase agreement liabilities. The carrying value of these assets, excluding assets within modified coinsurance and funds withheld portfolios, as of September 30, 2024 was 123.1 billion. Assets included in modified coinsurance and funds withheld portfolios, including assets held in reinsurance trusts, are available to fund the benefits for the associated obligations but are restricted from other uses. The carrying value of the underlying assets in these modified coinsurance and funds withheld portfolios that we consider liquid as of September 30, 2024 was 13.4 billion. Although our investment portfolio does contain assets that are generally considered illiquid for liquidity monitoring purposes (primarily mortgage loans, policy loans, real estate, investment funds and affiliated common stock), there is some ability to raise cash from these assets if needed. In periods of economic downturn, we may maintain higher cash balances than required to manage our liquidity risk and to take advantage of market dislocations as they arise. We have access to additional liquidity through our credit facility and liquidity facility. The credit facility has a borrowing capacity of 1.25 billion, subject to being increased up to 1.75 billion in total on the terms described in the credit facility. The credit facility has a commitment termination date of June 30, 2028, subject to up to two one-year extensions, and was undrawn as of September 30, 2024. We entered into a new liquidity facility on June 28, 2024, which replaced our previous agreement dated as of June 30, 2023. The liquidity facility has a borrowing capacity of 2.6 billion, subject to being increased up to 3.1 billion in total on the terms described in the liquidity facility. The liquidity facility has a commitment termination date of June 27, 2025, subject to additional 364-day extensions, and was undrawn as of September 30, 2024. We also have access to 2.0 billion of committed repurchase facilities. Our registration statement on Form S-3 ASR (Shelf Registration Statement) provides us with access to the capital markets, subject to market conditions and other factors. We are also the counterparty to repurchase agreements with several different financial institutions, pursuant to which we may obtain short-term liquidity, to the extent available. In addition, through our membership in the FHLB, we are eligible to borrow under variable rate short-term federal funds arrangements to provide additional liquidity. 
 
 We proactively manage our liquidity position to meet cash needs while minimizing adverse impacts on investment returns. We analyze our cash-flow liquidity over the upcoming 12 months by modeling potential demands on liquidity under a variety of scenarios, taking into account the provisions of our policies and contracts in force, our cash flow position, and the volume of cash and readily marketable securities in our portfolio. 
 
 Liquidity risk is monitored, managed and mitigated through a number of stress tests and analyses to assess our ability to meet our cash flow requirements, as well as the ability of our reinsurance and insurance subsidiaries to meet their collateral obligations, under various stress scenarios. We further seek to mitigate liquidity risk by maintaining access to alternative, external sources of liquidity as described below. 
 
 Our liquidity risk management framework is codified in the company s Liquidity Risk Policy that is reviewed and approved by our board of directors.

Insurance Subsidiaries Liquidity 
 
 Operations 
 
 The primary cash flow sources for our insurance subsidiaries include retirement services product inflows (premiums and deposits), investment income, principal repayments on our investments, net transfers from separate accounts and financial product inflows. Uses of cash include investment purchases, payments to policyholders for surrenders, withdrawals and payout benefits, interest and principal payments on funding agreements and outstanding debt, payments to satisfy pension group annuity obligations, policy acquisition and general operating costs and payment of cash dividends. 
 
 Our policyholder obligations are generally long-term in nature. However, policyholders may elect to withdraw some, or all, of their account value in amounts that exceed our estimates and assumptions over the life of an annuity contract. We include provisions within our annuity policies, such as surrender charges and MVAs, which are intended to protect us from early withdrawals. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, approximately 81 and 79 , respectively, of our deferred annuity liabilities were subject to penalty upon surrender. In addition, as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, approximately 66 and 64 , respectively, of policies contained MVAs that may also have the effect of limiting early withdrawals if interest rates increase but may encourage early withdrawals by effectively subsidizing a portion of surrender charges when interest rates decrease. As of September 30, 2024, approximately 32 of our net reserve liabilities were generally non-surrenderable, including buy-out pension group annuities other than those that can be withdrawn as lump sums, funding agreements and payout annuities, while 54 were subject to penalty upon surrender. 
 
 Membership in Federal Home Loan Bank 
 
 Through our membership in the FHLB, we are eligible to borrow under variable rate short-term federal funds arrangements to provide additional liquidity. The borrowings must be secured by eligible collateral such as mortgage loans, eligible CMBS or RMBS, government or agency securities and guaranteed loans. As of each of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively, we had no outstanding borrowings under these arrangements. 
 
 We have issued funding agreements to the FHLB. These funding agreements were issued in an investment spread strategy, consistent with other investment spread operations. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we had funding agreements outstanding with the FHLB in the aggregate principal amount of 13.0 billion and 6.5 billion, respectively. 
 
 The maximum FHLB indebtedness by a member is determined by the amount of collateral pledged and cannot exceed a specified percentage of the member s total statutory assets dependent on the internal credit rating assigned to the member by the FHLB. As of September 30, 2024, our total maximum borrowing capacity under the FHLB facilities was limited to 53.1 billion. However, our ability to borrow under the facilities is constrained by the availability of assets that qualify as eligible collateral under the facilities and certain other limitations. Considering these limitations, as of September 30, 2024, we had the ability to draw up to an estimated 16.2 billion, inclusive of borrowings then outstanding. This estimate is based on our internal analysis and assumptions and may not accurately measure collateral which is ultimately acceptable to the FHLB. 
 
 Securities Repurchase Agreements 
 
 We engage in repurchase transactions whereby we sell fixed income securities to third parties, primarily major brokerage firms or commercial banks, with a concurrent agreement to repurchase such securities at a determined future date. We require that, at all times during the term of the repurchase agreements, we maintain sufficient cash or other liquid assets sufficient to allow us to fund substantially all of the repurchase price. Proceeds received from the sale of securities pursuant to these arrangements are generally invested in short-term investments or maintained in cash, with the offsetting obligation to repurchase the security included within payables for collateral on derivatives and securities to repurchase on the condensed consolidated balance sheets. As per the terms of the repurchase agreements, we monitor the market value of the securities sold and may be required to deliver additional collateral (which may be in the form of cash or additional securities) to the extent that the value of the securities sold decreases prior to the repurchase date. 
 
 As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the payables for repurchase agreements were 2.7 billion and 3.9 billion, respectively, while the fair value of securities and collateral held by counterparties backing the repurchase agreements was 2.8 billion and 4.1 billion, respectively. As of September 30, 2024, payables for repurchase agreements, based on original issuance, were comprised of no short-term and 2.7 billion long-term repurchase agreements. As of December 31, 2023, payables for repurchase agreements, based on original issuance, were comprised of 686 million short-term and 3.2 billion long-term repurchase agreements. 
 
 We have a 1.0 billion committed repurchase facility with BNP Paribas. The facility has an initial commitment period of 12 months and automatically renews for successive 12-month periods until terminated by either party. During the commitment period, we may sell and BNP Paribas is required to purchase eligible investment grade corporate bonds pursuant to repurchase transactions at pre-agreed discounts in exchange for a commitment fee. As of September 30, 2024, we had no outstanding payables under this facility. 
 
 We have a 1.0 billion committed repurchase facility with Societe Generale. The facility has a commitment term of 5 years, however, either party may terminate the facility upon 24-months notice, in which case the facility will end upon the earlier of (1) such designated termination date, or (2) July 26, 2026. During the commitment period, we may sell and Societe Generale is required to purchase eligible investment grade

corporate bonds pursuant to repurchase transactions at pre-agreed rates in exchange for an ongoing commitment fee for the facility. As of September 30, 2024, we had no outstanding payables under this facility. 
 
 Cash Flows 
 
 Our cash flows were as follows: 
 Nine months ended September 30, (In millions) 2024 2023 Net income 3,825 2,049 Non-cash revenues and expenses 
 (2,335) 1,655 Net cash provided by operating activities

 3 2 Net (decrease) increase in cash and cash equivalents 1 
 (23) 2,597 1 Includes cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash and cash and cash equivalents of consolidated variable interest entities. 

Cash flows from operating activities 
 
 The primary cash inflows from operating activities include net investment income, annuity considerations and insurance premiums. The primary cash outflows from operating activities are comprised of benefit payments and operating expenses. Our operating activities generated cash flows totaling 1.5 billion and 3.7 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The decrease in cash provided by operating activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 2023 was primarily driven by lower cash received from pension group annuity transactions, net of cash outflows, and an increase in cash paid for interest on funding agreements and other operating expenses, partially offset by an increase in net investment income. 
 
 Cash flows from investing activities 
 
 The primary cash inflows from investing activities are the sales, maturities and repayments of investments. The primary cash outflows from investing activities are the purchases and acquisitions of new investments. Our investing activities used cash flows totaling 45.4 billion and 29.0 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The increase in cash used in investing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 2023 was primarily driven by an increase in the purchases of investments due to the deployment of greater cash inflows from strong organic growth compared to 2023 and a decrease in net investment payables, partially offset by an increase in sales, maturities and repayments of investments. 
 
 Cash flows from financing activities 
 
 The primary cash inflows from financing activities are inflows on our investment-type policies and contracts, changes of cash collateral for derivative transactions posted by counterparties, capital contributions and proceeds from debt and preferred stock issuances. The primary cash outflows from financing activities are withdrawals on our investment-type policies and contracts, changes of cash collateral for derivative transactions posted by counterparties, capital distributions, repayments of outstanding borrowings and payment of preferred and common stock dividends. Our financing activities provided cash flows totaling 43.9 billion and 27.9 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The increase in cash provided by financing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 2023 was primarily attributed to higher cash received from funding agreement and retail inflows, net of cash outflows, the issuance of 1.6 billion of debt in 2024, a favorable change in cash collateral posted by counterparties for derivative transactions related to more favorable equity market performance and the payment of less cash common stock dividends as 2024 included an assets in kind dividend of certain alternative investments to AGM in lieu of a cash dividend in the third quarter and 2023 included the payment of the fourth quarter 2022 common stock dividend. These increases were partially offset by a capital contribution of 1.25 billion from AGM in 2023 related to the net proceeds from its mandatory convertible preferred stock offering, a decrease in net capital contributions from noncontrolling interests and an increase in the repayment of short-term and long-term repurchase agreements in 2024 compared to 2023.

Atlas Securitized Products Holdings LP 
 
 In connection with our, Apollo and CS s previously announced transaction, certain subsidiaries of Atlas, which is owned by AAA, acquired certain assets of the CS Securitized Products Group (the Transaction). Under the terms of the Transaction, Atlas originally agreed to pay CS 3.3 billion by February 8, 2028. In March 2024, in connection with Atlas concluding its investment management agreement with CS, the deferred purchase obligation amount was reduced to 2.5 billion. In addition, certain strategic investors have made equity commitments to Atlas which therefore obligates these investors for a portion of the deferred purchase price obligation. This deferred purchase price is an obligation first of Atlas, and (as a result of additional guarantees provided by AAA, AAM and AHL) second of AAA, third of AAM, fourth of AHL and fifth of AARe. AARe and AAM have each issued an assurance letter to CS for the full deferred purchase obligation amount of 3.3 billion. Our guarantees are not probable of payment, hence there are no liabilities recorded for the guarantees on the condensed consolidated financial statements. 
 
 In exchange for the purchase price, Atlas originally received approximately 0.4 billion in cash and a portfolio of senior secured warehouse assets, subject to debt, with approximately 1 billion of tangible equity value. These warehouse assets are senior secured assets at industry standard loan-to-value ratios, structured to investment grade-equivalent criteria, and were approved by Atlas in connection with this Transaction. Atlas will earn total fees of 0.4 billion under the terms of the investment management agreement with CS, including management fees and transition and termination payments. Finally, Atlas also benefits generally from the net spread earned on its assets in excess of its cost of financing. 
 
 Holding Company Liquidity 
 
 Common Stock Dividends 
 
 We intend to pay regular common stock dividends to our parent company of 750 million per year, generally paid at the end of each quarter; provided that the declaration and payment of any dividends are at the sole discretion of our board of directors, which may change the dividend policy at any time, including, without limitation, eliminating the dividend entirely. 
 
 During the third quarter of 2024, we declared dividends on our outstanding common stock, which were provided to AGM in the form of assets in kind valued at an aggregate amount of 499 million. In addition to the third quarter dividend, we have paid 374 million in common stock cash dividends for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 
 
 We declared and paid common stock cash dividends of 188 million and 750 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023 and the nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively, including payment of the fourth quarter dividend from 2022 in the first quarter of 2023. 
 
 Dividends from Subsidiaries 
 
 AHL is a holding company whose primary liquidity needs include the cash-flow requirements relating to its corporate activities, including its day-to-day operations, debt servicing, preferred and common stock dividend payments and strategic transactions, such as acquisitions. The primary source of AHL s cash flow is dividends from its subsidiaries, which are expected to be adequate to fund cash flow requirements based on current estimates of future obligations. 
 
 102 

Table of Contents 
 
 Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 

The ability of AHL s insurance subsidiaries to pay dividends is limited by applicable laws and regulations of the jurisdictions where the subsidiaries are domiciled, as well as agreements entered into with regulators. These laws and regulations require, among other things, the insurance subsidiaries to maintain minimum solvency requirements and limit the amount of dividends these subsidiaries can pay. 
 
 Subject to these limitations and prior notification to the appropriate regulatory agency, the US insurance subsidiaries are permitted to pay ordinary dividends based on calculations specified under insurance laws of the relevant state of domicile. Any distributions above the amount permitted by statute in any twelve-month period are considered to be extraordinary dividends, and require the approval of the appropriate regulator prior to payment. AHL does not currently plan on having the US subsidiaries pay any dividends to their parents. 
 
 Dividends from subsidiaries are projected to be the primary source of AHL s liquidity. Under the Bermuda Insurance Act, each of our Bermuda insurance subsidiaries is prohibited from paying a dividend in an amount exceeding 25 of the prior year s statutory capital and surplus, unless at least two members of the board of directors of the Bermuda insurance subsidiary and its principal representative in Bermuda sign and submit to the Bermuda Monetary Authority (BMA) an affidavit attesting that a dividend in excess of this amount would not cause the Bermuda insurance subsidiary to fail to meet its relevant margins. In certain instances, the Bermuda insurance subsidiary would also be required to provide prior notice to the BMA in advance of the payment of dividends. In the event that such an affidavit is submitted to the BMA in accordance with the Bermuda Insurance Act, and further subject to the Bermuda insurance subsidiary meeting its relevant margins, the Bermuda insurance subsidiary is permitted to distribute up to the sum of 100 of statutory surplus and an amount less than 15 of its total statutory capital. Distributions in excess of this amount require the approval of the BMA. 
 
 The maximum distribution permitted by law or contract is not necessarily indicative of our actual ability to pay such distributions, which may be further restricted by business and other considerations, such as the impact of such distributions on surplus, which could affect our ratings or competitive position and the amount of premiums that can be written. Specifically, the level of capital needed to maintain desired financial strength ratings from rating agencies, including S P, AM Best, Fitch and Moody s, is of particular concern when determining the amount of capital available for distributions. AHL believes its insurance subsidiaries have sufficient statutory capital and surplus, combined with additional capital available to be provided by AHL, to meet their financial strength ratings objectives. Finally, state insurance laws and regulations require that the statutory surplus of our insurance subsidiaries following any dividend or distribution must be reasonable in relation to their outstanding liabilities and adequate for the insurance subsidiaries financial needs. 
 
 Other Sources of Funding 
 
 We may seek to secure additional funding at the holding company level by means other than dividends from subsidiaries, such as by drawing on our undrawn 1.25 billion credit facility, drawing on our undrawn 2.6 billion liquidity facility or by pursuing future issuances of debt or preferred stock to third-party investors. Certain other sources of liquidity potentially available at the holding company level are discussed below. Our credit facility contains various standard covenants with which we must comply, including maintaining a consolidated debt-to-capitalization ratio of not greater than 35 , maintaining a minimum consolidated net worth of no less than 14.8 billion and restrictions on our ability to incur liens, with certain exceptions. Rates, ratios and terms are as defined in the credit facility. Our liquidity facility also contains various standard covenants with which we must comply, including maintaining an ALRe minimum consolidated net worth of no less than 10.2 billion and restrictions on our ability to incur liens, with certain exceptions. Rates and terms are as defined in the liquidity facility. 
 
 Shelf Registration Under our Shelf Registration Statement, subject to market conditions, we have the ability to issue, in indeterminate amounts, debt securities, preferred stock, depositary shares, warrants and units.

 Unsecured Revolving Promissory Note Payable with AGM AHL has an unsecured revolving promissory note with AGM which allows AHL to borrow funds from AGM. The note has a borrowing capacity of 500 million and maturity date of December 13, 2025, or earlier at AGM s request. There was no outstanding balance on the note payable as of September 30, 2024. 
 
 Intercompany Note AHL has an unsecured revolving note payable with ALRe, which permits AHL to borrow up to 4.0 billion with a fixed interest rate of 2.29 and a maturity date of December 15, 2028. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the revolving note payable had an outstanding balance of 1.9 billion and 486 million, respectively. 
 
 Capital 
 
 We believe we have a strong capital position and are well positioned to meet policyholder and other obligations. We measure capital sufficiency using an internal capital model which reflects management s view on the various risks inherent to our business, the amount of capital required to support our core operating strategies and the amount of capital necessary to maintain our current ratings in a recessionary environment. The amount of capital required to support our core operating strategies is determined based upon internal modeling and analysis of economic risk, as well as inputs from rating agency capital models and consideration of both NAIC risk-based capital (RBC) and Bermuda capital requirements. Capital in excess of this required amount is considered excess equity capital, which is available to deploy. 
 
 As of December 31, 2023 and 2022, our US insurance companies total adjusted capital (TAC), as defined by the NAIC, was 5.8 billion and 4.1 billion, respectively, and our US RBC ratio was 392 and 387 , respectively. Each US domestic insurance subsidiary s state of domicile imposes minimum RBC requirements that were developed by the NAIC. The formulas for determining the amount of RBC specify various weighting factors that are applied to financial balances or various levels of activity based on the perceived degree of risk. Regulatory compliance is determined by a ratio of TAC to its authorized control level RBC. Our TAC was significantly in excess of all regulatory standards as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. 
 
 Bermuda statutory capital and surplus for our Bermuda insurance companies in aggregate was 14.6 billion and 14.8 billion as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. Our Bermuda insurance companies adhere to BMA regulatory capital requirements to maintain statutory capital and surplus to meet the minimum margin of solvency and maintain minimum economic balance sheet (EBS) capital and surplus to meet the enhanced capital requirement. Under the EBS framework, assets are recorded at market value and insurance reserves are determined by reference to nine prescribed scenarios, with the scenario resulting in the highest reserve balance being ultimately required to be selected. For the Bermuda group, which includes the capital and surplus of AARe and all of its subsidiaries, including Athene Annuity Life Assurance Company (AADE) and its subsidiaries, EBS capital and surplus was 26.6 billion and 21.9 billion, resulting in a Bermuda Solvency Capital Requirement (BSCR) ratio of 291 and 278 as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. An insurer must have a BSCR ratio of 100 or greater to be considered solvent by the BMA. As of December 31, 2023 and 2022, our Bermuda insurance companies held the appropriate capital to adhere to these regulatory standards. As of December 31, 2023 and 2022, our Bermuda RBC ratio was 400 and 407 , respectively. The Bermuda RBC ratio is calculated using Bermuda capital and applying the NAIC RBC factors on an aggregate basis with certain adjustments made by management as described in the glossary. The statutory capital and surplus and RBC of our Bermuda insurance companies presented herein exclude the impact of any deferred taxes that may be recorded on a statutory basis as a result of the Bermuda CIT. We are currently

 Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 

assessing deferred taxes that may be recorded on a statutory basis as a result of the Bermuda CIT, which could have a positive impact on the statutory capital and surplus of our Bermuda insurance companies. 
 
 As of December 31, 2023 and 2022, our consolidated statutory capital and surplus in the aggregate was 21.8 billion and 20.1 billion, respectively, and our consolidated RBC ratio was 412 and 416 , respectively. Our consolidated regulatory capital represents the aggregate capital of our US and Bermuda insurance entities, determined with respect to each insurance entity by applying the statutory accounting principles applicable to each such entity with adjustments made to, among other things, assets and expenses at the holding company level. The consolidated RBC ratio is calculated by aggregating US RBC and Bermuda RBC. See Glossary of Selected Terms Consolidated RBC for further information. 
 
 ACRA 1 ACRA 1 provided us with access to on-demand capital to support our growth strategies and capital deployment opportunities. ACRA 1 provided a capital source to fund both our inorganic and organic channels. 
 
 ACRA 2 Similar to ACRA 1, we funded ACRA 2 in December 2022 as another long-duration, on-demand capital vehicle. ACRA 2 is partially owned by ADIP II, a fund managed by Apollo. Effective October 1, 2024, ACRA 2 repurchased a portion of its shares held by ALRe, which increased ADIP II s ownership of economic interests in ACRA 2 to 63 , with ALRe owning the remaining 37 . ALRe holds all of ACRA 2 s voting interests. ACRA 2 participates in certain transactions by drawing a portion of the required capital for such transactions from third-party investors equal to ADIP II s proportionate economic interest in ACRA 2. 
 
 These strategic capital solutions allow us the flexibility to simultaneously deploy capital across multiple accretive avenues, while maintaining a strong financial position. 

Critical Accounting Estimates and Judgments 
 
 The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with US GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of any contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Amounts based on such estimates involve numerous assumptions subject to varying and potentially significant degrees of judgment and uncertainty, particularly related to the future performance of the underlying business, and will likely change in the future as additional information becomes available. Critical estimates and assumptions are evaluated on an ongoing basis based on historical developments, market conditions, industry trends and other information that is reasonable under the circumstances. There can be no assurance that actual results will conform to estimates and assumptions and that reported results of operations will not be materially affected by the need to make future accounting adjustments to reflect periodic changes in these estimates and assumptions. Critical accounting estimates are impacted significantly by our methods, judgments and assumptions used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements and should be read in conjunction with our significant accounting policies described in Note 1 Business, Basis of Presentation and Significant Accounting Policies to the consolidated financial statements of our 2023 Annual Report. The most critical accounting estimates and judgments include those used in determining: 
 
 fair value of investments; 
 impairment of investments and allowances for expected credit losses; 
 derivatives valuation, including embedded derivatives; 
 future policy benefits; 
 market risk benefits; 
 consolidation of VIEs; and 
 income taxes. 
 
 The above critical accounting estimates and judgments are discussed in detail in Part II Item 7. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Critical Accounting Estimates and Judgments of our 2023 Annual Report. 
 
 For a discussion of new accounting pronouncements affecting us, see Note 1 Business, Basis of Presentation and Significant Accounting Policies to the condensed consolidated financial statements. 

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risks 
 
 We regularly analyze our exposure to market risks, which reflect potential losses in value due to credit and counterparty risk, interest rate risk, currency risk, commodity price risk, equity price risk and inflation risk. As a result of that analysis, we have determined that we are primarily exposed to credit risk, interest rate risk, equity price risk and inflation risk. A description of our market risk exposures, including strategies used to manage our exposure to market risk, may be found under Part II Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risks of our 2023 Annual Report. 
 
 There have been no material changes to our market risk exposures from those previously disclosed in our 2023 Annual Report, except as described below.

Sensitivities 
 
 Interest Rate Risk 
 
 We assess interest rate exposure for financial assets and liabilities using hypothetical stress tests and exposure analyses. Assuming all other factors are constant, if there was an immediate parallel increase in interest rates of 100 basis points from levels as of September 30, 2024, we estimate a net decrease to our point-in-time income before income taxes from changes in the fair value of these financial instruments of 2.5 billion, net of offsets. If there was a similar parallel increase in interest rates from levels as of December 31, 2023, we estimate a net decrease to our point-in-time income before income taxes from changes in the fair value of these financial instruments of 2.5 billion, net of offsets. The financial instruments included in the sensitivity analysis are carried at fair value and changes in fair value are recognized in earnings. These financial instruments include derivative instruments, embedded derivatives, mortgage loans, certain fixed maturity securities and market risk benefits. The sensitivity analysis excludes those financial instruments carried at fair value for which changes in fair value are recognized in equity, such as AFS fixed maturity securities. 
 
 Assuming a 25 basis point increase in interest rates that persists for a 12-month period, the estimated impact to spread related earnings due to the change in net investment spread from floating rate assets and liabilities would be an increase of approximately 30 40 million, and a 25 basis point decrease would generally result in a similar decrease. This is calculated without regard to future changes to assumptions and excludes the impact of rate changes on cash and cash equivalents. As of September 30, 2024, the balance in cash and cash equivalents plus restricted cash, net investment payables and receivables, reinsurance impacts and the net derivative collateral offsetting the related cash positions, was 8.4 billion, net of the amount attributable to the noncontrolling interests. The decrease in sensitivity to spread related earnings due to the change in net investment spread from floating rate assets and liabilities as of September 30, 2024, when compared to December 31, 2023, was driven by the decrease in our net floating rate position related to hedging actions as well as additional issuances of floating rate funding agreements in 2024. 
 
 With the implementation of the Long Duration Targeted Improvements accounting standard, changes in the fair value of market risk benefits due to current period movement in the interest rate curve used to discount the reserve are reflected in net income but excluded from spread related earnings. However, changes in interest rates that impact the cost of the projected GLWB and GMDB rider benefits, included within our market risk benefit reserve, are amortized within cost of funds in spread related earnings over the life of the business. Assuming a parallel increase in interest rates of 25 basis points, the estimated impact to spread related earnings over a 12-month period related to market risk benefits would be an increase of approximately 30 50 million, and a parallel decrease in interest rates of 25 basis points would generally result in a similar decrease. This is calculated without regard to future changes to assumptions. 
 
 We are unable to make forward-looking estimates regarding the impact on net income of changes in interest rates that persist for a longer period of time, or changes in the shape of the yield curve over time, as a result of an inability to determine how such changes will affect certain of the items that we characterize as adjustments to income before income taxes in our reconciliation between net income available to AHL common stockholder and spread related earnings. See Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Non-GAAP Measure Reconciliations for the reconciliation of net income available to Athene Holding Ltd. common stockholder to spread related earnings. The impact of changing rates on these adjustments is likely to be significant. See above for a discussion regarding the estimated impact on income before income taxes of an immediate, parallel increase in interest rates of 100 basis points from levels as of September 30, 2024, which discussion encompasses the impact of such an increase on certain of the adjustment items. 
 
 The models used to estimate the impact of changes in market interest rates incorporate numerous assumptions, require significant estimates and assume an immediate change in interest rates without any discretionary management action to counteract such a change. Consequently, potential changes in our valuations indicated by these simulations will likely be different from the actual changes experienced under any given interest rate scenarios and these differences may be material. Because we actively manage our assets and liabilities, the net exposure to interest rates can vary over time. However, any such decreases in the fair value of fixed maturity securities, unless related to credit concerns of the issuer requiring recognition of credit losses, would generally be realized only if we were required to sell such securities at losses to meet liquidity needs.

Item 4. Controls and Procedures 
 
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 
 We maintain disclosure controls and procedures as such term is defined under Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(e), that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our Exchange Act reports is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures. In designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, our management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives and our management necessarily is required to apply its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures. We have carried out an evaluation, as of the end of the period covered by this report, under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures. Based on this evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective at attaining the level of reasonable assurance noted above. 
 
 Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
 
 There were no changes to our internal control over financial reporting as defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(f) during the quarter ended September 30, 2024, that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

PART II OTHER INFORMATION 

Item 1. Legal Proceedings 
 
 We are subject to litigation arising in the ordinary course of our business, including litigation principally relating to our retail business. We cannot assure you that our insurance coverage will be adequate to cover all liabilities arising out of such claims. The outcomes of legal proceedings and claims brought against us are subject to significant uncertainty. There is significant judgment required in assessing both the probability of an adverse outcome and the determination as to whether an exposure can be reasonably estimated. In management s opinion, the ultimate disposition of any current legal proceeding or claim brought against us will not have a material effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. Litigation is, however, inherently uncertain and an adverse outcome from such litigation could have a material effect on the operating results of a particular reporting period. 
 
 From time to time, in the ordinary course of business and like others in the insurance and financial services industries, we receive requests for information from government agencies in connection with such agencies regulatory or investigatory authority. Such requests can include financial or market conduct examinations, subpoenas or demand letters for documents to assist the government in audits or investigations. We and each of our US insurance subsidiaries review such requests and notices and take appropriate action. We have been subject to certain requests for information and investigations in the past and could be subject to them in the future. 

Item 1A. Risk Factors 
 
 The following should be read in conjunction with the risk factors that may affect our business or operations described in Part I Item 1A. Risk Factors of our 2023 Annual Report. Other than as described in this Item 1A, there have been no material changes to our risk factors from those previously disclosed in our 2023 Annual Report. 
 
 The following updates and supplements the risk factors described in our 2023 Annual Report: 
 
 We or our business may be the target or subject of, and we may be required to defend against or respond to, litigation, regulatory investigations, enforcement actions or reputational harm. 
 
 We operate in an industry in which various practices are subject to potential litigation, including class actions and regulatory scrutiny. We, like other financial services companies, are involved in litigation and arbitration in the ordinary course of business and may be the subject of regulatory proceedings (including investigations and enforcement actions). Plaintiffs may seek large or indeterminate amounts of damages in litigation and regulators may seek large fines in enforcement actions. Given the large or indeterminate amounts sometimes sought, and the inherent unpredictability of litigation and enforcement actions, it is possible that an unfavorable resolution of one or more matters could have a material and adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. See Item 1. Legal Proceedings and Note 12 Commitments and Contingencies to the condensed consolidated financial statements for certain matters to which we are a party, if any. Even if we ultimately prevail in any litigation or receive positive results from investigations, we could incur material legal costs, or our reputation could be materially adversely affected. 
 
 Beginning in March 2024, a number of putative class actions were filed in federal courts in the United States against certain of our customers, in their respective capacities as plan sponsors, alleging violations of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA) in connection with their transfer of pension obligations under defined benefit plans governed under ERISA and their purchase of pension group annuity (PGA) contracts from us. The lawsuits seek, inter alia, that defendants guarantee the annuities purchased from us and disgorge any profits earned from the transactions. Although we are not a named defendant, the lawsuits make several negative allegations about us and our business, which we believe to be untrue. Negative public perceptions of us and our business could adversely affect (and may have already adversely affected) our ability to attract and retain customers, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. In addition, these lawsuits could lead to increased regulatory and governmental scrutiny of our business and the industry overall, and/or result in us becoming involved in these lawsuits or even being named as a defendant in future lawsuits related to our PGA business, which could result in additional expenses, adverse regulations and oversight, and/or additional reputational harm. These lawsuits could also spur similar copycat lawsuits, which could further impact our PGA business. To the extent that the inflows in our PGA business are negatively impacted by these lawsuits and any related regulatory and governmental scrutiny, we may seek to increase our inflows in our other distribution channels, including by issuing additional funding agreements within our institutional channel. However, there are no assurances that we would be successful in replacing any PGA inflows with inflows from other distribution channels or that such other inflows would result in comparable spreads.

Table of Contents 

Our industry is highly regulated and we are subject to significant legal restrictions and obligations, and these restrictions and obligations may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, cash flows and prospects. 
 
 We are subject to a complex and extensive array of laws and regulations that are administered and enforced by many regulators, including the BMA, US state insurance regulators, US state securities administrators, US state banking authorities, the SEC, Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, the Department of Labor, the Internal Revenue Service and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency. See Item 1. Business Regulation of our 2023 Annual Report for a summary of certain of the laws and regulations applicable to our business. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations could subject us to administrative penalties imposed by a particular governmental or self-regulatory authority, unanticipated costs associated with remedying such failure or other claims, harm to our reputation, revocation of our certificate of incorporation or interruption of our operations, any of which could have a material and adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows. 
 
 In addition to these restrictions, guaranty associations may subject member insurers, including us, to assessments that require the insurers to pay funds to cover contractual obligations under insurance policies issued by insurance companies that become impaired or insolvent. These associations levy assessments, up to prescribed limits, on each member insurer doing business in a particular state on the basis of their proportionate share of the premiums written by all member insurers in the lines of business in which the impaired or insolvent insurer previously engaged. Most states limit assessments in any year to 2 of the insurer s average annual premium for the three years preceding the calendar year in which the impaired insurer became impaired or insolvent. Although we have historically not paid material amounts in connection with these assessments, we cannot accurately predict the magnitude of such amounts in the future, or accurately predict which past or future insolvencies of other insurers could lead to such assessments. If material, such future assessments may have an adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, liquidity or cash flows, and any liability we have previously established for these potential assessments may not be adequate. See also Note 12 Commitments and Contingencies to the condensed consolidated financial statements. 
 
 In addition to the foregoing risks, the financial services industry is the focus of increased regulatory scrutiny as various US state and federal governmental agencies and self-regulatory organizations conduct inquiries and investigations into the products and practices of the companies within this industry. Governmental authorities and standard setters in the US and worldwide (including the International Association of Insurance Supervisors (IAIS)) have become increasingly interested in potential risks posed by the insurance industry as a whole, and to commercial and financial activities and systems in general, as indicated by the IAIS s development of the global insurance capital standard to be applicable to internationally active insurance groups (IAIGs) and the Global Monitoring Exercise, as well as the US NAIC s adoption of the group capital calculation (GCC) and liquidity stress test (LST). The Iowa Insurance Division (IID) has adopted the GCC and LST amendments, which are applicable to us. On February 6, 2024, the IID identified AGM as meeting the criteria as an IAIG and further identified AHL as the Head of the IAIG. As a result of these identifications, we expect AHL to be subject to the relevant capital standard that the US will apply to IAIGs once adopted. At this time, we do not expect a significant impact on AHL s capital position or capital structure; however, we cannot fully predict with certainty the impact (if any) on AHL s capital position or capital structure and any other burdens being named an IAIG may impose on AHL or its insurance affiliates. See Item 1. Business Regulation Regulation of an Insurance Group of our 2023 Annual Report for further discussion. While we cannot predict the exact nature, timing or scope of possible governmental initiatives, there may be increased regulatory intervention in the insurance and financial services industry in the future. 

Item 2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities, Use of Proceeds and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities 
 
 None. 

Item 5. Other Information 
 
 During the three months ended September 30, 2024, no director or officer (as defined in Rule 16a-1(f) under the Exchange Act) of AHL or a Rule 10b5-1 trading arrangement or non-Rule 10b5-1 trading arrangement, as each term is defined in Item 408(a) of Regulation S-K with respect to any of AHL s securities.
