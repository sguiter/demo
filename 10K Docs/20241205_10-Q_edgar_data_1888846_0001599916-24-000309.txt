ITEM 2 
 MANAGEMENT S
 DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 

FORWARD LOOKING STATEMENTS 

This Quarterly Report of Ultimate Holdings Group,
Inc. on Form 10-Q contains forward-looking statements, particularly those identified with the words, anticipates, believes, 
 expects, plans, intends, objectives, and similar expressions. These statements
reflect management's best judgment based on factors known at the time of such statements. The reader may find discussions containing such
forward-looking statements in the material set forth under Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results
of Operations, generally, and specifically therein under the captions Liquidity and Capital Resources as well as
elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Actual events or results may differ materially from those discussed herein. The forward-looking
statements specified in the following information have been compiled by our management on the basis of assumptions made by management
and considered by management to be reasonable. Our future operating results, however, are impossible to predict and no representation,
guarantee, or warranty is to be inferred from those forward-looking statements. 

The assumptions used for purposes of the forward-looking
statements specified in the following information represent estimates of future events and are subject to uncertainty as to possible changes
in economic, legislative, industry, and other circumstances. As a result, the identification and interpretation of data and other information
and their use in developing and selecting assumptions from and among reasonable alternatives require the exercise of judgment. To the
extent that the assumed events do not occur, the outcome may vary substantially from anticipated or projected results, and, accordingly,
no opinion is expressed on the achievability of those forward-looking statements. No assurance can be given that any of the assumptions
relating to the forward-looking statements specified in the following information are accurate, and we assume no obligation to update
any such forward-looking statements. 

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES 

We prepare our financial statements in conformity
with U.S. GAAP, which requires management to make certain estimates and apply judgments. We base our estimates and judgments on historical
experience, current trends and other factors that management believes to be important at the time the financial statements are prepared.
Due to the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain, materially different amounts could be reported
under different conditions or using different assumptions. On a regular basis, we review our critical accounting policies and how they
are applied in the preparation of our financial statements. 

While we believe that the historical experience, current
trends and other factors considered support the preparation of our financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP, actual results could
differ from our estimates and such differences could be material. 

PLAN OF OPERATION 

Ultimate Holdings Group,
Inc. (we, us, our, the "Company" or the "Registrant") was incorporated in the State of Nevada on July 30, 2021. The
Company has been engaged in organizational efforts and obtaining initial financing. The Company was formed as a vehicle to pursue a business
combination and, as of October 31, 2024, had made no efforts to identify a possible business combination. As a result, as of October 31,
2024, the Company had not conducted negotiations or entered into a letter of intent concerning any target business. The current business
purpose of the Company is to seek the acquisition of or merger with, an existing company. 

The Company, based on proposed
business activities, is a "blank check" company. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC) defines those companies
as "any development stage company that is issuing a penny stock, within the meaning of Section 3 (a)(51)-1 of the Securities Exchange
Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act), and that has no specific business plan or purpose, or has indicated that its business plan
is to engage in a merger or acquisition with an unidentified company or companies or other entity or person." Under SEC Rule 12b-2
under the Exchange Act, the Company also qualifies as a shell company, because it has no or nominal assets (other than cash) and no or
nominal operations. Many states have enacted statutes, rules and regulations limiting the sale of securities of "blank check"
companies in their respective jurisdictions. Management does not intend to undertake any efforts to cause a market to develop in our securities,
either debt or equity, until we have successfully concluded a business combination. The Company intends to comply with the periodic reporting
requirements of the Exchange Act for so long as it is subject to those requirements. 

The Company was organized
as a vehicle to investigate and, if such investigation warrants, acquire a target company or business seeking the perceived advantages
of being a publicly held corporation. The Company s principal business objective for the next 12 months and beyond such time will
be to achieve long-term growth potential through a combination with a business rather than immediate, short-term earnings. The Company
will not restrict its potential candidate target companies to any specific business, industry or geographical location and, thus, may
acquire any type of business. The company may merge with or acquire another company in which the promoters, management, or promoters 
or managements affiliates or associates, directly or indirectly, have an ownership interest. 

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 

We generated 0 in revenue for the three months ended
October 31, 2024 and 2023. Our operating expenses for the three months ended October 31, 2024 and 2023 were 83,249 and 55,249, respectively.
Operating expenses were solely professional fees in nature. Our net loss for the three months period ended October 31, 2024 and 2023 was
 83,249 and 55,249, respectively. 

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES 

 In
assessing our liquidity and the substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern, we monitor and analyze cash on hand,
our ability to generate sufficient earnings in the future, and operating expenditure commitments. As of October 31, 2024, we generated
no revenue. Our working capital deficit was 325,262 and our accumulated deficit was 349,705. These factors raise substantial doubt about
our ability to continue as a going concern. Management
plans to fund operating expenses with borrowings from related parties. There is no assurance that the management s plan will be
successful. 

During the three
months ended October 31, 2024 and 2023, the Company s operating expenses were all paid by the related parties of the Company. The
Company had immaterial cash provided by (used in) operating activities, and did not have any cash flows from investing or financing activities. 

We have no known demands or commitments and are not
aware of any events or uncertainties as of October 31, 2024 that will result in or that are reasonably likely to materially increase or
decrease our current liquidity. 

We had no material commitments for capital expenditures
as of October 31, 2024.

OFF-BALANCE
SHEET ARRANGEMENTS 

The Company does not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on
the Company s financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital
expenditures or capital resources that is material to investors. 

ITEM 3 
 QUANTITATIVE
 AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 
 
 As a smaller
reporting company as defined by Item 10 of Regulation S-K, the Company is not required to provide the information required by
this Item. 

ITEM
 4 
 
 CONTROLS
 AND PROCEDURES 
 
 Evaluation
of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

 We maintain disclosure controls and procedures (as
defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed
in the reports we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified
in the SEC s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our chief executive
officer and chief financial officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding disclosure. In designing and evaluating the disclosure
controls and procedures, management recognized that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide
only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives, and management necessarily was required to apply its judgment in
evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures. 

Our Principal Executive Officer and Principal Financial
Officer, Ryohei Uetaki, evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of October 31, 2024. Based on that evaluation,
our Principal Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of
the period covered by this report were ineffective as a result of material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting. 

Changes in Internal Controls over Financial Reporting 

 There have been no significant changes to
the Company s internal controls over financial reporting that occurred during the quarter ended October 31, 2024 that materially
affected, or were reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal controls over financial reporting.
