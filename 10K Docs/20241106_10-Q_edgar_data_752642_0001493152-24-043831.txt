manufactured home communities containing approximately 
developed homesites, of which approximately 
are rental homes that we own. The 139 communities include two communities in central Florida owned through a joint venture with
Nuveen Real Estate in which the Company has a interest (Sebring Square and Rum Runner), the Countryside
Village expansion (Duck River Estates) and the Allentown expansion (River Bluff Estates) in Tennessee, which are now considered
separate communities, and also include two communities acquired through the Company s qualified opportunity zone fund (See
Note 5). These 139 communities are located in New Jersey, New York, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Tennessee, Indiana, Maryland, Michigan,
Alabama, South Carolina, Florida and Georgia. In November 2023, the Company expanded its joint venture relationship with Nuveen Real
Estate and formed a new joint venture entity for the development of a new manufactured housing community located in Honey Brook,
Pennsylvania. The community, once complete, will contain 113 manufactured home sites situated on approximately 61 acres. The
Company, through its wholly-owned taxable subsidiary, UMH Sales and Finance, Inc. S F ), sells manufactured homes
to residents and prospective residents in our communities. Inherent in the operations of manufactured home communities are site
vacancies. S F was established to fill these vacancies and enhance the value of the communities. The Company holds a 
controlling interest in its qualified opportunity zone fund which it created in 2022 to acquire, develop and redevelop manufactured
housing communities located in areas designated as Qualified Opportunity Zones by the U.S. Treasury Department to encourage
long-term investment in economically distressed areas. The consolidated financial statements of the Company include S F and all
of its other wholly-owned subsidiaries and its qualified opportunity zone fund. All intercompany transactions and balances have been
eliminated in consolidation. 

The
Company has elected to be taxed as a REIT under Sections 856-860 of the Internal Revenue Code (the Code and intends to
maintain its qualification as a REIT in the future. As a qualified REIT, with limited exceptions, the Company will not be taxed under
federal and certain state income tax laws at the corporate level on taxable income that it distributes to its shareholders. For special
tax provisions applicable to REITs, refer to Sections 856-860 of the Code. The Company is subject to franchise taxes in some of the states
in which the Company owns property. 

The
interim consolidated financial statements furnished herein have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted
in the United States of America U.S. GAAP applicable to interim financial information, the instructions to Form 10-Q,
and Article 10 of Regulation S-X. Accordingly, they do not include all of the information and footnotes required by U.S. GAAP for complete
financial statements. In the opinion of management, all adjustments (consisting of normal recurring accruals) considered necessary for
a fair presentation have been included. Operating results for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 are not necessarily
indicative of the results that may be expected for the year ending December 31, 2024. For further information, refer to the consolidated
financial statements and footnotes thereto included in the Company s annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31,
2023.

Revenue
from sales of manufactured homes is recognized in accordance with the core principle of ASC 606, at the time of closing when control
of the home transfers to the customer. After closing of the sale transaction, we generally have no remaining performance obligation. 

Interest
income is primarily from notes receivables for the previous sales of manufactured homes. Interest income on these receivables is accrued
based on the unpaid principal balances of the underlying loans on a level yield basis over the life of the loans. 

Dividend
income and gain (loss) on sales of marketable securities are from our investments in marketable securities and are presented separately
but are not in the scope of ASC 606. 

Other
income primarily consists of brokerage commissions for arranging for the sale of a home by a third party and other miscellaneous income.
This income is recognized when the transactions are completed and our performance obligations have been fulfilled.

The Company does not intend to increase its investments in this REIT securities portfolio. The REIT securities portfolio provides the
Company with additional diversification, liquidity and income. 

As
of September 30, 2024, the Company had total net unrealized losses of million in its REIT securities portfolio. For the three and
nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company recorded increases of million and million, respectively, in the fair value
of these marketable securities. The Company held seven securities that had unrealized losses as of September 30, 2024. 

million of equity capital for acquisitions
during a -month commitment period, with Nuveen having the option, subject to certain conditions, to elect to increase the parties 
total commitments by up to an additional million and to extend the commitment period for up to an additional four years. The LLC
Agreement called for committed capital to be funded by Nuveen and by the Company on a parity basis. The Company serves as managing
member of the joint venture entity and is responsible for day-to-day operations of the joint venture entity and management of its properties,
subject to obtaining approval of Nuveen Real Estate for major decisions (including investments, dispositions, financings, major capital
expenditures and annual budgets). The Company receives property management, asset management and other fees from the joint venture entity.
In addition, once each member has recouped its invested capital and received a net unlevered internal rate of return, of distributable
cash will be allocated pro rata in accordance with the members respective percentage interests and the Company and Nuveen will
receive a promote percentage equal to (in the case of the Company) and (in the case of Nuveen) of the remaining of distributable
cash. After years the Company may elect to consummate the crystallization of the promote. 

Under
the terms of the LLC Agreement, after December 8, 2024 or, if later, the second anniversary of the acquisition and placing in service
of a manufactured housing or recreational vehicle community, Nuveen will have a right to initiate the sale of one or more of the communities
owned by the joint venture entity. If Nuveen elects to initiate such a sale process, the Company may exercise a right of first refusal
to acquire Nuveen s interest in the community or communities to be sold for a purchase price corresponding to the greater of the
appraised value of such communities or the amount required to provide a net unlevered internal rate of return on Nuveen s
investment. 

The
LLC Agreement between the Company and Nuveen provided that until the capital contributions to the joint venture are fully funded or the
joint venture is terminated, the joint venture will be the exclusive vehicle for the Company to acquire any manufactured housing communities
and/or recreational vehicle communities that meet the joint venture s investment guidelines. These guidelines called for the joint
venture to acquire manufactured housing and recreational vehicle communities that have been developed within the previous and
are less than 20 occupied, are located in certain geographic markets, are projected to meet certain cash flow and internal rate of return
targets, and satisfy certain other criteria. The Company agreed to offer Nuveen the opportunity to have the joint venture acquire any
manufactured housing community or recreational vehicle community that meets these investment guidelines. Under the terms of the LLC Agreement,
if Nuveen determines not to pursue or approve any such acquisition, the Company would be permitted to acquire the property outside the
joint venture. Since the execution of the LLC Agreement, Nuveen has provided the Company with written waivers of the exclusivity provision
of the LLC Agreement with regard to two property acquisitions that may have fit the investment guidelines of the joint venture, which
permitted the Company to acquire them outside of the Nuveen joint venture. Except for investment opportunities that are offered to and
declined by Nuveen, the Company is prohibited from developing, owning, operating or managing manufactured housing communities or recreational
vehicle communities within a 10-mile radius of any community owned by the joint venture. However, this restriction does not apply with
respect to investments by the Company in existing communities operated by the Company. 

The
LLC Agreement provides that Nuveen will have the right to remove and replace the Company as managing member of the joint venture and
manager of the joint venture s properties if the Company breaches certain obligations or certain events occur. Upon such removal,
Nuveen may elect to buy out the Company s interest in the joint venture at of the value of the Company s interest in
the joint venture. If Nuveen does not exercise such buy-out right, the Company may, at specified times, elect to initiate a sale of the
communities owned by the joint venture, subject to a right of first refusal on the part of Nuveen. The LLC Agreement contains restrictions
on a party s right to transfer its interest in the joint venture without the approval of the other party. 

The
LLC Agreement requires the Company to offer Nuveen the opportunity to have the joint venture acquire a manufactured housing community
or recreational vehicle community that meets the investment guidelines. If Nuveen decides not to acquire the community through the joint
venture, however, the Company is free to purchase the community on its own outside of the joint venture.

December 2021 will not consummate additional acquisitions but will maintain its existing property portfolio, consisting of the Sebring
Square and Rum Runner communities. The Company and Nuveen also informally agreed that, unless otherwise determined in connection with
any specific future investment, capital for any such new joint venture entity would continue to be funded by Nuveen and by the
Company on a parity basis and that other terms would be similar to those of the LLC Agreement entered into in 2021, except that the amounts

guidelines. The terms of the new joint venture entity are set forth in a Limited Liability Company Agreement dated as of November 29,
2023 (the Second LLC Agreement entered into between a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company and an affiliate of Nuveen.

entity and management of its properties, subject to obtaining approval of Nuveen Real Estate for major decisions (including investments,
dispositions, financings, major capital expenditures and annual budgets). The Company receives property management oversite, development

In
addition to the Company s investment in marketable securities at fair value, the Company is required to disclose certain information
about fair values of its other financial instruments, as defined in ASC 825-10, Financial Instruments. Estimates of fair value are made
at a specific point in time, based upon, where available, relevant market prices and information about the financial instrument. Such
estimates do not include any premium or discount that could result from offering for sale at one time the Company s entire holdings
of a particular financial instrument. All of the Company s marketable securities have quoted market prices. However, for a portion
of the Company s other financial instruments, no quoted market value exists. Therefore, estimates of fair value are necessarily
based on a number of significant assumptions (many of which involve events outside the control of management). Such assumptions include
assessments of current economic conditions, perceived risks associated with these financial instruments and their counterparties, future
expected loss experience and other factors. Given the uncertainties surrounding these assumptions, the reported fair values represent
estimates only and, therefore, cannot be compared to the historical accounting model. Use of different assumptions or methodologies is
likely to result in significantly different fair value estimates. 

The
fair value of cash and cash equivalents and notes receivable approximates their current carrying amounts since all such items are
short-term in nature. The fair value of variable rate loans payable approximate their current carrying amounts since such amounts
payable are approximately at a weighted-average current market rate of interest. As of September 30, 2024, the estimated fair value
of fixed rate mortgages payable amounted to 
million and the carrying value of fixed rate mortgages payable amounted to 
million.

21st Mortgage provides financing for home purchasers in the Company s communities. 21st Mortgage has no recourse against the Company
under the MHRA except in instances where the Customer defaults before two scheduled monthly payments are paid by the purchaser and the
default is based on any dispute between S F surrounding the terms or execution of the purchase and sale of the home. Upon such a
default, S F is to take assignment of the loan from 21st Mortgage for the unpaid principal balance plus accrued interest. As of September
30, 2024, no loans have been originated under the MHRA. 

S F
entered into a Chattel Loan Origination, Sale and Servicing Agreement COP Program with Triad Financial Services, effective

applications are initially submitted to Triad for consideration by Triad s portfolio of outside lenders. If a loan application
does not meet the criteria for outside financing, the application is then considered for financing under the COP Program. If the loan
is approved under the COP Program, then it is originated by Triad, assigned to S F and then assigned by S F to the Company. Included
in Notes and Other Receivables is approximately million of loans that the Company acquired under the COP Program as of September

The
Company and one of its subsidiaries are parties to a Limited Liability Company Agreement dated as of December 8, 2021 with an affiliate
of Nuveen, which governs the initial joint venture entity between the Company and Nuveen. The LLC Agreement provided for the parties
to initially fund up to million of equity capital for acquisitions during a -month commitment period, with Nuveen having the option,
subject to certain conditions, to elect to increase the parties total commitments by up to an additional million and to extend
the commitment period for up to an additional four years. The Company is required to fund of the committed capital and Nuveen is
required to fund . All such funding will be on a parity basis. Since the execution of the LLC Agreement, this joint venture entity
has acquired two properties. The Company and Nuveen have continued to seek, and are continuing to seek, opportunities to acquire additional
manufactured housing and/or recreational vehicle communities that are under development and/or newly developed and meet certain other
investment guidelines. The Company and Nuveen have informally agreed that any future acquisitions would be made by one or more new joint
venture entities to be formed for that purpose and that the existing joint venture entity formed in December 2021 will not consummate
additional acquisitions but will maintain its existing property portfolio. The Company and Nuveen also informally agreed that, unless
otherwise determined in connection with any specific future investment, capital for any such new joint venture entity would continue
to be funded by Nuveen and by the Company on a parity basis and that other terms would be similar to those of the LLC Agreement
entered into in 2021, except that the amounts of the parties respective capital commitments will be determined on a property-by-property
basis. In 2023, the Company and Nuveen formed a new joint venture entity, governed by a new joint venture agreement, focused on the development
of a new manufactured housing community located in Honey Brook, Pennsylvania. The community, once complete, is expected to contain 
manufactured home sites situated on approximately acres. As with the 2021 LLC Agreement, capital contributions to the joint venture
entity formed for this project will be funded by Nuveen and by the Company on a parity basis and the other terms (including restrictions
on the Company s right to acquire manufacturing housing communities that meet the LLC Agreement s investment guidelines without
first offering Nuveen an opportunity to participate in the acquisition) are similar to those set forth in the LLC Agreement entered into
in 2021 (See Note 4).

community, once complete, will contain 113 manufactured home sites situated on approximately 61 acres. 

29 

As
of September 30, 2024, the Company owns and operates 139 manufactured home communities containing approximately 26,200 developed
homesites, of which approximately 10,300 are rental homes that we own. The 139 communities include two communities in central
Florida owned through a joint venture with Nuveen Real Estate in which the Company has a 40 interest (Sebring Square and Rum
Runner), the Countryside Village expansion (Duck River Estates) and the Allentown expansion (River Bluff Estates)
in Tennessee, which are now considered separate communities, and also include two communities acquired through the Company s
qualified opportunity zone fund (See Note 5). These 139 communities are located in New Jersey, New York, Ohio, Pennsylvania,
Tennessee, Indiana, Maryland, Michigan, Alabama, South Carolina, Florida and Georgia. 

The
Company is in preliminary discussions with a leading national homebuilder regarding the potential formation of a joint venture to develop
approximately 131 acres of undeveloped land adjacent to one of the Company s existing manufactured home communities in southern
New Jersey. If necessary governmental approvals can be obtained, the purpose of the joint venture would be to construct roads, infrastructure
and other site improvements on the property and then sell the improved lots to an affiliate of the Company s joint venture partner,
which would construct luxury single family residential homes to sell to purchasers. It is envisioned that the joint venture partner would
fully fund the costs of required site improvements and obtain all approvals. The Company would contribute the real property to the
joint venture and receive a percentage of the sale price of each home. If the parties elect to proceed, it is anticipated that the joint
venture partner would seek preliminary subdivision and site plan approvals over the next two years and, if these approvals are obtained,
the joint venture would then be formally established. Pursuit of this project would be contingent upon execution of definitive documentation
setting forth the terms of an agreement between the parties and a 90-day due diligence review period for the benefit of the joint venture
partner. There can be no assurance that the Company and its potential joint venture partner will reach agreement or proceed with this
arrangement or that required governmental approvals can be obtained. 

The
Company earns income from the operation of its manufactured home communities, leasing of manufactured homesites, the rental of manufactured
homes, the sale and finance of manufactured homes and the brokering of home sales, self-storage leases, oil and gas leases, cable service
agreements and from appreciation in the values of the manufactured home communities and vacant land owned by the Company. In addition,
the Company receives property management and other fees from its joint venture arrangements with Nuveen and from its opportunity zone
fund. Management views the Company as a single segment based on its method of internal reporting in addition to its allocation of capital
and resources. 

30 

The
Company believes that its capital structure, which allows for the ownership of assets using a balanced combination of equity obtained
through the issuance of common stock, preferred stock and debt, will enhance shareholder returns as the properties appreciate over time. 

The
Company intends to continue to increase its real estate investments. Our business plan includes acquiring communities that over time
are expected to yield in excess of our cost of funds and then investing in physical improvements, including adding rental homes onto
otherwise vacant sites. This has resulted in increased occupancy rates and improved operating results. For the three and nine months
ended September 30, 2024, rental and related income increased 8 and 9 , respectively, from the prior year periods and Community Net
Operating Income NOI ), as defined below, increased 7 and 11 , respectively. Same property NOI, which includes communities
owned and operated as of January 1, 2023 (excluding Memphis Blues, Duck River Estates and River Bluff Estates), increased 7 and 11 
for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, over the prior year period driven by a 70 basis point increase
in occupancy, to 87.7 , and a rental rate increase of 4.5 . We have been positioning ourselves for future growth and will continue to
seek opportunistic investments. In addition, on behalf of our joint venture arrangement with Nuveen Real Estate, we will seek opportunities
to acquire manufactured home communities that are under development and/or newly developed and meet certain other investment guidelines.
We will also seek additional opportunities, through our opportunity zone fund, to acquire communities that require substantial capital
investment and are located in qualified opportunity zones. 

For
the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, sales of manufactured homes increased 10 and 6 , respectively from the prior year
periods. Demand for quality affordable housing remains healthy while inventory is scarce. Our property type offers substantial comparative
value that should result in increased demand. 

The
macro-economic environment and current housing fundamentals continue to favor home rentals. Due to high mortgage rates and lack of inventory,
the higher cost of buying a home versus renting one is at its most extreme since 1996. Despite mortgage rates hitting a two-year low this past September
as they moved toward 6 , rates are still too high for many buyers and according to the National Association of Realtors, sales of existing
homes are on track for their worst year since 1995 for the second year in a row. Even if this year s sales slightly exceed last
year s level, sales are still on track for the worst two-year period since the mid-1990s, when the country s population was
considerably smaller. Rental homes in a manufactured home community
allow the resident to obtain the efficiencies of factory-built housing and the amenities of community living for less than the cost of
other forms of affordable housing. We continue to see strong demand for rental homes. We have added an additional 284 rental homes during
the first nine months of 2024, net of home sales. This brought the total number of rental homes to approximately 10,300 rental homes,
or 39.7 of total sites. Occupied rental homes represented approximately 42.9 of total occupied sites at quarter end. Occupancy in rental
homes continues to be strong and was at 94.4 as of September 30, 2024. Our manufactured home communities compare favorably with other
types of rental housing, including apartments, and we will continue to allocate capital to rental home purchases, as demand dictates. 

See
PART I, Item 1 Business in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 for a more complete
discussion of the economic and industry-wide factors relevant to the Company and the opportunities and challenges, and risks on which
the Company is focused.

Significant
Accounting Policies and Estimates 

The
discussion and analysis of the Company s financial condition and results of operations are based upon the Company s consolidated
financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America U.S. GAAP ). The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments
that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities
at the date of the Company s consolidated financial statements. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different
assumptions or conditions. 

On
a regular basis, management evaluates our assumptions, judgments and estimates. Management believes there have been no material changes
to the items that we disclosed as our significant accounting policies and estimates under Item 7, Management s Discussion
and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31,
2023. 

Supplemental
Measures 

In
addition to the results reported in accordance with U.S. GAAP, management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and
results of operations include certain non-U.S. GAAP financial measures that in management s view of the business we believe are
meaningful as they allow the investor the ability to understand key operating details of our business both with and without regard to
certain accounting conventions or items that may not always be indicative of recurring annual cash flow of the portfolio. These non-U.S.
GAAP financial measures as determined and presented by us may not be comparable to related or similarly titled measures reported by other
companies, and include Community Net Operating Income Community NOI ), Funds from Operations Attributable to Common Shareholders FFO and Normalized Funds from Operations Attributable to Common Shareholders Normalized FFO ). 

We
define Community NOI as rental and related income less community operating expenses such as real estate taxes, repairs and maintenance,
community salaries, utilities, insurance and other expenses. We believe that Community NOI is helpful to investors and analysts as a
direct measure of the actual operating results of our manufactured home communities, rather than our Company overall. Community NOI should
not be considered a substitute for the reported results prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Community NOI should not be considered
as an alternative to net income (loss) as an indicator of our financial performance, or to cash flows as a measure of liquidity; nor
is it indicative of funds available for our cash needs, including our ability to make cash distributions.

We
assess and measure our overall operating results based upon FFO, an industry performance measure which management believes is a useful
indicator of our operating performance. FFO is used by industry analysts and investors as a supplemental operating performance measure
of a REIT. FFO, as defined by Nareit, represents net income (loss) attributable to common shareholders, as defined by accounting principles
generally accepted in the U.S. U.S. GAAP ), excluding gains or losses from sales of previously depreciated real estate
assets, impairment charges related to depreciable real estate assets, the change in the fair value of marketable securities, and the
gain or loss on the sale of marketable securities plus certain non-cash items such as real estate asset depreciation and amortization.
Included in the Nareit FFO White Paper - 2018 Restatement, is an option pertaining to assets incidental to our main business in the calculation
of Nareit FFO to make an election to include or exclude gains and losses on the sale of these assets, such as marketable equity securities,
and include or exclude mark-to-market changes in the value recognized on these marketable equity securities. In conjunction with the
adoption of the FFO White Paper - 2018 Restatement, for all periods presented, we have elected to exclude the change in the fair value
of marketable securities from our FFO calculation. Nareit created FFO as a non-U.S. GAAP supplemental measure of REIT operating performance.
We define Normalized Funds from Operations Attributable to Common Shareholders Normalized FFO ), as FFO, excluding certain
one-time charges. FFO and Normalized FFO should be considered as supplemental measures of operating performance used by REITs. FFO and
Normalized FFO exclude historical cost depreciation as an expense and may facilitate the comparison of REITs which have a different cost
basis. However, other REITs may use different methodologies to calculate FFO and Normalized FFO and, accordingly, our FFO and Normalized
FFO may not be comparable to all other REITs. The items excluded from FFO and Normalized FFO are significant components in understanding
the Company s financial performance. 

FFO
and Normalized FFO (i) do not represent cash flow from operations as defined by U.S. GAAP; (ii) should not be considered as an alternative
to net income (loss) as a measure of operating performance or to cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities; and (iii)
are not alternatives to cash flow as a measure of liquidity.

Changes
In Results Of Operations 

Rental
and related income increased 8 from 48.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023 to 51.9 million for the three months
ended September 30, 2024. Rental and related income increased 9 from 140.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 to
 153.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. This increase was due to increases in rental rates and same property occupancy
and additional rental homes. The Company has been raising rental rates by approximately 5 to 6 annually at most communities. Same property
occupancy has increased 70 basis points from 87.0 as of September 30, 2023 to 87.7 at September 30, 2024. Occupied rental homes increased
4 from approximately 9,300 homes at September 30, 2023 to 9,700 homes at September 30, 2024. 

Community
operating expenses increased 9 from 20.7 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023 to 22.5 million for the three
months ended September 30, 2024. Community operating expenses increased 7 from 60.8 million for the nine months ended September
30, 2023 to 65.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. These increases were due to an increase in payroll costs,
real estate taxes, rental home expenses and storm cleanup. 

Community
NOI increased 7 from 27.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023 to 29.4 million for the three months ended September
30, 2024. Community NOI increased 11 from 79.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 to 88.6 million for the nine months
ended September 30, 2024. These increases were primarily due to increases in rental rates, occupancy and rental homes. The Company s
operating expense ratio (defined as community operating expenses divided by rental and related income) was 43.3 and 42.4 for the three
and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 42.9 and 43.3 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively. Many
recently acquired communities have deferred maintenance requiring higher than normal expenditures in the first few years of ownership.
Since most of the community expenses consist of fixed costs, as occupancy rates increase, these expense ratios are expected to continue
to improve. Due to the Company s ability to increase its rental rates annually (subject to limitations on rent increases in certain
jurisdictions), increasing costs due to inflation and changing prices have generally not had a material effect on revenue and income
from continuing operations. 

Sales
of manufactured homes increased 10 from 7.9 million, or 90 homes, for the three months ended September 30, 2023 to 8.7 million, or
100 homes, for the three months ended September 30, 2024. Sales of manufactured homes increased 6 from 23.4 million, or 264 homes,
for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 to 24.9 million, or 300 homes, for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. Cost of sales
of manufactured homes amounted to 5.4 million and 5.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively.
Cost of sales of manufactured homes amounted to 16.5 million and 16.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023,
respectively. The gross profit percentage was 38 and 33 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and 34 
and 31 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Selling expenses, which includes salaries, commissions,
advertising and other miscellaneous expenses, amounted to 1.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, and 5.2
million and 5.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Gain from the sales operations (defined
as sales of manufactured homes, less cost of sales of manufactured homes, less selling expenses), excluding interest on the financing
of inventory, amounted to 1.5 million or 17 of total sales and 783,000 or 10 of total sales for the three months ended September
30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Gain from the sales operations, excluding interest on the financing of inventory, amounted to 3.3 million
or 13 of total sales and 2.1 million or 9 of total sales for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Many
of the costs associated with sales, such as salaries, and to an extent, advertising and promotion, are fixed. 

35 

Despite
high mortgage rates, home prices have continued to rise as fewer sellers are listing homes and inventories decline resulting in the inherent
relative affordability of our property type becoming more and more apparent, which should result in increased demand. The Company continues
to be optimistic about future sales and rental prospects given the fundamental need for affordable housing. The Company believes that
sales of new homes produce new rental revenue and represent an investment in the upgrading of our communities. 

General
and administrative expenses remained relatively stable from the three months ended September 30, 2023 to September 30, 2024. General
and administrative expenses increased 5 from 14.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 to 15.3 million for the nine
months ended September 30, 2024, primarily due to an increase in meeting costs as a result of our biennial in-person employee training
meeting (which was not held last year) and an increase in payroll and related personnel cost. Although general and administrative expenses increased for the nine months,
general and administrative expenses as
a percentage of gross revenue (total income plus interest, dividends and other income) was down for both the three and the nine months ended September 30, 2024
as compared to same periods ended September 30, 2023. These percentages were 7.1 and 8.3 for the three and nine months
ended September 30, 2024, respectively, as compared to 7.7 and 8.6 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively. 

Depreciation
expense increased 4 from 14.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023 to 14.7 million for the three months ended September
30, 2024. Depreciation expense increased 8 from 41.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 to 44.4 million for the
nine months ended September 30, 2024. This increase was primarily due to the increase in rental homes during 2023 and 2024. 

Interest
income increased 39 from 1.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023 to 1.8 million for the three months ended September
30, 2024. Interest income increased 33 from 3.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 to 4.9 million for the nine months
ended September 30, 2024. This increase was primarily due to an increase in the average balance of notes receivable from 68.9 million
at September 30, 2023 to 79.2 million at September 30, 2024. The weighted average interest rate earned on these notes receivable increased
20 basis points and were approximately 7.1 and 6.9 as of September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. 

Dividend
income decreased 30 from 508,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2023 to 357,000 for the three months ended September 30,
2024. Dividend income decreased 38 from 1.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 to 1.1 million for the nine months
ended September 30, 2024. This decrease was due to reduced dividends as a result of our smaller securities portfolio and dividend cuts.
The weighted average yield on our dividends received from our marketable securities investments decreased 330 basis points and were approximately
4.3 and 7.6 at September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. 

36 

The
Company recognized a loss on sales of marketable securities of 3.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. The Company
recognized a gain on sales of marketable securities of 226,000 and 183,000 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023,
respectively. The increase (decrease) in fair value of marketable securities amounted to an increase of 5.5 million and a decrease of
 5.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The increase (decrease) in fair value of marketable
securities amounted to an increase of 3.5 million and a decrease of 10.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023,
respectively. As of September 30, 2024, the Company had total net unrealized losses of 36.2 million in its REIT securities portfolio. 

Interest
expense, including amortization of financing costs, decreased 15 from 7.7 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023 to
 6.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024. Interest expense, including amortization of financing costs, decreased 13 
from 24.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 to 21.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. This decrease
was due to a decrease in the average balance of mortgages and loans from 624.6 million at September 30, 2023 to 552.1 million at September
30, 2024. The weighted average interest rate on our total debt decreased from 4.7 
at September 30, 2023 to 4.4 at September 30, 2024, respectively. 

Changes
in Financial Condition 

Total
investment property increased 4 or 58.0 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. In addition to adding 284 rental homes,
net of 202 rental homes sold to its communities during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company is preparing sites for
additional homes to be added during the year. Occupied rentals increased by 310 rental homes from December 31, 2023 to September 30,
2024. The Company s occupancy rate on its rental homes portfolio increased 40 basis points and was 94.4 at September 30, 2024
as compared to 94.0 at December 31, 2023. 

Marketable
securities decreased 1 or 328,000 during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. This decrease was due to sales of securities with
a cost basis of 3.8 million offset by a net increase in the fair value of 3.5 million. 

Mortgages
payable, net of unamortized debt issuance costs, decreased 2 or 8.2 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 due to
principal payments. 

Loans
payable, net of unamortized debt issuance costs, decreased 72 or 67.5 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. This
decrease was due to a decrease of 70 million on our unsecured line of credit offset by an increase of 3.1 million on our revolving
lines of credit for the purchase of inventory. 

37 

L iquidity
and Capital Resources 

The
Company s focus is on real estate investments, including investment in rental homes. The Company s principal liquidity demands
have historically been, and are expected to continue to be, distributions to the Company s shareholders, acquisitions, capital
improvements, development and expansions of properties, debt service, purchases of manufactured home inventory and rental homes, financing
of manufactured home sales and payments of expenses relating to real estate operations. We anticipate that the liquidity demands of the
recent properties acquired will be met by the operations of these acquisitions. The Company s ability to generate cash adequate
to meet these demands is dependent primarily on income from its real estate investments, the sale of real estate investments, refinancing
of mortgage debt, leveraging of real estate investments, availability of bank borrowings, lines of credit, and other incurrence of indebtedness,
proceeds from the DRIP, and access to the capital markets, including through its Common and Preferred ATM Programs. 

In
addition to cash generated through operations, the Company uses a variety of sources to fund its cash needs, including acquisitions.
The Company may sell marketable securities from its investment portfolio, borrow on its unsecured credit facility or lines of
credit, incur other indebtedness, finance and refinance its properties, and/or raise capital through the DRIP and capital markets,
including through the Company s ATM Programs. In order to provide financial flexibility to opportunistically access the
capital markets, on March 12, 2024, the Company implemented its 2024 March Common ATM Program which allowed the Company to offer and
sell shares of the Company s Common Stock, having an aggregate sales price of up to 150 million, from time to time through
the Distribution Agents. In addition, on September 16, 2024, the Company terminated its successful 2024 March Common ATM Program and
implemented a new 2024 September Common ATM Program which allows the Company to offer and sell shares of the Company s Common
Stock, having an aggregate sales price of up to 150 million, from time to time through the Distribution Agents. Additionally,
during 2024 the Company expanded the borrowing capacity on its unsecured revolving credit facility from 180 million in available
borrowings to 260 million in available borrowings. 

The
Company intends to continue to increase its real estate investments. Our business plan includes acquiring communities that over time
are expected to yield in excess of our cost of funds and then investing in physical improvements, including adding rental homes onto
otherwise vacant sites. As part of this plan, we intend to continue to seek opportunities, through our opportunity zone fund, to acquire
communities that require substantial capital investment and are located in qualified opportunity zones. In addition, on behalf of our
joint venture with Nuveen Real Estate, we will continue to seek opportunities to acquire manufactured home communities that are under
development and/or newly developed and meet certain other investment guidelines. There is no guarantee that any of these additional opportunities
will materialize or that the Company will be able to take advantage of such opportunities. The growth of our real estate portfolio and
success of our joint venture depends on the availability of suitable properties which meet the Company s investment criteria and
appropriate financing. Competition in the market areas in which the Company operates is significant. To the extent that funds or appropriate
communities are not available, fewer acquisitions will be made. 

38 

The
Company continues to strengthen its capital and liquidity positions. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company issued
and sold 9.4 million shares of Common Stock through our Common ATM Programs, at a weighted average price of 17.55 per share, generating
gross proceeds of 166.0 million and net proceeds of 163.2 million, after offering expenses. Subsequent to quarter end, the Company
issued and sold an additional 170,000 shares of its Common Stock under the 2024 September Common ATM Program at a weighted average price
of 18.92 per share, generating net proceeds of 3.2 million, after offering expenses. 

In
addition, during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company issued and sold 664,000 shares of Series D Preferred Stock through
our 2023 Preferred ATM Program, at a weighted average price of 23.35 per share, generating gross proceeds of 15.5 million and net proceeds
of 15.3 million, after offering expenses. Subsequent to quarter end, the Company issued and sold an additional 247,000 shares of its
Series D Preferred Stock under the 2023 Preferred ATM Program at a weighted average price of 23.90 per share, generating net proceeds

Cautionary
Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements 

Statements
contained in this Form 10-Q, that are not historical facts are forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities
Act of 1933, as amended (the Securities Act ), and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange
Act ). Forward-looking statements provide our current expectations or forecasts of future events. Forward-looking statements include
statements about the Company s expectations, beliefs, intentions, plans, objectives, goals, strategies, future events, performance
and underlying assumptions and other statements that are not historical facts. Forward-looking statements can be identified by their
use of forward-looking words, such as may, will, anticipate, expect, believe, 
 intend, plan, should, seek or comparable terms, or the negative use of those
words, but the absence of these words does not necessarily mean that a statement is not forward-looking. 

 The
forward-looking statements are based on our beliefs, assumptions and expectations of our future performance, taking into account all
information currently available to us. Forward-looking statements are not predictions of future events. These beliefs, assumptions and
expectations can change as a result of many possible events or factors, not all of which are known to us. Some of these factors are described
below and under the headings Business , Risk Factors and Management s Discussion and Analysis
of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. These and other risks, uncertainties and factors could cause our actual results
to differ materially from those included in any forward-looking statements we make. Any forward-looking statement speaks only as of the
date on which it is made. New risks and uncertainties arise over time, and it is not possible for us to predict those events or how they
may affect us. Except as required by law, we are not obligated to, and do not intend to, update or revise any forward-looking statements,
whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. Important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially
from our expectations include, among others: 

changes
 in the real estate market conditions and general economic conditions; 
 
 the
 inherent risks associated with owning real estate, including local real estate market conditions,
 governing laws and regulations affecting manufactured housing communities and illiquidity

 and increases in costs, including personnel, insurance and the cost of purchasing manufactured
 homes;

 our
 ability to integrate acquired properties and operations into existing operations; 
 
 the
 availability of other debt and equity financing alternatives; 
 
 continued
 ability to access the debt or equity markets; 
 
 the
 loss of any member of our management team; 
 
 our
 ability to maintain internal controls and processes to ensure all transactions are accounted
 for properly, all relevant disclosures and filings are made in a timely manner in accordance
 with all rules and regulations, and any potential fraud or embezzlement is thwarted or detected;

the
 ability of manufactured home buyers to obtain financing; 
 
 the
 level of repossessions by manufactured home lenders; 
 
 market
 conditions affecting our investment securities; 
 
 changes
 in federal or state tax rules or regulations that could have adverse tax consequences; 
 
 our
 ability to qualify as a real estate investment trust for federal income tax purposes; 
 
 risks
 and uncertainties related to pandemics or other highly infectious or contagious diseases;
 and, 
 
 those
 risks and uncertainties referenced under the heading Risk Factors contained
 in this Form 10-Q and the Company s other filings with the Securities and Exchange
 Commission, including its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023.

to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements whether as a result of new information, future events, or otherwise.
