Revenues are generated through the receipt of advisory and financing fees. Institutional sales, trading and research services focus on the trading of equity and fixed income products with institutions, corporations, government and non-profit entities. Revenues are generated through commissions and sales credits earned on equity and fixed income institutional sales activities, net interest revenues on trading securities held in inventory, profits and losses from trading these securities, and fees for research services and corporate access offerings. Also, the Company has created alternative asset management funds in merchant banking and healthcare in order to invest firm capital and to manage capital from outside investors. The Company records gains and losses from investments in these funds and receives management and performance fees. 
 
 Basis of Presentation 
 The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles ("U.S. GAAP") for interim financial information and the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC"). Pursuant to this guidance, certain information and disclosures have been omitted that are included within the complete annual financial statements. Except as disclosed herein, there have been no material changes in the information reported in the financial statements and related disclosures in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. 
 
 The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Piper Sandler Companies, its wholly owned subsidiaries, and all other entities in which the Company has a controlling financial interest. Noncontrolling interests represent equity interests in consolidated entities that are not attributable, either directly or indirectly, to Piper Sandler Companies. Noncontrolling interests include the minority equity holders' proportionate share of the equity in the Company's alternative asset management funds. All material intercompany balances have been eliminated. 
 
 Management is required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Although these estimates and assumptions are based on the best information available, actual results could differ from those estimates.

If earned, amounts will be paid on various dates through the second quarter of 2029.

The Company is obligated to acquire the securities sold short at prevailing market prices, which may exceed the amount reflected on the consolidated statements of financial condition. The Company economically hedges changes in the market value of its financial instruments and other inventory positions owned using inventory positions sold, but not yet purchased, interest rate derivatives, U.S. treasury bond futures and options, and equity option contracts.

 (1) Noncontrolling interests are attributable to unrelated third-party ownership in consolidated alternative asset management funds. 
 
 At September 30, 2024, investments carried on a cost basis had an estimated fair market value of million. Because valuation estimates were based upon management's judgment, investments carried at cost would be categorized as Level III assets in the fair value hierarchy, if they were carried at fair value. 
 
 Investments accounted for under the equity method include general and limited partnership interests. The carrying value of these investments is based on the investment vehicle's net asset value. The net assets of investment partnerships consist of investments in both marketable and non-marketable securities. The underlying investments held by such partnerships are valued based on the estimated fair value determined by management in the Company's capacity as general partner or investor and, in the case of investments in unaffiliated investment partnerships, are based on financial statements prepared by the unaffiliated general partners.

 Incentive Plan 
 The Incentive Plan permits the grant of equity awards, including restricted stock, restricted stock units and non-qualified stock options, to the Company's employees and directors for up to million shares of common stock million shares remained available for future issuance under the Incentive Plan as of September 30, 2024). The Company believes that such awards help align the interests of employees and directors with those of shareholders and serve as an employee retention tool. The Incentive Plan provides for accelerated vesting of awards if there is a severance event, a change in control of the Company (as defined in the Incentive Plan), in the event of a participant's death, and at the discretion of the compensation committee of the Company's board of directors. 
 
 Restricted Stock Awards 
 
 Restricted stock grants are valued at the market price of the Company's common stock on the date of grant and are amortized over the requisite service period. The Company grants shares of restricted stock to employees as part of year-end compensation ("Annual Grants") and upon initial hiring or as a retention award ("Sign-on Grants" or "Inducement Grants").

in equal installments. Substantially all Annual Grants provide for continued vesting after termination of employment, so long as the employee does not violate certain post-termination restrictions set forth in the award agreement or any agreements entered into upon termination. The Company determined the service inception date precedes the grant date for these Annual Grants, and that the post-termination restrictions do not meet the criteria for an in-substance service condition, as defined by FASB Accounting Standards Codification Topic 718, "Compensation Stock Compensation." Accordingly, restricted stock granted as part of these Annual Grants is expensed in the period in which those awards are deemed to be earned, which is generally the calendar year preceding the February grant date. For example, the Company recognized compensation expense during fiscal year 2023 for its February 2024 Annual Grant. If an equity award related to these Annual Grants is forfeited as a result of violating the post-termination restrictions, the lower of the fair value of the award at grant date or the fair value of the award at the date of forfeiture is recorded within the consolidated statements of operations as a reversal of compensation expense. 
 
 Sign-on Grants are used as a recruiting tool for new employees and are issued to current employees as a retention tool. These awards have both cliff and ratable vesting terms, and the employees must fulfill service requirements in exchange for rights to the awards. Compensation expense is amortized on a straight-line basis from the grant date over the requisite service period, generally three to . Employees forfeit unvested shares upon termination of employment and a reversal of compensation expense is recorded. 
 
 Inducement Grants are issued as a retention tool in conjunction with certain acquisitions. During 2022, the Company granted million shares) in restricted stock under the Incentive Plan in conjunction with its acquisitions of Cornerstone Macro Research LP, including its subsidiary, Cornerstone Macro LLC (collectively, "Cornerstone Macro") and Stamford Partners LLP. These restricted shares are subject to graded vesting, and employees must fulfill service requirements in exchange for the rights to the restricted shares. Compensation expense is amortized on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period, generally three to . Employees forfeit unvested shares upon termination of employment and a reversal of compensation expense is recorded. 
 
 Annually, the Company grants stock to its non-employee directors. The stock-based compensation paid to non-employee directors is fully expensed on the grant date and included within outside services expense on the consolidated statements of operations. 
 
 Restricted Stock Units 
 
 The Company grants restricted stock units to its leadership team ("Leadership Grants"). Restricted stock units will vest and convert to shares of common stock at the end of each -month performance period only if the Company satisfies predetermined performance and/or market conditions over the performance period. The performance condition requires the Company to achieve certain average adjusted return on equity targets, as defined in the terms of the award agreements. The market condition requires the Company to achieve a certain total shareholder return ("TSR") relative to members of a predetermined peer group. Under the terms of these awards, the number of units that will actually vest and convert to shares will be based on the extent to which the Company achieves the specified targets during each performance period.

-month performance period. The Company reevaluates achievement of the performance condition by grant year each reporting period with changes in estimated outcomes accounted for using a cumulative effect adjustment to compensation expense. Compensation expense will be recognized only if the performance condition is met. Employees forfeit unvested restricted stock units upon termination of employment with a corresponding reversal of compensation expense. 
 2023 2022 
 
 The market condition must be met for the market condition portion of the award to vest. Compensation expense will be recognized regardless if the market condition is satisfied, and is amortized on a straight-line basis over the -month requisite service period (or earlier if age and service conditions are met, as described below). Employees forfeit unvested restricted stock units upon termination of employment with a corresponding reversal of compensation expense. 
 2023 2026 2022 2025 2021 2024 2020 2023 
 
 Because the vesting of the market condition portion of the award depends on the Company's TSR relative to a peer group, the valuation modeled the performance of the peer group as well as the correlation between the Company and the peer group. The expected stock price volatility assumptions were determined using historical volatility, as correlation coefficients can only be developed through historical volatility. The risk-free interest rates were determined based on U.S. Treasury bond yields. 
 
 The compensation committee of the Company's board of directors included defined retirement provisions in its Leadership Grants. Certain grantees meeting defined age and service requirements will be fully vested in the awards as long as performance and post-termination obligations are met throughout the performance period. These retirement-eligible grants are expensed in the period in which those awards are deemed to be earned, which is the calendar year preceding the February grant date. 
 
 Stock Options 
 
 On February 15, 2023 and February 15, 2018, the Company granted options to certain executive officers. These options are expensed on a straight-line basis over the required service period of , based on the estimated fair value of the award on the respective date of grant. The exercise price per share is equal to the closing price on the respective date of grant plus ten percent. These options are subject to graded vesting, beginning on the third anniversary of the respective grant date, so long as the employee remains continuously employed by the Company. The maximum term of these stock options is .

Dividend yield Expected stock price volatility Expected life of options (in years) Fair value of options granted (per share) 
 
 The risk-free interest rate assumption was based on the U.S. Treasury bond yield with a maturity equal to the expected life of the options. The dividend yield assumption was based on the assumed dividend payout over the expected life of the options. The expected stock price volatility assumption was determined using historical volatility, as correlation coefficients can only be developed through historical volatility. The expected life of options assumption was determined using the simplified method due to the Company's limited exercise information. The simplified method calculates the expected term as the midpoint of the vesting term and the original contractual term of the options. 
 
 Inducement Plans 
 Inducement plan awards are amortized as compensation expense on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period. Employees forfeit unvested shares upon termination of employment and a reversal of compensation expense is recorded.

 Deferred Compensation Plans 
 The Company maintains various deferred compensation arrangements for employees.

Forfeitures of MFRS awards are recorded as a reduction of compensation and benefits expense within the consolidated statements of operations. 
 
 The Company grants MFRS awards to qualifying employees in February of each year ("Annual MFRS Awards"). Annual MFRS Awards represent a portion of these employees' compensation for performance in the preceding year, similar to the Company's Annual Grants. Annual MFRS Awards vest ratably over in equal installments. Annual MFRS Awards provide for continued vesting after termination of employment so long as the employee does not violate certain post-termination restrictions set forth in the award agreement or any agreement entered into upon termination. Annual MFRS Awards are owned by employee recipients (subject to the aforementioned vesting restrictions) and as such are not included on the consolidated statements of financial condition.

Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date they are made, and we undertake no obligation to update them in light of new information or future events. 
 
 EXPLANATION OF NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES 
 We have included financial measures that are not prepared in accordance with United States ("U.S.") generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP"). Adjustments to these non-GAAP financial measures include (1) the exclusion of investment (income)/loss and non-compensation expenses related to noncontrolling interests, (2) the exclusion of interest expense on long-term financing from net revenues, (3) the exclusion of amortization of intangible assets related to acquisitions, (4) the exclusion of compensation and non-compensation expenses from acquisition-related agreements, (5) the exclusion of restructuring and integration costs related to acquisitions and/or headcount reductions, (6) the exclusion of non-compensation expenses from regulatory settlements (see Note 13 to our unaudited consolidated financial statements included in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for further information) and (7) the income tax impact allocated to the adjustments. The non-compensation expenses from regulatory settlements for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 include the reversal of other operating expenses of 4.0 million, as we reduced the accrual for civil penalties related to regulatory settlements with the SEC and Commodity Futures Trading Commission (the "CFTC"). The non-compensation expenses from regulatory settlements for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 include a 15.0 million accrual of other operating expenses for an estimated civil penalty related to the regulatory settlement with the SEC. In connection with these matters, we also incurred 0.4 million of outside services expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, and 1.4 million of outside services expenses for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023. The adjusted weighted average diluted shares outstanding used in the calculation of non-GAAP earnings per diluted common share contains an adjustment to include the common shares for unvested restricted stock awards with service conditions granted pursuant to all acquisitions since January 1, 2020. These adjustments affect the following financial measures: net revenues, compensation expenses, non-compensation expenses, income tax expense, net income attributable to Piper Sandler Companies, earnings per diluted common share, total non-interest expenses, pre-tax income/(loss) and pre-tax margin. Management believes that presenting these results and measures on an adjusted basis in conjunction with the corresponding U.S. GAAP measures provides the most meaningful basis for comparison of our operating results across periods and enhances the overall understanding of our current financial performance by excluding certain items that may not be indicative of our core operating results. The non-GAAP financial measures should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for, measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP.

External Factors Impacting Our Business 
 Performance in the financial services industry in which we operate is highly correlated to the overall strength of macroeconomic conditions, financial market activity and the effect of geopolitical events. Overall market conditions are a product of many factors, which are beyond our control, often unpredictable and at times inherently volatile. These factors may affect the financial decisions made by investors, including their level of participation in the financial markets. In turn, these decisions may affect our business results. With respect to financial market activity, our profitability is sensitive to a variety of factors, including the demand for investment banking services as reflected by the number and size of advisory transactions, equity and debt corporate financings, and municipal financings; the relative level of volatility of the equity and fixed income markets; changes in interest rates and credit spreads (especially rapid and extreme changes); overall market liquidity; the level and shape of various yield curves; the volume and value of trading in securities; and overall equity valuations. 
 
 Factors that differentiate our business within the financial services industry also may affect our financial results. For example, our capital markets business focuses on specific industry sectors while serving principally a middle-market clientele. If the business environment for our focus sectors is impacted adversely, our business and results of operations could reflect these impacts. In addition, our business, with its specific areas of focus and investment, may not track overall market trends. Given the variability of the capital markets and securities businesses, our earnings may fluctuate significantly from period to period, and results for any individual period should not be considered indicative of future results.

 Outlook for the Remainder of 2024 
 U.S. monetary policy remains a prevalent factor impacting the economy and financial markets. The U.S. Federal Reserve cut its short-term benchmark interest rate by 50 basis points in the third quarter of 2024 and is expected to continue to reduce benchmark rates as inflation moderates. The 2024 U.S. presidential election may influence the volatility or direction of the markets in the fourth quarter based on investors' assessment of the outcome and the overall political outlook in the U.S. Additionally, geopolitical concerns, including the conflicts in the Middle East and Eastern Europe, could negatively impact financial market activity. 
 
 Our advisory services results continue to benefit from our sector and product diversification as well as improvement in the market outlook for mergers and acquisitions ("M A") activity. Our advisory services activity for the fourth quarter of 2024 has started strong and if market conditions remain accommodative and closings stay on track, we expect a strong finish to the year. 
 
 While our corporate financing activity declined in the third quarter, activity in October has outpaced the entire third quarter. We expect our corporate financing revenues for the fourth quarter to be up meaningfully on a sequential basis. 
 
 In our equity brokerage business, the quality of our research product and trade execution is driving a continued increase in our client research votes, which we believe will result in further market share gains over time and offset the impact from the declining research and trading services fee pool. The fourth quarter tends to be our equity brokerage business's strongest quarter of the year and we expect our results to follow that trend for 2024. 
 
 We experienced increased client activity within fixed income services during the third quarter of 2024 as market conditions improved. The U.S. Federal Reserve's action to reduce short-term benchmark interest rates, more confidence on the direction of interest rates and the change in the yield curve drove higher activity among our depository clients. With continued improvement in the fixed income markets, we anticipate a strong finish to the year, with fourth quarter fixed income services revenues similar to the third quarter of 2024. 
 
 Overall market conditions for our municipal financing business markedly improved during the third quarter of 2024. Our municipal negotiated issuance activity increased across both our specialty sector and governmental businesses during the current quarter driven by strong investor demand and lower rates. We expect a strong fourth quarter in our municipal financing business to finish the year.

Table of Contents 

 For the three months ended September 30, 2024, we recorded net income attributable to Piper Sandler Companies of 34.8 million. Net revenues for the three months ended September 30, 2024 were 359.6 million, a 24.2 percent increase compared with 289.5 million in the year-ago period. In the third quarter of 2024, investment banking revenues were 241.5 million, up 14.1 percent compared to 211.7 million in the prior-year period, resulting from increases in advisory services and municipal financing revenues, partially offset by lower corporate financing revenues. For the three months ended September 30, 2024, institutional brokerage revenues were 100.9 million, an 11.5 percent increase compared with 90.5 million in the third quarter of 2023, resulting from increases in both our fixed income services and equity brokerage businesses. For the three months ended September 30, 2024, net interest income increased to 6.5 million, compared to 4.4 million in the prior-year period, driven by higher interest income on our cash balances and lower interest expense as we repaid our long-term financing arrangement in the fourth quarter of 2023. In the third quarter of 2024, we recorded investment income of 10.7 million, compared to an investment loss of 17.1 million in the third quarter of 2023. In the current quarter, we recorded gains on our investments and the noncontrolling interests in the alternative asset management funds that we manage. Non-interest expenses were 304.0 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, up 3.8 percent compared with 292.9 million in the prior-year period, primarily due to increased compensation expenses resulting from higher revenues and profitability. 
 
 Consolidated Non-Interest Expenses 
 Compensation and Benefits 
 Compensation and benefits expenses, which are the largest component of our expenses, include salaries, incentive compensation, benefits, stock-based compensation, employment taxes, the reversal of expenses associated with the forfeiture of stock-based compensation, and other employee-related costs. A significant portion of compensation expense is comprised of variable incentive arrangements, including discretionary incentive compensation, the amount of which fluctuates in proportion to the level of business activity, increasing with higher revenues and operating profits and decreasing with lower revenues and operating profits. Other compensation costs, primarily base salaries and benefits, are more fixed in nature. The timing of incentive compensation payments, which is generally in February, has a greater impact on our cash position and liquidity than is reflected on our consolidated statements of operations. In conjunction with our acquisitions, we have granted restricted stock, restricted cash, and restricted mutual fund shares of investment funds ("MFRS Awards") with service conditions, which are amortized to compensation expense over the service period. We have also entered into forgivable loans with service conditions, which are amortized to compensation expense over the loan term. Additionally, expense estimates related to revenue-based earnout arrangements with service conditions entered into as part of our acquisitions are amortized to compensation expense over the service period. 
 
 The following table summarizes our expected future acquisition-related compensation expense for restricted stock, MFRS Awards and forgivable loans with service conditions, as well as expense estimates related to revenue-based earnout arrangements: 
 (Amounts in thousands) Remainder of 2024 11,681 2025 31,413 2026 22,456 2027 16,562 2028 6,012 Thereafter 3,415 Total 91,539 
 
 For the three months ended September 30, 2024, compensation and benefits expenses increased 11.4 percent to 231.0 million, compared with 207.3 million in the corresponding period of 2023, due to higher revenues and profitability. Compensation and benefits expenses as a percentage of net revenues was 64.2 percent in the third quarter of 2024, compared to 71.6 percent in the third quarter of 2023. Excluding the impact of noncontrolling interests, our compensation ratio decreased to 65.7 percent in the third quarter of 2024, compared with 68.1 percent in the third quarter of 2023, primarily due to higher net revenues.

 Outside Services 
 Outside services expenses include securities processing expenses, outsourced technology functions, outside legal fees, fund expenses associated with our consolidated alternative asset management funds and other professional fees. Outside services expenses increased 7.9 percent to 13.5 million in the third quarter of 2024, compared with 12.5 million in the corresponding period of 2023, primarily due to higher recruiting and placement fees, as well as increased legal fees. 
 
 Occupancy and Equipment 
 For the three months ended September 30, 2024, occupancy and equipment expenses increased slightly to 16.5 million, compared with 16.3 million in the corresponding period of 2023. 
 
 Communications 
 Communication expenses include costs for telecommunication and data communication, primarily consisting of expenses for obtaining third-party market data information. For the three months ended September 30, 2024, communication expenses increased 6.4 percent to 13.7 million, compared with 12.9 million in the corresponding period of 2023, primarily due to higher market data services expenses. 
 
 Marketing and Business Development 
 Marketing and business development expenses include travel and entertainment costs, advertising and third-party marketing fees. For the three months ended September 30, 2024, marketing and business development expenses increased 19.8 percent to 10.4 million, compared with 8.7 million in the corresponding period of 2023, primarily due to increased travel expenses associated with increased transaction opportunities. 
 
 Deal-Related Expenses 
 Deal-related expenses include costs we incurred over the course of a completed investment banking deal, which primarily consist of legal fees, offering expenses, and travel costs. For the three months ended September 30, 2024, deal-related expenses were 6.1 million, compared with 6.7 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The amount of deal-related expenses is principally dependent on the level and mix of deal activity and may vary from period to period as the recognition of deal-related costs typically coincides with the closing of a transaction. 
 
 Trade Execution and Clearance 
 For the three months ended September 30, 2024, trade execution and clearance expenses increased slightly to 5.2 million, compared with 4.9 million in the corresponding period of 2023. 
 
 Restructuring and Integration Costs 
 For the three months ended September 30, 2024, we incurred restructuring and integration costs of 0.8 million. The expenses related to our acquisition of Aviditi Advisors and consisted of 0.5 million of integration costs and 0.3 million for vacated leased office space. We expect to incur additional restructuring and integration costs in the fourth quarter of 2024. 
 
 Intangible Asset Amortization 
 Intangible asset amortization includes the amortization of definite-lived intangible assets. For the three months ended September 30, 2024, intangible asset amortization was 2.6 million, compared to 4.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease was primarily due to lower intangible asset amortization expense associated with our 2022 acquisition of DBO Partners Holding LLC.

 Other Operating Expenses 
 Other operating expenses primarily include insurance costs, license and registration fees, expenses related to our charitable giving program and litigation-related expenses, which consist of the amounts we accrue for and/or pay out related to legal and regulatory matters. Other operating expenses were 4.3 million in the third quarter of 2024, compared with 18.9 million in the corresponding period in 2023. Other operating expenses for the third quarter of 2023 included a 15.0 million accrual for an estimated civil penalty related to our regulatory settlement with the SEC regarding recordkeeping requirements for business-related communications. 
 
 Income Taxes 
 For the three months ended September 30, 2024, our provision for income taxes was 15.2 million, which included 0.8 million of tax benefits related to stock-based compensation awards vesting at values greater than the grant price. Excluding the impact of this benefit and noncontrolling interests, our effective tax rate was 32.0 percent. 
 
 For the three months ended September 30, 2023, our provision for income taxes was 10.2 million, which included 0.9 million of tax benefits related to stock-based compensation awards vesting at values greater than the grant price. Excluding the impact of this benefit and noncontrolling interests, our effective tax rate was 79.1 percent, which was impacted by the non-deductibility of the estimated civil penalty related to our regulatory settlement with the SEC regarding recordkeeping requirements for business-related communications. 

Financial Performance 
 Our activities as an investment bank and institutional securities firm constitute a single business segment. 
 
 Throughout this section, we have presented results on both a U.S. GAAP and non-GAAP basis. Management believes that presenting results and measures on an adjusted, non-GAAP basis in conjunction with the corresponding U.S. GAAP measures provides a more meaningful basis for comparison of its operating results and underlying trends between periods, and enhances the overall understanding of our current financial performance by excluding certain items that may not be indicative of our core operating results. The non-GAAP results should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for, the results prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. 
 
 The adjusted financial results exclude (1) investment (income)/loss and non-compensation expenses related to noncontrolling interests, (2) interest expense on long-term financing from net revenues, (3) amortization of intangible assets related to acquisitions, (4) compensation and non-compensation expenses from acquisition-related agreements, (5) restructuring and integration costs related to acquisitions and/or headcount reductions and (6) non-compensation expenses from regulatory settlements. For U.S. GAAP purposes, these items are included in each of their respective line items on the consolidated statements of operations.

 Investment banking revenues comprise all of the revenues generated through advisory services activities, which include M A, equity and debt private placements, debt and restructuring advisory, and municipal financial advisory transactions. Collectively, debt advisory transactions and equity and debt private placements are referred to as capital advisory transactions. Investment banking revenues also include equity and debt corporate financing activities and municipal financings. 
 
 In the third quarter of 2024, investment banking revenues increased 14.1 percent to 241.5 million, compared with 211.7 million in the prior-year period. For the three months ended September 30, 2024, advisory services revenues were 188.0 million, up 21.7 percent compared to 154.6 million in the third quarter of 2023, driven primarily by more completed transactions. During the third quarter of 2024, our activity was broad based across sectors, led by our healthcare group with strong, balanced contributions from our financial services, services industrials, energy power and consumer sectors. In addition, our debt advisory product team continued to record strong results in the quarter. For the three months ended September 30, 2024, corporate financing revenues were 17.9 million, down 51.8 percent compared with 37.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023, due to fewer completed equity transactions and a lower average fee. Activity for us during the third quarter of 2024 was led by our financial services group. Municipal financing revenues for the three months ended September 30, 2024 were 35.5 million, up 78.2 percent compared to 19.9 million in the prior-year period, driven by increased municipal negotiated issuance activity across both our specialty sector and governmental businesses resulting from higher investor demand and lower rates. 
 
 Institutional brokerage revenues comprise all of the revenues generated through trading activities, which principally consist of facilitating customer trades, as well as fees received for our research services and corporate access offerings. Our results may vary from quarter to quarter as a result of changes in trading margins, trading gains and losses, net interest spreads, trading volumes and the amount of fees received for research services.

 For the three months ended September 30, 2024, institutional brokerage revenues were 100.9 million, up 11.5 percent compared with 90.5 million in the prior-year period. Equity brokerage revenues were 52.5 million in the third quarter of 2024, up 4.5 percent compared with 50.2 million in the corresponding period of 2023 due to increased client activity across our full suite of products. For the three months ended September 30, 2024, fixed income services revenues were 48.5 million, up 20.4 percent compared to 40.3 million in the prior-year period as more certainty in the direction of interest rates drove increased activity among our depository clients. 
 
 Interest income represents amounts earned from holding long inventory positions and cash balances, as well as interest earned on installment fee receivables. For the three months ended September 30, 2024, interest income increased to 7.8 million, compared with 7.0 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023, reflecting higher interest on our cash balances. 
 
 Investment income/(loss) includes realized and unrealized gains and losses on investments, including amounts attributable to noncontrolling interests, in our alternative asset management funds, as well as management and performance fees generated from those funds. For the three months ended September 30, 2024, we recorded investment income of 10.7 million, compared with an investment loss of 17.1 million in the corresponding period of 2023. In the third quarter of 2024, we recorded gains on our investments and the noncontrolling interests in the alternative asset management funds that we manage. Excluding the impact of noncontrolling interests, adjusted investment income was 3.0 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared with adjusted investment loss of 2.0 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. 
 
 Interest expense represents amounts associated with financing, economically hedging and holding short inventory positions, including interest paid on our short- and long-term financing arrangements, as well as commitment fees on certain short-term financing arrangements. For the three months ended September 30, 2024, interest expense decreased to 1.4 million, compared with 2.5 million in the prior-year period. The decrease was primarily due to lower interest paid on long-term financing arrangements, as we repaid our 125 million of Class B unsecured fixed rate senior notes upon maturity on October 15, 2023. 
 
 Pre-tax margin for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was 15.5 percent, compared to a negative 1.2 percent for the corresponding period of 2023. The increase in pre-tax margin for the current quarter was driven by higher net revenues, a lower compensation ratio and lower non-compensation expenses. The pre-tax margin for the third quarter of 2023 was impacted by higher non-compensation expenses related to an accrual recorded for an estimated civil penalty related to our regulatory settlement with the SEC regarding recordkeeping requirements for business-related communications. Adjusted pre-tax margin for the three months ended September 30, 2024 increased to 18.4 percent, compared with 15.3 percent for the corresponding period of 2023 primarily due to higher adjusted net revenues and a lower adjusted compensation ratio.

 In the first nine months of 2024, investment banking revenues were 731.8 million, up 26.2 percent compared to 580.0 million in the corresponding period of 2023. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, advisory services revenues were 529.1 million, up 24.5 percent compared with 425.0 million in the first nine months of 2023, driven by a higher average fee and more completed transactions. During the first nine months of 2024, our activity was broad based across sectors, led by our financial services group with solid contributions from the energy power, services industrials, healthcare and consumer sectors. In addition, our debt advisory product team recorded strong results in the first nine months of 2024. Corporate financing revenues were 121.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, up 20.0 percent compared to 100.9 million in the prior-year period, due to more completed transactions. While the overall market for equity financing declined during the second and third quarters from a strong first quarter of 2024, equity financing activity has improved compared to the prior-year period. Activity for us during the first nine months of 2024 was primarily in the healthcare sector, and we served as book runner on 31 of 33 completed healthcare equity deals. Municipal financing revenues for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 were 81.5 million, up 50.5 percent compared to 54.1 million in the year-ago period, driven by increased issuance activity across both our specialty sector and governmental businesses as market conditions and investor demand improved. 
 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, institutional brokerage revenues were 284.1 million, up 3.4 percent compared with 274.6 million in the prior-year period. Equity brokerage revenues were 154.0 million in the first nine months of 2024, essentially flat compared with 154.5 million in the corresponding period of 2023. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, fixed income services revenues were 130.1 million, up 8.3 percent compared to 120.1 million in the prior-year period, due to increased client activity, particularly with our depository clients. Market conditions for fixed income improved in the third quarter resulting from the U.S. Federal Reserve's action to reduce short-term benchmark interest rates as well as more confidence on the direction of interest rates. 
 
 Interest income for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 increased to 22.8 million, compared with 19.4 million in the prior-year period, reflecting higher interest on our cash balances.

 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we recorded investment income of 7.5 million, compared to 9.8 million in the year-ago period. Excluding the impact of noncontrolling interests, adjusted investment income was 8.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared with 1.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 
 Interest expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 decreased to 4.4 million, compared with 7.8 million in the prior-year period. The decrease was primarily due to lower interest paid on long-term financing arrangements, as we repaid our 125 million of Class B unsecured fixed rate senior notes upon maturity on October 15, 2023. 
 
 Pre-tax margin for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 increased to 13.1 percent, compared to 4.2 percent for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Adjusted pre-tax margin for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 increased to 17.5 percent, compared with 13.0 percent for the corresponding period of 2023. In the first nine months of 2024, the increase in pre-tax margin on both a U.S. GAAP and adjusted basis was primarily due to higher net revenues. Additionally, U.S. GAAP pre-tax margin increased due to lower non-compensation expenses. 

RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS 
 Recent accounting pronouncements are set forth in Note 3 to our unaudited consolidated financial statements included in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, and are incorporated herein by reference. 

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES 
 Our accounting and reporting policies comply with U.S. GAAP and conform to practices within the securities industry. The preparation of financial statements in compliance with U.S. GAAP and industry practices requires us to make estimates and assumptions that could materially affect amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements. Critical accounting policies are those policies that we believe to be the most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and that require us to make estimates that are difficult, subjective or complex. Most accounting policies are not considered by us to be critical accounting policies. Several factors are considered in determining whether or not a policy is critical, including whether the estimates are significant to the consolidated financial statements taken as a whole, the nature of the estimates, the ability to readily validate the estimates with other information (e.g., third-party or independent sources), the sensitivity of the estimates to changes in economic conditions and whether alternative accounting methods may be used under U.S. GAAP. 
 
 We believe that of our significant accounting policies, the following are our critical accounting policies and estimates: 
 
 Valuation of Financial Instruments 
 Goodwill and Intangible Assets 
 Stock-Based Compensation Plans 
 Income Taxes 
 
 See the "Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates" section and Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 for further information on our critical accounting policies and estimates. 
 
 We anticipate completing our 2024 annual goodwill and intangible asset impairment testing in the fourth quarter of 2024.

 LIQUIDITY, FUNDING AND CAPITAL RESOURCES 
 We regularly monitor our liquidity position, which is of critical importance to our business. Accordingly, we maintain a liquidity strategy designed to enable our business to continue to operate even under adverse circumstances, although there can be no assurance that our strategy will be successful under all circumstances. Insufficient liquidity resulting from adverse circumstances contributes to, and may be the cause of, financial institution failure. 
 
 The majority of our tangible assets consist of assets readily convertible into cash. Financial instruments and other inventory positions owned are stated at fair value and are generally readily marketable in most market conditions. Receivables and payables with brokers, dealers and clearing organizations usually settle within a few days. As part of our liquidity strategy, we emphasize diversification of funding sources to the extent possible while considering tenor and cost. Our assets are financed by our cash flows from operations, equity capital and our funding arrangements. The fluctuations in cash flows from financing activities are directly related to daily operating activities from our various businesses. One of our most important risk management disciplines is our ability to manage the size and composition of our balance sheet. While our asset base changes due to client activity, market fluctuations and business opportunities, the size and composition of our balance sheet reflect our overall risk tolerance, our ability to access stable funding sources and the amount of equity capital we hold. 
 
 Certain market conditions can impact the liquidity of our inventory positions, requiring us to hold larger inventory positions for longer than expected or requiring us to take other actions that may adversely impact our results. 
 
 A significant component of our employees' compensation is paid in annual discretionary incentive compensation. The timing of these incentive compensation payments, which is generally in February, has a significant impact on our cash position and liquidity. 
 
 Our dividend policy is intended to return between 30 percent and 50 percent of our fiscal year adjusted net income to shareholders. Our board of directors determines the declaration and payment of dividends and is free to change our dividend policy at any time. Our board of directors declared the following dividends on shares of our common stock:

 (1) Represents a special cash dividend. 
 
 As part of our capital management strategy, we repurchase our common stock over time in order to offset the dilutive effect of our employee stock-based compensation awards and our grants of acquisition-related restricted stock, as well as to return capital to shareholders. 
 
 Effective May 6, 2022, our board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to 150.0 million in common shares through December 31, 2024. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we did not repurchase any shares of our common stock related to this authorization. At September 30, 2024, we had 138.2 million remaining under this authorization.

 We also purchase shares of common stock from restricted stock award recipients upon the award vesting as recipients sell shares to meet their employment tax obligations. During the first nine months of 2024, we purchased 325,019 shares of our common stock at an average price of 184.51 per share for an aggregate purchase price of 60.0 million for these purposes. 

Leverage 
 The following table presents total assets, adjusted assets, total shareholders' equity and tangible common shareholders' equity with the resulting leverage ratios: 
 September 30, December 31, (Dollars in thousands) 2024 2023 Total assets 2,032,127 2,140,983 Deduct: Goodwill and intangible assets (420,829) (417,957) Deduct: Right-of-use lease assets 
 (72,253) (69,387) Deduct: Assets attributable to noncontrolling interests 
 (195,755) (217,411) Adjusted assets 1,343,290 1,436,228 Total shareholders' equity 1,362,082 1,299,473 Deduct: Goodwill and intangible assets (420,829) (417,957) Deduct: Noncontrolling interests (194,774) (213,975) Tangible common shareholders' equity 746,479 667,541 Leverage ratio (1) 1.5 1.6 Adjusted leverage ratio (2) 1.8 2.2 
 (1) Leverage ratio equals total assets divided by total shareholders' equity. 
 (2) Adjusted leverage ratio equals adjusted assets divided by tangible common shareholders' equity. 
 
 Adjusted assets and tangible common shareholders' equity are non-GAAP financial measures. Goodwill and intangible assets are subtracted from total assets and total shareholders' equity in determining adjusted assets and tangible common shareholders' equity, respectively, as we believe that goodwill and intangible assets do not constitute operating assets that can be deployed in a liquid manner. Right-of-use lease assets are also subtracted from total assets in determining adjusted assets as these are not operating assets that can be deployed in a liquid manner. Amounts attributable to noncontrolling interests are subtracted from total assets and total shareholders' equity in determining adjusted assets and tangible common shareholders' equity, respectively, as they represent assets and equity interests in consolidated entities that are not attributable, either directly or indirectly, to Piper Sandler Companies. We view the resulting measure of adjusted leverage, also a non-GAAP financial measure, as a more relevant measure of financial risk when comparing financial services companies. Our adjusted leverage ratio decreased from December 31, 2023, primarily due to higher tangible common shareholders' equity driven by strong net income for the nine months ended September 30, 2024.

 Funding and Capital Resources 
 The primary goal of our funding activities is to ensure adequate funding over a wide range of market conditions. Given the mix of our business activities, funding requirements are fulfilled through a diversified range of financing arrangements. We attempt to ensure that the tenor of our borrowing liabilities equals or exceeds the expected holding period of the assets being financed. Our ability to support increases in total assets is largely a function of our ability to obtain funding from external sources. Access to these external sources, as well as the cost of that financing, is dependent upon various factors, including market conditions, the general availability of credit and credit ratings. We currently do not have a credit rating, which could adversely affect our liquidity and competitive position by increasing our financing costs and limiting access to sources of liquidity that require a credit rating as a condition to providing the funds. 
 
 Our day-to-day funding and liquidity is obtained primarily through the use of cash from our operating activities, as well as through the use of a clearing arrangement with Pershing LLC ("Pershing"), a clearing arrangement with bank financing, and a bank line of credit, which are typically collateralized by our securities inventory. These funding sources are critical to our ability to finance and hold inventory, which is a necessary part of our institutional brokerage business. The majority of our inventory is liquid and is therefore funded by short-term facilities or cash from our operating activities. Our committed line has been established to mitigate changes in the liquidity of our inventory based on changing market conditions, and is available to us regardless of changes in market liquidity conditions through the end of its term, although there may be limitations on the type of securities available to pledge. Our funding sources are also dependent on the types of inventory that our counterparties are willing to accept as collateral and the number of counterparties available. Funding is generally obtained at rates based upon the federal funds rate. 
 
 Pershing Clearing Arrangement 
 We have established an arrangement to obtain financing from Pershing related to the majority of our trading activities. Under our fully disclosed clearing agreement, all of our securities inventories with the exception of convertible securities, and all of our customer activities are held by or cleared through Pershing. Financing under this arrangement is secured primarily by securities, and collateral limitations could reduce the amount of funding available under this arrangement. We may accommodate non-standard settlement timeframes for our clients, which can impact our funding and collateral balances. Our clearing arrangement activities are recorded net of trading activity and reported within receivables from or payables to brokers, dealers and clearing organizations. The funding is at the discretion of Pershing (i.e., uncommitted) and could be denied without a notice period. Our fully disclosed clearing agreement includes a covenant requiring Piper Sandler Co., our U.S. broker dealer subsidiary, to maintain excess net capital of 120 million. At September 30, 2024, we had 7.3 million of financing outstanding under this arrangement. 
 
 Clearing Arrangement with Bank Financing 
 We have established a financing arrangement with a U.S. branch of Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce ("CIBC") related to our convertible securities inventories. Under this arrangement, our convertible securities inventories are cleared through a broker dealer affiliate of CIBC and held by CIBC. We generally economically hedge changes in the market value of our convertible securities inventories using the underlying common stock or the stock options of the underlying common stock. Financing under this arrangement is secured primarily by convertible securities and collateral limitations could reduce the amount of funding available. The funding is at the discretion of CIBC (i.e., uncommitted) and could be denied subject to a notice period. This arrangement is reported within receivables from or payables to brokers, dealers and clearing organizations, net of trading activity. At September 30, 2024, we had 71.7 million of financing outstanding under this arrangement. 
 
 Unsecured Revolving Credit Facility 
 We elected to increase our unsecured revolving credit facility with U.S. Bank N.A. from 100 million to 120 million in the third quarter of 2024. The credit agreement will terminate on December 18, 2026, unless otherwise terminated. At September 30, 2024, there were 20.0 million of advances against this credit facility. At November 7, 2024, there are 10.0 million of advances against this credit facility. 
 
 This credit facility includes customary events of default and covenants that, among other things, require Piper Sandler Co. to maintain a minimum regulatory net capital of 120 million, limit our leverage ratio, require maintenance of a minimum ratio of operating cash flow to fixed charges, and impose certain limitations on our ability to make acquisitions and make payments on our capital stock. At September 30, 2024, we were in compliance with all covenants.

 Secured Revolving Credit Facility 
 On August 23, 2024, we entered into a 30 million revolving credit facility with Cadence Bank related to our private capital advisory business. Advances under this facility are secured by certain installment fee receivables. The credit agreement will terminate on August 23, 2027, unless otherwise terminated. At September 30, 2024, there were no advances against this credit facility. 
 
 This credit facility includes customary events of default and covenants that, among other things, require Piper Sandler Co. to maintain a minimum regulatory net capital of 120 million, limit our leverage ratio, require maintenance of a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio, and impose certain limitations on our ability to make acquisitions and make payments on our capital stock. At September 30, 2024, we were in compliance with all covenants. 
 
 Committed Line 
 Our committed line is a one-year 50 million revolving secured credit facility. Advances under this facility are secured by certain marketable securities. The facility includes a covenant that requires Piper Sandler Co. to maintain a minimum regulatory net capital of 120 million, and the unpaid principal amount of all advances under the facility will be due on December 6, 2024. We anticipate being able to renew the facility for another one-year term in the fourth quarter of 2024. At September 30, 2024, we had no advances against this line of credit. 
 
 The following tables present the average balances outstanding for our various funding sources by quarter for 2024 and 2023:

 The average funding in the third quarter of 2024 increased to 84.4 million, compared with 73.1 million during the second quarter of 2024, as we borrowed on our unsecured revolving credit facility in the third quarter of 2024. The average funding decreased compared with 103.2 million during the third quarter of 2023, primarily due to lower average balances of convertible securities inventories. 
 
 The following table presents the maximum daily funding amount by quarter for 2024 and 2023: 
 (Amounts in millions) 2024 2023 First Quarter 544.2 146.6 Second Quarter 466.6 370.1 Third Quarter 163.3 224.2 Fourth Quarter 550.8

 Capital Requirements 
 As a registered broker dealer and member firm of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, Inc. ("FINRA"), Piper Sandler Co. is subject to the uniform net capital rule of the SEC and the net capital rule of FINRA. We have elected to use the alternative method permitted by the uniform net capital rule which requires that we maintain minimum net capital of 1.0 million. Advances to affiliates, repayment of subordinated liabilities, dividend payments and other equity withdrawals are subject to certain approvals, notifications and other provisions of the uniform net capital rules. We expect that these provisions will not impact our ability to meet current and future obligations. At September 30, 2024, our net capital under the SEC's uniform net capital rule was 236.5 million, and exceeded the minimum net capital required under the SEC rule by 235.5 million. 
 
 Although we operate with a level of net capital substantially greater than the minimum thresholds established by FINRA and the SEC, a substantial reduction of our capital would curtail many of our capital markets revenue producing activities. 
 
 Our committed line, unsecured revolving credit facility and secured revolving credit facility include covenants requiring Piper Sandler Co. to maintain a minimum regulatory net capital of 120 million. Our fully disclosed clearing agreement with Pershing includes a covenant requiring Piper Sandler Co. to maintain excess net capital of 120 million. 
 
 At September 30, 2024, Piper Sandler Ltd., our broker dealer subsidiary registered in the U.K., was subject to, and was in compliance with, the capital requirements of the Prudential Regulation Authority and the Financial Conduct Authority pursuant to the Financial Services Act of 2012. 
 
 Piper Sandler Hong Kong Limited is licensed by the Hong Kong Securities and Futures Commission, which is subject to the liquid capital requirements of the Securities and Futures (Financial Resources) Rule promulgated under the Securities and Futures Ordinance. At September 30, 2024, Piper Sandler Hong Kong Limited was in compliance with the liquid capital requirements of the Hong Kong Securities and Futures Commission. 
 
 Aviditi Capital Advisors Europe GmbH, a European subsidiary, is authorized and regulated by the Federal Financial Supervisory Authority ("BaFin") as a tied agent of AHP Capital Management GmbH, a third-party financial institution.

 OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS 
 
 In the ordinary course of business we enter into various types of off-balance sheet arrangements. The following table summarizes the notional contract value of our off-balance sheet arrangements for the periods presented: 
 Expiration Per Period 
 Total Contractual Amount Remainder of 
 2027 2029 September 30, December 31, (Amounts in thousands) 2024 2025 2026 - 2028 - 2030 Later 2024 2023 Customer matched-book derivative contracts (1) (2) 14,570 50,000 4,092 67,522 348,150 484,334 1,356,924 Trading securities derivative contracts (2) 104,130 45,000 5,000 154,130 196,250 Investment commitments (3) 89,309 95,142 
 (1) Consists of interest rate swaps. We have three counterparties (contractual amount of 77.2 million at September 30, 2024) who are not required to post collateral. The uncollateralized amounts, representing the fair value of the derivative contracts, expose us to the credit risk of these counterparties. At September 30, 2024, we had 6.4 million of credit exposure with these counterparties, including 5.9 million of credit exposure with one counterparty. 
 (2) We believe the fair value of these derivative contracts is a more relevant measure of the obligations because we believe the notional or contract amount overstates the expected payout. At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the net fair value of these derivative contracts approximated 6.8 million and 6.9 million, respectively. 
 (3) The investment commitments have no specified call dates. The timing of capital calls is based on market conditions and investment opportunities. 
 
 Derivatives 
 Derivatives' notional or contract amounts are not reflected as assets or liabilities on our consolidated statements of financial condition. Rather, the fair value of the derivative transactions are reported on the consolidated statements of financial condition as assets or liabilities in financial instruments and other inventory positions owned and financial instruments and other inventory positions sold, but not yet purchased, as applicable. 
 
 At September 30, 2024, the total contractual amount of our customer matched-book derivative contracts was 484.3 million, a decrease of 872.6 million from December 31, 2023, as a result of no longer intermediating certain derivative contracts. For further discussion of our activities related to derivative products, see Note 7 to our unaudited consolidated financial statements included in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. 
 
 Investment Commitments 
 We have investments, including those made as part of our alternative asset management activities, in limited partnerships or limited liability companies that make direct or indirect equity or debt investments in companies. We commit capital and/or act as the managing partner of these entities. We have committed capital of 89.3 million to certain entities and these commitments generally have no specified call dates.

 RISK MANAGEMENT 
 Risk is an inherent part of our business. The principal risks we face in operating our business include: strategic risk, market risk, liquidity risk, credit risk, operational risk, human capital risk, and legal and regulatory risk. The extent to which we properly identify and effectively manage each of these risks is critical to our financial condition and profitability. We have a formal risk management process to identify, assess and monitor each risk and mitigating controls in accordance with defined policies and procedures. The risk management functions are independent of our business lines. Our management takes an active role in the risk management process, and the results are reported to senior management and the board of directors. 
 
 The audit committee of the board of directors oversees management's processes for identifying and evaluating our major risks, and the policies, procedures and practices employed by management to govern its risk assessment and risk management processes. The nominating and governance committee of the board of directors oversees the board of directors' committee structures and functions as they relate to the various committees' responsibilities with respect to oversight of our major risk exposures. With respect to these major risk exposures, the audit committee is responsible for overseeing management's monitoring and control of our major risk exposures relating to market risk, credit risk, liquidity risk, legal and regulatory risk, operational risk (including cybersecurity, as further described in Part I, Item 1C "Cybersecurity" in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023), and human capital risk relating to misconduct, fraud, and legal and compliance matters. Our compensation committee is responsible for overseeing management's monitoring and control of our major risk exposures relating to compensation, organizational structure, and succession. Our board of directors is responsible for overseeing management's monitoring and control of our major risk exposures related to our corporate strategy. Our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer meet with the audit committee on a quarterly basis to discuss our market, liquidity, and legal and regulatory risks, and provide updates to the board of directors, audit committee, and compensation committee concerning the other major risk exposures on a regular basis. 
 
 We use internal committees to assist in governing risk and ensure that our business activities are properly assessed, monitored and managed. Our executive financial risk committee manages our market, liquidity and credit risks; oversees risk management practices related to these risks, including defining acceptable risk tolerances and approving risk management policies; and responds to market changes in a dynamic manner. Membership is comprised of senior leadership, including our Chief Executive Officer, President, Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer, Head of Market and Credit Risk, and Head of Fixed Income Trading and Risk. Other committees that help evaluate and monitor risk include underwriting, leadership team and operating committees. These committees help manage risk by ensuring that business activities are properly managed and within a defined scope of activity. Our valuation committees, comprised of members of senior management and risk management, provide oversight and overall responsibility for the internal control processes and procedures related to fair value measurements. Additionally, our operational risk committees address and monitor risk related to information systems and security, legal, regulatory and compliance matters, and third parties such as vendors and service providers. 
 
 With respect to market risk and credit risk, the cornerstone of our risk management process is daily communication among traders, trading department management and senior management concerning our inventory positions and overall risk profile. Our risk management functions supplement this communication process by providing their independent perspectives on our market and credit risk profile on a daily basis. The broader objectives of our risk management functions are to understand the risk profile of each trading area, to consolidate risk monitoring company-wide, to assist in implementing effective hedging strategies, to articulate large trading or position risks to senior management, and to ensure accurate fair values of our financial instruments. 
 
 Risk management techniques, processes and strategies may not be fully effective in mitigating our risk exposure in all market environments or against all types of risk, and any risk management failures could expose us to material unanticipated losses. 
 
 Strategic Risk 
 Strategic risk represents the risk associated with executive management failing to develop and execute on the appropriate strategic vision which demonstrates a commitment to our culture, leverages our core competencies, appropriately responds to external factors in the marketplace, and is in the best interests of our clients, employees and shareholders. 
 
 Our leadership team is responsible for managing our strategic risks. The board of directors oversees the leadership team in setting and executing our strategic plan.

 Market Risk 
 Market risk represents the risk of losses, or financial volatility, that may result from the change in value of a financial instrument due to fluctuations in its market price. Our exposure to market risk is directly related to our role as a financial intermediary for our clients and to our market-making activities. The scope of our market risk management policies and procedures includes all market-sensitive cash and derivative financial instruments. 
 
 Our different types of market risk include: 
 
 Interest Rate Risk 
 Interest rate risk represents the potential volatility from changes in market interest rates. We are exposed to interest rate risk arising from changes in the level and volatility of interest rates, changes in the slope of the yield curve, changes in credit spreads, and the rate of prepayments on our interest-earning assets (e.g., inventories) and our funding sources (e.g., short-term financing) which finance these assets. Interest rate risk is managed by selling short U.S. government securities, agency securities, corporate debt securities and derivative contracts. See Note 7 to our unaudited consolidated financial statements included in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for additional information on our derivative contracts. Our interest rate hedging strategies may not work in all market environments and as a result may not be effective in mitigating interest rate risk. Also, we establish limits on our long fixed income securities inventory, monitor these limits on a daily basis and manage within those limits. Our limits include but are not limited to the following: position and concentration size, dollar duration (i.e., DV01), credit quality and aging. 
 
 We estimate that a parallel 50 basis point adverse change in the market would result in a decrease of approximately 0.7 million in the carrying value of our fixed income securities inventory as of September 30, 2024, including the effect of the hedging transactions. 
 
 We also measure and monitor the aging and turnover of our long fixed income securities inventory. Turnover is evaluated based on a five-day average by category of security. The vast majority of our fixed income securities inventory generally turns over within three weeks. 
 
 In addition to the measures discussed above, we monitor and manage market risk exposure through evaluation of spread DV01 and the MMD basis risk for municipal securities to movements in U.S. treasury securities. All metrics are aggregated by asset concentration and are used for monitoring limits and exception approvals. In times of market volatility, we may also perform ad hoc stress tests and scenario analysis as market conditions dictate. 
 
 Equity Price Risk 
 Equity price risk represents the potential loss in value due to adverse changes in the level or volatility of equity prices. We are exposed to equity price risk through our trading activities primarily in the U.S. market. We attempt to reduce the risk of loss inherent in our market-making and in our inventory of equity securities by establishing limits on our long inventory, monitoring these limits on a daily basis, and by managing net position levels within those limits. 
 
 Foreign Exchange Risk 
 Foreign exchange risk represents the potential volatility to earnings or capital arising from movement in foreign exchange rates. A modest portion of our business is conducted in currencies other than the U.S. dollar, and changes in foreign exchange rates relative to the U.S. dollar can therefore affect the value of non-U.S. dollar net assets, revenues and expenses. 
 
 Liquidity Risk 
 Liquidity risk is the risk that we are unable to timely access necessary funding sources in order to operate our business, as well as the risk that we are unable to timely divest securities that we hold in connection with our market-making and sales and trading activities. We are exposed to liquidity risk in our day-to-day funding activities, by holding potentially illiquid inventory positions and in our role as a remarketing agent for variable rate demand notes. 
 
 Piper Sandler Companies | 64 

Table of Contents 

 Our inventory positions subject us to potential financial losses from the reduction in value of illiquid positions. Market risk can be exacerbated in times of trading illiquidity when market participants refrain from transacting in normal quantities or at normal bid-offer spreads. Depending on the specific security, the structure of the financial product, or overall market conditions, we may be forced to hold a security for substantially longer than we had planned or forced to liquidate into a challenging market if funding becomes unavailable. 
 
 See the section entitled "Liquidity, Funding and Capital Resources" for information regarding our liquidity and how we manage liquidity risk. 
 
 Credit Risk 
 Credit risk refers to the potential for loss due to the default or deterioration in credit quality of a counterparty, customer, borrower or issuer of securities we hold in our trading inventory. The nature and amount of credit risk depends on the type of transaction, the structure and duration of that transaction and the parties involved. Credit risk also results from an obligor's failure to meet the terms of any contract with us or otherwise fail to perform as agreed. This may be reflected through issues such as settlement obligations or payment collections. 
 
 A key tenet of our risk management procedures related to credit risk is the daily monitoring of the credit quality of our long fixed income securities inventory. These rating trends and the credit quality mix are regularly reviewed with the executive financial risk committee. The following table summarizes the credit rating for our long corporate fixed income securities, taxable and tax-exempt municipal securities, and U.S. government and agency securities as a percentage of the total of these asset classes as of September 30, 2024: 
 AAA AA A BBB BB Not Rated Corporate fixed income securities 0.3 0.1 2.3 Taxable and tax-exempt municipal securities 12.3 47.0 20.0 0.2 4.2 U.S. government and agency securities 11.8 1.8 12.3 59.1 21.9 2.5 4.2 
 
 Convertible and preferred securities are excluded from the table above as they are typically unrated. 
 
 Our different types of credit risk include: 
 
 Credit Spread Risk 
 Credit spread risk arises from the possibility that changes in credit spreads will affect the value of financial instruments. Credit spreads represent the credit risk premiums required by market participants for a given credit quality (e.g., the additional yield that a debt instrument issued by a AA-rated entity must produce over a risk-free alternative). Changes in credit spreads result from potential changes in an issuer's credit rating or the market's perception of the issuer's creditworthiness. We are exposed to credit spread risk with the debt instruments held in our trading inventory. We enter into transactions to hedge our exposure to credit spread risk with derivatives and certain other financial instruments. These hedging strategies may not work in all market environments and as a result may not be effective in mitigating credit spread risk. 
 
 Deterioration/Default Risk 
 Deterioration/default risk represents the risk due to an issuer, counterparty or borrower failing to fulfill its obligations. We are exposed to deterioration/default risk in our role as a trading counterparty to dealers and customers, as a holder of securities, and as a member of exchanges. The risk of default depends on the creditworthiness of the counterparty or issuer of the security. We mitigate this risk by establishing and monitoring individual and aggregate position limits for each counterparty relative to potential levels of activity, holding and marking to market collateral on certain transactions. Our risk management functions also evaluate the potential risk associated with institutional counterparties with whom we hold derivatives, TBAs and other documented institutional counterparty agreements that may give rise to credit exposure. 
 
 Piper Sandler Companies | 65 

Table of Contents 

 Collections Risk 
 Collections risk arises from ineffective management and monitoring of collecting outstanding debts and obligations, including those related to our customer trading activities. Our client activities involve the execution, settlement and financing of various transactions. Client activities are transacted on a delivery versus payment, cash or margin basis. Our credit exposure to institutional client business is mitigated by the use of industry-standard delivery versus payment through depositories and clearing banks. Our risk management functions have credit risk policies establishing appropriate credit limits and collateralization thresholds for our customers and counterparties. 
 
 Concentration Risk 
 Concentration risk is the risk due to concentrated exposure to a particular product; individual issuer, borrower or counterparty; financial instrument; or geographic area. We are subject to concentration risk if we hold large individual securities positions, execute large transactions with individual counterparties or groups of related counterparties, or make substantial underwriting commitments. Potential concentration risk is monitored through review of counterparties and borrowers and is managed using policies and limits established by senior management. 
 
 Within our customer matched-book derivative portfolio, we have concentrated counterparty credit exposure with three non-publicly rated entities totaling 6.4 million at September 30, 2024. This counterparty credit exposure relates to our public finance business and consists primarily of interest rate swaps. One derivative counterparty represented 91.4 percent, or 5.9 million, of this exposure. Credit exposure associated with our derivative counterparties is driven by uncollateralized market movements in the fair value of the interest rate swap contracts and is monitored regularly by our financial risk committee. We attempt to minimize the credit (or repayment) risk in derivative instruments by entering into transactions with high-quality counterparties that are reviewed periodically by senior management. 
 
 Operational Risk 
 Operational risk is the risk of loss, or damage to our reputation, resulting from inadequate or failed processes, people and systems or from external events. We rely on the ability of our employees and our systems, both internal and at computer centers operated by third parties, to process a large number of transactions. Our systems may fail to operate properly or become disabled as a result of events that are wholly or partially beyond our control. In the event of a breakdown or improper operation of our systems or improper action by our employees or third-party vendors, we could suffer financial loss, a disruption of our businesses, regulatory sanctions and damage to our reputation. We also face the risk of operational failure or termination of our relationship with any of the exchanges, fully disclosed clearing firms, or other financial intermediaries we use to facilitate our securities transactions. Any such failure or termination could adversely affect our ability to effect transactions and manage our exposure to risk. 
 
 Our operations rely on secure processing, storage and transmission of confidential and other information in our internal and outsourced computer systems and networks. Our computer systems, software and networks may be vulnerable to unauthorized access, computer viruses or other malicious code, internal misconduct or inadvertent errors and other events that could have an information security impact. The occurrence of one or more of these events could jeopardize our or our clients' or counterparties' confidential and other information processed and stored in, and transmitted through, our computer systems and networks, or otherwise cause interruptions or malfunctions in our, our clients', our counterparties' or third parties' operations. We take protective measures and endeavor to modify them as circumstances warrant. A further discussion of our procedures for cybersecurity risk management is included in Part I, Item 1C "Cybersecurity" in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. 
 
 In order to mitigate and control operational risk, we have developed and continue to enhance policies and procedures that are designed to identify and manage operational risk at appropriate levels throughout the organization. Important aspects of these policies and procedures include segregation of duties, management oversight, internal control over financial reporting and independent risk management activities within such functions as Risk Management, Compliance, Operations, Internal Audit, Treasury, Finance, Information Technology and Legal. Internal Audit oversees, monitors, evaluates, analyzes and reports on operational risk across the firm. We also have business continuity plans in place that we believe will cover critical processes on a company-wide basis, and redundancies are built into our systems as we have deemed appropriate. These control mechanisms attempt to ensure that operational policies and procedures are being followed and that our various businesses are operating within established corporate policies and limits.

 We operate under a fully disclosed clearing model for all of our securities inventories with the exception of convertible securities, and for all of our client clearing activities. In a fully disclosed clearing model, we act as an introducing broker for client transactions and rely on Pershing, our clearing broker dealer, to facilitate clearance and settlement of our clients' securities transactions. The clearing services provided by Pershing are critical to our business operations, and similar to other services performed by third-party vendors, any failure by Pershing with respect to the services we rely upon Pershing to provide could cause financial loss, significantly disrupt our business, damage our reputation, and adversely affect our ability to serve our clients and manage our exposure to risk. 
 
 Human Capital Risk 
 Our business is a human capital business and our success is dependent upon the skills, expertise and performance of our employees. Human capital risks represent the risks posed if we fail to attract and retain qualified individuals who are motivated to serve the best interests of our clients, thereby serving the best interests of our company. Attracting and retaining employees depends, among other things, on our company's culture, management, work environment, geographic locations and compensation. There are risks associated with the proper recruitment, development and rewards of our employees to ensure quality performance and retention. 
 
 Legal and Regulatory Risk 
 Legal and regulatory risk includes the risk of non-compliance with applicable legal and regulatory requirements and loss to our reputation we may suffer as a result of failure to comply with laws, regulations, rules, related self-regulatory organization standards and codes of conduct applicable to our business activities. We are generally subject to extensive regulation in the various jurisdictions in which we conduct our business. We have established procedures that are reasonably designed to achieve compliance with applicable statutory and regulatory requirements, such as public company reporting obligations, regulatory net capital requirements, sales and trading practices, potential conflicts of interest, anti-money laundering, privacy, and financial and electronic recordkeeping. We have also established procedures that are reasonably designed to achieve compliance with our policies relating to ethics and business conduct. The legal and regulatory focus on the financial services industry presents a continuing business challenge for us. 
 
 Our business also subjects us to the complex income tax laws of the jurisdictions in which we have business operations, and these tax laws may be subject to different interpretations by the taxpayer and the relevant governmental taxing authorities. We must make judgments and interpretations about the application of these inherently complex tax laws when determining the provision for income taxes. 

EFFECTS OF INFLATION 
 Because our assets are liquid and generally short-term in nature, they are not significantly affected by inflation. However, the rate of inflation affects our expenses, such as employee compensation, office space occupancy costs, communications charges and travel costs, which may not be readily recoverable in the price of services we offer to our clients. To the extent inflation results in rising interest rates and has adverse effects upon the securities markets, it may adversely affect our financial position and results of operations.

The entries maintained in such accounts shall be prima facie evidence of the existence and amounts of the Obligations therein recorded provided that the failure of the Lender to maintain such accounts or any error therein shall not in any manner affect the obligation of the Borrower to pay the Obligations in accordance with their terms. 
 2.13. Oral Notices . The Borrower hereby authorizes the Lender to extend or convert Borrowings and Types of Borrowings and to transfer funds based on oral or written requests, including Borrowing Notices and Conversion Notices via telephone.

To the extent lawful, the interest and charges that would 
 20 

have been paid in respect of such Loan but were not paid as a result of the operation of this Section 2.15 shall be applied first to reduce the unpaid balance of the Loans, then to reduce the principal balance of any other Indebtedness of the Borrower to the Lender, and then to the Borrower. 
 
 2.16. Judgment Currency . If for the purposes of obtaining judgment in any court it is necessary to convert a sum due from the Borrower hereunder in the currency expressed to be payable herein (the specified currency into another currency, the parties hereto agree, to the fullest extent that they can effectively do so, that the rate of exchange used shall be that at which in accordance with normal banking procedures the Lender could purchase the specified currency with such other currency at the Lender s offices on the Business Day preceding that on which final, non-appealable judgment is given. The obligations of the Borrower in respect of any sum due to the Lender hereunder shall, notwithstanding any judgment in a currency other than the specified currency, be discharged only to the extent that on the Business Day following receipt by the Lender of any sum adjudged to be so due in such other currency the Lender can in accordance with normal, reasonable banking procedures purchase the specified currency with such other currency. If the amount of the specified currency so purchased is less than the sum originally due to the Lender in the specified currency, the Borrower agrees, to the fullest extent that it can effectively do so, as a separate obligation and notwithstanding any such judgment, to indemnify the Lender against such loss, and if the amount of the specified currency so purchased exceeds the sum originally due to the Lender in the specified currency, the Lender shall remit such excess to the Borrower.

 3.1.1.1.1.1. impose, modify or deem applicable any reserve, special deposit, compulsory loan, insurance charge or similar requirement against assets 
 21 

of, deposits with or for the account of, or credit extended or participated in by, the Lender 
 3.1.1.1.1.2. subject the Lender to any Taxes (other than (A) Indemnified Taxes and (B) Connection Income Taxes) on its loans, loan principal, letters of credit, commitments, or other obligations, or its deposits, reserves, other liabilities or capital attributable thereto or 
 3.1.1.1.1.3. impose on the Lender or the London interbank market any other condition, cost or expense (other than Taxes) affecting this Agreement or Loans, 
 and the result of any of the foregoing shall be to increase the cost to the Lender of making, converting to or maintaining any Loan or of maintaining its obligation to make any Loan, or to reduce the amount of any sum received or receivable by the Lender hereunder (whether of principal, interest or any other amount), then, upon request of the Lender, the Borrower will pay to the Lender such additional amount or amounts as will compensate the Lender for such additional costs incurred or reduction suffered. 
 3.1.1.2. Capital Requirements . If the Lender determines that any Change in Law affecting the Lender or any lending office of the Lender or the Lender s holding company, if any, regarding capital or liquidity requirements, has or would have the effect of reducing the rate of return on the Lender s capital or on the capital of the Lender s holding company, if any, as a consequence of this Agreement, the Revolving Commitment or the Loans to a level below that which the Lender or the Lender s holding company could have achieved but for such Change in Law (taking into consideration the Lender s policies and the policies of the Lender s holding company with respect to capital adequacy), then from time to time the Borrower will pay to the Lender such additional amount or amounts as will compensate the Lender or the Lender s holding company for any such reduction suffered. 
 3.2. Certificates for Reimbursement Delay in Requests . A certificate of the Lender setting forth the amount or amounts necessary to compensate the Lender or its holding company, as the case may be, as specified in Section 3.1 and delivered to the Borrower shall be conclusive absent manifest error. The Borrower shall pay the Lender the amount shown as due on any such certificate within 10 days after receipt thereof. Failure or delay on the part of the Lender to demand compensation pursuant to Section 3.1 shall not constitute a waiver of the Lender s right to demand such compensation provided that the Borrower shall not be required to compensate the Lender pursuant to Section 3.1 for any increased costs incurred or reductions suffered more than nine months prior to the date that the Lender notifies the Borrower of the Change in Law giving rise to such increased costs or reductions, and of the Lender s intention to claim compensation therefor (except that, if the Change in Law giving rise to such increased costs or reductions is retroactive, then the nine-month period referred to above shall be extended to include the period of retroactive effect thereof). 
 3.3. Adequacy of Interest Rate . Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement or any other Loan Document, if the Lender determines (which determination shall be 
 22 

conclusive absent manifest error) that the interest rate applicable to Federal Funds Borrowings for any day is not ascertainable or available or does not adequately and fairly reflect the cost of making or maintaining Federal Funds Borrowings, then the Lender shall suspend the availability of Federal Funds Borrowings and require any affected Federal Funds Borrowings to be repaid or converted to Base Rate Borrowings. 
 3.4. Reserved . 
 3.5. Taxes . 
 
 3.5.1.1. Payments Free of Taxes . Any and all payments by or on account of any obligation of any Loan Party under any Loan Document shall be made without deduction or withholding for any Taxes, except as required by Applicable Law. If any Applicable Law requires the deduction or withholding of any Tax from any such payment, then the applicable Loan Party may make such deduction or withholding and shall timely pay the full amount deducted or withheld to the relevant Governmental Authority in accordance with Applicable Law and, if such Tax is an Indemnified Tax, then the sum payable by the applicable Loan Party shall be increased as necessary so that after such deduction or withholding has been made (including such deductions and withholdings applicable to additional sums payable under this Section 3.5) the Lender receives an amount equal to the sum it would have received had no such deduction or withholding been made. 
 3.5.1.2. Payment of Other Taxes by Loan Parties . The Loan Parties shall timely pay to the relevant Governmental Authority in accordance with Applicable Law or at the option of the Lender timely reimburse it for the payment of, any Other Taxes. 
 3.5.1.3. Indemnification by Loan Parties . The Loan Parties shall indemnify the Lender, within 10 days after demand therefor, for the full amount of any Indemnified Taxes (including Indemnified Taxes imposed or asserted on or attributable to amounts payable under this Section 3.5) payable or paid by the Lender or required to be withheld or deducted from a payment to the Lender and any reasonable expenses arising therefrom or with respect thereto, whether or not such Indemnified Taxes were correctly or legally imposed or asserted by the relevant Governmental Authority. A certificate as to the amount of such payment or liability delivered to the Borrower by the Lender shall be conclusive absent manifest error. 
 3.5.1.4. Evidence of Payments . As soon as practicable after any payment of Taxes by any Loan Party to a Governmental Authority pursuant to this Section 3.5, such Loan Party shall deliver to the Lender the original or a certified copy of a receipt issued by such Governmental Authority evidencing such payment, a copy of the return reporting such payment or other evidence of such payment reasonably satisfactory to the Lender. 
 3.5.1.5. Treatment of Certain Refunds . If the Lender determines, in its sole discretion exercised in good faith, that it has received a refund of any Taxes as to which it has been indemnified pursuant to this Section 3.5 (including by the payment of additional amounts pursuant to this Section 3.5), it shall pay to the applicable Loan Party an amount equal to such refund (but only to the extent of indemnity payments made under this Section 3.5 with respect to the Taxes giving rise to such refund), net of all out-of-pocket expenses (including Taxes) of the 
 23 

Lender and without interest (other than any interest paid by the relevant Governmental Authority with respect to such refund). Such Loan Party, upon the request of the Lender, shall repay to the Lender the amount paid over pursuant to this Section 3.5(e) (plus any penalties, interest or other charges imposed by the relevant Governmental Authority) if the Lender is required to repay such refund to such Governmental Authority. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 3.5(e), in no event will the Lender be required to pay any amount pursuant to this Section 3.5(e) the payment of which would place the Lender in a less favorable net after-Tax position than it would have been in if the Tax subject to indemnification and giving rise to such refund had not been deducted, withheld or otherwise imposed and the indemnification payments or additional amounts with respect to such Tax had never been paid. This Section 3.5(e) shall not be construed to require the Lender to make available its Tax returns (or any other information relating to its Taxes that it deems confidential) to any Loan Party or any other Person. 
 3.5.1.6. Survival . Each party s obligations under this Section 3.5 shall survive any assignment of rights by the Lender, the termination of the Revolving Commitment and the repayment, satisfaction or discharge of all obligations under any Loan Document. 
 3.6. Lender Statements Survival of Indemnity . The Lender shall give notice to the Borrower as to any amount due under Section 3.1, 3.2 or 3.5. Such notice shall set forth in reasonable detail the calculations upon which the Lender determined such amount and shall be final, conclusive and binding on the Borrower in the absence of manifest error. Unless otherwise provided herein, the Borrower shall pay the amount specified in such notice on demand. 
 3.7. Illegality . If the Lender determines that any Law has made it unlawful, or that any Governmental Authority has asserted that it is unlawful, for the Lender or its applicable lending office to make, maintain, or fund Loans whose interest is determined by reference to the Federal Funds Effective Rate, or to determine or charge interest rates based upon the Federal Funds Effective Rate, then, upon notice thereof by the Lender to the Borrower, any obligation of the Lender to make Federal Funds Borrowings or to convert Base Rate Borrowings to Federal Funds Borrowings shall be suspended until the Lender notifies the Borrower that the circumstances giving rise to such determination no longer exist. Upon receipt of such notice, the Borrower shall, upon demand from the Lender, prepay or, if applicable, convert all Federal Funds Borrowings to Base Rate Borrowings immediately. Upon any such prepayment or conversion, the Borrower shall also pay accrued interest on the amount so prepaid or converted.

By the issuance of a Letter of Credit (or an amendment to a Letter of Credit increasing the amount thereof) and without any further action on the part of the applicable Issuing Lender or the Revolving Lenders, such Issuing Lender hereby grants to each Revolving Lender, and each Revolving Lender hereby acquires from such Issuing Lender, a participation in such Letter of Credit equal to such Lender s Applicable Percentage of the aggregate amount available to be drawn under such Letter of Credit. In consideration and in furtherance of the foregoing, each Revolving Lender hereby absolutely and unconditionally agrees to pay to the Administrative Agent, for the account of the respective Issuing Lender, such Lender s Applicable Percentage of each LC Disbursement made by such Issuing Lender and not reimbursed by the Borrower on the date due as provided in paragraph (c) of this Section, or of any reimbursement payment required to be refunded to the Borrower for any reason, including after the Revolving Credit Maturity Date. Each such payment shall be made without any offset, abatement, withholding or reduction whatsoever. Each Revolving Lender acknowledges and agrees that its obligation to acquire participations pursuant to this paragraph in respect of Letters of Credit is absolute and unconditional and shall not be affected by any circumstance whatsoever, including any amendment or extension of any Letter of Credit or the occurrence and continuance of a Default or reduction or termination of the Commitments. 
 (e) Reimbursement . If the Issuing Lender shall make any LC Disbursement in respect of a Letter of Credit, the Borrower shall reimburse such LC Disbursement by paying to the Administrative Agent an amount equal to such LC Disbursement not later than 11 00 a.m., Houston time, on (i) the Business Day that the Borrower receives notice of such LC Disbursement, if such notice is received prior to 9 00 a.m., Houston time, on the day of receipt, or (ii) the Business Day immediately following the day that the Borrower receives such notice, if such notice is received after 9 00 a.m., Houston time, on the day of receipt provided that the Borrower may, subject to the conditions to borrowing set forth herein, request in accordance with 

Section 2.03 that such payment be financed with a Loan in an equivalent amount and, to the extent so financed, the Borrower s obligation to make such payment shall be discharged and replaced by the resulting Loan. If the Borrower fails to make such payment when due, the Administrative Agent shall notify each Lender of the applicable LC Disbursement, the payment then due from the Borrower in respect thereof and such Lender s Applicable Percentage thereof. Promptly following receipt of such notice, each Lender shall pay to the Administrative Agent its Applicable Percentage of the payment then due from the Borrower, in the same manner as provided in Section 2.05 with respect to Loans made by such Lender (and Section 2.05 shall apply, mutatis mutandis , to the payment obligations of the Lenders), and the Administrative Agent shall promptly pay to the Issuing Lender the amounts so received by it from the Lenders. Promptly following receipt by the Administrative Agent of any payment from the Borrower pursuant to this paragraph, the Administrative Agent shall distribute such payment to the Issuing Lender or, to the extent that Lenders have made payments pursuant to this paragraph to reimburse the Issuing Lender, then to such Lenders and the Issuing Lender as their interests may appear. Any payment made by a Lender pursuant to this paragraph to reimburse the Issuing Lender for any LC Disbursement (other than the funding of Loans as contemplated above) shall not constitute a Loan and shall not relieve the Borrower of its obligation to reimburse such LC Disbursement. 
 (f) Obligations Absolute . The Borrower s obligation to reimburse LC Disbursements as provided in paragraph (c) of this Section shall be absolute, unconditional and irrevocable, and shall be performed strictly in accordance with the terms of this Agreement under any and all circumstances whatsoever and irrespective of (i) any lack of validity or enforceability of any Letter of Credit, any Letter of Credit Agreement or this Agreement, or any term or provision therein or herein, (ii) any draft or other document presented under a Letter of Credit proving to be forged, fraudulent or invalid in any respect or any statement therein being untrue or inaccurate in any respect, (iii) any payment by the respective Issuing Lender under a Letter of Credit against presentation of a draft or other document that does not comply with the terms of such Letter of Credit, or (iv) any other event or circumstance whatsoever, whether or not similar to any of the foregoing, that might, but for the provisions of this Section, constitute a legal or equitable discharge of, or provide a right of setoff against, the Borrower s obligations hereunder. Neither the Administrative Agent, the Revolving Lenders nor any Issuing Lender, or any of their respective Related Parties, shall have any liability or responsibility by reason of or in connection with the issuance or transfer of any Letter of Credit, or any payment or failure to make any payment thereunder (irrespective of any of the circumstances referred to in the preceding sentence), or any error, omission, interruption, loss or delay in transmission or delivery of any draft, notice or other communication under or relating to any Letter of Credit (including any document required to make a drawing thereunder), any error in interpretation of technical terms, any error in translation or any consequence arising from causes beyond the control of the respective Issuing Lender provided that the foregoing shall not be construed to excuse an Issuing Lender from liability to the Borrower to the extent of any direct damages (as opposed to special, indirect, consequential or punitive damages, claims in respect of which are hereby waived by the Borrower to the extent permitted by applicable law) suffered by the Borrower that are caused by such Issuing Lender s failure to exercise care when determining whether drafts and other documents presented under a Letter of Credit comply with the terms thereof. The parties hereto expressly agree that, in the absence of gross negligence or willful misconduct on the part of an Issuing Lender (as finally determined by a nonappealable judgment of a court of competent 

jurisdiction), such Issuing Lender shall be deemed to have exercised care in each such determination. In furtherance of the foregoing and without limiting the generality thereof, the parties agree that, with respect to documents presented which appear on their face to be in substantial compliance with the terms of a Letter of Credit, an Issuing Lender may, in its sole discretion, either accept and make payment upon such documents without responsibility for further investigation, regardless of any notice or information to the contrary, or refuse to accept and make payment upon such documents if such documents are not in strict compliance with the terms of such Letter of Credit. 
 (g) Disbursement Procedures . The Issuing Lender for any Letter of Credit shall, within the time allowed by applicable law or the specific terms of the Letter of Credit following its receipt thereof, examine all documents purporting to represent a demand for payment under such Letter of Credit. Such Issuing Lender shall promptly after such examination notify the Administrative Agent and the Borrower by telephone (confirmed by fax or through Electronic Systems) of such demand for payment if such Issuing Lender has made or will make an LC Disbursement thereunder provided that any failure to give or delay in giving such notice shall not relieve the Borrower of its obligation to reimburse such Issuing Lender and the Revolving Lenders with respect to any such LC Disbursement. 
 (h) Interim Interest . If the Issuing Lender for any Letter of Credit shall make any LC Disbursement, then, unless the Borrower shall reimburse such LC Disbursement in full on the date such LC Disbursement is made, the unpaid amount thereof shall bear interest, for each day from and including the date such LC Disbursement is made to but excluding the date that the Borrower reimburse such LC Disbursement, at the rate per annum then applicable to ABR Loans and such interest shall be due and payable on the date when such reimbursement is due provided that, if the Borrower fail to reimburse such LC Disbursement when due pursuant to paragraph (e) of this Section, then Section 2.11(c) shall apply. Interest accrued pursuant to this paragraph shall be for the account of such Issuing Lender, except that interest accrued on and after the date of payment by any Revolving Lender pursuant to paragraph (e) of this Section to reimburse such Issuing Lender for such LC Disbursement shall be for the account of such Lender to the extent of such payment. 
 (i) Replacement of the Issuing Lender . 
 (i) An Issuing Lender may be replaced at any time by written agreement among the Borrower, the Administrative Agent, the replaced Issuing Lender and the successor Issuing Lender. The Administrative Agent shall notify the Revolving Lenders of any such replacement of an Issuing Lender. At the time any such replacement shall become effective, the Borrower shall pay all unpaid fees accrued for the account of the replaced Issuing Lender pursuant to Section 2.10(b) . From and after the effective date of any such replacement, (A) the successor Issuing Lender shall have all the rights and obligations of an Issuing Lender under this Agreement with respect to Letters of Credit to be issued thereafter and (B) references herein to the term Issuing Lender shall be deemed to refer to such successor or to any previous Issuing Lender, or to such successor and all previous Issuing Lenders, as the context shall require. After the replacement of an Issuing Lender hereunder, the replaced Issuing Lender shall remain a party hereto and shall continue to have all the rights and obligations of an Issuing Lender under this Agreement with respect to Letters of Credit then 

outstanding and issued by it prior to such replacement, but shall not be required to issue additional Letters of Credit or extend or otherwise amend any existing Letter of Credit. 
 (ii) Subject to the appointment and acceptance of a successor Issuing Lender, any Issuing Lender may resign as an Issuing Lender at any time upon thirty days prior written notice to the Administrative Agent, the Borrower and the Lenders, in which case, such resigning Issuing Lender shall be replaced in accordance with Section 2.04(i)(i) above. 
 (j) Cash Collateralization . If any Event of Default shall occur and be continuing, on the Business Day that the Borrower receives notice from the Administrative Agent or the Required Lenders (or, if the maturity of the Loans has been accelerated, Revolving Lenders with LC Exposure representing at least 66.67 of the aggregate LC Exposure) demanding the deposit of cash collateral pursuant to this paragraph, the Borrower shall deposit in an account with the Administrative Agent, in the name of the Administrative Agent and for the benefit of the Revolving Lenders (the LC Collateral Account ), an amount in cash equal to 103 of the amount of the LC Exposure as of such date plus accrued and unpaid interest thereon provided that the obligation to deposit such cash collateral shall become effective immediately, and such deposit shall become immediately due and payable, without demand or other notice of any kind, upon the occurrence of any Event of Default with respect to the Borrower described in clause (h) or (i) of Article VII . The Borrower also shall deposit cash collateral in accordance with this paragraph as and to the extent required by Section 2.09(b) or Section 2.19 . Each such deposit shall be held by the Administrative Agent as collateral for the payment and performance of the Secured Obligations. The Administrative Agent shall have exclusive dominion and control, including the exclusive right of withdrawal, over the LC Collateral Account and the Borrower hereby grants the Administrative Agent for the benefit of the Lenders a security interest in the LC Collateral Account and all moneys or other assets on deposit therein or credited thereto. Other than any interest earned on the investment of such deposits, which investments shall be made at the option and sole discretion of the Administrative Agent and at the Borrower s risk and expense, such deposits shall not bear interest. Interest or profits, if any, on such investments shall accumulate in such account. Moneys in such account shall be applied by the Administrative Agent to reimburse the Issuing Lender for LC Disbursements for which it has not been reimbursed and, to the extent not so applied, shall be held for the satisfaction of the reimbursement obligations of the Borrower for the LC Exposure at such time or, if the maturity of the Loans has been accelerated, be applied to satisfy other Secured Obligations, and thereafter, paid over to the Borrower. If the Borrower is required to provide an amount of cash collateral hereunder as a result of the occurrence of an Event of Default, such amount (to the extent not applied as aforesaid) shall be returned to the Borrower within three (3) Business Days after all such Events of Defaults have been cured or waived as confirmed in writing by the Administrative Agent. 
 (k) Issuing Lender Reports to the Administrative Agent . Unless otherwise agreed by the Administrative Agent, each Issuing Lender shall, in addition to its notification obligations set forth elsewhere in this Section, report in writing to the Administrative Agent (i) periodic activity (for such period or recurrent periods as shall be requested by the Administrative Agent) in respect of Letters of Credit issued by such Issuing Lender, including all issuances, extensions and 

amendments, all expirations and cancelations and all disbursements and reimbursements, (ii) reasonably prior to the time that such Issuing Lender issues, amends or extends any Letter of Credit, the date of such issuance, amendment or extension, and the stated amount of the Letters of Credit issued, amended or extended by it and outstanding after giving effect to such issuance, amendment or extension (and whether the amounts thereof shall have changed), (iii) on each Business Day on which such Issuing Lender makes any LC Disbursement, the date and amount of such LC Disbursement, (iv) on any Business Day on which the Borrower fails to reimburse an LC Disbursement required to be reimbursed to such Issuing Lender on such day, the date of such failure and the amount of such LC Disbursement, and (v) on any other Business Day, such other information as the Administrative Agent shall reasonably request as to the Letters of Credit issued by such Issuing Lender.

Notwithstanding that a Letter of Credit issued or outstanding hereunder supports any obligations of, or is for the account of, a Subsidiary, or states that a Subsidiary is the account party, applicant, customer, instructing party, or the like of or for such Letter of Credit, and without derogating from any rights of the applicable Issuing Lender (whether arising by contract, at law, in equity or otherwise) against such Subsidiary in respect of such Letter of Credit, the Borrower (i) shall reimburse, indemnify and compensate the applicable Issuing Lender hereunder for such Letter of Credit (including to reimburse any and all drawings thereunder) as if such Letter of Credit had been issued solely for the account of the Borrower and (ii) irrevocably waives any and all defenses that might otherwise be available to it as a guarantor or surety of any or all of the obligations of such Subsidiary in respect of such Letter of Credit. The Borrower hereby acknowledges that the issuance of such Letters of Credit for its Subsidiaries inures to the benefit of the Borrower, and that the Borrower s business derives substantial benefits from the businesses of such Subsidiaries. 
 SECTION 2.05 Funding of Borrowings .

 (b) Unless the Administrative Agent shall have received notice from a Lender prior to the proposed date of any Loan that such Lender will not make available to the Administrative Agent such Lender s share of such Loan, the Administrative Agent may assume that such Lender has made such share available on such date in accordance with paragraph (a) of this Section and may, in reliance upon such assumption, make available to the Borrower a corresponding amount. In such event, if a Lender has not in fact made its share of the applicable Loan available to the Administrative Agent, then the applicable Lender and the Borrower severally agree to pay to the Administrative Agent forthwith on demand such corresponding amount with interest thereon, for each day from and including the date such amount is made available to the Borrower to but excluding the date of payment to the Administrative Agent, at (i) in the case of such Lender, the

If the Borrower and such Lender shall pay such interest to the Administrative Agent for the same or an overlapping period, the Administrative Agent shall promptly remit to the Borrower the amount of such interest paid by the Borrower for such period. If such Lender pays its share of the applicable Borrowing to the Administrative Agent, then the amount so paid shall constitute such Lender s Loan included in such Borrowing.

 the Administrative Agent will promptly so notify the Borrower and each Lender. 
 Upon notice thereof by the Administrative Agent to the Borrower, any obligation of the Lenders to make SOFR Loans, and any right of the Borrower to continue SOFR Loans or to convert ABR Loans to SOFR Loans, shall be suspended (to the extent of the affected SOFR Loans) until the Administrative Agent (with respect to clause (b), at the instruction of the Required Lenders) revokes such notice.

Upon receipt of an Illegality Notice, the Borrower shall, if necessary to avoid such illegality, upon demand from any Lender (with a copy to the Administrative Agent), prepay or, if applicable, convert all SOFR Loans to ABR Loans (the interest rate on which ABR Loans shall, if necessary to avoid such illegality, be determined by the Administrative Agent without reference to clause (c) of the definition of Alternate Base Rate ), on the Interest Payment Date

interest and fees as it becomes due hereunder or any other amount due under the Loan Documents and agrees that all such amounts charged shall constitute Loans, and that all such Borrowings shall be deemed to have been requested pursuant to Section 2.03 and (ii) the Administrative Agent to charge any deposit account of the Borrower maintained with the Administrative Agent for each payment of principal, interest and fees as it becomes due hereunder or any other amount due under the Loan Documents. 
 (d) If, except as otherwise expressly provided herein, any Lender shall, by exercising any right of set-off or counterclaim or otherwise, obtain payment in respect of any principal of or interest on any of its Loans or participations in LC Disbursements resulting in such Lender receiving payment of a greater proportion of the aggregate amount of its Loans and participations in LC Disbursements and accrued interest thereon than the proportion received by any other Lender, then the Lender receiving such greater proportion shall purchase (for cash at face value) participations in the Loans and participations in LC Disbursements of other Lenders to the extent necessary so that the benefit of all such payments shall be shared by the Lenders ratably in accordance with the aggregate amount of principal of and accrued interest on their respective Loans and participations in LC Disbursements provided that (i) if any such participations are purchased and all or any portion of the payment giving rise thereto is recovered, such participations shall be rescinded and the purchase price restored to the extent of such recovery, without interest, and (ii) the provisions of this paragraph shall not be construed to apply to any payment made by the Borrower pursuant to and in accordance with the express terms of this Agreement or any payment obtained by a Lender as consideration for the assignment of or sale of a participation in any of its Loans or participations in LC Disbursements to any assignee or participant, other than to the Borrower or any Subsidiary or Affiliate thereof (as to which the provisions of this paragraph shall apply).

 (e) Unless the Administrative Agent shall have received, prior to any date on which any payment is due to the Administrative Agent for the account of the Lenders or the Issuing Lender pursuant to the terms hereof or any other Loan Document (including any date that is fixed for prepayment by notice from the Borrower to the Administrative Agent pursuant to Section 2.09(d) ), notice from the Borrower that the Borrower will not make such payment or prepayment, the Administrative Agent may assume that the Borrower has made such payment on such date in accordance herewith and may, in reliance upon such assumption, distribute to the Lenders or the Issuing Lender, as the case may be, the amount due. In such event, if the Borrower has not in fact made such payment, then each of the Lenders or the Issuing Lender, as the case may be, severally agrees to repay to the Administrative Agent forthwith on demand the amount so distributed to such Lender or Issuing Lender with interest thereon, for each day from and including the date such amount is distributed to it to but excluding the date of payment to the Administrative Agent, at the greater of the Federal Funds Rate and a rate determined by the Administrative Agent in accordance with banking industry rules on interbank compensation. 
 (f) The Administrative Agent may from time to time provide the Borrower with account statements or invoices with respect to any of the Secured Obligations (the Statements ). 

The Administrative Agent is under no duty or obligation to provide Statements, which, if provided, will be solely for the Borrower s convenience.

The Borrower shall pay all reasonable costs and expenses incurred by any Lender in connection with any such designation or assignment. 
 (b) If any Lender requests compensation under Section 2.13 , or if the Borrower is required to pay any additional amount to any Lender or any Governmental Authority for the account of any Lender pursuant to Section 2.15 , or if any Lender becomes a Defaulting Lender, then the Borrower may, at its sole expense and effort, upon notice to such Lender and the Administrative Agent, require such Lender to assign and delegate, without recourse (in accordance with and subject to the restrictions contained in Section 9.04 , all its interests, rights (other than its existing rights to payments pursuant to Section 2.13 or Section 2.15 and obligations under this Agreement to an assignee that shall assume such obligations (which assignee may be another Lender, if a Lender accepts such assignment) provided that (i) the Borrower shall have received the prior written consent of the Administrative Agent (and in circumstances where its consent would be required under Section 9.04 , the Issuing Lender), which consent shall not unreasonably be withheld, (ii) such Lender shall have received payment of an amount equal to the outstanding principal of its Loans and participations in LC Disbursements, accrued interest thereon, accrued fees and all other amounts payable to it hereunder, from the assignee (to the extent of such outstanding principal and accrued interest and fees) or the Borrower (in the case of all other amounts) and (iii) in the case of any such assignment resulting from a claim for compensation under Section 2.13 or payments required to be made pursuant to Section 2.15 , such assignment will result in a reduction in such compensation or payments. A Lender shall not be required to make any such assignment and delegation if, prior thereto, as a result of a waiver by such Lender or otherwise, the circumstances entitling the Borrower to require such assignment and delegation cease to apply. Each party hereto agrees that (i) an assignment required pursuant to this paragraph may be effected pursuant to an Assignment and Assumption executed by the Borrower, the Administrative Agent and the 

assignee (or, to the extent applicable, an agreement incorporating an Assignment and Assumption by reference pursuant to an Approved Electronic Platform as to which the Administrative Agent and such parties are participants), and (ii) the Lender required to make such assignment need not be a party thereto in order for such assignment to be effective and shall be deemed to have consented to and be bound by the terms thereof provided that, following the effectiveness of any such assignment, the other parties to such assignment agree to execute and deliver such documents necessary to evidence such assignment as reasonably requested by the applicable Lender, provided that any such documents shall be without recourse to or warranty by the parties thereto.

The provisions of this Section 2.18 shall be and remain effective notwithstanding any contrary action which may have been taken by the Administrative Agent or any Lender in reliance upon such payment or application of proceeds. The provisions of this Section 2.18 shall survive the termination of this Agreement.

By accepting the benefits of the Collateral, each Secured Party that is a party to any such arrangement in respect of Banking Services or Swap Agreement, as applicable, shall be deemed to have appointed the Administrative Agent to serve as administrative agent and collateral agent under the Loan Documents and agreed to be bound by the Loan Documents as a Secured Party thereunder, subject to the limitations set forth in this paragraph. 
 (c) The Secured Parties irrevocably authorize the Administrative Agent, at its option and in its discretion, to subordinate any Lien on any property granted to or held by the Administrative Agent under any Loan Document to the holder of any Lien on such property that

The Administrative Agent shall not be responsible for or have a duty to ascertain or inquire into any representation or warranty regarding the existence, value or collectability of the Collateral, the existence, priority or perfection of the Administrative Agent s Lien thereon or any certificate prepared by any Loan Party in connection therewith, nor shall the Administrative Agent be responsible or liable to the Lenders or any other Secured Party for any failure to monitor or maintain any portion of the Collateral. 
 SECTION 8.08 Credit Bidding . The Secured Parties hereby irrevocably authorize the Administrative Agent, at the direction of the Required Lenders, to credit bid all or any portion of the Obligations (including by accepting some or all of the Collateral in satisfaction of some or all of the Obligations pursuant to a deed in lieu of foreclosure or otherwise) and in such manner purchase (either directly or through one or more acquisition vehicles) all or any portion of the Collateral (a) at any sale thereof conducted under the provisions of the Bankruptcy Code, including under Sections 363, 1123 or 1129 of the Bankruptcy Code, or any similar laws in any other jurisdictions to which a Loan Party is subject, or (b) at any other sale, foreclosure or acceptance of collateral in lieu of debt conducted by (or with the consent or at the direction of) the Administrative Agent (whether by judicial action or otherwise) in accordance with any applicable law. In connection with any such credit bid and purchase, the Obligations owed to the Secured Parties shall be credit bid by the Administrative Agent at the direction of the Required Lenders on a ratable basis (with Obligations with respect to contingent or unliquidated claims receiving contingent interests in the acquired assets on a ratable basis that shall vest upon the liquidation of such claims in an amount proportional to the liquidated portion of the contingent claim amount used in allocating the contingent interests) for the asset or assets so purchased (or for the equity interests or debt instruments of the acquisition vehicle or vehicles that are issued in connection with such purchase). In connection with any such bid (i) the Administrative Agent shall be authorized to form one or more acquisition vehicles and to assign any successful credit bid to such acquisition vehicle or vehicles (ii) each of the Secured Parties ratable interests in the Obligations which were credit bid shall be deemed without any further action under this Agreement to be assigned to such vehicle or vehicles for the purpose of closing such sale, (iii) the Administrative Agent shall be authorized to adopt documents providing for the governance of the acquisition vehicle or vehicles provided that any actions by the Administrative Agent with respect to such acquisition vehicle or vehicles, including any disposition of the assets or equity interests thereof, shall be governed, directly or indirectly, by, and the governing documents shall provide for, control by the vote of the Required Lenders or their permitted assignees under the terms of this Agreement or the governing documents of the applicable acquisition vehicle or vehicles, as the case may be, irrespective of the termination of this Agreement and without giving effect to the limitations on actions by the Required Lenders contained in Section 9.02 of this Agreement), (iv) the Administrative Agent on behalf of such acquisition vehicle or vehicles shall be authorized to issue to each of the Secured Parties, ratably on account of the relevant Obligations which were credit bid, interests, whether as equity, partnership interests, limited partnership interests or membership interests, in any such acquisition vehicle and or debt instruments issued by such acquisition vehicle, all without the need for any Secured Party or acquisition vehicle to take any further action, and (v) to the extent that Obligations that are assigned to an acquisition vehicle are not used to acquire Collateral for any reason (as a result of another bid being higher or better, because the amount of Obligations assigned to the acquisition vehicle exceeds the amount of Obligations credit bid by the acquisition vehicle or otherwise), such Obligations shall automatically be reassigned to the Secured Parties pro rata with their 

original interest in such Obligations and the equity interests and or debt instruments issued by any acquisition vehicle on account of such Obligations shall automatically be cancelled, without the need for any Secured Party or any acquisition vehicle to take any further action. Notwithstanding that the ratable portion of the Obligations of each Secured Party are deemed assigned to the acquisition vehicle or vehicles as set forth in clause (ii) above, each Secured Party shall execute such documents and provide such information regarding the Secured Party (and or any designee of the Secured Party which will receive interests in or debt instruments issued by such acquisition vehicle) as the Administrative Agent may reasonably request in connection with the formation of any acquisition vehicle, the formulation or submission of any credit bid or the consummation of the transactions contemplated by such credit bid.

The rights and remedies of the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Lender and the Lenders hereunder and under any other Loan Document are cumulative and are not exclusive of any rights or remedies that they would otherwise have.

payable hereunder, without the written consent of each Lender (including any such Lender that is a Defaulting Lender) affected thereby (except that any amendment or modification of the financial covenants in this Agreement (or defined terms used in the financial covenants in this Agreement) shall not constitute a reduction in the rate of interest or fees for purposes of this clause (B)), (C) postpone any scheduled date of payment of the principal amount of any Loan or LC Disbursement, or any date for the payment of any interest, fees or other Obligations payable hereunder, or reduce the amount of, waive or excuse any such payment, or postpone the scheduled date of expiration of any Commitment, without the written consent of each Lender (including any such Lender that is a Defaulting Lender) affected thereby, (D) change Section 2.07 or Section 2.16(b) or (d) in a manner that would alter the ratable reduction of Commitments or the manner in which payments are shared, without the written consent of each Lender (other than any Defaulting Lender), (E) change any of the provisions of this Section or the definition of Required Lenders or any other provision of any Loan Document specifying the number or percentage of Lenders required to waive, amend or modify any rights thereunder or make any determination or grant any consent thereunder, without the written consent of each Lender (other than any Defaulting Lender) directly affected thereby, (F) change Section 2.19 , without the consent of each Lender (other than any Defaulting Lender), (G) release any Guarantor from its obligation under its Guaranty (except as otherwise permitted herein or in the other Loan Documents), without the written consent of each Lender (other than any Defaulting Lender), or (H) except as provided in clause (c) of this Section or in any Collateral Document, release all or substantially all of the Collateral without the written consent of each Lender (other than any Defaulting Lender) provided , further , that no such agreement shall amend, modify or otherwise affect the rights or duties of the Administrative Agent or the Issuing Lender hereunder without the prior written consent of the Administrative Agent or the Issuing Lender, as the case may be (it being understood that any amendment to Section 2.19 shall require the consent of the Administrative Agent and the Issuing Lender) provided , further , that no such agreement shall amend or modify the provisions of Section 2.05 without the prior written consent of the Administrative Agent and the Issuing Lenders.

 (c) If, in connection with any proposed amendment, waiver or consent requiring the consent of each Lender or each Lender affected thereby, the consent of the Required Lenders is obtained, but the consent of other necessary Lenders is not obtained (any such Lender whose consent is necessary but has not been obtained being referred to herein as a Non-Consenting Lender ), then the Borrower may elect to replace a Non-Consenting Lender as a Lender party to this Agreement, provided that, concurrently with such replacement, (i) another bank or other entity which is reasonably satisfactory to the Borrower, the Administrative Agent and the Issuing Lender shall agree, as of such date, to purchase for cash the Loans and other Obligations due to the Non- Consenting Lender pursuant to an Assignment and Assumption and to become a Lender for all purposes under this Agreement and to assume all obligations of the Non-Consenting Lender to be terminated as of such date and to comply with the requirements of clause (b) of Section 9.04 , and (ii) the Borrower shall pay to such Non-Consenting Lender in same day funds on the day of such replacement (1) all interest, fees and other amounts then accrued but unpaid to such Non- Consenting Lender by the Borrower hereunder to and including the date of termination, including without limitation payments due to such Non-Consenting Lender under Section 2.13 and Section 2.15 , and (2) an amount, if any, equal to the payment which would have been due to such Lender on the day of such replacement under Section 2.13 had the Loans of such Non-Consenting Lender been prepaid on such date rather than sold to the replacement Lender. Each party hereto agrees that an assignment required pursuant to this paragraph may be effected pursuant to an Assignment and Assumption executed by the Borrower, the Administrative Agent and the assignee (or, to the extent applicable, an agreement incorporating an Assignment and Assumption by reference pursuant to an Approved Electronic Platform as to which the Administrative Agent and such parties are participants), and (b) the Lender required to make such assignment need not be a party thereto in order for such assignment to be effective and shall be deemed to have consented to an be bound by the terms thereof provided that, following the effectiveness of any such assignment, the other parties to such assignment agree to execute and deliver such documents necessary to evidence such assignment as reasonably requested by the applicable Lender, provided that any such documents shall be without recourse to or warranty by the parties thereto.

 (a) If the Administrative Agent (x) notifies a Lender, Issuing Lender or Secured Party, or any Person who has received funds on behalf of a Lender, Issuing Lender or Secured Party (any such Lender, Issuing Lender, Secured Party or other recipient (and each of their respective successors and assigns), a Payment Recipient that the Administrative Agent has determined in its sole discretion (whether or not after receipt of any notice under immediately succeeding clause (b) that any funds (as set forth in such notice from the Administrative Agent) received by such Payment Recipient from the Administrative Agent or any of its Affiliates were erroneously or mistakenly transmitted to, or otherwise erroneously or mistakenly received by, such Payment Recipient (whether or not known to such Lender, Issuing Lender, Secured Party or other Payment Recipient on its behalf) (any such funds, whether transmitted or received as a payment, prepayment or repayment of principal, interest, fees, distribution or otherwise, individually and collectively, an Erroneous Payment and (y) demands in writing the return of such Erroneous Payment (or a portion thereof), such Erroneous Payment shall at all times remain the property of the Administrative Agent pending its return or repayment as contemplated below in this Section 9.22 and held in trust for the benefit of the Administrative Agent, and such Lender, Issuing Lender or Secured Party shall (or, with respect to any Payment Recipient who received such funds on its behalf, shall cause such Payment Recipient to) promptly, but in no event later than two Business Days thereafter (or such later date as the Administrative Agent may, in its sole discretion, specify in writing), return to the Administrative Agent the amount of any such Erroneous Payment (or portion thereof) as to which such a demand was made, in same day funds (in the currency so received), together with interest thereon (except to the extent waived in writing by the Administrative Agent) in respect of each day from and including the date such Erroneous Payment (or portion thereof) was received by such Payment Recipient to the date such amount is repaid to the Administrative Agent in same day funds at the greater of the Federal Funds Rate and a rate determined by the Administrative Agent in accordance with banking industry rules on interbank compensation from time to time in effect. A notice of the Administrative Agent to any Payment Recipient under this clause (a) shall be conclusive, absent manifest error. 
 
 (b) Without limiting immediately preceding clause (a) , each Payment Recipient, agrees that if it receives a payment, prepayment or repayment (whether received as a payment, prepayment or repayment of principal, interest, fees, distribution or otherwise) from the Administrative Agent (or any of its Affiliates) (x) that is in a different amount than, or on a different date from, that specified in this Agreement or in a notice of payment, prepayment or repayment sent by the Administrative Agent (or any of its Affiliates) with respect to such payment, prepayment or repayment, (y) that was not preceded or accompanied by a notice of payment, prepayment or 

repayment sent by the Administrative Agent (or any of its Affiliates), or (z) that such Payment Recipient otherwise becomes aware was transmitted, or received, in error or by mistake (in whole or in part), then in each such case 
 (i) it acknowledges and agrees that (A) in the case of immediately preceding clauses (x) or (y) , an error and mistake shall be presumed to have been made (absent written confirmation from the Administrative Agent to the contrary) or (B) an error and mistake has been made (in the case of immediately preceding clause (z) ), in each case, with respect to such payment, prepayment or repayment and 
 
 (ii) such Lender, Issuing Lender or Secured Party shall (and shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause any other recipient that receives funds on its respective behalf to) promptly (and, in all events, within one Business Day of its knowledge of the occurrence of any of the circumstances described in immediately preceding clauses (x) , (y) and (z) notify the Administrative Agent of its receipt of such payment, prepayment or repayment, the details thereof (in reasonable detail) and that it is so notifying the Administrative Agent pursuant to this Section 9.22(b) . 
 For the avoidance of doubt, the failure to deliver a notice to the Administrative Agent pursuant to this Section 9.22(b) shall not have any effect on a Payment Recipient s obligations pursuant to Section 9.22(a) or on whether or not an Erroneous Payment has been made. 
 
 (c) Each Lender, Issuing Lender or Secured Party hereby authorizes the Administrative Agent to set off, net and apply any and all amounts at any time owing to such Lender, Issuing Lender or Secured Party under any Loan Document, or otherwise payable or distributable by the Administrative Agent to such Lender, Issuing Lender or Secured Party under any Loan Document with respect to any payment of principal, interest, fees or other amounts against any amount that the Administrative Agent has demanded to be returned under immediately preceding clause (a) . 
 
 (d) (i) In the event that an Erroneous Payment (or portion thereof) is not recovered by the Administrative Agent for any reason, after demand therefor in accordance with immediately preceding clause (a) , from any Lender that has received such Erroneous Payment (or portion thereof) (and or from any Payment Recipient who received such Erroneous Payment (or portion thereof) on its respective behalf) (such unrecovered amount, an Erroneous Payment Return Deficiency ), upon the Administrative Agent s notice to such Lender at any time, then effective immediately (with the consideration therefor being acknowledged by the parties hereto), (A) such Lender shall be deemed to have assigned its Loans (but not its Commitment) with respect to which such Erroneous Payment was made (the Erroneous Payment Impacted Class in an amount equal to the Erroneous Payment Return Deficiency (or such lesser amount as the Administrative Agent may specify) (such assignment of the Loans (but not Commitments) of the Erroneous Payment Impacted Class, the Erroneous Payment Deficiency Assignment (on a cashless basis and such amount calculated at par plus any accrued and unpaid interest (with the assignment fee to be waived by the Administrative Agent in such instance)), and is hereby (together with the Borrower) deemed to execute and deliver an Assignment and Assumption with respect to such Erroneous Payment Deficiency Assignment, and such Lender shall deliver any Notes evidencing such Loans to the Administrative Agent (but the failure of such Person to deliver any such Notes shall not affect the effectiveness of the foregoing assignment), (B) the Administrative Agent as the assignee Lender shall be deemed to have acquired the Erroneous Payment Deficiency Assignment, (C) upon such 

deemed acquisition, the Administrative Agent as the assignee Lender shall become a Lender, as applicable, hereunder with respect to such Erroneous Payment Deficiency Assignment and the assigning Lender shall cease to be a Lender, as applicable, hereunder with respect to such Erroneous Payment Deficiency Assignment, excluding, for the avoidance of doubt, its obligations under the indemnification provisions of this Agreement and its Commitment which shall survive as to such assigning Lender, (D) the Administrative Agent and the Borrower shall each be deemed to have waived any consents required under this Agreement to any such Erroneous Payment Deficiency Assignment, and (E) the Administrative Agent will reflect in the Register its ownership interest in the Loans subject to the Erroneous Payment Deficiency Assignment. For the avoidance of doubt, no Erroneous Payment Deficiency Assignment will reduce the Commitment of any Lender and such Commitment shall remain available in accordance with the terms of this Agreement. 
 (ii) Subject to Section 9.04 (but excluding, in all events, any assignment consent or approval requirements (whether from the Borrower or otherwise)), the Administrative Agent may, in its discretion, sell any Loans acquired pursuant to an Erroneous Payment Deficiency Assignment and upon receipt of the proceeds of such sale, the Erroneous Payment Return Deficiency owing by the applicable Lender shall be reduced by the net proceeds of the sale of such Loan (or portion thereof), and the Administrative Agent shall retain all other rights, remedies and claims against such Lender (and or against any recipient that receives funds on its respective behalf). In addition, an Erroneous Payment Return Deficiency owing by the applicable Lender (x) shall be reduced by the proceeds of prepayments or repayments of principal and interest, or other distribution in respect of principal and interest, received by the Administrative Agent on or with respect to any such Loans acquired from such Lender pursuant to an Erroneous Payment Deficiency Assignment (to the extent that any such Loans are then owned by the Administrative Agent) and (y) may, in the sole discretion of the Administrative Agent, be reduced by any amount specified by the Administrative Agent in writing to the applicable Lender from time to time. 
 
 (e) The parties hereto agree that (x) irrespective of whether the Administrative Agent may be equitably subrogated, in the event that an Erroneous Payment (or portion thereof) is not recovered from any Payment Recipient that has received such Erroneous Payment (or portion thereof) for any reason, the Administrative Agent shall be subrogated to all the rights and interests of such Payment Recipient (and, in the case of any Payment Recipient who has received funds on behalf of a Lender, Issuing Lender or Secured Party, to the rights and interests of such Lender, Issuing Lender or Secured Party, as the case may be) under the Loan Documents with respect to such amount (the Erroneous Payment Subrogation Rig hts ( provided that the Loan Parties Obligations under the Loan Documents in respect of the Erroneous Payment Subrogation Rights shall not be duplicative of such Obligations in respect of Loans that have been assigned to the Administrative Agent under an Erroneous Payment Deficiency Assignment) and (y) an Erroneous Payment shall not pay, prepay, repay, discharge or otherwise satisfy any Obligations owed by the Borrower or any other Loan Party provided that this Section 9.22 shall not be interpreted to increase (or accelerate the due date for), or have the effect of increasing (or accelerating the due date for), the Obligations of the Borrower relative to the amount (and or timing for payment) of the Obligations that would have been payable had such Erroneous Payment not been made by the Administrative Agent provided , further , that for the avoidance of doubt, immediately preceding clauses (x) and (y) shall not apply to the extent any such Erroneous Payment is, and solely with 

respect to the amount of such Erroneous Payment that is, comprised of funds received by the Administrative Agent from the Borrower for the purpose of making such Erroneous Payment. 
 
 (f) To the extent permitted by applicable law, no Payment Recipient shall assert any right or claim to an Erroneous Payment, and hereby waives, and is deemed to waive, any claim, counterclaim, defense or right of set-off or recoupment with respect to any demand, claim or counterclaim by the Administrative Agent for the return of any Erroneous Payment received, including, without limitation, any defense based on discharge for value or any similar doctrine. 
 
 (g) Each party s obligations, agreements and waivers under this Section 9.22 shall survive the resignation or replacement of the Administrative Agent, any transfer of rights or obligations by, or the replacement of, a Lender or Issuing Lender, the termination of the Commitments and or the repayment, satisfaction or discharge of all Obligations (or any portion thereof) under any Loan Document. 

ARTICLE X 
 Guaranty 
 
 SECTION 10.01 Guaranty . Each Guarantor hereby agrees that it is jointly and severally liable for, and, as a primary obligor and not merely as surety, absolutely and unconditionally and irrevocably guarantees to the Secured Parties, the prompt payment when due, whether at stated maturity, upon acceleration or otherwise, and at all times thereafter, of the Secured Obligations and all costs and expenses including, without limitation, all court costs and reasonable attorneys fees and expenses paid or incurred by the Secured Parties in endeavoring to collect all or any part of the Secured Obligations from, or in prosecuting any action against, the Borrower, any Guarantor or any other guarantor of all or any part of the Secured Obligations (such costs and expenses, together with the Secured Obligations, collectively the Guaranteed Obligations provided , however , that the definition of Guaranteed Obligations shall not create any guarantee by any Guarantor of (or grant of security interest by any Guarantor to support, as applicable) any Excluded Swap Obligations of such Guarantor for purposes of determining any obligations of any Guarantor). Each Guarantor further agrees that the Guaranteed Obligations may be extended or renewed in whole or in part without notice to or further assent from it, and that it remains bound upon its guarantee notwithstanding any such extension or renewal. All terms of this Guaranty apply to and may be enforced by or on behalf of any domestic or foreign branch or Affiliate of any Lender that extended any portion of the Guaranteed Obligations. 
 SECTION 10.02 Guaranty of Payment . This Guaranty is a guaranty of payment and not of collection. Each Guarantor waives any right to require the Lenders to sue the Borrower, any Guarantor, any other guarantor of, or any other Person obligated for all or any part of the Guaranteed Obligations (each, an Obligated Party ), or otherwise to enforce its payment against any collateral securing all or any part of the Guaranteed Obligations. 
 SECTION 10.03 No Discharge or Diminishment of Guaranty . 
 a. Except as otherwise provided for herein, the obligations of each Guarantor hereunder are unconditional and absolute and not subject to any reduction, limitation, impairment or termination for any reason (other than Payment in Full of the Guaranteed Obligations), including (i) any claim of waiver, release, extension, renewal, settlement, surrender, alteration, or compromise of any of the Guaranteed Obligations, by operation of law or otherwise (ii) any change in the corporate existence, structure or ownership of the Borrower or any other Obligated Party liable for any of the Guaranteed Obligations (iii) any insolvency, bankruptcy, reorganization or other similar proceeding affecting any Obligated Party, or their assets or any resulting release or discharge of any obligation of any Obligated Party or (iv) the existence of any claim, setoff or other rights which any Guarantor may have at any time against any Obligated Party, the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Lender, the Lenders or any other Person, whether in connection herewith or in any unrelated transactions. 
 
 b. The obligations of each Guarantor hereunder are not subject to any defense or setoff, counterclaim, recoupment, or termination whatsoever by reason of the invalidity, illegality, or unenforceability of any of the Guaranteed Obligations or otherwise, or any provision of applicable 

law or regulation purporting to prohibit payment by any Obligated Party, of the Guaranteed Obligations or any part thereof. 
 
 c. Further, the obligations of any Guarantor hereunder are not discharged or impaired or otherwise affected by (i) the failure of the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Lender or any Lender to assert any claim or demand or to enforce any remedy with respect to all or any part of the Guaranteed Obligations (ii) any waiver or modification of or supplement to any provision of any agreement relating to the Guaranteed Obligations (iii) any release, non-perfection, or invalidity of any indirect or direct security for the obligations of the Borrower for all or any part of the Guaranteed Obligations or any obligations of any other Obligated Party liable for any of the Guaranteed Obligations (iv) any action or failure to act by the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Lender or any Lender with respect to any collateral securing any part of the Guaranteed Obligations or (v) any default, failure or delay, willful or otherwise, in the payment or performance of any of the Guaranteed Obligations, or any other circumstance, act, omission or delay that might in any manner or to any extent vary the risk of such Guarantor or that would otherwise operate as a discharge of any Guarantor as a matter of law or equity (other than the Payment in Full of the Guaranteed Obligations). 
 SECTION 10.04 Defenses Waived . To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, each Guarantor hereby waives any defense based on or arising out of any defense of the Borrower or any Guarantor or the unenforceability of all or any part of the Guaranteed Obligations from any cause, or the cessation from any cause of the liability of the Borrower, any Guarantor or any other Obligated Party, other than the Payment in Full in cash of the Guaranteed Obligations. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, each Guarantor irrevocably waives acceptance hereof, presentment, demand, protest and, to the fullest extent permitted by law, any notice not provided for herein, as well as any requirement that at any time any action be taken by any Person against any Obligated Party, or any other Person. Each Guarantor confirms that it is not a surety under any state law and shall not raise any such law as a defense to its obligations hereunder. The Administrative Agent may, at its election, or at the request of the Required Lenders, shall foreclose on any Collateral held by it by one or more judicial or nonjudicial sales, accept an assignment of any such Collateral in lieu of foreclosure or otherwise act or fail to act with respect to any collateral securing all or a part of the Guaranteed Obligations, compromise or adjust any part of the Guaranteed Obligations, make any other accommodation with any Obligated Party or exercise any other right or remedy available to it against any Obligated Party, without affecting or impairing in any way the liability of such Guarantor under this Guaranty, except to the extent the Guaranteed Obligations have been Paid in Full. To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, each Guarantor waives any defense arising out of any such election even though that election may operate, pursuant to applicable law, to impair or extinguish any right of reimbursement or subrogation or other right or remedy of any Guarantor against any Obligated Party or any security. 
 SECTION 10.05 Rights of Subrogation . No Guarantor will assert any right, claim or cause of action, including, without limitation, a claim of subrogation, contribution or indemnification that it has against any Obligated Party, or any collateral, until the Loan Parties and the Guarantors have fully performed all their obligations to the Lenders. Subject to the preceding sentence, the Guarantors agree among themselves that, in connection with payments made hereunder, each Guarantor shall have subrogation and contribution rights against the other 

Guarantors as permitted under applicable law and, in addition, shall also have a right of contribution against all other Loan Parties in respect of any such payment pro rata among the Loan Parties. 
 SECTION 10.06 Reinstatement Stay of Acceleration . If at any time any payment of any portion of the Guaranteed Obligations (including a payment effected through exercise of a right of setoff) is rescinded or must otherwise be restored or returned upon the insolvency, bankruptcy, or reorganization of the Borrower or otherwise (including pursuant to any settlement entered into by a Secured Party in its discretion), each Guarantor s obligations under this Guaranty with respect to that payment shall be reinstated at such time as though the payment had not been made and whether or not the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Lender or any Lender is in possession of this Guaranty. If acceleration of the time for payment of any of the Guaranteed Obligations is stayed upon the insolvency, bankruptcy or reorganization of the Borrower, all such amounts otherwise subject to acceleration under the terms of any agreement relating to the Guaranteed Obligations shall nonetheless be payable by the Guarantors forthwith on demand by the Administrative Agent. 
 SECTION 10.07 Information . Each Guarantor assumes all responsibility for being and keeping itself informed of the Borrower s financial condition and assets, and of all other circumstances bearing upon the risk of nonpayment of the Guaranteed Obligations and the nature, scope and extent of the risks that each Guarantor assumes and incurs under this Guaranty, and agrees that the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Lender and the Lenders shall not have any duty to advise any Guarantor of information known to it regarding those circumstances or risks. 
 SECTION 10.08 Termination . The Lenders may continue to make loans or extend credit to the Borrower based on this Guaranty until five (5) days after it receives written notice of termination from any Guarantor. Notwithstanding receipt of any such notice, each Guarantor will continue to be liable to the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Lender and the Lenders for any Guaranteed Obligations created, assumed or committed to prior to the fifth day after receipt of the notice, and all subsequent renewals, extensions, modifications and amendments with respect to, or substitutions for, all or any part of such Guaranteed Obligations. Nothing in this Section 10.08 shall be deemed to constitute a waiver of, or eliminate, limit, reduce or otherwise impair any rights or remedies the Administrative Agent may have in respect of, any Default or Event of Default that shall exist under Article VII hereof as a result of any such notice of termination. 
 SECTION 10.09 Taxes . Each payment of the Guaranteed Obligations will be made by each Guarantor without withholding for any Taxes, unless such withholding is required by law. If any Guarantor determines, in its sole discretion exercised in good faith, that it is so required to withhold Taxes, then such Guarantor may so withhold and shall timely pay the full amount of withheld Taxes to the relevant Governmental Authority in accordance with applicable law. If such Taxes are Indemnified Taxes, then the amount payable by such Guarantor shall be increased as necessary so that, net of such withholding (including such withholding applicable to additional amounts payable under this Section), the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Lender and the Lenders receive the amount it would have received had no such withholding been made. 
 SECTION 10.10 Maximum Liability . Notwithstanding any other provision of this Guaranty, the amount guaranteed by each Guarantor hereunder shall be limited to the extent, if 

any, required so that its obligations hereunder shall not be subject to avoidance under Section 548 of the Bankruptcy Code or under any applicable state Uniform Fraudulent Transfer Act, Uniform Fraudulent Conveyance Act or similar statute or common law. In determining the limitations, if any, on the amount of any Guarantor s obligations hereunder pursuant to the preceding sentence, it is the intention of the parties hereto that any rights of subrogation, indemnification or contribution which such Guarantor may have under this Loan Guaranty, any other agreement or applicable law shall be taken into account. 
 SECTION 10.11 Liability Cumulative . The liability of each Loan Party as a Guarantor under this Guaranty is in addition to and shall be cumulative with all liabilities of each Loan Party to the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Lender and the Lenders under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents to which such Loan Party is a party or in respect of any obligations or liabilities of the other Loan Parties, without any limitation as to amount, unless the instrument or agreement evidencing or creating such other liability specifically provides to the contrary. 
 SECTION 10.12 Keepwell . Each Guarantor that is a Qualified ECP Guarantor (at the time of the Guaranty or the grant of a security interest under the Loan Documents by any such Loan Party, in either case, becomes effective with respect to any Swap Obligation) hereby jointly and severally absolutely, unconditionally and irrevocably undertakes to provide such funds or other support as may be needed from time to time by each other Loan Party to honor all of its obligations under this Guaranty in respect of a Swap Obligation (provided, however, that each Qualified ECP Guarantor shall only be liable under this Section 10.12 for the maximum amount of such liability that can be incurred under Section 10.11 ). Except as otherwise provided herein, the obligations of each Qualified ECP Guarantor under this Section 10.12 shall remain in full force and effect until the termination of all Swap Obligations. Each Qualified ECP Guarantor intends that this Section 10.12 constitute, and this Section 10.12 shall be deemed to constitute, a keepwell, support, or other agreement for the benefit of each other Loan Party for all purposes of Section 1a(18)(A)(v)(II) of the Commodity Exchange Act.
