million as of September 30, 2024. The Company has historically incurred net losses on an annual basis and does not generate sufficient cash flow from operating activities to fund operations and meet obligations on a timely basis. The Company has generated no revenue from its therapeutic product candidate. Unless the Company obtains additional financing or extends the maturity on its existing financing, the Company does not have sufficient cash on hand to sustain operations for at least twelve months from the issuance date of these condensed consolidated financial statements. There can be no assurance that the Company will be successful in maintaining normal operating cash flow or obtaining additional funding. These circumstances raise substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. For the foreseeable future, the Company s ability to continue its operations is dependent upon its ability to obtain additional financing or to extend the maturity on its existing financing. The accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments to reflect the possible future effects on the recoverability and classification of assets or the amounts and classifications of liabilities that may result from the outcome of the uncertainty concerning the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. The Company continues to evaluate various financing sources and options to raise working capital to help fund current research and development programs and operations. The Company plans to obtain significant additional funding from sources, including through debt and equity financing, license arrangements, grants and/or collaborative research arrangements to sustain its operations and develop products. The timing and degree of any future capital requirements will depend on several factors, including: the accuracy of the assumptions underlying the estimates for capital needs; 

 the extent that revenues from sales of LSC and LCT products cover the related costs and provide capital; 

 scientific progress in research and development programs; 

 the magnitude and scope of the Company s research and development programs and its ability to establish, enforce and maintain strategic arrangements for research, development, clinical testing, manufacturing and marketing;

revenue-generating operating segments, the biomedical market (LCT) and anti-aging market (LSC). The anti-aging market sells products solely through the ecommerce channel. The biomedical market sells primary human cell research products with product categories, cells and media, which are sold both domestically and internationally. The biomedical market also offers performance of quality control (QC) testing services. revenue from services was earned during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 .

Contract terms for the unit price, quantity, shipping and payment are governed by sales agreements, invoices or online order forms, which the Company considers to be a customer's contract. The unit price is considered the observable stand-alone selling price for the performance obligation(s) within the arrangements. Any promotional or volume sales discounts are applied evenly to the units sold for purposes of calculating standalone selling price. The Company recognizes revenue when its customer obtains control of the promised goods or services in an amount that reflects the consideration which the entity expects to receive in exchange for those goods or services. Product sales generally consist of a single performance obligation that the Company satisfies at a point in time (i.e., upon shipment of the product). For LSC products, ecommerce sales are primarily paid through credit card charges. The anti-aging and biomedical products standard payment terms for its customers are generally 30 days after the Company satisfies the performance obligation(s). The Company elects to account for shipping and handling costs, recognized as cost of sales, as activities to fulfill the promise to transfer the goods to a customer. As a result, no consideration is allocated to shipping and handling costs. Rather, the Company accrues the cost of shipping and handling upon shipment of the product, and all contract revenue (i.e., the transaction price) is recognized at the same time. Variable Consideration The Company records revenue from customers in an amount that reflects the consideration it expects to be entitled to after transferring control of those goods or services to a customer. From time to time, the Company offers sales promotions on its products such as discounts and free product offers. Variable consideration is estimated at contract inception only to the extent that it is probable that a significant reversal of revenue will not occur and is updated at the end of each reporting period as additional information becomes available. Practical Expedients The Company has elected the practical expedient to not determine whether contracts with customers contain significant financing components. The Company pays commissions on certain sales for its biomedical and anti-aging product markets once the customer payment has been received, which are accrued at the time of sale. The Company generally expenses sales commissions when incurred because the amortization period would be or less. These costs are recorded within selling and marketing expenses. In addition, the Company has elected to exclude sales taxes consideration from the determined transaction price. 
 product return guarantee; however, the Company determined that there is a low probability that returns will occur based on its historical rate of returns. Historically, returns have not been significant and are recognized as a reduction to current period revenue. As of September 30, 2024 and 2023 , the Company recorded allowance for sales returns. 
 
 of qualified research and development expenditures, not to exceed established thresholds. The Australian research and development tax incentive program is a self-assessment process, and the Australian Government has the right to review the Company s qualifying programs and related expenditures for a period of four years. If such a review were to occur and, as a result of the review and failure of a related appeal, the qualified program and related expenditures were disqualified, the respective research and development refunds could be recalled with penalties and interest.

Series D Preferred Stock Redemption The Company s Series D redeemable convertible preferred stock contains a contingent redemption feature that is not solely within the Company s control. Accordingly, the Series D redeemable convertible preferred stock is classified in temporary equity (outside of permanent equity) on the accompanying condensed consolidated balance sheets. As of September 30, 2024, Management concluded the contingency is not probable of being resolved. The Company will continue to monitor the probability of the contingency event at each reporting date. Dividends Holders of the Company s convertible preferred stock are entitled to participating dividends with common stock when and if declared by the Company s Board of Directors. The Series D and G convertible preferred stock previously had rights to cumulative dividends in liquidation whether declared or not declared. Since the holders waived the rights to such dividends indefinitely, this does not have an ongoing impact. dividends have been declared during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. Liquidation Liquidation preference among classes of preferred shares is first with Series D with priority followed by Series G, Series B and Series I-2 on the proceeds from any sale or liquidation of the Company in an amount equal to the purchase price of shares plus (in the case of the Series B) an amount equal to of the Series B original issue price for every two calendar months from February 1, 2008. Following the satisfaction of the liquidation preferences, all shares of common stock participate in any remaining distribution. Conversion The shares of convertible preferred stock are convertible into shares of common stock at any time, at the option of the holder. The conversion rates of the Series B, Series D, and Series I-2 are subject to anti-dilution adjustments whereby, subject to specified exceptions, if the Company issues equity securities or securities convertible into equity at a price below the applicable conversion price of the Series B, Series D, and Series I-2, the conversion price of each such series shall be adjusted downward to equal the price of the new securities. The conversion rate of the Series G is subject to a weighted-average adjustment in the event of the issuance of additional shares of common stock below the conversion price, subject to specified exceptions. The conversion price of the Series I-2 are also subject to certain resets as set forth in the Certificates of Designation, including a reverse stock split.

Related party note payable Between March 2018 and September 2022, to obtain funding for working capital purposes, the Company borrowed a total of million from Dr. Semechkin and issued an unsecured, non-convertible promissory note in the principal amount of million (the Note to Dr. Semechkin. The outstanding principal amount under the Note accrued interest at a rate of per annum. On March 14, 2023, the Noteholder surrendered the September 2022 Note, and the Company issued a new promissory note March 2023 Note ), which featured all the same terms as the previously outstanding note, with the exception of an extension of the maturity date from to . The March 2023 Note has a principal balance of million, an interest rate of , and features optional prepayment terms. There were debt issuance fees associated with this issuance.

to . The September 2024 Note has a principal balance of million, an interest rate of , and features optional prepayment terms. There were debt issuance fees associated with this issuance. All amendments during the year ended December 31, 2023 qualified as troubled debt restructurings, which did not result in a gain as the carrying amount of the debt was less than the total future cash payments of the restructured debt. On September 15, 2024, the Company amended its September 2024 Note, which included repaying million in outstanding principal, reducing the principal balance to million, increasing the interest rate from to , and extending the maturity date from to September 2025 Note ). All other terms of the September 2025 Note are the same as the previously outstanding note and there were debt issuance fees associated with this issuance. Pursuant to ASC 470-60, the amendment did not qualify as a troubled debt restructuring as the creditor did not grant a concession. As the terms of the September 2025 Note were not substantially different than the terms of the September 2024 Note, the amendment was accounted for as a debt modification. The repayment of principal was accounted for as a partial extinguishment of debt, which did not result in an extinguishment gain or loss.

Item 2. Ma nagement s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 
 The following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements and related notes and other financial information included elsewhere herein. This information should also be read in conjunction with our audited historical consolidated financial statements which are included in our Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023 Form 10-K ). The discussion contains forward-looking statements, such as our plans, expectations and intentions (including those related to clinical trials and business and expense trends), that are based upon current expectations and that involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results may differ significantly from management s expectations. The factors that could affect these forward-looking statements are discussed in the Risk Factors included in our Form 10-K. This discussion should not be construed to imply that the results discussed herein will necessarily continue into the future, or that any expectations expressed herein will necessarily be indicative of actual operating results in the future. Such discussion represents only the best assessment by our management. 
 Business Overview 
 We are a clinical stage biotechnology company focused on therapeutic and biomedical product development with multiple long-term therapeutic opportunities and two revenue-generating businesses offering potential for increased future revenue. We have generated aggregate product revenues from our two commercial businesses of 2.2 million and 2.0 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and 6.6 million and 5.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. We currently have no revenue generated from our principal operations in therapeutic and clinical product development. 
 Our products are based on multi-decade experience with human cell culture and a proprietary type of pluripotent stem cells, human parthenogenetic stem cells hpSCs ). Our hpSCs are comparable to human embryonic stem cells hESCs in that they have the potential to be differentiated into many different cells in the human body. However, the derivation of hpSCs does not require the use of fertilized eggs or the destruction of viable human embryos and also offers the potential for the creation of immune-matched cells and tissues that are less likely to be rejected following transplantation. Our collection of hpSCs, known as UniStemCell , currently consists of 15 stem cell lines. We have facilities and manufacturing protocols that comply with the requirements of Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP) standards as promulgated by the U.S. Code of Federal Regulations and enforced by the United States Food and Drug Administration FDA ). 
 Market Opportunity and Growth Strategy 
 Therapeutic Market Clinical Applications of hpSCs for Disease Treatments 
 We are developing different cell types from our stem cells that may result in therapeutic products. We focus on applications where cell and tissue therapy is already proven but where there is an insufficient supply of functional cells or tissue. 
 We believe that the most promising potential clinical applications of our technology are Parkinson s disease PD ), traumatic brain injury TBI ), and stroke. Using our proprietary technologies and know-how, we are creating neural stem cells from hpSCs as a potential treatment of PD, TBI, and stroke. 
 PD: Our most advanced project is the neural stem cell program for the treatment of Parkinson s disease. In 2013, we published in Nature Scientific Reports the basis for our patent on a new method of manufacturing neural stem cells, which is used to produce the clinical-grade cells necessary for future clinical studies and commercialization. In 2014, we completed the majority of the preclinical research, establishing the safety profile of NSC in various animal species, including non-human primates. In June 2016, we published the results of a 12-month pre-clinical non-human primate study, which demonstrated the safety, efficacy and mechanism of action of the ISC- hpNSC . In 2017, we dosed four patients in our Phase I trial of ISC-hpNSC , human parthenogenetic stem cell-derived neural stem cells for the treatment of Parkinson s disease. We reported 12-month results from the first cohort and 6-month interim results of the second cohort at the Society for Neuroscience annual meeting (Neuroscience 2018) in November 2018. In April 2019, we announced the completion of subject enrollment, with the 12th subject receiving a transplantation of the highest dose of cells. There have been no safety signals or serious adverse effects seen to date as related to the transplanted ISC-hpNSC cells. 
 We announced the successful completion of the dose escalating phase 1 clinical trial in June 2021. In terms of preliminary efficacy, where scores are compared against baseline before transplantation, we observed a potential dose-dependent response with an apparent peak effectiveness at our middle dose. The OFF-Time, which is the time during the day when levodopa medication is not performing optimally and PD symptoms return, decreased an average 47 from the baseline at 12 months post transplantation in cohort 2. This trend continued through 24 months where the OFF-Time in the second cohort dropped by 55 from the initial reading. The same was true for ON-Time without dyskinesia, which is the time during the day when levodopa medication is performing optimally without dyskinesia. The ON-Time increased an average of 42 above the initial evaluation at 12 months post-transplantation in the second cohort. 
 Stroke: In August 2014, we announced the launch of a stroke program, evaluating the use of ISC-hpNSC transplantation for the treatment of ischemic stroke using a rodent model of the disease. The Company has a considerable amount of safety data on ISC-hpNSC from the Parkinson s disease program and, as there is evidence that transplantation of ISC-hpNSC may improve patient 
 20 

outcomes as an adjunctive therapeutic strategy in stroke, having a second program that can use this safety dataset is therefore a logical extension. In 2015, the Company together with Tulane University demonstrated that NSC can significantly reduce neurological dysfunction after a stroke in animal models. 
 TBI: In October 2016, we announced the results of the pre-clinical rodent study, evaluating the use of ISC-hpNSC transplantation for the treatment of TBI. The study was conducted at the University of South Florida Morsani College of Medicine. We demonstrated that animals receiving injections of ISC-hpNSC displayed the highest levels of improvements in cognitive performance and motor coordination compared to vehicle control treated animals. In February 2019, we published the results of the pre-clinical study in Theranostics, a prestigious peer-reviewed medical journal. The publication titled, Human parthenogenetic neural stem cell grafts promote multiple regenerative processes in a traumatic brain injury model, demonstrated that the clinical-grade neural stem cells used in our Parkinson s disease clinical trial, ISC-hpNSC , significantly improved TBI-associated motor, neurological, and cognitive deficits without any safety issues. 
 Anti-Aging Cosmetic Market Skin Care Products 
 Our wholly owned subsidiary Lifeline Skin Care, Inc. LSC develops, manufactures and sells anti-aging skin care products based on two core technologies: encapsulated extract derived from hpSC and specially selected targeted small molecules. LSC s products include: 
 ProPlus Advanced Defense Complex 

ProPlus Advanced Recovery Complex 

ProPlus Eye Firming Complex

ProPlus Advanced Aquoues Treatment 

ProPlus Collagen Booster (Advanced Molecular Serum) 

ProPlus Elastin Booster 

ProPlus Brightening Toner 

LSC s products are regulated as cosmetics. LSC s products are sold domestically through a branded website, Amazon, and ecommerce partners. 
 Biomedical Market Primary Human Cell Research Products 
 Our wholly owned subsidiary Lifeline Cell Technology, LLC LCT develops, manufactures and commercializes approximately 200 human cell culture products, including frozen human primary cells and reagents (called media ), which are needed to grow, maintain, and differentiate the cells. LCT s scientists have used a standardized, methodical, scientific approach to basal medium optimization to systematically produce optimized products designed to culture specific human cell types and to elicit specific cellular behaviors. These techniques can also be used to produce products that do not contain non-human animal proteins, a feature desirable to the research and therapeutic markets. Each LCT cell product is quality tested for the expression of specific markers (to assure the cells are the correct type), proliferation rate, viability, morphology and absence of pathogens. Each cell system also contains associated donor information and all informed consent requirements are strictly followed. LCT s research products are marketed and sold by its internal sales force, original equipment manufacturing OEM partners and LCT brand distributors in Europe and Asia.

Product sales, net 
 Product sales for the three months ended September 30, 2024 were 2,179 thousand compared to 1,973 thousand for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase of 206 thousand, or 10 , was primarily attributable to an increase in OEM sales from our Biomedical market segment, including an increase of 145 thousand from our media and other products sales and an increase of 70 thousand from our cell product sales. The net increase in product sales from our Biomedical market segment is partially offset by a decrease in skin care product line sales of approximately 9 thousand. 
 Cost of sales 
 Cost of sales for the three months ended September 30, 2024 were 974 thousand, compared to 781 thousand for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase of 193 thousand, or 25 , was a result of a net increase of approximately 200 thousand in cost of goods sold due to an overall increase in product sales from our Biomedical market segment offset by a net decrease of approximately 7 thousand in cost of goods sold from our skin care market segment due to decreased sales. 
 Profit margin for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was 55 , compared to 60 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease in profit margin was primarily related to inventory adjustments for purchased inventory and scrap. The decrease in profit margin was partially offset by production efficiency variances related to our Biomedical market segment, which comprised over 90 of our product sales for the three months ended September 30, 2024. 
 Cost of sales consists primarily of salaries and benefits associated with employee efforts expended directly on the production of the Company s products, as well as related direct materials, general laboratory supplies and the allocation of overhead. We plan to continue to refine our manufacturing processes and supply chain management to improve the cost of sales as a percentage of revenue for both our LCT and LSC segments. 
 General and administrative expenses 
 General and administrative expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2024 were 816 thousand, compared to 832 thousand for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease of 16 thousand, or 2 , was primarily attributable to a decrease of approximately 35 thousand in legal fees, directors and officer s insurance, and personnel-related expenses. The decrease in general and administrative expenses was partially offset by an increase of approximately 19 thousand in general liability insurance, audit fees, and other general operating expenses. 
 Our general and administrative expenses consist primarily of employee-related expenses including salaries, bonuses, benefits, and stock-based compensation. Other significant costs include facility costs not otherwise included in or allocated to other departments, legal fees not relating to patents and corporate matters, and fees for accounting and consulting services. 
 Selling and marketing expenses 
 Selling and marketing expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2024 were 292 thousand, compared to 302 thousand for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease of 10 thousand, or 3 , was primarily attributable to a decrease of approximately 15 thousand in personnel-related expenses, including commissions expense, merchandise costs, advertising, marketing materials, and dues and subscriptions, partially offset by an increase of approximately 4 thousand in consulting fees and licenses and permits. 
 22 

Our selling and marketing expenses consist primarily of employee-related expenses including salaries, bonuses, benefits, and stock-based compensation for our Biomedical and Anti-aging cosmetic businesses. Other significant costs include facility costs not otherwise included in or allocated to other departments, as well as marketing material costs, permits and licenses for ecommerce, and other advertising expenses. 
 Research and development expenses 
 Research and development expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2024 were 187 thousand, compared to 155 thousand for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase of 32 thousand, or 21 , was a result of an increase of approximately 52 thousand in personnel-related costs related an increase in stock-based compensation expense from grants during the prior period, consulting fees, general lab expenses, and depreciation expense from newly acquired equipment. The increase is partially offset by a decrease of approximately 10 thousand in other general material and supplies costs, as well as receipt of an additional 10 thousand for the Australian research and development tax credit. 
 Our research and development efforts are primarily focused on the development of treatments for Parkinson s disease, traumatic brain injury, and stroke. These projects are long-term investments that involve developing both new stem cell lines and new differentiation techniques that can provide higher purity populations of functional cells. Research and development expenses are expensed as incurred and are accounted for on a project-by-project basis. However, much of our research has potential applicability to each of our projects. 
 Other expense, net 
 Other expense, net for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was 35 thousand compared to other expense, net for the three months ended September 30, 2023 of 34 thousand. Other expenses in both periods primarily relate to interest expense on our related party note payable.

The increase of 739 thousand, or 13 , was primarily attributable to an increase of approximately 912 thousand in our media product sales, partially offset by a decrease of approximately 148 thousand in our cell and other product sales in our Biomedical market segment. The net increase in product sales from our Biomedical market segment is partially offset by a decrease in product sales from our skin care product line of approximately 25 thousand. 
 Cost of sales 
 Cost of sales for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 were 2,774 thousand, compared to 2,318 thousand for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase of 456 thousand, or 20 , was primarily attributable to an increase in cost of sales driven by an increase in product sales in our Biomedical market segment of approximately 636 thousand, partially offset by approximately 253 thousand in favorable manufacturing variances generated by higher production volumes to accommodate large OEM sales. There was a net decrease in cost of sales related to our skin care product sales in our Anti-aging market segment of approximately 3 thousand, which was primarily attributable to an overall decrease in manufacturing costs as a result of a decrease in our product sales. 
 Profit margins have decreased by approximately 3 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023 due to the fact that there was a higher volume of product sales from our Biomedical market segment, which 
 23 

lowered our margin from OEM sales as compared to the prior year. There were also more items scrapped during manufacturing due to failed quality tests. The margins in our skin care line remained fairly consistent, but there has been an overall decrease in sales volume. 
 Cost of sales consists primarily of salaries and benefits associated with employee efforts expended directly on the production of the Company s products, as well as related direct materials, general laboratory supplies and the allocation of overhead. We plan to continue to refine our manufacturing processes and supply chain management to improve the cost of sales as a percentage of revenue for both our LCT and LSC segments.

 Our sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of employee-related expenses including salaries, bonuses, benefits, and share-based compensation for our Biomedical and anti-aging cosmetic businesses. Other significant costs include facility costs not otherwise included in or allocated to other departments, as well as marketing material costs, permits and licenses for ecommerce, and other advertising expenses. 
 Research and development expenses 
 Research and development expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 were 447 thousand, compared to 345 thousand for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase of 102 thousand, or 30 , was primarily attributable to an increase of approximately 97 thousand in personnel-related costs, including stock-based compensation, an increase of approximately 9 thousand in depreciation expense and general lab expenses, and a decrease of approximately 5 thousand in the Australian research and development tax credit, partially offset by a decrease of approximately 15 thousand in consulting fees and general material and supply costs. 
 Our research and development efforts are primarily focused on the development of treatments for Parkinson s disease, traumatic brain injury, and stroke. These projects are long-term investments that involve developing both new stem cell lines and new differentiation techniques that can provide higher purity populations of functional cells. Research and development expenses are expensed as incurred and are accounted for on a project-by-project basis. However, much of our research has potential applicability to each of our projects. 
 Other income (expense), net 
 Other income (expense), net for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was (101) thousand, compared to other income (expense), net of 566 thousand for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease in other income (expense), net of 671 thousand was largely attributable to the Employment Tax Credit refund (see Note 9 within the accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements for further discussion) received during the three months ended June 30, 2023, which was partially offset by other expense. Other expense in both periods relate to interest expense on our related party note payable. 
 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 The Company enters into contracts in the normal course of business with various third-party consultants and contract research organizations CRO for preclinical research, clinical trials and manufacturing activities. These contracts generally provide for termination upon notice. Actual expenses associated with these arrangements may be higher or lower due to various reasons, including but not limited to, progress of our development products and enrollment in clinical trials. Other short-term and long terms commitments that would affect liquidity include lease obligations as well as related party debt repayments.

 Investing Cash Flows 
 Net cash used in investing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 168 thousand, compared to 80 thousand for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase is primarily attributable to an increase in purchases of property and equipment during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 
 Financing Cash Flows 
 Net cash used in financing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 of 200 thousand was wholly attributable to the partial repayment of principal on our related party note payable. 
 Funding Requirements 
 Management continues to evaluate various financing sources and options to raise working capital to help fund our current research and development programs and operations. We will need to obtain significant additional capital from equity and/or debt financings, license arrangements, grants and/or collaborative research arrangements to sustain our operations and develop products. Unless we obtain additional financing, we do not have sufficient cash on hand to sustain our operations at least through one year after the issuance date. The timing and degree of any future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including: 
 the accuracy of the assumptions underlying our estimates for capital needs; 

the extent that revenues from sales of LSC and LCT products cover the related costs and provide capital; 

scientific progress in our research and development programs; 

the magnitude and scope of our research and development programs and our ability to establish, enforce and maintain strategic arrangements for research, development, clinical testing, manufacturing and marketing; 

our progress with preclinical development and clinical trials; 

the extent to which third party interest in Company s research and commercial products can be realized through effective partnerships; 

25 

the time and costs involved in obtaining regulatory approvals; 

the costs involved in preparing, filing, prosecuting, maintaining, defending and enforcing patent claims; and 

the number and type of product candidates that we pursue. 

Our failure to raise capital or enter into applicable arrangements when needed would have a negative impact on our financial condition. Additional debt financing may be expensive and require us to pledge all or a substantial portion of its assets. Further, if additional funds are obtained through arrangements with collaborative partners, these arrangements may require us to relinquish rights to some of its technologies, product candidates or products that we would otherwise seek to develop and commercialize on its own. If sufficient capital is not available, we may be required to delay, reduce the scope of or eliminate one or more of its product initiatives. 
 We currently have no revenue generated from our principal operations in therapeutic and clinical product development through research and development efforts. There can be no assurance that we will be successful in maintaining our normal operating cash flow and obtaining additional funds and that the timing of our capital raising or future financing will result in cash flow sufficient to sustain our operations at least through one year after the issuance date. 
 Based on the factors above, there is substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. The consolidated financial statements were prepared assuming that we will continue to operate as a going concern. The consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments to reflect the possible future effects on the recoverability and classification of assets or the amounts and classification of liabilities that may result from the outcome of this uncertainty. Management s plans in regard to these matters are focused on managing our cash flow, the proper timing of our capital expenditures, and raising additional capital or financing in the future. 
 Critical Accounting Estimates 
 Our management s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our condensed consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America and the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission. The preparation of these condensed consolidated financial statements requires us to make judgments and estimates that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the condensed consolidated financial statement, and the reported amounts of revenues, costs and expenses during the reporting periods. 
 Our estimates are based on our historical experience, known trends and events, and on various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities and amount of expense recognized that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. We evaluate our estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis. The effects of material revisions in estimates, if any, will be reflected in the consolidated financial statements prospectively from the date of the change in estimates. 
 There have been no material changes to our critical accounting policies and estimates during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from those disclosed in Part II Item 7. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K. 
 Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements 
 A description of recently issued accounting pronouncements that may potentially impact our financial position and results of operations is disclosed in Note 1 Description of Business, Basis of Presentation, and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies to our condensed consolidated financial statements of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. 
 Contractual Obligations and Commitments 
 There have been no material changes to our contractual obligations and commitments outside the ordinary course of business during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from those disclosed in Part II Item 7. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K. 
 Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 
 We are a smaller reporting company, as defined by Rule 12b-2 of the Exchange Act, and are not required to provide the information required under this item. 
 26 

Item 4. Controls and Procedures 
 Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 As required by Rule 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act, the Company, with the participation of management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer, evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in such rules) as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based on this evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer concluded that, at September 30, 2024, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective. 
 Disclosure controls and procedures are controls and other procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer, or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 
 Additionally, controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people, or by management override of the control. The design of any system of controls also is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions; over time, controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. Because of the inherent limitations in a cost-effective control system, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected. 
 Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
 There were no changes in our internal controls during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 that materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal controls over financial reporting.
