 (b) During the year ended December 31, 2023, the Company recorded a million charge in Cost of goods sold to reduce the value of certain spodumene and finished goods to their net realizable value following the decline in lithium market pricing at the end of the year. 
 The Company purchases certain of its inventory from its equity method investments (primarily the Windfield Holdings Pty. Ltd. Windfield joint venture) and eliminates the balance of intra-entity profits on purchases of such inventory that remains unsold at the balance sheet in Inventories, specifically finished goods and equally reduces Equity in net income of unconsolidated investments (net of tax) on the consolidated statements of (loss) income. The balance of intra-entity profits on inventory purchased from equity method investments in Inventories totaled million and million at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. The intra-entity profit is recognized in Equity in net income of unconsolidated investments (net of tax) in the period that converted inventory is sold to a third-party customer. In the same period, the intra-entity profit is also recognized as higher Cost of goods sold on the consolidated statements of (loss) income.

Following this restructuring, Albemarle and MRL each own of the Wodgina Lithium Mine Project Wodgina ), and MRL operates the Wodgina mine on behalf of the joint venture. During the fourth quarter of 2023, Albemarle paid MRL approximately million in cash, which included million of consideration for the remaining ownership of Kemerton as well as a payment for the economic effective date of the transaction being retroactive to April 1, 2022. 
 This joint venture is unincorporated with each investor holding an undivided interest in each asset and proportionately liable for each liability; therefore our proportionate share of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses are included in the appropriate classifications in the consolidated financial statements.

 The Company holds a equity interest in Windfield, where the ownership parties share risks and benefits disproportionate to their voting interests. As a result, the Company considers Windfield to be a variable interest entity VIE ), however this investment is not consolidated as the Company is not the primary beneficiary. The carrying amount of the Company s equity interest in Windfield, which is the Company s most significant VIE, was million and million at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. The Company s unconsolidated VIEs are reported in Investments on the consolidated balance sheets. The Company does not guarantee debt for, or have other financial support obligations to, these entities, and its maximum exposure to loss in connection with its continuing involvement with these entities is limited to the carrying value of the investments.

 Included in the Company s investments balance are holdings in equity securities of public companies. The fair value is measured using publicly available share prices of the investments, with any changes reported in Other (expenses) income, net in our consolidated statements of (loss) income. During the nine-month period ended September 30, 2023, the Company purchased approximately million of shares in publicly-traded companies. In addition, during the three-month and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024, the Company recorded unrealized mark-to-market losses of million and million, respectively, in Other (expenses) income, net for all public equity securities held at the end of the balance sheet date. During the three-month and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2023, the Company recorded unrealized mark-to-market (losses) gains of million and million, respectively, in Other (expenses) income, net for all public equity securities held at the end of the balance sheet date. 
 In January 2024, the Company sold equity securities of a public company for proceeds of approximately million. As a result of the sale, the Company realized a loss of million in the nine months ended September 30, 2024.

 As part of the proceeds from the sale of the fine chemistry services FCS business on June 1, 2021, W.R. Grace Co. Grace issued Albemarle preferred equity of a Grace subsidiary having an aggregate stated value of million. The preferred equity can be redeemed at Grace s option under certain conditions and began accruing payment-in-kind PIK dividends at an annual rate of on June 1, 2023. In addition, the preferred equity can be redeemed by Albemarle when the accumulated balance reaches of the original value. This preferred equity had a fair value of million and million at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively, which is reported in Investments in the consolidated balance sheets.

 In July 2024, the Company made the decision to stop construction of Kemerton conversion plant Train 3 and put Kemerton Train 2 into care and maintenance. See Note 9, Restructuring Charges and Asset Write-offs, for further details. The Company determined these actions to be a triggering event for a review for impairment of its Energy Storage reporting unit goodwill. As a result, during the third quarter of 2024, the Company tested the goodwill of the Energy Storage reporting unit by comparing its estimated fair value, using a discounted cash flow model, to the related carrying value.

 Subsequent Event 
 Given economic conditions, specifically around the market pricing of lithium, and the related anticipated impact on the Company s future earnings, on October 31, 2024 the Company further amended its revolving, unsecured amended and restated credit agreement dated October 28, 2022, as previously amended on February 9, 2024 (the 2022 Credit Agreement ), which provides for borrowings of up to billion and matures on October 28, 2027. Borrowings under the 2022 Credit Agreement bear interest at variable rates based on a benchmark rate depending on the currency in which the loans are denominated, plus an applicable margin which ranges from to , depending on the Company s credit rating from Standard Poor s Rating Services LLC, Moody s Investors Services, Inc. and Fitch Ratings, Inc. With respect to loans denominated in U.S. dollars, interest is calculated using the term Secured Overnight Financing Rate SOFR plus a term SOFR adjustment of , plus the applicable margin. The applicable margin on the facility was as of September 30, 2024. There were borrowings outstanding under the 2022 Credit Agreement as of September 30, 2024. 
 Borrowings under the 2022 Credit Agreement are conditioned upon satisfaction of certain customary conditions precedent, including the absence of defaults. The October 2024 amendment was entered into to modify the financial covenants under the 2022 Credit Agreement to avoid a potential covenant violation through June 2026 given the market pricing of lithium. The amended 2022 Credit Agreement subjects the Company to two financial covenants, as well as customary affirmative and negative covenants. The amended first financial covenant requires that the ratio of (a) (i) the Company s consolidated net funded debt plus a proportionate amount of Windfield s net funded debt less (ii) the Company s unrestricted cash and cash equivalents plus a proportionate amount of Windfield s unrestricted cash and cash equivalents (up to a specified amount) to (b) consolidated Windfield-Adjusted EBITDA (as such terms are defined in the 2022 Credit Agreement) be less than or equal to: (i) :1.0 as of the end of the third quarter of 2024, (ii) :1.0 as of the end of the fourth quarter of 2024, (iii) :1.0 as of the end of the first quarter of 2025, (iv) :1.0 as of the end of the second quarter of 2025, (v) :1.0 as of the end of the third quarter of 2025, (vi) :1.0 as of the end of the fourth quarter of 2025, (vii) :1.0 as of the end of the first and second quarters of 2026, respectively and (viii) :1.0 as of the end of the third quarter of 2026 and each fiscal quarter thereafter through the third quarter of 2027. The maximum permitted leverage ratios described above are subject to adjustment in

 (Unaudited) 

 million. 
 The amended second financial covenant requires that, beginning as of the end of the fourth quarter of 2024, the ratio of the Company s consolidated EBITDA to consolidated interest charges (as such terms are defined in the 2022 Credit Agreement) be no less than (i) :1.0 as of the end of each fiscal quarter through the second quarter of 2025, (ii) :1.0 as of the end of the third quarter of 2025, (iii) :1.0 as of the end of the fourth quarter of 2025, and (iv) :1.0 as of the end of each fiscal quarter thereafter. The 2022 Credit Agreement also contains customary default provisions, including defaults for non-payment, breach of representations and warranties, insolvency, non-performance of covenants and cross-defaults to other material indebtedness. The occurrence of an event of default under the 2022 Credit Agreement could result in all loans and other obligations becoming immediately due and payable and the commitments under the 2022 Credit Agreement being terminated. Following the billion issuance of mandatory convertible preferred stock in March 2024 and the amendments to the financial covenants, the Company expects to maintain compliance with the amended financial covenants for the next twelve months. In addition to the amended covenants, the Company has introduced additional cost reduction plans to further reduce operating expenses and capital investments, as discussed in Note 9, Restructuring Charges and Assets Write-offs. No assurances can be given that any additional cost reduction strategies undertaken will be sufficient to meet the amended financial covenants. Further, a significant and extended downturn in lithium market prices or demand could impact the Company s ability to maintain compliance with its amended financial covenants and it could require the Company to seek additional amendments to the 2022 Credit Agreement and/or issue debt or equity securities to fund its activities and maintain financial flexibility. If the Company were unable to obtain such necessary additional amendments, this could lead to an event of default and its lenders could require the Company to repay its outstanding debt. In that situation, the Company may not be able to raise sufficient debt or equity capital, or divest assets, to refinance or repay the lenders.

 Less amounts reported in Accrued expenses Amounts reported in Other noncurrent liabilities 
 Environmental remediation liabilities included discounted liabilities of million and million at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively, discounted at rates with a weighted-average of and , respectively, and with the undiscounted amount totaling million and million at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. For certain locations where the Company is operating groundwater monitoring and/or remediation systems, prior owners or insurers have assumed all or most of the responsibility. 
 The amounts recorded represent our future remediation and other anticipated environmental liabilities. These liabilities typically arise during the normal course of our operational and environmental management activities or at the time of acquisition of the site, and are based on internal analysis as well as input from outside consultants. As evaluations proceed at each relevant site, changes in risk assessment practices, remediation techniques and regulatory requirements can occur, therefore such liability estimates may be adjusted accordingly. The timing and duration of remediation activities at these sites will be determined when evaluations are completed. Although it is difficult to quantify the potential financial impact of these remediation liabilities, management estimates (based on the latest available information) that there is a reasonable possibility that future environmental remediation costs associated with our past operations could represent an additional million before income taxes, in excess of amounts already recorded. 
 We believe that any sum we may be required to pay in connection with environmental remediation matters in excess of the amounts recorded would likely occur over a period of time and would likely not have a material adverse effect upon our

 Other 
 The Company has contracts with certain of its customers which serve as guarantees of product delivery and performance according to customer specifications that can cover both shipments on an individual basis, as well as blanket coverage of multiple shipments under certain customer supply contracts. The financial coverage provided by these guarantees is typically based on a percentage of net sales value. The Company is unable to estimate the maximum amount of the potential future liability under performance guarantees. However, the Company accrues for any potential loss for which we believe a future payment is probable and a range of loss can be reasonably estimated. At September 30, 2024, the Company believes its liability under such obligations is immaterial.

 As a result of the actions taken at Kemerton Trains 2 and 3 during the third quarter of 2024, the Company elected to evaluate the recoverability of its property, plant and equipment within the corresponding asset group as of August 31, 2024, and concluded that the carrying amount of the associated asset group is recoverable as the undiscounted cash flows of the asset group significantly exceed its carrying value. Accordingly, no impairment loss was recognized during the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024.

The three-month and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024 included the impact of the 15 global minimum tax under the Pillar Two Global Anti-Base Erosion Rules Pillar Two developed by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development OECD as part of global tax framework. The Company s effective income tax rate fluctuates based on, among other factors, the amount and location of income. The lower effective tax rate in the three-month and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024, compared to the three-month and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2023, was due to lower 2024 earnings in various jurisdictions. The difference between the U.S. federal statutory income tax rate of and the Company s effective income tax rate for the three-month and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024 was impacted by a variety of factors, primarily the location in which income was earned, including the impact of the OECD Pillar Two minimum tax, the valuation allowance for losses in our consolidated Australian entities and certain entities in China, and an uncertain tax position recorded in Chile. The difference between the U.S. federal statutory income tax rate of and the Company s effective income tax rate for the three-month and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2023 was impacted by a variety of factors, primarily the location in which income was earned, foreign-derived intangible income and an uncertain tax position recorded in Chile. During the nine-month period ended September 30, 2023, the effective tax rate was also impacted by a non-deductible accrual for the agreements in principle to resolve a previously disclosed legal matter with the U.S. Department of Justice DOJ ), the SEC, and the Dutch Public Prosecutor DPP ).

During the fourth quarter of 2019, we entered into a foreign currency forward contract to hedge the cash flow exposure of non-functional currency purchases during the construction of the Kemerton plant in Australia. This derivative financial instrument is used to manage risk and is not used for trading or other speculative purposes. This foreign currency forward contract has been designated as a hedging instrument under Accounting Standards Codification ASC 815, Derivatives and Hedging . As a result of the actions taken at Kemerton Trains 3 and 4 during 2024, the Company dedesignated the remaining hedged foreign currency forward contracts. The Company recorded a loss in Other (expenses) income, net of million and million during the three- and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024 from the reclassification of the hedged balance from Accumulated other comprehensive loss. The balance of the settled hedged foreign currency forward contracts associated with the construction of Kemerton Trains 1 and 2 assets placed into service will be reclassified to earnings over the life of the related assets. We had outstanding designated foreign currency forward contracts with notional values totaling the equivalent of million at December 31, 2023. 
 In connection with our risk management strategies, we also enter into other derivative financial instruments that have not been designated as hedging instruments under ASC 815, Derivatives and Hedging. These derivative financial instruments are used to manage risk and are not used for trading or other speculative purposes. At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we had outstanding non-designated derivative financial instruments with notional values totaling billion and billion, respectively. The non-designated derivative financial instruments are primarily comprised of foreign currency forward contracts that attempt to minimize the financial impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates. The fair values of our non-designated foreign currency forward contracts are estimated based on current settlement values. At September 30, 2024, these foreign currency forward contracts hedge our exposure to various currencies including the Chinese Renminbi, Euro, Australian Dollar and Chilean Peso.

We are exposed to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by these counterparties. However, we do not anticipate nonperformance by the counterparties.

 Overview 
 Albemarle is a world leader in transforming essential resources into critical ingredients for mobility, energy, connectivity, and health. Our purpose is to enable a more resilient world. We partner to pioneer new ways to move, power, connect, and protect. The end markets we serve include grid storage, automotive, aerospace, conventional energy, electronics, construction, agriculture and food, pharmaceuticals and medical devices. We believe that our world-class resources with reliable and consistent supply, our leading process chemistry, high-impact innovation, customer centricity and focus on people and planet will enable us to maintain a leading position in the industries in which we operate. 
 Secular trends favorably impacting demand within the end markets that we serve combined with our diverse product portfolio, broad geographic presence and customer-focused solutions will continue to be key drivers of our future earnings growth. We continue to build upon our existing green solutions portfolio and our ongoing mission to provide innovative, yet commercially viable, clean energy products and services to the marketplace to contribute to our sustainability-based revenue. For example, our Energy Storage business contributes to the growth of clean miles driven with electric vehicles and more efficient use of renewable energy through grid storage; Specialties enables the prevention of fires starting in electronic equipment, greater fuel efficiency from rubber tires and the reduction of emissions from coal fired power plants; and our Ketjen business enhances the efficiency of natural resources through more usable products from a single barrel of oil, enables safer, greener production of alkylates used to produce more environmentally-friendly fuels, and reduced emissions through cleaner transportation fuels. We believe our disciplined cost reduction efforts and ongoing productivity improvements, among other factors, position us well to take advantage of strengthening economic conditions as they occur, while softening the negative impact of the current challenging global economic environment. 
 
 Third Quarter 2024 
 During the third quarter of 2024: 
 Our board of directors declared a quarterly dividend of 0.405 per share on July 16, 2024, which was paid on October 1, 2024 to common shareholders of record at the close of business as of September 13, 2024. 
 We announced a comprehensive review of our cost and operating structure to maintain a competitive position, further generate long-term financial flexibility and drive long-term value creation. As part of this review, we concluded to stop construction of the Kemerton conversion plant Train 3 and placed Kemerton Train 2 into care and maintenance. Kemerton Train 1 will continue to operate and activity around it is currently focused on commercialization efforts.

 We submitted several state and federal permit applications for the potential redevelopment of the Kings Mountain Mine, one of the few known hard-rock lithium deposits in the United States. Development of the mine is subject to the successful completion of permitting as well as a final investment decision prior to starting construction. 
 We announced a new operating structure, effective November 1, 2024, that will transition from two core global business units - Energy Storage and Specialties - to a fully integrated functional model (excluding Ketjen) designed to increase agility, deliver significant cost savings and maintain long-term competitiveness. Albemarle will continue to report results across its three existing operating segments: Energy Storage, Specialties and Ketjen. 

Outlook 
 The current global business environment presents a diverse set of opportunities and challenges in the markets we serve. In particular, we believe that the market for lithium battery and energy storage, particularly for electric vehicles EV ), remains strong, providing the opportunity to continue to develop high quality and innovative products while managing the high cost of expanding capacity. The other markets we serve continue to present various opportunities for value and growth as we have positioned ourselves to manage the impact on our business of changing global conditions, such as slow and uneven global growth, currency exchange volatility, crude oil price fluctuation, a dynamic pricing environment, an ever-changing landscape in electronics, the continuous need for cutting edge catalysts and technology by our refinery customers and increasingly stringent environmental standards. During the course of 2023, lithium index pricing dropped significantly, and remained relatively steady at these lower levels during the first nine months of 2024. Amidst these dynamics, and despite recent downward lithium price pressure, we believe our business fundamentals are sound and that we are strategically well-positioned as we remain focused on increasing sales volumes, optimizing and improving the value of our portfolio primarily through pricing and product development, managing costs and delivering value to our customers and shareholders. We believe that our businesses remain well-positioned to capitalize on new business opportunities and long-term trends driving growth within our end markets and to respond quickly to changes in economic conditions in these markets. 
 However, in order to optimize our cost structure and strengthen our financial flexibility, we are taking proactive actions, including certain restructuring activities and reducing planned capital expenditures. As part of these actions, we announced a new operating structure, effective November 1, 2024, that will transition from two core global business units to a fully integrated functional model (excluding Ketjen) designed to increase agility, deliver significant cost savings and maintain long-term competitiveness. We will continue to report results across its three existing operating segments of Energy Storage, Specialties and Ketjen. If lithium index pricing trends further downward or remains at low levels for an extended time, we may need to take additional measures to support growth and financial flexibility, including further restructuring actions. 
 At this time, relating to the current situation in the Middle East, our business operations have continued as normal with some shipping and raw material delays. We are monitoring the situation and will continue to make efforts to protect the safety of our employees and the health of our business. 
 Energy Storage: We expect Energy Storage net sales and profitability to decrease year-over-year in 2024 as lithium market prices remain at lower levels compared to the prior year. Due to many of our contracts being index-referenced and variable-priced, our business is more aligned with changes in market and index pricing. The first part of 2023 saw record high lithium price levels which increased prior year results. As a result, increases or further decreases in lithium market pricing could have a material impact on our results. We do expect the lower pricing to be partially offset by higher sales volume driven primarily by additional capacity from La Negra, Chile, Meishan and Qinzhou, China, as well as additional tolling volume supported by increased spodumene production out of Australia. The Meishan, China lithium conversion plant achieved first commercial sales during the second quarter of 2024. During the fourth quarter of 2023, we recorded a 604 million charge to reduce the value of certain spodumene and finished goods to their net realizable value following the decline in lithium market pricing at the end of the year. We could record additional inventory valuation charges in 2024 if lithium prices continue to deteriorate during the projected period of conversion and sale. While we ramp up our new capacity, we will continue to utilize tolling arrangements to meet growing customer demand. Global EV sales are expected to continue to increase over the prior year, driving continued demand for lithium batteries. 
 As part of the above-mentioned actions to optimize our cost structure and strengthen our financial flexibility, we have stopped construction of the Kemerton Trains 3 and 4. In addition, we have put Kemerton Train 2 into care and maintenance. Kemerton Train 1 will continue to operate and activity around it is currently focused on commercialization efforts. 
 On a longer-term basis, we believe that demand for lithium will continue to grow as new lithium applications advance and the use of plug-in hybrid EVs and full battery EVs increases. This demand for lithium is supported by a favorable backdrop of steadily declining lithium-ion battery costs, increasing battery performance, continuing significant investments in the battery and EV supply chain by cathode and battery producers and automotive OEMs and favorable global public policy toward e-mobility/renewable energy usage. Our outlook is also bolstered by long-term supply agreements with key strategic customers,

 reflecting our standing as a preferred global lithium partner, highlighted by our scale, access to geographically diverse, low-cost resources and long-term track record of reliability of supply and operating execution. 
 Specialties: We expect both net sales and profitability to be lower in 2024 year-over-year as we recover from reduced customer demand in certain markets, including consumer and industrial electronics, and maintain strong demand in other end-markets, such as pharmaceuticals, agriculture and oilfield services. We have taken measures to reduce the negative impact of lower demand, which we expect to partially offset the lower results in 2024. 
 On a longer-term basis, we continue to believe that improving global standards of living, widespread digitization, increasing demand for data management capacity and the potential for increasingly stringent fire safety regulations in developing markets are likely to drive continued demand for fire safety, bromine and lithium specialties products. We are focused on profitably growing our globally competitive production networks to serve all major bromine and lithium specialties consuming products and markets. The combination of our solid, long-term business fundamentals, strong cost position, product innovations and effective management of raw material costs should enable us to manage our business through end-market challenges and to capitalize on opportunities that are expected with favorable market trends in select end markets. 
 Ketjen: Total Ketjen results in 2024 are expected to increase year-over-year due to higher revenue and favorable product mix. The fluidized catalytic cracking FCC market is expected to remain stable. Hydroprocessing catalysts HPC demand is project-driven, but we have seen increased demand as refineries are taking turnarounds. 
 On a longer-term basis, we believe increased global demand for transportation fuels, new refinery start-ups and ongoing adoption of cleaner fuels will be the primary drivers of growth in our Ketjen business. We believe delivering superior end-use performance continues to be the most effective way to create sustainable value in the refinery catalysts industry. We also believe our technologies continue to provide significant performance and financial benefits to refiners challenged to meet tighter regulations around the world. 
 Corporate: We continue to focus on cash generation, working capital management and process efficiencies. We expect our global effective tax rate will vary based on the locations in which income is actually earned and remains subject to potential volatility from changing legislation in the United States, such as the Inflation Reduction Act and the recently released Pillar Two Global Anti-Base Erosion Rules Pillar Two which became effective in early 2024, and other tax jurisdictions. In 2024, we have taken actions as part of an effort that will focus on preserving our world-class resource advantages, optimizing our global conversion network, improving our cost competitiveness and efficiency, reducing capital intensity and enhancing our financial flexibility. As part of these measures, we stopped construction or deferred spending on certain capital projects, such as the Kemerton conversion plant noted above. In addition, we will incur severance and other restructuring charges associated with the Company s transition to a new fully integrated functional operating model. 
 From time to time, we may evaluate the merits of any opportunities that may arise for acquisitions or other business development activities that will complement our business footprint.

 Segment Information Overview. We have identified three reportable segments according to the nature and economic characteristics of our products as well as the manner in which the information is used internally by the Company s chief operating decision maker to evaluate performance and make resource allocation decisions. Our reportable business segments consist of: (1) Energy Storage, (2) Specialties and (3) Ketjen.

Table of Contents 

The Corporate category is not considered to be a segment and includes corporate-related items not allocated to the operating segments. Pension and OPEB service cost (which represents the benefits earned by active employees during the period) and amortization of prior service cost or benefit are allocated to the reportable segments and Corporate, whereas the remaining components of pension and OPEB benefits cost or credit Non-operating pension and OPEB items are included in Corporate. Segment data includes intersegment transfers of raw materials at cost and allocations for certain corporate costs. 
 
 Our chief operating decision maker uses adjusted EBITDA (as defined below) to assess the ongoing performance of the Company s business segments and to allocate resources. Effective January 1, 2024, the Company changed its definition of adjusted EBITDA for financial accounting purposes. The updated definition includes Albemarle s share of the pre-tax earnings of the Windfield joint venture, whereas the prior definition included Albemarle s share of Windfield earnings net of tax. This calculation is consistent with the definition of adjusted EBITDA used in the leverage financial covenant calculation in the February 9, 2024 amendment to our revolving, unsecured amended and restated credit agreement dated October 28, 2022 (as so amended, the 2022 Credit Agreement ), which is a material agreement for the Company and aligns the information presented to various stakeholders. This presentation more closely represents the materiality and financial contribution of the strategic investment in Windfield to the Company s earnings, and more closely represents a measure of EBITDA. The Company s updated definition of adjusted EBITDA is earnings before interest and financing expenses, income tax expenses, the proportionate share of Windfield income tax expense, depreciation and amortization, as adjusted on a consistent basis for certain non-operating, non-recurring or unusual items in a balanced manner and on a segment basis. These non-operating, non-recurring or unusual items may include acquisition and integration related costs, gains or losses on sales of businesses, restructuring charges, facility divestiture charges, certain litigation and arbitration costs and charges, non-operating pension and OPEB items and other significant non-recurring items. In addition, management uses adjusted EBITDA for business and enterprise planning purposes and as a significant component in the calculation of performance-based compensation for management and other employees. The Company has reported adjusted EBITDA because management believes it provides additional useful measurements to review the Company s operations, provides transparency to investors and enables period-to-period comparability of financial performance. Total adjusted EBITDA is a financial measure that is not required by, or presented in accordance with, U.S. GAAP. Total adjusted EBITDA should not be considered as an alternative to Net (loss) income attributable to Albemarle Corporation, the most directly comparable financial measure calculated and reported in accordance with U.S. GAAP, or any other financial measure reported in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Adjusted EBITDA for the prior period has been recast to conform to the current year presentation.

Financial Condition and Liquidity 
 Overview 
 The principal uses of cash in our business generally have been capital investments and resource development costs, funding working capital, and service of debt. We also make contributions to our defined benefit pension plans, pay dividends to our shareholders and have the ability to repurchase shares of our common stock. Historically, cash to fund the needs of our business has been principally provided by cash from operations, debt financing and equity issuances. 
 We are continually focused on working capital efficiency particularly in the areas of accounts receivable, payables and inventory. We anticipate that cash on hand, cash provided by operating activities, proceeds from divestitures and borrowings will be sufficient to pay our operating expenses, satisfy debt service obligations, fund capital expenditures and other investing activities, fund pension contributions and pay dividends for the foreseeable future. 
 Cash Flow 
 During the first nine months of 2024, cash on hand, cash provided by operations and net proceeds from the issuance of mandatory convertible preferred stock of 2.2 billion funded the repayment of a net balance of 620.0 million of commercial paper, 1.3 billion of capital expenditures for plant, machinery and equipment, dividends to common shareholders of 140.9 million and dividends to mandatory convertible preferred shareholders of 81.1 million. Our operations provided 701.4 million of cash flows during the first nine months of 2024, as compared to 1.4 billion for the first nine months of 2023. The change compared to prior year was primarily due to decreased earnings from the Energy Storage segment, driven by lower lithium market prices, and lower dividends received from unconsolidated investments, partially offset by positive working capital changes year-over-year of 2.2 billion. The inflow from working capital in 2024 was primarily driven by the impact of lower lithium pricing in inventories and accounts receivable. This was partially offset by lower accounts payable driven by similar lower lithium pricing. Overall, our cash and cash equivalents increased by 774.6 million to 1.7 billion at September 30, 2024 from 889.9 million at December 31, 2023. 
 Capital expenditures for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024 of 1.3 billion were primarily associated with plant, machinery and equipment. We expect our capital expenditures to be at the lower-end of 1.7 billion to 1.8 billion in 2024, primarily for Energy Storage growth and capacity increases, including in Chile, China and the U.S., as well as productivity and continuity of operations projects in all segments. Capital expenditures in 2024 also include spending for construction of Kemerton Trains 3 and 4 and certain other capital projects, which were stopped as part of our announced comprehensive review of our cost and operating structure. 
 In addition, in stopping construction of Kemerton Trains 3 and 4, and putting Kemerton Train 2 on care and maintenance, the Company incurred 72.7 million of related contract cancellation costs and required charges under take or pay contracts, as well as 27.4 million of severance charges. The Company s actions regarding Kemerton are part of a broader effort that will focus on preserving its world-class resource advantages, optimizing its global conversion network, improving the Company s cost competitiveness and efficiency, reducing capital intensity and enhancing the Company s financial flexibility. As part of this effort, on October 7, 2024, the Company announced it will transition to a new operating structure effective November 1, 2024. The new operating structure will transition to a fully integrated functional model (excluding Ketjen) from a global business unit model. As a result, the Company expects to record severance and employee benefits of approximately 30 million to 50 million and other restructuring costs of approximately 25 million to 30 million associated with these actions in the fourth quarter of 2024. 
 In January 2024, the Company sold equity securities of a public company for proceeds of approximately 81.5 million. As a result of the sale, the Company realized a loss of 33.7 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 
 On March 8, 2024, the Company issued 46,000,000 depositary shares, each representing a 1/20th interest in a share of Preferred Stock. The 2,300,000 shares of Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock issued had a 1,000 per share liquidation preference. As a result of this transaction, the Company received cash proceeds of approximately 2.2 billion, net of underwriting fees and offering costs. The Company intends to use the proceeds for general corporate purposes, which may

 include, among other uses, funding growth capital expenditures, such as the construction and expansion of lithium operations in Australia and China that are significantly progressed or near completion, following the repayment of commercial paper using a portion of the proceeds in the first quarter of 2024. See Note 8, Equity, for additional information. 
 Net current assets were 2.8 billion and 1.7 billion at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. The increase is primarily due to the increased cash and cash equivalents balance as a result of the 2.2 billion of net proceeds from the issuance of Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock in March 2024, and the resulting paydown of commercial paper. In addition, accounts receivable, inventory and accounts payable balances all decreased from December 31, 2023 due to the lower lithium market prices. Additional changes in the components of net current assets are primarily due to the timing of the sale of goods and other ordinary transactions leading up to the balance sheet dates. The additional changes are not the result of any policy changes by the Company, and do not reflect any change in either the quality of our net current assets or our expectation of success in converting net working capital to cash in the ordinary course of business. 
 On July 16, 2024, our board of directors declared a cash dividend of 0.405, which was paid on October 1, 2024 to shareholders of record at the close of business as of September 13, 2024. 
 At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, our cash and cash equivalents included 980.8 million and 857.6 million, respectively, held by our foreign subsidiaries. The majority of these foreign cash balances are associated with earnings that we have asserted are indefinitely reinvested and which we plan to use to support our continued growth plans outside the U.S. through funding of capital expenditures, acquisitions, research, operating expenses or other similar cash needs of our foreign operations. From time to time, we repatriate cash associated with earnings from our foreign subsidiaries to the U.S. for normal operating needs through intercompany dividends, but only from subsidiaries whose earnings we have not asserted to be indefinitely reinvested or whose earnings qualify as previously taxed income as defined by the Internal Revenue Code. During the first nine months of 2024 and 2023, we repatriated 28.8 million and 3.0 million, respectively, of cash as part of these foreign earnings cash repatriation activities. 
 While we continue to closely monitor our cash generation, working capital management and capital spending in light of continuing uncertainties in the global economy, we believe that we will continue to have the financial flexibility and capability to opportunistically fund future growth initiatives. Additionally, we anticipate that future capital spending, including business acquisitions and other cash outlays, should be financed primarily with cash flow provided by operations, cash on hand and additional issuances of debt or equity securities, as needed.

 Our senior notes are senior unsecured obligations and rank equally with all our other senior unsecured indebtedness from time to time outstanding. The notes are effectively subordinated to all of our existing or future secured indebtedness and to the existing and future indebtedness of our subsidiaries. As is customary for such long-term debt instruments, each series of notes outstanding has terms that allow us to redeem the notes before maturity, in whole at any time or in part from time to time, at a redemption price equal to the greater of (i) 100 of the principal amount of these notes to be redeemed, or (ii) the sum of the present values of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest thereon (exclusive of interest accrued to the date of redemption) discounted to the redemption date on a semi-annual basis using the comparable government rate (as defined in the indentures governing these notes) plus between 25 and 40 basis points, depending on the series of notes, plus, in each case, accrued interest thereon to the date of redemption. Holders may require us to purchase such notes at 101 upon a change of control triggering event, as defined in the indentures. These notes are subject to typical events of default, including bankruptcy and insolvency events, nonpayment and the acceleration of certain subsidiary indebtedness of 40 million or more caused by a nonpayment default.

 Our Euro notes issued in 2019 are unsecured and unsubordinated obligations and rank equally in right of payment to all our other unsecured senior obligations. The Euro notes are effectively subordinated to all of our existing or future secured indebtedness and to the existing and future indebtedness of our subsidiaries. As is customary for such long-term debt instruments, each series of notes outstanding has terms that allow us to redeem the notes before their maturity, in whole at any time or in part from time to time, at a redemption price equal to the greater of (i) 100 of the principal amount of the notes to be redeemed and (ii) the sum of the present values of the remaining scheduled payments of principal thereof and interest thereon (exclusive of interest accrued to, but excluding, the date of redemption) discounted to the redemption date on an annual basis using the bond rate (as defined in the indentures governing these notes) plus between 25 and 35 basis points, depending on the series of notes, plus, in each case, accrued and unpaid interest on the principal amount being redeemed to, but excluding, the date of redemption. Holders may require us to purchase such notes at 101 upon a change of control triggering event, as defined in the indentures. These notes are subject to typical events of default, including bankruptcy and insolvency events, nonpayment and the acceleration of certain subsidiary indebtedness exceeding 100 million caused by a nonpayment default. 
 Given current economic conditions, specifically around the market pricing of lithium, and the related impact on the Company s future earnings, on October 31, 2024, we further amended the 2022 Credit Agreement, which provides for borrowings of up to 1.5 billion and matures on October 28, 2027. Borrowings under the 2022 Credit Agreement bear interest at variable rates based on a benchmark rate depending on the currency in which the loans are denominated, plus an applicable margin which ranges from 0.910 to 1.375 , depending on the Company s credit rating from Standard Poor s Ratings Services LLC S P ), Moody s Investors Services, Inc. Moody s and Fitch Ratings, Inc. Fitch ). With respect to loans denominated in U.S. dollars, interest is calculated using the term Secured Overnight Financing Rate SOFR plus a term SOFR adjustment of 0.10 , plus the applicable margin. The applicable margin on the facility was 1.20 as of September 30, 2024. As of September 30, 2024 there were no borrowings outstanding under the 2022 Credit Agreement. 
 Borrowings under the 2022 Credit Agreement are conditioned upon satisfaction of certain customary conditions precedent, including the absence of defaults. The October 2024 amendment was entered into to modify the financial covenants under the 2022 Credit Agreement to avoid a potential covenant violation over the following 18 months given the current market pricing of lithium. The amended 2022 Credit Agreement subjects the Company to two financial covenants, as well as customary affirmative and negative covenants. The amended first financial covenant requires that the ratio of (a) (i) the Company s consolidated net funded debt plus a proportionate amount of Windfield s net funded debt less (ii) the Company s unrestricted cash and cash equivalents plus a proportionate amount of Windfield s unrestricted cash and cash equivalents (up to a specified amount) to (b) consolidated Windfield-Adjusted EBITDA (as such terms are defined in the 2022 Credit Agreement) be less than or equal to (i) 5.50:1.0 as of the end of the third quarter of 2024, (ii) 4.00:1.0 as of the end of the fourth quarter of 2024, (iii) 4.75:1.0 as of the end of the first quarter of 2025, (iv) 5.75:1.0 as of the end of the second quarter of 2025, (v) 5.50:1.0 as of the end of the third quarter of 2025, (vi) 5.00:1.0 as of the end of fourth quarter of 2025, (vii) 4.75:1.0 as of the end of each of first and second quarter of 2026, and (viii) 3.50:1.0 as of the end of the third quarter of 2026 and each fiscal quarter thereafter through the third quarter of 2027. The maximum permitted leverage ratios described above are subject to adjustment in accordance with the terms of the 2022 Credit Agreement upon the consummation of an acquisition after June 30, 2026 if the consideration includes cash proceeds from the issuance of funded debt in excess of 500 million. 
 Beginning in the fourth quarter of 2024, the amended second financial covenant requires that the ratio of the Company s consolidated EBITDA to consolidated interest charges (as such terms are defined in the 2022 Credit Agreement) be no less than (i) 1.00:1.0 for fiscal quarters through June 30, 2025, (ii) 2.00:1 for the third quarter of 2025, (iii) 2.50:1 for the fourth quarter of 2025, and (iv) 3.00:1.0 for all fiscal quarters thereafter. The 2022 Credit Agreement also contains customary default provisions, including defaults for non-payment, breach of representations and warranties, insolvency, non-performance of covenants and cross-defaults to other material indebtedness. The occurrence of an event of default under the 2022 Credit Agreement could result in all loans and other obligations becoming immediately due and payable and the commitments under the 2022 Credit Agreement being terminated. Following the 2.2 billion issuance of mandatory convertible preferred stock in March 2024 and the amendments to the financial covenants, the Company expects to maintain compliance with the amended financial covenants in the near future. However, a significant downturn in lithium market prices or demand could impact the Company s ability to maintain compliance with its amended financial covenants and it could require the Company to seek additional amendments to the 2022 Credit Agreement and/or issue debt or equity securities to fund its activities and maintain financial flexibility. If the Company were unable to obtain such necessary additional amendments, this could lead to an event of default and its lenders could require the Company to repay its outstanding debt. In that situation, the Company may not be able to raise sufficient debt or equity capital, or divest assets, to refinance or repay the lenders. 
 On May 29, 2013, we entered into agreements to initiate a commercial paper program on a private placement basis under which we may issue unsecured commercial paper notes (the Commercial Paper Notes from time-to-time. On May 17, 2023, we entered into definitive documentation to increase the size of our existing commercial paper program. The maximum aggregate face amount of Commercial Paper Notes outstanding at any time is 1.5 billion (up from 750 million prior to the increase). The proceeds from the issuance of the Commercial Paper Notes are expected to be used for general corporate 
 48 

Table of Contents 

 purposes, including the repayment of other debt of the Company. The 2022 Credit Agreement is available to repay the Commercial Paper Notes, if necessary. Aggregate borrowings outstanding under the 2022 Credit Agreement and the Commercial Paper Notes will not exceed the 1.5 billion current maximum amount available under the 2022 Credit Agreement. The Commercial Paper Notes will be sold at a discount from par, or alternatively, will be sold at par and bear interest at rates that will vary based upon market conditions at the time of issuance. The maturities of the Commercial Paper Notes will vary but may not exceed 397 days from the date of issue. The definitive documents relating to the commercial paper program contain customary representations, warranties, default and indemnification provisions. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we repaid a net amount of 620.0 million of commercial paper notes using the net proceeds received from the issuance of mandatory convertible preferred stock. 
 In the second quarter of 2023, the Company received a loan of 300.0 million to be repaid in five equal annual installments beginning on December 31, 2026. This interest-free loan was discounted using an imputed interest rate of 5.5 and the Company will amortize that discount through Interest and financing expenses over the term of the loan. 
 When constructing new facilities or making major enhancements to existing facilities, we may have the opportunity to enter into incentive agreements with local government agencies in order to reduce certain state and local tax expenditures. Under these agreements, we transfer the related assets to various local government entities and receive bonds. We immediately lease the facilities from the local government entities and have an option to repurchase the facilities for a nominal amount upon tendering the bonds to the local government entities at various predetermined dates. The bonds and the associated obligations for the leases of the facilities offset, and the underlying assets are recorded in property, plant and equipment. We currently have the ability to transfer up to 540 million in assets under these arrangements. At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, there were 74.5 million and 14.3 million, respectively, of bonds outstanding under these arrangements. 
 The non-current portion of our long-term debt amounted to 3.57 billion at September 30, 2024, compared to 3.54 billion at December 31, 2023. In addition, at September 30, 2024, we had the ability to borrow 1.5 billion under our commercial paper program and the 2022 Credit Agreement, and 222.8 million under other existing lines of credit, subject to various financial covenants under the 2022 Credit Agreement. We have the ability and intent to refinance our borrowings under our other existing lines of credit with borrowings under the 2022 Credit Agreement, as applicable. Therefore, the amounts outstanding under those lines of credit, if any, are classified as long-term debt. We believe that at September 30, 2024 we were, and currently are, in compliance with all of our debt covenants. 
 Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 
 In the ordinary course of business with customers, vendors and others, we have entered into off-balance sheet arrangements, including bank guarantees and letters of credit, which totaled approximately 126.0 million at September 30, 2024. None of these off-balance sheet arrangements has, or is likely to have, a material effect on our current or future financial condition, results of operations, liquidity or capital resources. 
 Other Obligations 
 Our contractual obligations have not significantly changed, based on our ordinary business activities and projected capital expenditures noted above, from the information we provided in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. 
 Total expected 2024 contributions to our domestic and foreign qualified and nonqualified pension plans, including the Albemarle Corporation Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan, are expected to approximate 14 million. We may choose to make additional pension contributions in excess of this amount. We have made contributions of 11.9 million to our domestic and foreign pension plans (both qualified and nonqualified) during the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024. 
 The liability related to uncertain tax positions, including interest and penalties, recorded in Other noncurrent liabilities totaled 240.1 million at September 30, 2024 and 220.6 million at December 31, 2023. Related assets for corresponding offsetting benefits recorded in Other assets totaled 74.4 million at September 30, 2024 and 73.0 million at December 31, 2023. We cannot estimate the amounts of any cash payments associated with these liabilities for the remainder of 2024 or the next twelve months, and we are unable to estimate the timing of any such cash payments in the future at this time. 
 We are subject to federal, state, local and foreign requirements regulating the handling, manufacture and use of materials (some of which may be classified as hazardous or toxic by one or more regulatory agencies), the discharge of materials into the environment and the protection of the environment. To our knowledge, we are currently complying, and expect to continue to comply, in all material respects with applicable environmental laws, regulations, statutes and ordinances. Compliance with existing federal, state, local and foreign environmental protection laws is not expected to have a material effect on capital expenditures, earnings or our competitive position, but the costs associated with increased legal or regulatory requirements could have an adverse effect on our operating results.

 Among other environmental requirements, we are subject to the federal Superfund law, and similar state laws, under which we may be designated as a potentially responsible party PRP ), and may be liable for a share of the costs associated with cleaning up various hazardous waste sites. Management believes that in cases in which we may have liability as a PRP, our liability for our share of cleanup is de minimis. Further, almost all such sites represent environmental issues that are quite mature and have been investigated, studied and in many cases settled. In de minimis situations, our policy generally is to negotiate a consent decree and to pay any apportioned settlement, enabling us to be effectively relieved of any further liability as a PRP, except for remote contingencies. In other than de minimis PRP matters, our records indicate that unresolved PRP exposures should be immaterial. We accrue and expense our proportionate share of PRP costs. Because management has been actively involved in evaluating environmental matters, we are able to conclude that the outstanding environmental liabilities for unresolved PRP sites should not have a material adverse effect upon our results of operations or financial condition. 
 Liquidity Outlook 
 We anticipate that cash on hand and cash provided by operating activities, divestitures and borrowings will be sufficient to pay our operating expenses, satisfy debt service obligations, fund any capital expenditures, make acquisitions, make pension contributions and pay dividends for the foreseeable future. We also could issue additional debt or equity securities to fund these activities in an effort to maintain our financial flexibility. Our main focus in the short-term, during the continued uncertainty surrounding the global economy, including lithium market pricing and recent inflationary trends, is to continue to maintain financial flexibility by continuing our cost savings initiative, while still protecting our employees and customers, committing to shareholder returns and maintaining an investment grade rating. Over the next three years, in terms of uses of cash, we will continue to invest in growth of the businesses and return value to shareholders. Additionally, we will continue to evaluate the merits of any opportunities that may arise for acquisitions of businesses or assets, which may require additional liquidity. Financing the purchase price of any such acquisitions could involve borrowing under existing or new credit facilities and/or the issuance of debt or equity securities, in addition to cash on hand. 
 We expect 2024 capital expenditures to be down from 2023 levels. In January 2024, we announced an intentional re-phasing of larger projects to focus on those that are significantly progressed, near completion and in start up. At that time, we also announced actions to optimize our cost structure by reducing costs primarily related to sales, general and administrative expenses, including a reduction in headcount and lower spending on contracted services. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company stopped construction of Kemerton Trains 3 and 4, as well as put the Kemerton Train 2 on care and maintenance. Kemerton Train 1 will continue to operate and is currently focusing on commercialization efforts. As part of the comprehensive review of our cost and operating structure, we are planning to reduce capital expenditures by approximately 50 versus 2024 to a range of 800 million to 900 million. 
 The Company s actions regarding Kemerton are part of a broader effort that will focus on preserving its world-class resource advantages, optimizing its global conversion network, improving the Company s cost competitiveness and efficiency, reducing capital intensity and enhancing the Company s financial flexibility. As part of this effort, on October 7, 2024, the Company announced it will transition to a new operating structure effective November 1, 2024. The new operating structure will transition to a fully integrated functional model (excluding Ketjen) from a global business unit model. As a result, the Company expects to record severance and employee benefits of approximately 30 million to 50 million and other restructuring costs of approximately 25 million to 30 million associated with these actions in the fourth quarter of 2024. We expect the comprehensive review of our cost and operating structure to drive additional cost and productivity improvements of 300 million to 400 million per year. 
 In 2024, we entered into a Master Receivables Purchase Agreement under which we may sell up to 250.0 million of available and eligible outstanding customer accounts receivable generated by sales to two specified customers. This agreement is uncommitted and has initial terms that expire on April 25, 2025, unless earlier terminated by the purchaser. Transactions under this agreement are accounted for as sales of accounts receivable, and the receivables sold are removed from the consolidated balance sheets at the time of the sales transaction. As of September 30, 2024, there were no accounts receivable sold under this Master Receivables Purchase Agreement. 
 In October 2022, we announced we had been awarded a nearly 150 million grant from the U.S. Department of Energy to expand domestic manufacturing of batteries for EVs and the electrical grid and for materials and components currently imported from other countries. The grant funding is intended to support a portion of the anticipated cost to construct a new, commercial-scale U.S.-based lithium concentrator facility at our Kings Mountain, North Carolina, location. We expect the concentrator facility to create hundreds of construction and full-time jobs and to produce approximately 420,000 tons of spodumene concentrate annually. To further support the restart of the Kings Mountain mine, in August 2023, we announced a 90 million critical materials award from the U.S. Department of Defense. 
 Our cash flows from operations may be negatively affected by adverse consequences to our customers and the markets in which we compete as a result of moderating global economic conditions, continuing inflationary trends and reduced capital

 availability. We have experienced, and may continue to experience, volatility and increases in the price of certain raw materials and in transportation and energy costs as a result of global market and supply chain disruptions and the broader inflationary environment. As a result, we are planning for various economic scenarios and actively monitoring our balance sheet to maintain the financial flexibility needed. 
 Although we maintain business relationships with a diverse group of financial institutions as sources of financing, an adverse change in their credit standing could lead them to not honor their contractual credit commitments to us, decline funding under our existing but uncommitted lines of credit with them, not renew their extensions of credit or not provide new financing to us. While the global corporate bond and bank loan markets remain strong, periods of elevated uncertainty related to the stability of the banking system, future pandemics or global economic and/or geopolitical concerns may limit efficient access to such markets for extended periods of time. If such concerns heighten, we may incur increased borrowing costs and reduced credit capacity as our various credit facilities mature. If the U.S. Federal Reserve or similar national reserve banks in other countries decide to continue tightening the monetary supply, we may incur increased borrowing costs (as interest rates increase on our variable rate credit facilities, as our various credit facilities mature or as we refinance any maturing fixed rate debt obligations), although these cost increases would be partially offset by increased income rates on portions of our cash deposits. 
 Overall, with generally strong cash-generative businesses and no significant long-term debt maturities before the fourth quarter of 2025, we believe we have, and will be able to maintain, a solid liquidity position. 
 We had cash and cash equivalents totaling 1.7 billion at September 30, 2024, of which 980.8 million is held by our foreign subsidiaries. This cash represents an important source of our liquidity and is invested in bank accounts or money market investments with no limitations on access. The cash held by our foreign subsidiaries is intended for use outside of the U.S. We anticipate that any needs for liquidity within the U.S. in excess of our cash held in the U.S. can be readily satisfied with borrowings under our existing U.S. credit facilities or our commercial paper program. 
 Guarantor Financial Information 
 Albemarle Wodgina Pty Ltd Issued Notes 
 Albemarle Wodgina Pty Ltd (the Issuer ), a wholly-owned subsidiary of Albemarle Corporation, issued 300.0 million aggregate principal amount of 3.45 Senior Notes due 2029 (the 3.45 Senior Notes in November 2019. The 3.45 Senior Notes are fully and unconditionally guaranteed (the Guarantee on a senior unsecured basis by Albemarle Corporation (the Parent Guarantor ). No direct or indirect subsidiaries of the Parent Guarantor guarantee the 3.45 Senior Notes (such subsidiaries are referred to as the Non-Guarantors ). 
 In 2019, we completed the acquisition of a 60 interest in MRL s Wodgina hard rock lithium mine project Wodgina Project in Western Australia and formed an unincorporated joint venture with MRL, named MARBL Lithium Joint Venture, for the exploration, development, mining, processing and production of lithium and other minerals (other than iron ore and tantalum) from the Wodgina spodumene mine and for the operation of the Kemerton assets in Western Australia. We participate in the Wodgina Project through our ownership interest in the Issuer. On October 18, 2023, we amended the joint venture agreements, resulting in a decrease of our ownership interest in the MARBL joint venture and the Wodgina Project to 50 . 
 Prior to January 1, 2024, the Parent Guarantor conducted its U.S. Specialties and Ketjen operations directly, and conducted its other operations (other than operations conducted through the Issuer) through the Non-Guarantors. Effective January 1, 2024, the Company split its U.S. Ketjen operations to a separate non-guarantor subsidiary and its results are no longer included within the summarized Parent Guarantor and Issuer financial information below for the 2024 periods presented. 
 The 3.45 Senior Notes are the Issuer s senior unsecured obligations and rank equally in right of payment to the senior indebtedness of the Issuer, effectively subordinated to all of the secured indebtedness of the Issuer, to the extent of the value of the assets securing that indebtedness, and structurally subordinated to all indebtedness and other liabilities of its subsidiaries. The Guarantee is the senior unsecured obligation of the Parent Guarantor and ranks equally in right of payment to the senior indebtedness of the Parent Guarantor, effectively subordinated to the secured debt of the Parent Guarantor to the extent of the value of the assets securing the indebtedness and structurally subordinated to all indebtedness and other liabilities of its subsidiaries. 
 For cash management purposes, the Parent Guarantor transfers cash among itself, the Issuer and the Non-Guarantors through intercompany financing arrangements, contributions or declaration of dividends between the respective parent and its subsidiaries. The transfer of cash under these activities facilitates the ability of the recipient to make specified third-party payments for principal and interest on the Issuer and/or the Parent Guarantor s outstanding debt, common stock dividends and common stock repurchases. There are no significant restrictions on the ability of the Issuer or the Parent Guarantor to obtain funds from subsidiaries by dividend or loan.

 The 3.45 Senior Notes are structurally subordinated to the indebtedness and other liabilities of the Non-Guarantors. The Non-Guarantors are separate and distinct legal entities and have no obligation, contingent or otherwise, to pay any amounts due pursuant to the 3.45 Senior Notes or the Indenture under which the 3.45 Senior Notes were issued, or to make any funds available therefor, whether by dividends, loans, distributions or other payments. Any right that the Parent Guarantor has to receive any assets of any of the Non-Guarantors upon the liquidation or reorganization of any Non-Guarantor, and the consequent rights of holders of the 3.45 Senior Notes to realize proceeds from the sale of any of a Non-Guarantor s assets, would be effectively subordinated to the claims of such Non-Guarantor s creditors, including trade creditors and holders of preferred equity interests, if any, of such Non-Guarantor. Accordingly, in the event of a bankruptcy, liquidation or reorganization of any of the Non-Guarantors, the Non-Guarantors will pay the holders of their debts, holders of preferred equity interests, if any, and their trade creditors before they will be able to distribute any of their assets to the Parent Guarantor. 
 The 3.45 Senior Notes are obligations of the Issuer. The Issuer s cash flow and ability to make payments on the 3.45 Senior Notes could be dependent upon the earnings it derives from the production from MARBL for the Wodgina Project. Absent income received from sales of its share of production from MARBL, the Issuer s ability to service the 3.45 Senior Notes could be dependent upon the earnings of the Parent Guarantor s subsidiaries and other joint ventures and the payment of those earnings to the Issuer in the form of equity, loans or advances and through repayment of loans or advances from the Issuer.

 The Issuer s obligations in respect of MARBL are guaranteed by the Parent Guarantor. Further, under MARBL pursuant to a deed of cross security between the Issuer, the joint venture partner and the manager of the project (the Manager ), each of the Issuer, and the joint venture partner have granted security to each other and the Manager for the obligations each of the Issuer and the joint venture partner have to each other and to the Manager. The claims of the joint venture partner, the Manager and other secured creditors of the Issuer will have priority as to the assets of the Issuer over the claims of holders of the 3.45 Senior Notes. 
 Albemarle Corporation Issued Notes 
 In March 2021, Albemarle New Holding GmbH (the Subsidiary Guarantor ), a wholly-owned subsidiary of Albemarle Corporation, added a full and unconditional guarantee (the Upstream Guarantee to all securities of Albemarle Corporation (the Parent Issuer issued and outstanding as of such date and, subject to the terms of the applicable amendment or supplement, securities issuable by the Parent Issuer pursuant to the Indenture, dated as of January 20, 2005, as amended and supplemented from time to time (the Indenture ). No other direct or indirect subsidiaries of the Parent Issuer guarantee these securities (such subsidiaries are referred to as the Upstream Non-Guarantors ). See Long-term debt section above for a description of the securities issued by the Parent Issuer. 
 The current securities outstanding under the Indenture are the Parent Issuer s unsecured and unsubordinated obligations and rank equally in right of payment with all other unsecured and unsubordinated indebtedness of the Parent Issuer. All securities currently outstanding under the Indenture are effectively subordinated to the Parent Issuer s existing and future secured indebtedness to the extent of the value of the assets securing that indebtedness. With respect to any series of securities issued under the Indenture that is subject to the Upstream Guarantee (which series of securities does not include the 2022 Notes), the Upstream Guarantee is, and will be, an unsecured and unsubordinated obligation of the Subsidiary Guarantor, ranking pari passu with all other existing and future unsubordinated and unsecured indebtedness of the Subsidiary Guarantor. All securities currently outstanding under the Indenture (other than the 2022 Notes) are effectively subordinated to all existing and future indebtedness and other liabilities of the Parent s Subsidiaries other than the Subsidiary Guarantor. The 2022 Notes are effectively subordinated to all existing and future indebtedness and other liabilities of the Parent s Subsidiaries, including the Subsidiary Guarantor. 
 For cash management purposes, the Parent Issuer transfers cash among itself, the Subsidiary Guarantor and the Upstream Non-Guarantors through intercompany financing arrangements, contributions or declaration of dividends between the respective parent and its subsidiaries.

 Summary of Cr itical Accounting Policies and Estimates 
 There have been no significant changes in our critical accounting policies and estimates from the information we provided in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. However, we are expanding the description of our property, plant and equipment critical accounting policy and estimates as follows. 
 Property, Plant and Equipment. We assign the useful lives of our property, plant and equipment based upon our internal engineering estimates, which are reviewed periodically. The estimated useful lives of our property, plant and equipment range from two to sixty years and depreciation is recorded on the straight-line method, with the exception of our mineral rights and reserves, which are depleted on a units-of-production method. We evaluate the recovery of our property, plant and equipment annually and when events or changes in circumstances indicate that its carrying amount may not be recoverable. Events that may trigger a test for recoverability include, but are not limited to, significant adverse changes to projected revenues, costs, or capital plans or changes to government regulations that may adversely impact our current or future operations. An impairment is determined to exist if the total projected future cash flows on an undiscounted basis are not recoverable or are less than the carrying amount of a long-lived asset group. We estimate future cash flows based on numerous assumptions, which are consistent or reasonable in relation to internal budgets and projections, and actual future cash flows may be significantly different than the estimates. Significant estimates used include, but are not limited to, market pricing (including lithium index pricing), customer demand, operating and production costs, and the timing and capital costs of expansion and sustaining projects. Significant management judgment is involved in estimating these variables and they include inherent uncertainties since they are forecasting future events.

 Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk. 
 There have been no significant changes in our interest rate risk, foreign currency exchange rate exposure, marketable securities price risk or raw material price risk from the information we provided in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, except as noted below. 
 We had variable interest rate borrowings of 29.7 million outstanding at September 30, 2024, bearing a weighted average interest rate of 0.33 and representing 1 of our total outstanding debt. A hypothetical 100 basis point increase in the interest rate applicable to these borrowings would change our annualized interest expense by 0.3 million as of September 30, 2024. We may enter into interest rate swaps, collars or similar instruments with the objective of reducing interest rate volatility relating to our borrowing costs. 
 Our financial instruments, which are subject to foreign currency exchange risk, primarily consist of foreign currency forward contracts with an aggregate notional value of 7.0 billion and with a fair value representing a net liability position of 15.2 million at September 30, 2024. Fluctuations in the value of these contracts are generally offset by the value of the underlying exposures being hedged. We conducted a sensitivity analysis on the fair value of our foreign currency hedge portfolio assuming an instantaneous 10 change in select foreign currency exchange rates from their levels as of September 30, 2024, with all other variables held constant. A 10 appreciation of the U.S. Dollar against foreign currencies that we hedge would result in an increase of approximately 19.1 million in the fair value of our foreign currency forward contracts. A 10 depreciation of the U.S. Dollar against these foreign currencies would result in a decrease of approximately 19.1 million in the fair value of our foreign currency forward contracts. The sensitivity of the fair value of our foreign currency hedge portfolio represents changes in fair values estimated based on market conditions as of September 30, 2024, without reflecting the effects of underlying anticipated transactions. When those anticipated transactions are realized, actual effects of changing foreign currency exchange rates could have a material impact on our earnings and cash flows in future periods. 

Item 4. Controls and Procedures. 
 Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act), as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based on this evaluation, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer concluded that, as of the end of the period covered by this report, our disclosure controls and procedures are effective to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act, is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 
 No change in our internal control over financial reporting (as such term is defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(f)) occurred during the third quarter ended September 30, 2024 that materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 

PART II. OTHER INFORMATION 

Item 1. Legal Proceedings. 
 We are involved from time to time in legal proceedings of types regarded as common in our business, including administrative or judicial proceedings seeking remediation under environmental laws, such as Superfund, products liability, breach of contract liability and premises liability litigation. Where appropriate, we may establish financial reserves for such proceedings. We also maintain insurance to mitigate certain of such risks. Additional information with respect to this Item 1 is contained in Note 7 to the Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. 

Item 1A. Risk Factors. 
 While we attempt to identify, manage and mitigate risks and uncertainties associated with our business to the extent practical under the circumstances, some level of risk and uncertainty will always be present. The risk factors set forth in Item 1A of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 describe some of the risks and uncertainties associated with our business. These risks and uncertainties have the potential to materially affect our results of operations and our financial condition. We do not believe that there have been any material changes to the risk factors previously disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023.

Item 5. Other Information. 
 In October 2024, the Company announced that its operating structure will transition from two core global business units Energy Storage and Specialties to a fully integrated functional model designed to increase agility, deliver significant cost savings and maintain long-term competitiveness. This transition includes a workforce reduction of 6 to 7 of the Company s global employees, primarily in non-manufacturing roles.

 The information presented above contains forward-looking statements regarding the restructuring based on the Company s current expectations.
