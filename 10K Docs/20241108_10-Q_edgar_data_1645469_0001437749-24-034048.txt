Forward-Looking Statements 
 
 This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the Act ), and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. All statements other than statements of historical facts included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q are forward-looking statements. The words hopes, believes, anticipates, plans, seeks, estimates, projects, expects, intends, may, could, should, would, will, continue, and similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements. The following uncertainties and factors, among others, could affect future performance and cause actual results to differ materially from those matters expressed in or implied by forward-looking statements: 

our ability to raise sufficient funds in order for us to support continued clinical, regulatory and commercial development of our programs and to make contractual upfront and future milestone payments, as well as our ability to further raise additional funds in the future to support any existing or future product candidate programs through completion of clinical trials, the approval processes and, if applicable, commercialization

the difficulties of commercialization, marketing and product manufacturing and overall strategy 

uncertainties of intellectual property position and strategy including new discoveries and patent filings 

our ability to attract and retain experienced and qualified key personnel and/or to find and utilize external sources of experience, expertise and scientific, medical and commercialization knowledge to complete product development and commercialization of new products 

the risks inherent in our estimates regarding the level of needed expenses, capital requirements and the availability of required additional financing at acceptable terms 

the impact of the U.S. Presidential and Congressional election results affecting the economy and future government laws and regulations including increased governmental control of healthcare and pharmaceuticals, resulting in direct price controls driving lower prices, other governmental regulations affecting cost requirements and structures for selling therapeutic or imaging products, and recent governmental legislation affecting other industries which may indirectly increase our costs of obtaining goods and services and our cost of capital 

the uncertain impact any resurgence of COVID-19 or another pandemic could have on our ability to advance our clinical programs and raise additional financing 

the cumulative impact of domestic and global inflation, volatility in financial markets and/or the potential for an economic recession increasing our costs of obtaining goods and services or making financing more difficult to obtain on acceptable terms or at all 

the uncertain impact of the Russia-Ukraine war, the Israel-Hamas war, or any potential future conflicts on our clinical material manufacturing expenses and timelines, as well as on general political, economic, trade and financial market conditions and 

uncertainty of our financial projections and operational timelines and the development of new competitive products and technologies.

Summary Risk Factors 
 
 Our business is subject to numerous risks and uncertainties, including those highlighted in Item 1A - Risk Factors of our December 31, 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on March 28, 2024 and Item 1A - Risk Factors of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. These risks include, among others, the following: 

We are a clinical stage biotechnology company with a history of financial losses. We expect to continue to incur significant losses for the foreseeable future and may never achieve or maintain cash self-sufficiency or profitability, which could result in a decline in the market value of our common stock. 

Our ability to raise sufficient funds in order for us to support continued clinical, regulatory and commercial development of our programs and to make contractual upfront and future milestone payments, as well as our ability to further raise additional funds in the future to support any existing or future product candidate programs through completion of clinical trials, the approval processes and, if applicable, commercialization 

Although a pivotal Phase 3 trial with ALXN-1840 has been completed, which met its primary endpoint as described elsewhere in this report, Alexion ended up terminating the ALXN-1840 program in Wilson disease based on review of results from Phase 2 mechanistic trials and discussions with regulatory authorities. In the near term, we will be focusing on assembling a regulatory package and initiating discussions with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). There are uncertainties with respect to the outcome of these discussions and the additional capital needed for the program. 

The regulatory approval process can be lengthy, expensive and uncertain. The FDA and other regulatory agencies around the world could require us to perform additional nonclinical and/or clinical studies to obtain ALXN-1840 approval, which we may not be able to raise the capital to complete or the results of which may not meet the level of clinical or statistical significance required by the FDA and other regulatory agencies. 

We do not have and may never have any approved products on the market. Our business is highly dependent upon receiving marketing approvals from various U.S. and international governmental agencies and would be severely harmed if we are not granted approvals to manufacture and sell our product candidates. 

Our clinical trials may not yield sufficiently conclusive results for regulatory agencies to approve the marketing and sale of our products, which would adversely affect our financial condition. 

If we experience delays or difficulties in the enrollment of patients in clinical trials, our receipt of necessary regulatory approvals will be delayed or prevented, which could materially delay our program schedules and adversely affect our financial condition. 

If we or our licensees, development collaborators, or suppliers are unable to manufacture our products in sufficient quantities or at defined quality specifications, or are unable to obtain regulatory approvals for the manufacturing facility, we may be unable to develop and/or meet demand for our products as well as lose time to market and potential revenues. 

We rely on qualified third parties to conduct our active pharmaceutical ingredient manufacturing, our drug product manufacturing, non-clinical studies, and our clinical trials. If these third parties do not or cannot successfully carry out their contractual duties and meet expected deadlines or performance goals, the initiation or conduct of our clinical trials would be delayed and we may be unable to obtain regulatory approval for, or commercialize, our current product candidates or any future products, and our financial condition would be adversely affected. 

Radiopharmaceutical technology is a relatively novel approach to cancer imaging and treatment, which may create significant and potentially unpredictable challenges for it, including the availability of radioisotopes, potential misconception about the safety of radiopharmaceuticals, and low market uptake due to its novelty. Perceptions of these challenges may make it more difficult to raise funding as we focus efforts on our radiopharmaceutical programs.

Table of Contents 

The Russia-Ukraine war, and resulting sanctions against Russia and Russian entities, and Russian reduction in gas shipments to the EU and other allies, have increased fuel costs, reduced access to critical supplies and may cause shipping delays. Separately, the Israel-Hamas war has created additional uncertainties. The broader political, economic, trade and financial market consequences are uncertain at this time, which may increase the cost of supplies for our clinical materials, delay the manufacture of our clinical materials, restrict the availability of radioisotopes, increase costs of other goods and services or make it more difficult or costly to raise additional financing, any of which could cause an adverse effect on our clinical and preclinical programs and on our financial condition. 

Market variables, such as inflation of product costs, labor rates and fuel, freight and energy costs, as well as geopolitical events could likely cause us to suffer significant increases in our operating and administrative expenses. 

Unstable market and economic conditions, such as volatility in the markets due to concerns about bank stability and economic challenges due to inflation, may have serious adverse consequences on our ability to raise funds, which may cause us to delay, restructure or cease our operations. 

The impact of the U.S. Presidential and Congressional election results affecting the economy and future government laws and regulations including potential increased governmental control of healthcare and pharmaceuticals, resulting in direct price controls driving lower prices, other governmental regulations affecting cost requirements and structures for selling therapeutic or imaging products, and recent governmental legislation affecting other industries which may indirectly increase our costs of obtaining goods and services and our cost of capital 

We face significant competition from other radiopharmaceutical, biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies, and from research-based academic medical institutions, in our targeted medical indications, and our operating results would be adversely affected if we fail to compete effectively. Many competitors in our industry have greater organizational capabilities, much higher available capital resources, and established marketing and sales resources and experience in the targeted markets. Competition and technological change may make our product candidates obsolete or non-competitive. 

The termination of third-party licenses would adversely affect our rights to important compounds or technologies which are essential to develop and market our products. 

If we and our third-party licensors do not obtain and preserve protection for our respective intellectual property rights, our competitors may be able to develop and market competing drugs, which would adversely affect our financial condition. 

If we lose key management leadership, and/or the expertise and experience of our scientific personnel, and if we cannot recruit qualified employees or other highly qualified and experienced personnel for future requirements, we would be at risk to experience significant program delays and increased operational and compensation costs, and our business would be materially disrupted. 

Any future or long-term impacts of COVID-19 or any other pandemic remain uncertain, and their scope and impact could have a substantial negative bearing on our business, financial condition, operating results, stock price and ability to raise additional funds.

MONOPAR THERAPEUTICS INC.

NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

September 30, 2024

million as of September 30, 2024 . To date, the Company has primarily funded its operations with the net proceeds from the Company s initial public offering of its common stock on Nasdaq, sales of its common stock in the public market through at-the-market sales agreements, private placements of convertible preferred stock and of common stock and cash provided in the camsirubicin asset purchase transaction. In October 2024, the Company raised approximately million in total net proceeds from two financing events as disclosed under subsequent event section of this Form 10 -Q. Management estimates that currently available cash will provide sufficient funds to enable the Company to meet its obligations at least into the first half of 2026 . The Company s ability to fund its future operations, including the development of ALXN- 1840, an investigational drug candidate for Wilson disease, and the continued clinical development of its radiopharmaceutical programs, is dependent upon its ability to execute its business strategy, to obtain additional funding and/or to execute collaborative research agreements. There can be no certainty that future financing or collaborative research agreements will occur in the amounts required or at a time needed to maintain operations, if at all. 
 
 Going Concern Assessment 
 
 The Company applies Accounting Standards Codification 205 - 40 ASC 205 - 40 ), Disclosure of Uncertainties about an Entity s Ability to Continue as a Going Concern , which the Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB issued to provide guidance on determining when and how reporting companies must disclose going concern uncertainties in their financial statements. ASC 205 - 40 requires management to perform interim and annual assessments of an entity s ability to continue as a going concern within one year of the date of issuance of the entity s financial statements (or within one year after the date on which the financial statements are available to be issued, when applicable). Further, a company must provide certain disclosures if there is substantial doubt about the entity s ability to continue as a going concern. In October 2024, the Company analyzed its cash requirements at least through December 31, 2025 and has determined that, based upon the Company s current available cash, the Company has no substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern. 
 
 Risks and Uncertainties 
 
 Risks Related to the Company's Financial Condition and Capital Requirements 
 
 Many, if not most, biotechnology companies never become profitable and are acquired, merge, sell major product assets or go out of business before successfully developing any product that generates revenue from commercial sales that enables profitability. The Company has incurred losses since inception, and expects to continue to incur substantial operating losses over the next several years. These losses stem from the clinical development of the Company's current and future licensed and/or purchased product candidates and will continue for the foreseeable future. As a result, the Company anticipates that it will seek to raise additional capital within the next 12 months to fund our future operations. The Company's ability to raise sufficient funds in order to support continued clinical, regulatory and commercial development and to make contractual future milestone payments, as well as to further raise additional funds in the future to support any existing or future product candidate programs through completion of clinical trials, the approval processes and, if applicable, commercialization are uncertain. 
 
 The amount of future losses and when, if ever, the Company would become profitable is uncertain. The Company's ability to generate revenue and achieve profitability will depend on, among other things, successful completion of the development of its product candidates; obtaining necessary regulatory approvals from the FDA and international regulatory agencies; establishing manufacturing/quality, sales, and marketing and distribution arrangements with third parties; obtaining adequate reimbursement by third -party payers; and raising sufficient funds to finance its activities. If the Company is unsuccessful at some or all of these undertakings, its business, financial condition, and results of operations are expected to be materially and adversely affected. 

or more per year that are expensed monthly over the life of the contract, which is typically one year. Prepaid expenses are reflected on the Company s condensed consolidated balance sheets as other current assets. 

Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation FDIC insurable limit. The Company has not experienced any losses on its deposits since inception and management believes the Company is not exposed to significant risks with respect to these financial institutions. 

Determining which category an asset or liability falls within the hierarchy requires significant judgment. The Company evaluates its hierarchy disclosures each reporting period. There were no transfers between Level 1, 2 or 3 of the fair value hierarchy during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 . The following table presents the assets that are reported at fair value on the Company's condensed consolidated balance sheets on a recurring basis. No values were recorded in Level 2 or Level 3 as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 . The Company has no liabilities reported at fair value on a recurring basis Assets Measured at Fair Value on a Recurring Basis

and shares for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 respectively, and shares for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 respectively) and b) potentially dilutive shares of common stock (such as stock options and restricted stock units) outstanding during the period determined using the treasury stock method. As of September 30, 2024 and 2023 , potentially dilutive securities included stock-based awards to purchase u p to a n d shares of the Co mpany s common stock, respectively. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 , potentially dilutive securities are excluded from the computation of fully diluted net loss per share as their effect is anti-dilutive. 

Stock-based compensation expense for awards granted to employees, non-employee directors and consultants are based on the fair value of the underlying instrument calculated using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model on the date of grant for stock options and using the closing stock price on the date of grant for RSUs and recognized as expense on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period, which is the vesting period. Determining the appropriate fair value model and related assumptions requires judgment, including estimating the future stock price volatility and expected terms. For stock options granted in 2023, the expected volatility rates are estimated based on the Company s historical actual volatility over the three -year period from its initial public offering on December 18, 2019 through December 31, 2022. For awards granted during the three months ended September 30, 2024 , the expected volatility rates were estimated based on the Company s historical actual volatility over the four -year period from its initial public offering on December 18, 2019, through December 31, 2023. The expected term for options granted to date is estimated using the simplified method. Forfeitures only include known forfeitures to-date as the Company accounts for forfeitures as they occur due to a limited history of forfeitures. The Company has not paid dividends and does not anticipate paying a cash dividend in the future vesting period and, accordingly, uses an expected dividend yield of zero. The risk-free interest rate is based on the rate of U.S. Treasury securities with maturities consistent with the estimated expected term of the awards.

 Reverse Stock Split 
 
 On August 5, 2024, the Company conducted its Annual Meeting of Stockholders in which the stockholders approved among other items, a proposal to amend the Company's Second Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation to effect a reverse stock split of the outstanding shares, which provided the Board of Directors with authority to effect a reverse split within a specified range of ratios. Subsequently, the Board of Directors approved a reverse stock split of 1 for shares of the Company's common stock in an attempt to regain compliance with the Nasdaq's continued listing requirements, which the reverse stock split did end up successfully accomplishing. The reverse stock split became effective at 5:00 pm on Monday August 12, 2024, and the Company's common stock commenced trading on a split-adjusted basis at the open of trading on Tuesday, August 13, 2024. 
 
 Furthermore, at the Annual Meeting of Stockholders, a proposal to amend the 2016 Stock Incentive Plan was approved. As a result, the total number of shares reserved for issuance under the Amended 2016 Plan would increase from to (pre-split). As a result of the above mentioned stock split, the total number of shares reserved for issuance was adjusted to . 
 
 The reverse stock split reduced the number of shares of the Company's common stock outstanding on August 12, 2024 from to . Proportional adjustments were made to the Company's outstanding stock options, and restricted stock units. No fractional shares were issued in connection with the reverse stock split. Stockholders who would otherwise have held a fractional share of common stock were rounded up and issued one whole share. 
 
 The par value of the Company's common stock was unchanged at per share. The number of authorized shares of common stock was also unchanged at shares. 
 
 The reverse stock split did not modify the rights or preferences of the underlying common stock. The Company's stockholders' equity reflects the par value for all shares of common stock at per share, with a corresponding increase in additional paid-in capital. All per-share amounts and numbers of shares in the accompanying financial statements and related notes have been retroactively adjusted to reflect the reverse stock split. 

Sales of Common Stock 

On April 20, 2022, the Company entered into a Capital on Demand Sales Agreement with JonesTrading Institutional Services LLC JonesTrading ), pursuant to which Monopar may offer and sell, from time to time, through or to JonesTrading, as sales agent or principal, shares of Monopar s common stock. On January 4, 2023, the Company filed a a prospectus related to the offer and sale of shares of common stock under this agreement of up to an aggregate amount of , under which had been sold through September 30, 2024 and was remaining on that date. Expenses related to these financing activities were recorded as offering costs (a reduction of additional paid in capital) on the Company s condensed consolidated statement of stockholders equity for the period.

As of September 30, 2024 , the Company had not reached any milestones and has not been required to pay XOMA Ltd. any funds under this license agreement. The first milestone payment is payable upon first dosing of a human patient in a Phase 2 clinical trial. The Company's MNPR- 101 radiopharma program is in Phase 1 and the Company cannot reliably predict when the program will enter Phase 2 if at all. 
 
 NorthStar Medical Radioisotopes, LLC ("NorthStar") 
 
 In June 2024, the Company entered into a long-term, non-exclusive master supply agreement for NorthStar to provide Monopar with the therapeutic radioisotope actinium- 225 ("Ac- 225" ). The original collaboration agreement was amended at that time to clarify certain economic terms and those related to jointly developed intellectual property rights for Monopar s MNPR- 101 for radiopharmaceutical use. Monopar has acquired those rights from NorthStar, together with certain broad, jointly developed intellectual property pertaining to MNPR- 101, giving Monopar full ownership and title to its lead MNPR- 101 radiopharmaceutical platform. Both companies will share ownership of the filed patent application on the use of PCTA as a linker with Ac- 225, which has shown with MNPR- 101 superior binding and yield with Ac- 225 over the current industry-leading linker, DOTA. 
 
 Legal Contingencies 
 
 The Company may be subject to claims and assessments from time to time in the ordinary course of business. No claims have been asserted to date. 

Indemnification 
 
 In the normal course of business, the Company enters into contracts and agreements that contain a variety of representations and warranties and provide for general indemnification. The Company s exposure under these agreements is unknown because it involves claims that may be made against the Company in the future, but that have not yet been made. To date, the Company has not paid any claims nor been required to defend any action related to its indemnification obligations. However, the Company may record charges in the future as a result of future claims against these indemnification obligations.

There have been no indemnification claims to date. 

shares of common stock (representing a beneficial ownership interest in the Company upon issuance) and the Company has agreed to make an upfront cash payment of million, which shall be payable in two installments, including a million cash payment at the time of signing and a million cash payment within ninety 90 days. The Company made the initial million payment on October 24, 2024. 
 
 Additionally, pursuant to the license agreement, Alexion is eligible to receive milestones and royalties, as further described below. 
 
 The shares issued to Alexion were issued pursuant to a separate Common Stock Investment Agreement, also dated October 23, 2024, between the Company and Alexion (the Equity Agreement ). Pursuant to the Equity Agreement, the Company agreed to anti-dilution provisions that entitle Alexion to additional shares of common stock so that the total number of shares issued thereunder continue to represent of outstanding shares after any subsequent issuances of common stock through the next million of common equity capital raised by the Company, subject to a maximum of Shares (inclusive of the shares initially issued) unless the Company obtains stockholder approval. As of October 31, 2024, the Company has issued Alexion an additional shares under these anti-dilution provisions (bringing the total number of shares issued to Alexion to as a result of the financing transactions discussed below. The Equity Agreement also entitles Alexion to customary registration rights and the Company agreed to file a resale registration statement within forty-five 45 days of October 23, 2024. 
 
 As additional consideration, the Company will be obligated to pay Alexion aggregate milestone payments of up to million, including regulatory approval and sales related milestone payments. Alexion is also entitled to receive tiered royalties based on net sales in the low to mid-double digit range. Alexion has a right of first negotiation regarding any rights that the Company intends to sublicense, and will receive a percentage in the mid-double digits of sublicensing income received by Company until the Licensed Product achieves sales. The Company also assumed a third party agreement from Alexion under which the Company will owe a third -party a single digit millions cash milestone payment upon regulatory approval in Europe and a single digit percentage royalty on net sales in Europe.

Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. 
 
 You should read the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations together with our condensed consolidated financial statements and related notes contained in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Some of the information contained in this discussion and analysis are set forth elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, including information with respect to our plans and strategy for our business and related financing activities, includes forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. 
 
 Overview 
 
 We are a clinical-stage biotechnology company with late-stage ALXN-1840 for Wilson disease, and radiopharma programs including Phase 1-stage MNPR-101-Zr for imaging advanced cancers, and Phase 1a-stage MNPR-101-Lu and late preclinical-stage MNPR-101-Ac225 for the treatment of advanced cancers. 
 
 Financial Status 
 
 Our cash, cash equivalents and investments as of September 30, 2024, were 6 million. Our primary funding source over the past three years was sales of shares of our common stock under at-the-market sales programs through Capital on Demand Sales Agreements with JonesTrading Institutional Services LLC Jones Trading ). As of October 31, 2024 we sold 557,761 shares of our common stock this year at an average gross price per share of 7.73 for net proceeds of 4,202,244 after fees and commissions of 107,806. On October 28, 2024, we entered into and executed a placement agent agreement with Rodman Renshaw LLC in connection with a registered public offering of 1,181,540 shares of our common stock, par value 0.001 per share, at an offering price of 16.25 per Share. The offering closed on October 30, 2024 and yielded net proceeds from the offering of approximately 17.7 million, after deducting placement agent fees and other estimated offering expenses. 
 
 As discussed further below and elsewhere in this Quarterly Report, we expect that our current funds will be sufficient at least into the first half of 2026 for us to: (1) assemble a regulatory package and initiate discussions with the FDA for the in-licensed ALXN-1840 investigational drug candidate for Wilson disease; (2) continue to conduct and conclude our first-in-human imaging and dosimetry clinical trial with MNPR-101-Zr; (3) continue to conduct our first-in-human therapeutic clinical trial of MNPR-101-Lu; (4) advance our preclinical MNPR-101-Ac program into the clinic; and (5) invest in internal R D projects to expand our radiopharma pipeline. We will require additional funding to further advance our clinical and preclinical programs and we anticipate that we will seek to raise additional capital within the next 12 months to fund our future operations. 
 
 Our Product Pipeline 

ALXN-1840 for Wilson disease 

Wilson disease is a rare and progressive genetic condition in which the body s pathway for removing excess copper is compromised. It affects one in 30,000 live births in the US. Over time this results in the build-up of toxic copper levels in the liver, brain, and other organs, leading to damage that greatly impacts a patient s life. Patients can develop a wide range of symptoms, including liver disease and/or psychiatric or neurological symptoms, such as personality changes, tremors and difficulty walking, swallowing or talking. In some cases, the damage and loss of function may be irreversible. 
 
 ALXN-1840 (bis-choline tetrathiomolybdate) is an investigational once-daily, oral medicine in development for the treatment of Wilson disease. This novel molecule is designed to selectively and tightly bind and remove copper from the body s tissues and blood. ALXN-1840 has been granted Orphan Drug Designation in the United States and orphan designation in the European Union for Wilson disease. 
 
 A pivotal Phase 3 trial with ALXN-1840 has been completed, which met its primary endpoint. The primary endpoint assessed copper mobilization over 48 weeks, defined as daily mean AUEC (Area Under the Effect Curve) for dNCC (directly measured non-ceruloplasmin-bound copper). In the trial, 214 patients were enrolled, and the trial was randomized, rater-blinded, and multi-centered, designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of ALXN-1840 versus standard-of-care (SoC) in patients with Wilson disease aged 12 years and older. In the trial, people taking ALXN-1840 experienced rapid copper mobilization, with a response at four weeks and sustained through the 48 weeks. The primary endpoint demonstrated three-times greater copper mobilization from tissues compared to the SoC arm (Least Square Mean Difference [LSM Diff] 2.18 mol/L; p

Alexion ended up terminating the ALXN-1840 program in Wilson disease based on review of results from Phase 2 mechanistic trials and discussions with regulatory authorities. The Phase 2 mechanism of action studies failed to meet their primary objectives of demonstrating net-negative copper balance in Wilson disease patients during short-term treatment with ALXN-1840 and reducing hepatic copper concentration after treatment with ALXN-1840. The decision not to progress the ALXN-1840 program in Wilson disease was not related to any safety signals. 
 
 In the near term, we will be focusing on assembling a regulatory package and initiating discussions with the FDA. These activities will provide clarity on the additional capital needed for the program. As a result, the costs beyond the 4.0 million due at signing and within ninety (90) days pursuant to the license agreement, will largely be consultant time along with patent maintenance. These near-term expenses are estimated to be less than 1.0 million to assemble the detailed regulatory package and maintain the patent portfolio. 
 
 The regulatory approval process can be lengthy, expensive and uncertain. The FDA and other regulatory agencies around the world could require us to perform additional nonclinical and/or clinical studies to obtain ALXN-1840 approval, which we may not be able to raise the capital to complete or the results of which may not meet the level of clinical or statistical significance required by the FDA and other regulatory agencies. What the FDA and other regulatory agencies require for approval could have a material impact on the timelines and/or capital required to get ALXN-1840 approved. Even if approved, market adoption could be slower or lower than expected, especially given competition from existing therapies or new ones that get approved. We are planning to initially focus on Wilson disease patients with more severe symptoms, and this population could end up being smaller than we are anticipating. This population could be further reduced in size if the FDA or other regulatory agencies give us a more narrow label than anticipated. Being an orphan indication, this could result in a very small eligible patient population. Additionally, if the currently filed patents do not end up providing sufficient protection, we will be heavily reliant on the orphan drug designation protections in the US and EU. 
 
 MNPR-101 for Radiopharmaceutical Use, Development Update 
 
 The radiopharma space has had numerous positive recent developments and announcements, from acquisitions to clinical data to reimbursement rates to commercial demand. Since this past December alone, four significant acquisitions have been publicly announced or completed which have had upfront payments ranging from approximately 1 billion to over 4 billion (BMS/RayzeBio, AstraZeneca/Fusion Pharma, Eli Lilly/POINT BioPharma, and Novartis/Mariana Oncology). 
 
 Monopar has a proprietary first-in-class humanized monoclonal antibody, MNPR-101, that targets the urokinase plasminogen activator receptor ("uPAR"). uPAR is expressed on several of the more aggressive, deadly cancers including pancreatic, breast, ovarian, colorectal, and bladder cancers. Monopar has conjugated MNPR-101 to imaging and therapeutic radioisotopes for the purpose of creating highly precise radiopharmaceutical agents that have the potential to image and treat tumors expressing uPAR while reducing exposure to healthy tissues. In February 2024, we received regulatory clearance in Australia to commence a first-in-human P hase 1 imaging and dosimetry clinical trial with our novel radiopharmaceutical imaging agent MNPR-101-Zr (MNPR-101 conjugated to zirconium-89) in patients with advanced cancers, and in April, we launched the Phase 1 trial. In July 2024, we announced the enrollment of our first patient and in September 2024, we announced positive early clinical data validating the tumor-targeting ability of MNPR-101-Zr. In August 2024, we received regulatory clearance in Australia to commence a first-in-human Phase 1a clinical trial of our novel uPAR-targeted radiopharmaceutical therapy MNPR-101-Lu (MNPR-101 conjugated to lutetium-177) in patients with advanced solid cancers. We launched the trial in October 2024, and it is now active and open for patient enrollment. 

In October, we presented clinical data at the European Association of Nuclear Medicine Annual Congress 2024 showing significant uptake of MNPR-101-Zr in a patient with advanced ovarian cancer together with preclinical and clinical data showing favorable biodistribution, tumor uptake, and low off-target binding of our uPAR-targeted radiopharmaceuticals MNPR-101-Zr, MNPR-101-Lu, and MNPR-101-Ac (MNPR-101 conjugated to actinium-225). 

We are also actively exploring opportunities to expand our radiopharmaceutical pipeline primarily through internal development efforts. In October 2024, we announced the filing of a provisional patent application for new radiopharmaceutical compounds and a family of linkers used to connect radioisotopes with targeting agents, including our uPAR-targeting antibody MNPR-101. 
 
 Our Strategy 
 
 Our management team has extensive experience in developing therapeutics and medical technologies through global regulatory approval and commercialization. In aggregate, companies they co-founded have achieved four drug approvals and three diagnostic medical imaging device approvals in the U.S. and the EU, successfully sold an asset developed by management which subsequently had a positive Phase 3 clinical trial, sold two oncology-focused diagnostic imaging businesses to Fortune Global 1000 firms, and completed the clinical and commercial development and ultimately the sale of a commercial biopharmaceutical company for over 800 million in cash. In addition, the team has supported multiple regulatory submissions with the FDA and the European Medicines Agency EMA) and launched multiple drugs in the U.S and the EU. Understanding the preclinical, clinical, regulatory and commercial development processes and hurdles are key factors in successful drug development and the expertise demonstrated by our management team across all of these areas increases the probability of success in advancing the product candidates in our product pipeline. 

Our strategic goal is to acquire, develop, and commercialize innovative treatments for patients with unmet medical needs. Key elements of our strategy to achieve this goal are to:

Assemble a regulatory package for ALXN-1840 and initiate discussions with the FDA. We are planning to assemble a regulatory package to support a New Drug Application (NDA) approval for ALXN-1840 in Wilson disease patients with more severe symptoms. 

Expand th e development of MNPR-101 for radiopharmaceutical use as a therapeutic as well as a diagnostic imaging agent . Based on promising preclinical data from our imaging and efficacy animal model studies in multiple cancers including triple-negative breast and pancreatic cancers and human clinical data from our MNPR-101-Zr Phase 1 trial validating the tumor-targeting ability of MNPR-101, we have prioritized significant resources and funds toward the development of our radiopharmaceutical programs. We have two open and active human clinical trials for our MNPR-101 radiopharmaceutical program; a Phase 1 imaging and dosimetry clinical trial of MNPR-101-Zr in patients with advanced cancers and a Phase 1a therapeutic clinical trial of MNPR-101-Lu also in patients with advanced cancers. In addition, we are continuing our preclinical development of MNPR-101-Ac, using the alpha-emitter actinium-225 conjugated to MNPR-101. 

Expand our drug development pipeline through internal efforts, in-licensing and acquisition of product candidates. We plan to continue the expansion of our drug development pipeline through internal research and development, acquiring or in-licensing additional product candidates, particularly those that leverage existing scientific and clinical data that helps reduce the risks of the next steps in clinical development. The focus on this front will include identifying both novel and established targets and candidates complementing our radiopharmaceutical and rare disease programs. 

Utilize the expertise and prior experience of our team in the areas of asset acquisition, drug development and commercialization to establish ourselves as a leading biotechnology company. Our senior executive team has relevant experience in biopharmaceutical in-licensing and acquisitions as well as developing product candidates through approval and commercialization. In aggregate, our team has co-founded BioMarin Pharmaceutical (Nasdaq: BMRN), Sensant Corp (acquired by Siemens), American BioOptics (assets acquired by Olympus), Raptor Pharmaceuticals 800 million sale to Horizon Therapeutics), and Tactic Pharma, LLC Tactic Pharma (sale of lead asset, bis-choline tetrathiomolybdate, was ultimately acquired by Alexion in June 2018 for 764 million; Alexion was subsequently acquired by AstraZeneca). In October 2024, we in-licensed, ALXN-1840 from Alexion, AstraZeneca Rare Disease and plan to pursue regulatory approval and commercialization of this late-stage drug candidate for Wilson disease. 

Revenues 
 
 We are an emerging growth company. We have no approved drugs and have not generated any revenues. To date, we have engaged in acquiring or in-licensing drug product candidates, and in entering into collaboration agreements for the preclinical testing and clinical development of our drug product candidates along with providing the infrastructure to support the clinical development of our drug product candidates. We do not anticipate revenues from operations until we complete testing and development of one of our drug product candidates and obtain marketing approval, or until we sell, enter into a collaborative marketing arrangement, or out-license one of our drug product candidates to another party. See Liquidity and Capital Resources . 
 
 Recently Issued and Adopted Accounting Pronouncements 
 
 During the three months ended September 30, 2024, there were three recently issued accounting pronouncements that are described in more detail in Note 2 of our condensed consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.

Table of Contents 

Critical Accounting Policies and Use of Estimates 
 
 While our significant accounting policies are described in more detail in Note 2 of our condensed consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, we believe the following accounting policies to be critical to the judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our condensed consolidated financial statements. 
 
 Going Concern Assessment 
 
 We apply Accounting Standards Codification 205-40 ("ASC 205-40"), Disclosure of Uncertainties about an Entity's Ability to Continue as a Going Concern , which the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued to provide guidance on determining when and how reporting companies must disclose going concern uncertainties in their financial statements. ASC-205-40 requires management to perform interim and annual assessments of an entity's ability to continue as a going concern within one year of the date of issuance of the entity's financial statements (or within one year after the date on which the financial statements are available to be issued when applicable). Further, a company must provide certain disclosures if there is "substa ntial doubt about the entity's ability to continue as a going concern." In October 2024, we analyzed our cash requirements at least throug h December 31 , 2025 and w e have determined that, based upon our current available cash, we have no substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. 
 
 Clinical Trials Accruals 
 
 We accrue and expense the costs for clinical trial activities performed by third parties based upon estimates of the percentage of work completed over the life of the individual study in accordance with agreements established with contract research organizations, service providers, and clinical trial sites. We estimate the amounts to accrue based upon discussions with internal clinical personnel and external service providers as to progress or stage of completion of trials or services and the agreed upon fees to be paid for such services. Costs of setting up clinical trial sites for participation in the trials are expensed immediately as research and development expenses. Clinical trial site costs related to patient screening and enrollment are accrued as patients are screened/entered into the trial. 

Stock-Based Compensation 

We account for stock-based compensation arrangements with employees, non-employee directors and consultants using a fair value method, which requires the recognition of compensation expense for costs related to all stock-based compensation grants, including stock option and restricted stock unit RSU grants. The fair value method requires us to estimate the fair value of stock-based payment awards on the date of grant using an option pricing model or the closing stock price on the date of grant in the case of RSUs. 
 
 Stock-based compensation costs for stock awards granted to our employees, non-employee directors and consultants are based on the fair value of the underlying instruments calculated using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model on the date of grant for stock options and using the closing stock price on the date of grant for RSUs and recognized as expense on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period, which is the vesting period. Determining the appropriate fair value model and related assumptions requires judgment, including selecting methods for estimating our future stock price volatility and expected holding term. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we granted 2,000 options to purchase shares of our common stock to a consultant, 30,001 options to purchase shares of our common stock to officers and 11,522 options to purchase shares of our common stock to non-officer employees. For awards granted during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, the expected volatility rates are estimated based on our actual historical volatility over the four-year period from our initial public offering on December 18, 2019, through December 31, 2023. For awards granted during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, the expected volatility rates are estimated based on our actual historical volatility over the three-year period from our initial public offering on December 18, 2019, through December 31, 2022. The expected term for stock options granted during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, and 2023, was estimated using the simplified method. Forfeitures only include actual forfeitures to-date as we account for forfeitures as they occur due to a limited history of forfeitures. We have not paid dividends and do not anticipate paying a cash dividend in future vesting periods and, accordingly, use an expected dividend yield of zero. The risk-free interest rate is based on the rate of U.S. Treasury securities with maturities consistent with the estimated expected term of the awards.

Research and Development R D Expenses 
 
 R D expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2024 were 984,000, compared to 1,317,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2023 . This represents a decrease of 333,000 attribu ted to (1) a decrease in camsirubicin manufacturing costs of 301,000 due to our decision to wind down that program, and (2) a decrease of 218,000 in Validive clinical trial-related expenses due to the closure of the trial in March 2023. These decreases were partially offset by a net increase o f 186,000 due to other R D expenses attributable to MNPR-101 for radiopharma use . 
 
 R D expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 were 3,081,000 compared to 4,564,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 . This represents a decrease of 1,483,000 attribu ted to (1) a decrease of 1,572,000 in Validive clinical trial-related expenses due to the closure of the trial in March 2023, and (2) a net decrease of 366,000 due to other R D expenses. These decreases were partially offset by an increase of 455,000 in expenses for MNPR-101 for radiopharma use. 
 
 General and Administrative G A Expenses 
 
 G A expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2024 were 591,000, compared to 749,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2023 . This represents a decrease of 158,000 primarily attributed to (1) a reduction of stock based compensation expenses of 146,000 due to the full vesting of the 2020 grants in the fourth quarter of 2023, and (2) a decrease in stock-based compensation to the CEO and the board of directors of 64,000 as no equity awards have been issued to the CEO and the board of directors to date in 2024 partially offset by a net increase in consulting and other G A expenses of 52,000. 
 
 G A expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 were 2,006,000, compared to 2,355,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 . This represents a decrease of 349,000 primarily attributed to (1) a reduction of stock based compensation expenses of 197,000 due to the full vesting of the 2020 grants in the fourth quarter of 2023, and (2) a decrease in stock-based compensation to the CEO and the board of directors of 197,000 as no equity awards were issued to the CEO and the board of directors to date in 2024 partially offset by a net increase in consulting, tax services and other G A expenses of 45,000. 
 
 Other Income 

Other income for the three and nine months ended 
 September 30, 2024
 increased by 171,000 versus the three and nine months ended 
 September 30, 202 3 
 due to the release of an accrued liability. 

Interest Income 
 
 Interest income for the three months ended September 30, 2024 , decreased by 13,000 versus the three months ended September 30, 2023. The reduction in the amount of interest received is a reflection of the lower daily average cash balance in the third quarter of 2024 versus the third quarter of 2023. 
 
 Interest income for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 , decreased by 76,000 versus the nine months ended September 30, 2023 , due to lower interest received due to a lower daily average cash balance in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 versus the nine months ended September 30, 2023.

Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 
 Sources of Liquidity 
 
 We have incurred losses and cumulative negative cash flows from operations since we commenced operations resulting in an accumulated deficit of approx imately 64.9 million as of September 30, 2024 . We anticipate that we will continue to incur losses for the foreseeable future. We expect that our R D and G A expenses will increase to enable the execution of our strategic plan. As a result, we anticipate that we will seek to raise additional capital within the next 12 months to fund our future operations. We will seek to obtain needed capital through a variety of methods including and not limited to marketed offerings, rights offerings, debt financing, strategic partnerships or other sources of capital that may be available. 

We anticipate that the currently available funds as of October 31, 2024 will fund our planned operations at least into the first half of 2026. 

We invest our cash equivalents in two money market accounts and U.S. Treasury Bills and may consider expanding the instruments to include U.S Treasury Notes and U.S. Treasury bonds. 
 
 Cash Flows

During the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 we had a net cash outflow of 1,246,000 and 2,671,000, respectively. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024 , versus the nine months ended September 30, 2023 , the decrease in net cash outflow of 1,425,000 primarily consisted of a decrease in net cash provided by investing activities of 1,957,000 due to the purchases of investments versus certain investments maturities in 2023, partially offset by (1) a decrease in net cash used in operating activities of 1,907,000, (2) an increase in net cash provided by financing activities of 1,463,000 due to the increased sales of shares of our common stock under at-the-market sales programs and (3) an increase due to effect of foreign exchange rates. 
 
 Cash Flow Used in Operating Activities 
 
 The decrease of 1,907,000 in cash flow used in operating activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023 was primarily a result of lower net loss due to a reduction in research and development expenses. 
 
 Cash Flow Provided by Investing Activities 
 
 The cash provided by investing activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and the cash provided by investing activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2023 represent our net investment in U.S. Treasury Bills maturing or invested in during the periods reported. 
 
 Cash Flow Provided by Financing Activities 
 
 The increase in cash flow provided by financing activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023 of 1,463,000 was primarily due to higher net proceeds from sales of our common stock under at-the-market sales programs during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 when compared to the sales of our common stock during the nine months ended September 30, 2023 .

Future Funding Requirements 
 
 To date, we have not generated any revenue from product sales. We do not know when, or if, we will generate any revenue from product sales. We do not expect to generate any revenue from product sales or royalties unless and until we obtain regulatory approval of and commercialize any of our current or future drug product candidates or we out-license or sell a drug product candidate to another party. At the same time, we expect our expenses to increase in connection with our ongoing development activities, particularly as we continue the research, development, future preclinical studies and clinical trials of, and seek regulatory approval for, our current and future drug product candidates. We will need substantial additional funding for clinical development prior to seeking regulatory approval. If we obtain regulatory approval of any of our current or future drug product candidates, we will need substantial additional funding for commercialization requirements and our continuing drug product development operations. 
 
 As a company, we have not completed development through marketing approvals of any therapeutic or imaging products. We expect to continue to incur significant increases in expenses and increasing operating losses for the foreseeable future. We anticipate that our expenses will increase substantially as we: 

develop our ALXN-1840 investigational drug candidate as a treatment for Wilson disease; 

progress our MNPR-101-Zr imaging and dosimetry clinical trial in advanced cancer patients 

progress our MNPR-101-Lu therapeutic clinical trial in advanced cancer patients 

continue the preclinical activities and potentially advance MNPR-101-Ac into the clinic as a therapeutic in advanced cancer patients 

support intellectual property initiatives for our Wilson disease and radiopharmaceutical programs; 

identify and potentially invent or license novel targets and drug candidates complementing our radiopharmaceutical programs, and pursue the future preclinical and clinical development and regulatory requirements of such drug product candidates 

seek regulatory approvals for any of our current and future drug product candidates that successfully complete registration clinical trials 

establish or purchase the services of a sales, marketing and distribution infrastructure to commercialize any products for which we obtain marketing approval 

develop, or contract for, manufacturing/quality capabilities in order to establish a reliable, high quality supply chain sufficient to support our clinical and specialized radiopharmaceutical requirements and to provide sufficient capacity to launch and supply the market for any product for which we obtain marketing approval and 

add or contract for required operational, financial, human resources and management information systems and capabilities and other specialized expert personnel to support our drug product candidate development and planned commercialization efforts. 

W e anticipate that the funds available as of October 31, 2024 will fund our obligations at least into the first half of 2026 . We have based this estimate on assumptions that may prove to be wrong, and we could use our available capital resources sooner than we currently expect. Because of the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with the development and commercialization of our drug product candidates, and the extent to which we enter into collaborations with third parties to participate in the development and commercialization of our drug product candidates, we are unable to accurately estimate with high reliability the amounts and timing required for increased capital outlays and operating expenditures associated with our current and anticipated drug product candidate development programs. 
 
 Our future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including: 

the development program for ALXN-1840 in Wilson disease; 

the clinical development progress of MNPR-101-Zr in imaging advanced cancers; 

the clinical development progress of MNPR-101-Lu as a therapeutic agent in advanced cancers; 

the progress of preclinical and clinical development of MNPR-101-Ac (the radioisotope actinium-225 conjugated to MNPR-101); 

the progress of preclinical activities towards identifying novel targets and candidates to complement our radiopharmaceutical programs; 

the number and characteristics of other drug product candidates that we may invent, license, acquire, or otherwise pursue

the scope, progress, timing, cost and results of research, preclinical development and clinical trials and regulatory requirements for future drug product candidates 

the costs, timing and outcomes of seeking, obtaining, and maintaining FDA and international regulatory approvals 

the costs associated with establishing or contracting for manufacturing/quality requirements and establishing or contracting for sales, marketing and distribution capabilities 

our ability and related costs to maintain, expand and defend the scope of our intellectual property portfolio, including the amount and timing of any payments we may be required to make in connection with the licensing, filing, defense and enforcement of any patents or other intellectual property rights 

our need and ability to hire or contract for additional management, administrative, scientific, medical, sales and marketing, and manufacturing/quality and other specialized personnel or external expertise 

the effect and timing of entry of competing products or new therapies that may limit market penetration or prevent the introduction of our drug product candidates or reduce the commercial potential of our product portfolio 

our need to implement additional required internal management, operational, record keeping, and other systems and infrastructure and 

the economic and other terms, timing and success of our existing collaboration and licensing arrangements and any collaboration, licensing or other arrangements into which we may enter into in the future, including the timing of receipt of or payment to or from others of any license, milestone or royalty payments under these arrangements. 

We intend to continue evaluating drug product candidates for the purpose of growing our pipeline. Identifying and securing high-quality compounds usually takes time and related expenses. Our spending could be significantly accelerated in the future if additional drug product candidates are acquired and enter clinical development. In this event, we may be required to expand our management team, and pay higher contract manufacturing costs, contract research organization fees, other clinical development costs and insurance costs that are not currently projected. Beyond our current funds, substantial additional long-term funding is needed to further develop our radiopharmaceutical and rare disease programs. 
 
 Until we can generate a sufficient amount of product revenue to finance our cash requirements, we expect to finance our future cash needs primarily through a combination of equity offerings, debt financings, strategic collaborations and grant funding. To the extent that we raise additional capital through the sale of equity or convertible debt securities, the ownership interest of our current stockholders will be diluted, and the terms of these securities may include liquidation or other preferences that adversely affect our current stockholders rights. Debt financing, if available, may involve agreements that include covenants limiting or restricting our ability to take specific actions, such as incurring additional debt, making capital expenditures or declaring dividends. If we raise additional funds through marketing and distribution arrangements or other collaborations, strategic alliances or licensing arrangements with other parties, we likely will have to share or relinquish valuable rights to our technologies, future revenue streams, research programs or drug product candidates or grant licenses on terms that may not be favorable to us, which will reduce our future returns and affect our future operating flexibility. If we are unable to raise additional funds through equity or debt financings when needed, we may be required to delay, limit, reduce or terminate our pipeline product development or commercialization efforts or grant rights to others to develop and market drug product candidates that we would otherwise prefer to develop and market ourselves.

Contractual Obligations and Commitments 
 
 License, Development and Collaboration Agreements 
 
 Alexion, AstraZeneca Rare Disease 
 
 On October 23, 2024, we executed a License Agreement with Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc., pursuant to which Alexion granted us an exclusive worldwide license for the development and commercialization of ALXN-1840, a drug candidate for Wilson disease. As initial upfront consideration for the License Agreement, we issued Alexion 387,329 shares (representing 9.9 of our outstanding shares) of our common stock and agreed to make an upfront cash payment of 4.0 million. We agreed to an anti-dilution provision that entitles Alexion to receive additional shares at no cost to maintain their 9.9 ownership until we raise the next 25.0 million of common equity capital, subject to a maximum of 705,015 Shares unless we obtain stockholder approval. We have given customary registration rights to Alexion and agreed to file a resale registration statement within forty-five (45) days of October 23, 2024. To date, we have issued an aggregate of 522,501 shares of our common stock to Alexion. 
 
 A cash payment of 1.0 million was paid at the time of signing and the remaining 3.0 million is due to be paid within ninety (90) days. Additionally, we are obligated to milestone payments of up to 94.0 million for achievement of regulatory approval and sales related milestones. In addition, we are obligated to pay tiered royalties based on net sales in the low to mid-double digit range. We have also given Alexion the right of first negotiation regarding any rights should we intend to sublicense ALXN-1840. Furthermore, we will have to pay Alexion a percentage in the mid-double digits of any sublicensing income received by us. As part of this license agreement, we will also owe a third-party single digit millions cash milestone payment upon regulatory approval in Europe and a single digit percentage royalty on net sales in Europe. 
 
 NorthStar Medical Radioisotopes, LLC ("NorthStar") 
 
 In June 2024, we entered into a long-term, non-exclusive master supply agreement with NorthStar underwhich Northstar will provide us with the therapeutic radioisotope actinium-225 ("Ac-225"). The original collaboration agreement was amended at that time to clarify certain economic terms and those related to jointly developed intellectual property rights for our MNPR-101 for radiopharmaceutical use. We have acquired these rights from NorthStar, together with certain broad, jointly developed intellectual property pertaining to MNPR-101, giving us full ownership and title to our lead MNPR-101 radiopharmaceutical platform. We will jointly share ownership of the filed patent application on the use of PCTA as a linker with Ac-225, which has shown that MNPR-101 has superior binding and yield with Ac-225 over the current industry-leading linker, DOTA. 
 
 XOMA Ltd. 
 
 Pursuant to a non-exclusive license agreement with XOMA Ltd. for the humanization technology used in the development of MNPR-101, we are obligated to pay XOMA Ltd. clinical, regulatory and sales milestones which could reach up to 14.925 million if we achieve all milestones for MNPR-101. The agreement does not require the payment of sales royalties. There can be no assurance that we will achieve any milestones. As of October 31, 2024, we had not reached any milestones and had not been required to pay XOMA Ltd. any funds under this license agreement. The first milestone payment is payable upon first dosing of a human patient in a Phase 2 clinical trial. We are currently conducting a Phase 1 clinical trial and cannot reliably predict when we will be able to commence a Phase 2 clinical trial, if at all. 
 
 Service Providers 
 
 In the normal course of business, we contract with service providers to assist in the performance of R D, including drug product manufacturing, process development, clinical and preclinical development, and G A including financial strategy, audit, tax and legal support. We can elect to discontinue the work under these agreements at any time. We could also enter into collaborative research and development, contract research, manufacturing and supplier agreements in the future, which may require upfront payments and/or long-term commitments of cash. 
 
 Office Lease 
 
 We are currently leasing on a month-to-month basis office space for our executive headquarters at 1000 Skokie Blvd., in the Village of Wilmette, Illinois for 4,238 per month. 
 
 Legal Contingencies 
 
 We are currently not, and to date have never been, a party to any adverse material legal proceedings.

Table of Contents 

Indemnification 
 
 In the normal course of business, we enter into contracts and agreements that contain a variety of representations and warranties and provide for general indemnification. Our exposure under these agreements is unknown because it involves claims that may be made against us in the future, but that have not yet been made. To date, we have not paid any claims or been required to defend any action related to our indemnification obligations. However, we may record charges in the future as a result of these indemnification obligations. 
 
 In accordance with our Second Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation, Amended and Restated Bylaws and the indemnification agreements entered into with each officer and non-employee director, we have indemnification obligations to our officers and non-employee directors for certain events or occurrences, subject to certain limits, while they are serving at our request in such capacity. There have been no claims to date. 
 
 Item 4. Controls and Procedures 
 
 Our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have provided certifications filed as Exhibits 31.1 and 31.2, respectively, and Exhibit 32.1. Such certifications should be read in conjunction with the information contained in this Item 4 for a more complete understanding of the matters covered by those certifications. 
 
 (a) Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 
 We carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of September 30, 2024, pursuant to Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act. Based on that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures, as of such date, were effective. 
 
 (b) Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 
 We have concluded that the condensed consolidated financial statements and other financial information included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q fairly present in all material respects our financial condition, results of operations and comprehensive loss and cash flows as of, and for, the periods presented. 
 
 There have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the three months ended September 30, 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 

PART II. OTHER INFORMATION 
 
 Item 1A. Risk Factors 
 
 Other than the additional risk factors below, there have been no material changes in information regarding our risk factors as described in Item 1A of our Annual Report on Form 10-K as filed with the SEC on March 28, 2024. 
 
 Our strategic focus on our radiopharmaceutical program could subject to us to concentrated risks. 
 
 As a result of our strategic decision to focus our efforts on our radiopharmaceutical program, a relatively novel approach to cancer imaging and treatment, and wind-down our camsirubicin and MNPR-202 programs, we face concentrated risks. Although the nature of the risks associated with our radiopharmaceutical program as described in Item 1A of our Annual Report on Form 10-K have not materially changed, the impacts from those risks should they be realized, or from perceptions of those risks in the market, could be more acute. In addition, our decision to wind-down our camsirubicin and MNPR-202 programs could adversely impact our stock price. Following our decision to wind-down our Validive program in 2023, our stock price suffered significant declines. We cannot predict what impact our decision to focus on our radiopharmaceutical program and wind-down our other programs will have on our stock price or financing prospects. 
 
 There are risks and uncertainties associated with our newly-acquired ALXN-1840 program. 
 
 Although a pivotal Phase 3 trial with ALXN-1840 has been completed, which met its primary endpoint as described elsewhere in this report, Alexion ended up terminating the ALXN-1840 program in Wilson disease based on review of results from Phase 2 mechanistic trials and discussions with regulatory authorities. The Phase 2 mechanism of action studies failed to meet their primary objectives of demonstrating net-negative copper balance in Wilson disease patients during short-term treatment with ALXN-1840 and reducing hepatic copper concentration after treatment with ALXN-1840. The decision not to progress the ALXN-1840 program in Wilson disease was not related to any safety signals. 
 
 In the near term, Monopar will be focusing on assembling a regulatory package and initiating discussions with the FDA. These activities will provide clarity on the additional capital needed for the program. 
 
 The regulatory approval process can be lengthy, expensive and uncertain. The FDA and other regulatory agencies around the world could require us to perform additional nonclinical and/or clinical studies to obtain ALXN-1840 approval, which we may not be able to raise the capital to complete or the results of which may not meet the level of clinical or statistical significance required by the FDA and other regulatory agencies. What the FDA and other regulatory agencies require for approval could have a material impact on the timelines and/or capital required to get ALXN-1840 approved. Even if approved, market adoption could be slower or lower than expected, especially given competition from existing therapies or new ones that get approved. We are planning to initially focus on Wilson disease patients with more severe symptoms, and this population could end up being smaller than we are anticipating. This population could be further be reduced in size if the FDA or other regulatory agencies give us a more narrow label than anticipated. Being an orphan indication, this could result in a very small eligible patient population. Additionally, if the currently filed patents do not end up providing sufficient protection, we will be heavily reliant on the orphan drug designation protections in the US and EU.
