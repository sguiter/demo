 in a privately held company that operates in our industry, with no additional investments thereafter. The Company concluded that it is not the primary beneficiary as it does not have the power to direct activities that most significantly impact economic performance. Prior to March 30, 2023 , the Company accounted for the investment under the equity method of accounting based on its ability to exercise significant influence, based on its representation on and the makeup of the investee's Board of Directors. 
 On March 30, 2023 , the Company no longer had representation on the investee's Board of Directors, and therefore determined that significant influence had been lost as of that date. As such, as of March 30, 2023 , the Company stopped accounting for the investment as an equity method investment and began to account for the investment under Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) Topic 321 ("ASC 321"), Investments - Equity Securities . As of September 30, 2024, the Company's ability to exercise significant influence continues to be restricted as it no longer has, or the ability to obtain, board representation and it has no means of participation in any decision making processes as the privately held investee's Board of Directors is closely held. 
 Because the investee is a privately held company, there is not a means to obtain a readily determinable fair value of the entity. The Company follows ASC 321 using the measurement alternative to measure investments in investees that do not have readily determinable fair value and over which the Company does not have significant influence. Under ASC 321, the initial carrying value of the investment is equal to the previous carrying amount of the investment under the equity method. The carrying amount of the investment is subsequently adjusted for any impairment or adjustments resulting from observable price changes in orderly transactions for identical or similar investments of the same issuer, if any. Dividends and distributions, if any, from the investee would be recognized in the period in which they are received and recorded in other income on the consolidated statement of operations. 
 The Company performs a qualitative assessment of whether the investment is impaired at each reporting date. If a qualitative assessment indicates that the investment is impaired, the Company estimates the investment s fair value in accordance with the principles of ASC Topic 820 ASC 820 ), Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures. If the fair value is less than the investment s carrying value, the entity recognizes an impairment loss in earnings equal to the difference between the carrying value and fair value. On March 26, 2024, the investee completed an equity funding, which we concluded represented an orderly transaction for an identical equity security with no differences in rights and obligations. As a result, pursuant to the ASC 321 measurement alternative, we adjusted the carrying amount of our equity investment from as of December 31, 2023 to as of March 31, 2024, recognizing a gain of in earnings for the three months ended March 31, 2024, based on the observable transactional price of the identical equity security issued by the investee. 
 March 2023 Issuance of million of Convertible Senior Notes (the "Convertible Notes") - million Convertible Notes in March 2023 , the Company evaluated the debt instrument and its embedded features to determine if the contract or the embedded components of the contract qualified as a derivative that would be required to be separately accounted for in accordance with the relevant accounting literature.

 aggregate principal amount of convertible senior notes due 2028 (the Convertible Notes ). The Convertible Notes were issued in a private offering to qualified institutional buyers pursuant to Rule 144A under the Securities Act of 1933 , as amended (the Securities Act ). The net proceeds from the sale of the Convertible Notes were approximately after deducting offering and issuance costs related to the Convertible Notes and before the 2023 Capped Call transactions, as described below. 
 The Convertible Notes are our senior, unsecured obligations and accrue interest at a rate of per annum, payable semi-annually in arrears on April 1 and October 1 of each year, beginning on October 1, 2023 . The Convertible Notes will mature on April 1, 2028 unless earlier converted, redeemed or repurchased by us. Before January 3, 2028, noteholders will have the right to convert their Convertible Notes only under the following circumstances: (1) during any calendar quarter commencing after the calendar quarter ended on June 30, 2023 and only during such calendar quarter), if the last reported sale price of our common stock, par value per share (the "common stock"), for each of at least trading days (whether or not consecutive) during a period of consecutive trading days ending on, and including, the last trading day of the immediately preceding calendar quarter is greater than or equal to of the conversion price on each applicable trading day; (2) during the consecutive business day period immediately after any consecutive trading day period (the "measurement period") in which the trading price per 1,000 principal amount of notes, as determined following a request by a holder or holders of the Convertible Notes in the manner described in indenture pursuant to which the Convertible Notes were issued and are governed (the Indenture ), for each trading day of the measurement period, was less than of the product of the last reported sale price of our common stock and the conversion rate on each such trading day; (3) if we call any or all of the Convertible Notes for redemption, but only with respect to the convertible notes called (or deemed called) for redemption; or (4) upon the occurrence of specified corporate events (e.g., a fundamental change or the making of certain distributions). On or after January 3, 2028, until the close of business on the second scheduled trading day immediately preceding the maturity date, a holder may convert its Convertible Notes at any time, regardless of the foregoing circumstances. 
 As of March 31, 2024 and June 30, 2024, noteholders had the right to early convert under the early conversion feature, with such conversion right exercisable only during the respective subsequent quarter. No early conversions occurred as of September 30, 2024. As of September 30, 2024, noteholders again have the right to early convert under the early conversion feature, with such conversion right exercisable only during the fourth quarter of 2024. As of the date of this filing, no early conversions have occurred during the fourth quarter of 2024. 
 We will settle conversions by paying or delivering, as applicable, cash, shares of our common stock or a combination of cash and shares of our common stock, at our election. The initial conversion rate for the Convertible Notes is 14.3516 shares of common stock per 1,000 principal amount of Notes, which represents an initial conversion price of approximately per share of common stock. The conversion rate and conversion price are subject to customary adjustments upon the occurrence of certain events. In addition, in connection with a make-whole fundamental change (as defined in the Indenture), which shall include among other things the Company's delivery of a notice of redemption, the Company will, in certain circumstances, increase the conversion rate for a holder who elects to convert its notes in connection with such a corporate event or redemption, as the case may be. 
 We may not redeem the Convertible Notes prior to April 3, 2026. We may redeem for cash all or any portion of the Convertible Notes, at our option, on or after April 3, 2026 and on or before the th scheduled trading day immediately preceding the maturity date, if the last reported sale price of our common stock has been at least of the conversion price then in effect for each of at least trading days (whether or not consecutive) during the consecutive trading day period (including the last trading day of such period) ending on, and including, the trading day immediately preceding the date on which we send the notice of redemption, at a

 of the principal amount of the Convertible Notes to be redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid interest to, but excluding, the redemption date. However, we may not redeem less than all of the outstanding Convertible Notes unless at least million aggregate principal amount of Convertible Notes are outstanding and not called for redemption as of the time we send the related redemption notice. 
 Upon the occurrence of a fundamental change (as defined in the Indenture), holders may require the Company to repurchase for cash all or any portion of their Convertible Notes at a fundamental change repurchase price equal to of the principal amount of the Convertible Notes to be repurchased, plus accrued and unpaid additional interest, if any, to, but excluding, the fundamental change repurchase date. 
 The effective interest rate for the Convertible Notes is . Transaction costs of attributable to the issuance of the Convertible Notes were recorded as a direct deduction from the related debt liability in the Consolidated Balance Sheet and are amortized to interest expense over the term of the Convertible Notes using the effective interest method. 
 The Company measures the fair value of its Convertible Notes for disclosure purposes. The fair value is based on observable market prices for this debt, which is traded in less active markets and is therefore classified as a Level 2 fair value measurement.

 of the net proceeds from the Convertible Notes to enter into privately negotiated capped call transactions (collectively, the Capped Call Transactions with certain financial institutions. 
 The Capped Call Transactions are generally expected to reduce potential dilution to holders of our common stock upon any conversion of the Convertible Notes and/or offset any cash payments we are required to make in excess of the principal amount of the Convertible Notes upon conversion of the Convertible Notes in the event that the market price per share of our common stock is greater than the strike price of the Capped Call Transactions, with such reduction and/or offset subject to a cap. 
 The Capped Call Transactions have an initial cap price of approximately per share, which represents a premium of over the last reported sale price of our common stock of per share on March 15, 2023 , and is subject to certain adjustments under the terms of the Capped Call Transactions. Collectively, the Capped Call Transactions cover, initially, the number of shares of our common stock underlying the Convertible Notes, subject to anti-dilution adjustments substantially similar to those applicable to the Convertible Notes. 

Note 8 
 to , some of which include an option to extend the lease term for up to . Because the Company is not reasonably certain to exercise the renewal options on these lease arrangements, the options are not considered in determining the lease term and associated potential option payments are excluded from lease payments. The Company s leases generally do not include termination options for either party to the lease or restrictive financial or other covenants. 
 During the third quarter of 2023 , we also entered into a finance lease agreement for manufacturing equipment with an initial term of , which includes an option to extend the lease term for up to , which the Company is not reasonably certain to exercise. The agreement did not include termination options for either party to the lease or restrictive financial or other covenants. In connection with the manufacturing equipment lease, which is a new asset class, we elected the practical expedient to combine lease and non-lease components to determine the right of use asset and lease liability. 
 Weighted-average discount rate 
 As most of our leases do not provide an implicit rate, we use our incremental borrowing rate based on the information available at the commencement date to determine the present value of lease payments.

 Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 
 The following discussion summarizes the significant factors affecting our consolidated operating results, financial condition, liquidity and cash flows as of and for the periods presented below. The following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements and related notes in Item 1 and with the audited consolidated financial statements and the related notes included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 (our "Annual Report"). 
 In addition to historical information, this discussion and analysis contains forward-looking statements based on current expectations that involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions, such as our plans, objectives, expectations, and intentions. Our actual results and the timing of events may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of various factors, including those set forth in the section entitled "Forward-Looking Statements" in this report and in the section entitled "Risk Factors" in our Annual Report. 
 
 Overview 
 We started Freshpet with a single-minded mission to bring the power of real, fresh food to our dogs and cats. We were inspired by the rapidly growing view among pet owners that their dogs and cats are a part of their family, leading them to demand healthier pet food choices. Since Freshpet's inception in 2006, we have created a comprehensive business model to deliver wholesome pet food that pet parents can trust, and in the process we believe we have become one of the fastest growing pet food companies in North America. Our business model is difficult for others to replicate and we see significant opportunity for future growth by leveraging the unique elements of our business, including our brand, our product know-how, our Freshpet Kitchens, our refrigerated distribution, our Freshpet Fridges and our culture. 
 
 Components of our Results of Operations 
 Net Sales 
 Our net sales are derived from the sale of pet food products that are sold to retailers through broker and distributor arrangements. Our products are sold to consumers through a fast-growing network of company-owned branded refrigerators, known as Freshpet Fridges, located in our customers stores. We continue to roll out Freshpet Fridges at leading retailers across North America and parts of Europe and have installed Freshpet Fridges in approximately 27,838 retail stores as of September 30, 2024. Our products are sold under the Freshpet brand name with ingredients, packaging and labeling customized by class of retail. Sales are recorded net of discounts, returns and promotional allowances. 
 Our net sales growth is driven by the following key factors: 
 Increasing sales velocity from the average Freshpet Fridge due to increasing awareness, trial and adoption of Freshpet products and innovation. Our investments in marketing and advertising help to drive awareness and trial at each point of sale. 
 Increasing penetration of Freshpet Fridge locations in major classes of retail, including Grocery, Mass, International, Digital, Pet Specialty, and Club. The impact of new Freshpet Fridge installations on our net sales varies by retail class and depends on numerous factors including store traffic, refrigerator size, placement within the store, and proximity to other stores that carry our products. 
 Consumer trends including growing pet ownership, pet humanization and a focus on health and wellness. 
 At times we increase our sales price to offset any adverse movement in input costs.

Table of Contents 

 Gross Profit 
 Our gross profit is net of costs of goods sold, which include the costs of product manufacturing, product ingredients, packaging materials and inbound freight, as well as depreciation and amortization and non-cash share-based compensation. 
 We expect to continue to mitigate any adverse movement in input costs through a combination of cost management and price increases. 
 Selling, General and Administrative Expenses 
 Our selling, general and administrative expenses consist of the following: 
 Outbound freight. We use a third-party logistics provider for outbound freight that ships directly to retailers as well as third-party distributors. 
 Marketing advertising. Our marketing and advertising expenses primarily consist of national television media, digital marketing, social media and grass roots marketing to drive brand awareness. These expenses may vary from quarter to quarter depending on the timing of our marketing and advertising campaigns. Our Feed the Growth initiative focuses on growing the business through increased marketing investments. 
 Freshpet Fridge operating costs. Freshpet Fridge operating costs consist of repair costs and depreciation. The purchase and installation costs for new Freshpet Fridges are capitalized and depreciated over the estimated useful life. All new refrigerators are covered by a manufacturer warranty for three years. We subsequently incur maintenance and freight costs for repairs and refurbishments handled by third-party service providers. 
 Research development. Research and development costs consist of expenses to develop and test new products. The costs are expensed as incurred. 
 Brokerage. We use third-party brokers to assist with monitoring our products at the point-of-sale as well as representing us at headquarters for various customers. These brokers visit our retail customers store locations to ensure items are appropriately stocked and maintained. 
 Share-based compensation . We account for all share-based compensation payments issued to employees, directors and non-employees using a fair value method. Accordingly, share-based compensation expense is measured based on the estimated fair value of the awards on the grant date using the Black-Scholes Merton option-pricing model. We recognize compensation expense for the portion of the award that is ultimately expected to vest over the period during which the recipient renders the required services to us using the straight-line single option method. 
 Other general administrative costs. Other general and administrative costs include non-plant personnel salaries and benefits, as well as corporate general administrative costs. 
 Income Taxes 
 We had federal net operating loss NOL carry forwards of approximately 420.3 million as of December 31, 2023, of which approximately 175.4 million, generated in 2017 and prior, will expire between 2025 and 2037. The NOLs generated from 2018 through 2023, of approximately 244.9 million, will have an indefinite carryforward period but can generally only be used to offset 80 of taxable income in any particular year. We may be subject to certain limitations in our annual utilization of NOL carry forwards to off-set future taxable income pursuant to Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code, which could result in NOLs expiring unused. At December 31, 2023, we had approximately 312.8 million of state NOLs, which expire between 2024 and 2043, and had 20.7 million of foreign NOLs in the United Kingdom which do not expire. At December 31, 2023, we had a full valuation allowance against our net deferred tax assets as the realization of such assets was not considered more likely than not.

 Net Sales 
 The following table sets forth net sales by class of retailer:

 Net sales increased 52.7 million, or 26.3 , to 253.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to 200.6 million in the same period in the prior year. The 52.7 million increase in net sales was driven by growth in the Grocery, Mass, International, and Digital channel of 41.1 million, with the remaining 
 25 

Table of Contents 

 growth in the Pet Specialty and Club channel. The net sales increase was primarily driven by volume gains of 26.1 . 
 Gross Profit 
 Gross profit was 102.2 million, or 40.4 as a percentage of net sales, for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 66.3 million, or 33.0 as a percentage of net sales, in the prior year period. The increase in gross profit as a percentage of net sales was primarily due to lower input costs and reduced quality costs. For the three months ended September 30, 2024, Adjusted Gross Profit was 117.7 million, or 46.5 as a percentage of net sales, compared to 80.6 million, or 40.2 as a percentage of net sales, in the prior year period. 
 See Non-GAAP Financial Measures for how we define Adjusted Gross Profit, a reconciliation of Adjusted Gross Profit to gross profit, the closest comparable U.S. GAAP measure, certain limitations of Non-GAAP measures and why management has included such Non-GAAP measures. 
 Selling, General and Administrative Expenses 
 Selling, general and administrative expenses ("SG A") were 90.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 73.4 million in the prior year period. As a percentage of net sales, SG A decreased to 35.7 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 36.6 in the prior year period. The decrease of 90 basis points in SG A as a percentage of net sales was mainly a result of reduced logistics costs as a percentage of net sales and the non-recurring charges in the prior year, offset by increased media as a percentage of net sales, higher share-based compensation and increased variable compensation accrual. 
 Adjusted SG A for the three months ended September 30, 2024, was 74.2 million, or 29.3 as a percentage of net sales, compared to 57.4 million, or 28.6 as a percentage of net sales, in the prior year period. 
 See Non-GAAP Financial Measures for how we define Adjusted SG A, a reconciliation of Adjusted SG A to SG A, the closest comparable U.S. GAAP measure, certain limitations of Non-GAAP measures and why management has included such Non-GAAP measures. 
 Income (Loss) from Operations 
 As a result of the factors discussed above, income from operations increased by 19.0 million to an income from operations of 11.9 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to a loss from operations of 7.1 million for the same period in the prior year. 
 Interest and Other Income, net 
 The Company recorded interest and other income, net of 3.0 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 as a result of interest income generated from cash and cash equivalents as compared to 4.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. 
 Interest Expense 
 Interest expense decreased 1.2 million to 2.9 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to 4.1 million for the same period in the prior year. The decrease was primarily driven by a 1.2 million decrease in interest expense on our Convertible Notes due to an increase in capitalized interest compared to prior period. 
 Net Income (Loss) 
 Net income increased 19.1 million to 11.9 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to a net loss of 7.2 million for the same period in the prior year due to contribution from higher sales, improved gross margin, and reduced logistics costs as a percentage of net sales, partially offset by increased SG A expenses.

Adjusted EBITDA 
 Adjusted EBITDA was 43.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 23.2 million in the prior year period. The increase in Adjusted EBITDA was a result of increased Adjusted Gross Profit, partially offset by higher Adjusted SG A expenses.

The 161.0 million increase in net sales was driven by growth in the Grocery, Mass, International and Digital channel of 122.8 million, with the remaining growth in Pet Specialty and Club channel. The net sales increase was primarily driven by volume gains of 28.2 . 
 Gross Profit 
 Gross profit was 284.4 million, or 39.9 as a percentage of net sales, for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 176.3 million, or 32.0 as a percentage of net sales, in the prior year period. The increase in gross profit as a percentage of net sales was primarily due to lower input costs and reduced quality costs. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, Adjusted Gross Profit was 327.2 million, or 45.9 as a percentage of net sales, compared to 218.1 million, or 39.5 as a percentage of net sales, in the prior year period. 
 Selling, General and Administrative Expenses 
 Selling, general and administrative expenses ("SG A") were 265.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 221.6 million in the prior year period. As a percentage of net sales, SG A decreased to 37.3 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 40.2 in the prior year period. The decrease of 290 basis points in SG A as a percentage of net sales was mainly a result of reduced logistics costs and media as a percentage of net sales and the non-recurring charges in the prior year, offset by higher share-based compensation and increased variable compensation accrual. 
 Adjusted SG A for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, was 218.0 million, or 30.6 as a percentage of net sales, compared to 182.9 million, or 33.2 as a percentage of net sales, in the prior year period.

 Income (Loss) from Operations 
 As a result of the factors discussed above, income from operations increased by 64.0 million to an income from operations of 18.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to a loss from operations of 45.3 million for the same period in the prior year. 
 Interest and Other Income, net 
 The Company recorded interest and other income, net of 9.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, as a result of interest income generated from cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments. 
 Interest Expense 
 Interest expense decreased 1.9 million to 8.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to 10.6 million for the same period in the prior year. The decrease was primarily driven by the termination of our Credit Agreement in the prior year period resulting in the write-off of unamortized fees of 2.5 million, which were recorded to interest expense, and a 0.2 million decrease (net of capitalized interest) as a result of interest incurred on our Convertible Notes compared to interest incurred in the prior year period, partially offset by a 1.1 million increase related to the interest on our finance lease liability. 
 Gain on Equity Investment 
 The 9.9 million gain on equity investment for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, resulted from the change in fair value of the Company's equity interest in a privately held company, as discussed in Note 1 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies of our (unaudited) condensed consolidated financial statements. 
 Net Income (Loss) 
 Net income increased 77.7 million to net income of 28.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to a net loss of 48.9 million for the same period in the prior year due to contribution from higher sales, improved gross margin, reduced logistics costs as a percentage of net sales, and gain on equity investment, partially offset by increased SG A expenses. 
 Adjusted EBITDA 
 Adjusted EBITDA was 109.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 35.2 million in the prior year period. The increase in Adjusted EBITDA was a result of increased Adjusted Gross Profit partially offset by higher Adjusted SG A expenses. 
 
 Non-GAAP Financial Measures 
 Freshpet uses the following non-GAAP financial measures in its financial communications. These non-GAAP financial measures should be considered as supplements to the U.S. GAAP reported measures, should not be considered replacements for, or superior to, the U.S. GAAP measures and may not be comparable to similarly named measures used by other companies.

 Such financial measures are not financial measures prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. We define Adjusted Gross Profit as Gross Profit before depreciation expense, non-cash share-based compensation, and

Table of Contents 

 loss on disposal of manufacturing equipment. We define Adjusted SG A as SG A expenses before depreciation and amortization expense, non-cash share-based compensation, implementation and other costs associated with the implementation of an ERP system, fees related to the Capped Call Transactions, loss on disposal of equipment, and advisory fees related to shareholder activism defense engagement. EBITDA represents net income (loss) plus interest expense net of interest income, income tax expense and depreciation and amortization expense. Adjusted EBITDA represents EBITDA plus loss on equity method investment, gain on equity investment, non-cash share-based compensation expense, implementation and other costs associated with the implementation of an ERP system, loss on disposal of property, plant and equipment, fees related to the Capped Call Transactions, and advisory fees related to activism engagement. 
 We believe that each of these non-GAAP financial measures provide additional metrics to evaluate our operations and, when considered with both our U.S. GAAP results and the reconciliation to the closest comparable U.S. GAAP measures, provides a more complete understanding of our business than could be obtained absent this disclosure. We use the non-GAAP financial measures, together with U.S. GAAP financial measures, such as net sales, gross profit margins and cash flow from operations, to assess our historical and prospective operating performance, to provide meaningful comparisons of operating performance across periods, to enhance our understanding of our operating performance and to compare our performance to that of our peers and competitors. 
 Adjusted EBITDA is also an important component of internal budgeting and setting management compensation. 
 The non-GAAP financial measures are presented here because we believe they are useful to investors in assessing the operating performance of our business without the effect of non-cash items, and other items as detailed herein. The non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered in isolation or as alternatives to net income (loss), income (loss) from operations or any other measure of financial performance calculated and prescribed in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Neither EBITDA nor Adjusted EBITDA should be considered a measure of discretionary cash available to us to invest in the growth of our business. Our non-GAAP financial measures may not be comparable to similarly titled measures in other organizations because other organizations may not calculate non-GAAP financial measures in the same manner as we do. 
 Our presentation of the non-GAAP financial measures should not be construed as an inference that our future results will be unaffected by the expenses that are excluded from that term or by unusual or non-recurring items. We recognize that the non-GAAP financial measures have limitations as analytical financial measures. For example, the non-GAAP financial measures do not reflect: 
 our capital expenditures or future requirements for capital expenditures; 
 the interest expense, or the cash requirements necessary to service interest expense or principal payments associated with indebtedness; 
 depreciation and amortization, which are non-cash charges, although the assets being depreciated and amortized will likely have to be replaced in the future, nor any cash requirements for such replacements; and 
 changes in our cash requirements for our working capital needs. 
 Additionally, Adjusted EBITDA excludes (i) non-cash share-based compensation expense, which is and will remain a key element of our overall long-term incentive compensation package, and (ii) certain costs essential to our sales growth and strategy. Adjusted EBITDA also excludes certain cash charges resulting from matters we consider not to be indicative of our ongoing operations. Other companies in our industry may calculate the non-GAAP financial measures differently than we do, limiting their usefulness as comparative measures. 
 The following table provides a reconciliation of EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA to net income (loss), the most directly comparable financial measure presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP:

 (a) Includes true-ups to share-based compensation expense compared to prior periods. We have certain outstanding share-based awards with performance-based vesting conditions that require the achievement of certain Adjusted EBITDA and/or Net Sales targets as a condition of vesting. At each reporting period, we reassess the probability of achieving the performance criteria and the performance period required to meet those targets. When the probability of achieving such performance conditions changes, the compensation cost previously recorded is adjusted as needed. When such performance conditions are deemed to be improbable of achievement, the compensation cost previously recorded is reversed. 
 (b) Represents costs associated with the implementation of an ERP system. 
 (c) Represents fees associated with the Capped Call Transactions.

 Three Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 2024 2023 (Dollars in thousands) SG A expenses 90,338 73,371 265,734 221,638 Depreciation and amortization expense 5,512 4,452 15,967 12,043 Non-cash share-based compensation (a) 10,498 5,511 31,411 16,256 Loss on disposal of equipment 129 226 362 688 Enterprise Resource Planning (b) 212 1,550 Capped Call Transactions fees (c) 113 Shareholder activism defense engagement (d) 5,548 8,177 Organization changes (e) (67) Adjusted SG A Expenses 74,199 57,422 217,994 182,878 Adjusted SG A Expenses as a of Net Sales 29.3 28.6 30.6 33.2 
 (a) Includes true-ups to share-based compensation expense compared to prior periods. We have certain outstanding share-based awards with performance-based vesting conditions that require the achievement of certain Adjusted EBITDA and/or Net Sales targets as a condition of vesting. At each reporting period, we reassess the probability of achieving the performance criteria and the performance period required to meet those targets. When the probability of achieving such performance conditions changes, the compensation cost previously recorded is adjusted as needed. When such performance conditions are deemed to be improbable of achievement, the compensation cost previously recorded is reversed. 
 (b) Represents costs associated with the implementation of an ERP system. 
 (c) Represents fees associated with the Capped Call Transactions. 
 (d) Represents advisory fees related to shareholder activism defense engagement. 
 (e) Represents a true-up to transition costs related to the organization changes designed to support growth, including several changes in organizational structure designed to enhance capabilities and support long-term growth objectives. 

Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 To meet our capital needs, we issued approximately 402.5 million in convertible notes in March 2023 (the Convertible Notes ), used 66.2 million of the proceeds to enter into capped call transactions, and used 11.0 million of the proceeds on debt issuance related costs. Further, on March 13, 2023, in connection with the proposed offering of the Convertible Notes, the Company notified City National Bank of Freshpet's intent to terminate the Credit Agreement, and such termination became effective as of March 15, 2023 (the "Termination Date"). The Company had no borrowings outstanding under the Credit Agreement as of the Termination Date. 
 We expect to make future capital expenditures in connection with the completion of our planned development of Freshpet Kitchens Ennis Phase 2 and 3. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we spent approximately 128.8 million of capital to meet our capacity needs as well as recurring capital expenditures. We expect to spend an additional 51.2 million in the remainder of fiscal 2024. 
 We expect to rely on our current and future cash flow from operations, may issue additional debt, and/or raise capital through our access to capital markets, if appropriate. Our ability to obtain additional funding will be subject to various factors, including general economic and market conditions, our operating performance, the 
 31 

Table of Contents 

 market s perception of our growth potential, lender sentiment and our ability to incur additional debt in compliance with other contractual restrictions. 
 Our ability to make future minimum interest payments on the Convertible Notes, to refinance any indebtedness and to fund any necessary expenditures for our growth will depend on our ability to generate cash in the future. If our business does not achieve the levels of profitability or generate the amount of cash that we anticipate or if we expand faster than anticipated, we may need to seek additional debt or equity financing to operate and expand our business. Future third-party financing may not be available on favorable terms or at all. 
 Our primary cash needs, in addition to our plant expansions, are for purchasing ingredients, operating expenses, marketing expenses and capital expenditures to procure Freshpet Fridges. We believe that cash and cash equivalents, expected cash flow from operations, amounts previously raised through the issuance of the Convertible Notes and our ability to access the capital markets, if appropriate, are adequate to fund our debt service requirements, operating and finance lease obligations, capital expenditures and working capital obligations for the foreseeable future. We believe our sources of liquidity and capital will be sufficient to finance our continued operations, growth strategy and additional expenses we expect to incur for at least the next twelve months. However, our ability to continue to meet these requirements and obligations will depend on, among other things, our ability to achieve anticipated levels of revenue and cash flow from operations and our ability to manage costs and working capital successfully. Additionally, our cash flow generation ability is subject to general economic factors, including but not limited to increasing interest rates and inflation, financial, competitive, legislative and regulatory factors and other factors that are beyond our control. We cannot assure you that our business will generate cash flow from operations in an amount sufficient to enable us to fund our liquidity needs. Expanding certain of our Freshpet Kitchens primarily comprises our material future cash requirement. However, our capital requirements, including our cash requirements, may vary materially from those currently planned if, for example, our revenues do not reach expected levels, or we have to incur unforeseen capital expenditures and make investments to maintain our competitive position. If this is the case, we may seek alternative financing, such as issuing additional debt or equity securities, and we cannot assure you that we will be able to do so on favorable terms, if at all. Moreover, if we issue new debt securities, the debt holders would have rights senior to common stockholders to make claims on our assets, and the terms of any debt could restrict our operations, including our ability to pay dividends on our common stock. If we issue additional equity or if the Convertible Notes are converted to common shares, existing stockholders may experience dilution, and such new securities could have rights senior to those of our common stock. These factors may make the timing, amount, terms and conditions of additional financing unattractive. Our inability to raise capital could impede our growth or otherwise require us to forego growth opportunities and could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
 The following table sets forth, for the periods indicated, our working capital: 
 September 30, 2024 December 31, 2023 (Dollars in thousands) Cash and cash equivalents 274,594 296,871 Accounts receivable, net of allowance for doubtful accounts 65,015 56,754 Inventories, net 72,791 63,238 Prepaid expenses 5,768 7,615 Other current assets 3,126 2,841 Accounts payable (35,481) (36,096) Accrued expenses (50,396) (49,816) Current operating lease liabilities (1,290) (1,312) Current finance lease liabilities (2,075) (1,998) Total Working Capital 332,052 338,097 
 Working capital consists of current assets net of current liabilities. Working capital decreased 6.0 million to 332.1 million as of September 30, 2024 compared with working capital of 338.1 million as of December 31, 2023. The decrease was primarily a result of a decrease of 22.3 million in cash and cash equivalents, a 
 32 

Table of Contents 

 decrease of 1.8 million in prepaid expenses, and an increase in accrued expenses of 0.6 million due to timing. The decrease was partially offset by an increase of 8.3 million in accounts receivable, an increase of 9.6 million in inventories, net, and a decrease of 0.6 in accounts payable as a result of timing. 
 We normally carry three to four weeks of finished goods inventory and less than 30 days of accounts receivable. 
 As of September 30, 2024, our capital resources consisted primarily of 274.6 million of cash and cash equivalents on hand. 
 As of December 31, 2023, our capital resources consisted primarily of 296.9 million of cash and cash equivalents on hand. 
 We expect to fund our ongoing operations and obligations with cash and cash equivalents and cash flow from operations. 
 The following table sets forth, for the periods indicated, our beginning balance of cash, net cash flows provided by (used in) operating, investing and financing activities and our ending balance of cash: 
 Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 (Dollars in thousands) 
 Cash at the beginning of period 296,871 132,735 Net cash provided by operating activities 103,919 38,968 Net cash used in investing activities (128,828) (161,642) Net cash provided by financing activities 2,632 328,046 Cash at the end of period 274,594 338,107 
 Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities 
 Net cash provided by operating activities consists primarily of net income (loss) adjusted for certain non-cash items (i.e., provision for loss on accounts receivable, loss on disposal of property, plant and equipment, share-based compensation, change in reserve for inventory obsolescence, depreciation and amortization, write-off and amortization of deferred financing costs and loan discount, change in operating lease right of use asset, loss on equity method investment, and gain on equity investment). 
 Net cash provided by operating activities of 103.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, was primarily attributed to: 
 113.4 million of net income, adjusted for reconciling non-cash items, which excludes 84.6 million of non-cash items related to 52.2 million of depreciation and amortization, 37.9 million of share-based compensation including amortization of warrants, 1.6 million of write-off and amortization of deferred financing costs and loan discount, 1.1 million of loss on disposal of property, plant and equipment, 0.7 million of a reserve for inventory obsolescence, 1.0 million of change in operating lease right of use asset, partially offset by 9.9 million of gain on equity investment. 
 
 This was partially offset by: 
 9.5 million decrease due to changes in operating assets and liabilities. The decrease was primarily due to the change in inventories, accounts receivable, other assets, operating lease liability, and prepaid expenses and other current assets, , partially offset by the change in accounts payable and accrued expenses. 
 Net cash provided by operating activities of 39.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, was primarily attributed to: 
 28.8 million of net income, adjusted for reconciling non-cash items, which excludes 77.7 million of non-cash items related to 45.4 million of depreciation and amortization, 25.0 million of share-based compensation including amortization of warrants, 3.5 million of write-off and amortization of deferred 
 33 

Table of Contents 

 financing costs and loan discount, 1.9 million of loss on investments in equity method investment, 1.2 million of change in operating lease right of use asset and 0.7 million of loss on disposal of property, plant and equipment. 
 
 10.2 million increase due to changes in operating assets and liabilities. The increase was primarily due to the change in accrued expenses, accounts receivable, and accounts payable, primarily offset by the change in other assets, operating lease liability, inventories, and prepaid expenses and other current assets, 
 Net Cash Used in Investing Activities 
 Net cash used in investing activities of 128.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, was primarily attributed to: 
 128.8 million of capital expenditures related to Freshpet Kitchens, plant recurring capital expenditures, expenditures relating to investment in fridges, and other capital spend. 
 Net cash used in investing activities of 161.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, was primarily attributed to: 
 161.6 million of capital expenditures related to Freshpet Kitchens, plant recurring capital expenditures, expenditures relating to investment in fridges, and other capital spend. 
 113.4 million purchase of short-term investments. 
 This was partially offset by: 
 113.4 million proceeds from maturities of short-term investments. 
 Net Cash Provided by Financing Activities 
 Net cash provided by financing activities of 2.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, was primarily attributed to:

 66.2 million for the purchase of a capped call option. 
 2.0 million for debt issuance costs.

 Critical Accounting Estimates 
 Our management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based on our financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States or ("U.S. GAAP"). The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, as well as the revenue and expenses incurred during the reported periods. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates and judgments, including those related to accrued expenses and share-based compensation. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not apparent from other sources. Changes in estimates are reflected in reported results for the period in which they become known. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. 
 There have been no material changes to our critical accounting estimates as compared to the critical accounting policies and estimates described in our Annual Report. 
 Recent Accounting Pronouncements 
 Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements: 
 See Note 1 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies of our (unaudited) condensed consolidated financial statements for additional information. 
 Standards Effective in Future Years: 
 We consider the applicability and impact of all Accounting Standards Updates (ASUs) issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB). ASUs not listed herein were assessed and determined to be either not applicable or are expected to have minimal impact to our consolidated financial statements. 
 
 Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risks 
 Interest Rate Risk 
 During period of rising interest rates, our cost of borrowing could increase, the fair value of our investments could be affected, and it could constrain the purchasing power of our customers. 
 Commodity Price and Inflation Risk 
 We purchase certain products and services that are affected by commodity prices and are, therefore, subject to price volatility caused by weather, market conditions, and other factors which are not considered predictable or within our control. In many cases, we believe we will be able to address material commodity cost increases by either increasing prices or reducing operating expenses. However, increases in commodity prices, without adjustments to pricing or reduction to operating expenses, could increase our operating costs as a percentage of our net sales. 
 Foreign Exchange Rates 
 Fluctuations in the currencies of countries where the Company operates outside the U.S. may impact our financial results. The Company is exposed to movements in the British pound sterling and Euro. The Statements of Financial Position of non-U.S. business units are translated into U.S. dollars using period-end exchange rates for assets and liabilities and weighted average exchange rates for revenues and expenses. The percentage of our consolidated revenue for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 recognized in Europe was less than 1 . 
 The Company may, from time to time, enter into forward exchange contracts to reduce the Company s exposure to foreign currency fluctuations of certain assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies. Historically, the foreign currency forward contracts have not been designated as hedges and, accordingly, any changes in 
 35

 their fair value are recognized on the Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income (Loss) in Interest and Other Income, net, and carried at their fair value in the Consolidated Balance Sheet with gains reported in prepaid expenses and other current assets and losses reported in accrued expenses. As of September 30, 2024, there were no forward contracts outstanding. 
 
 Item 4. Controls and Procedures 
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 Our management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, has evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act )), as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Based on such evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that as of such date our disclosure controls and procedures were effective. 
 Changes in Internal Control 
 There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting identified in management s evaluation pursuant to Rules 13a-15(d) or 15d-15(d) of the Exchange Act during the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q that materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 
 Limitations on Effectiveness of Controls and Procedures 
 Our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, believes that our disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting are designed to provide reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives and are effective at the reasonable assurance level. However, our management does not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures or our internal control over financial reporting will prevent all errors and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, have been detected. These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision making can be faulty, and that breakdowns can occur because of a simple error or mistake. Additionally, controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people or by management override of the controls. The design of any system of controls also is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions. Over time, controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or the degree of compliance with policies or procedures may deteriorate. Because of the inherent limitations in a cost-effective control system, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected.

 PART II OTHER INFORMATION 
 
 Item 1. Legal Proceedings

 Item 1A. Risk Factors 
 There have been no material changes to the risk factors previously reported under Part I, Item 1A. "Risk Factors" in our Annual Report. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial may materially affect our business, financial condition and/or operating results.
