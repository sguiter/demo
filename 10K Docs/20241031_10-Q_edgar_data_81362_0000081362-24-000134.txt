 Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations . 
 As used in this Report, the terms Quaker Houghton, the Company, we and our refer to Quaker Chemical Corporation (doing business as Quaker Houghton), its subsidiaries, and associated companies, unless the context otherwise requires. 
 
 Executive Summary 
 Quaker Houghton is the global leader in industrial process fluids. With a presence around the world, including operations in over 25 countries, our customers include thousands of the world s most advanced and specialized steel, aluminum, automotive, aerospace, offshore, container, mining, and metalworking companies. Our high-performing, innovative and sustainable solutions are backed by best-in-class technology, deep process knowledge, and customized services. Quaker Houghton is headquartered in Conshohocken, Pennsylvania, located near Philadelphia in the U.S. 
 Net sales in the third quarter of 2024 were 462.3 million, a decrease of 6 compared to 490.6 million in the third quarter of 2023. This was primarily driven by a decrease in selling price and product mix of approximately 4 , a decrease in sales volumes of 1 , and an unfavorable impact from foreign currency translation of 1 . The decrease in selling price and product mix was primarily attributable to the impact of our index-based customer contracts. The decline in sales volumes was primarily a result of a continuation of soft end market conditions compared to the prior year, primarily in the Americas and Europe, Middle East and Africa EMEA segments, partially offset by an increase in sales volumes in the Asia/Pacific segment, continued new business wins across all segments and a contribution from acquisitions in the EMEA and Asia/Pacific segments. 
 The Company generated net income in the third quarter of 2024 of 32.3 million, or 1.81 per diluted share, compared to net income of 33.7 million, or 1.87 per diluted share in the third quarter of 2023. Excluding non-recurring and non-core items in each period, the Company s third quarter 2024 non-GAAP net income and earnings per diluted share were 34.0 million and 1.89 compared to 36.9 million and 2.05, respectively, in the prior year. The decrease in current quarter earnings was primarily driven by lower net sales, partially offset by lower selling, general, and administrative expenses SG A and lower interest expense. The Company s current quarter adjusted EBITDA was 78.6 million compared to 84.4 million in the third quarter of 2023, primarily driven by lower net sales as described above. See the Non-GAAP Measures section of this Item below, as well as other items discussed in the Company s Consolidated Operations Review in the Operations section of this Item, below. 
 The Company s third quarter 2024 operating performance in each of its three reportable segments: (i) Americas; (ii) EMEA; and (iii) Asia/Pacific, reflects similar drivers to that of the Company s consolidated performance. Operating earnings for all three segments decreased compared to the prior year quarter, primarily driven by a decrease in net sales in the Americas and EMEA segments and a slight decline in operating margin in the Asia/Pacific segment. Additional details of each segment s operating performance are further discussed in the Company s Reportable Segments Review, in the Operations section of this Item, below. 
 Net cash flows provided by operating activities were 141.5 million in the first nine months of 2024 compared to 199.5 million in the first nine months of 2023. The lower operating cash flow year-over-year reflects an increase in the net cash outflows from working capital in the first nine months of 2024. The key drivers of the Company s operating cash flow and working capital are further discussed in the Company s Liquidity and Capital Resources section of this Item, below. 
 Overall, the Company s results in the third quarter of 2024 reflects the Company s continued execution on its financial and operational priorities despite softer end market conditions that have impacted the Company s customers and end markets. 
 
 Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 
 Our significant accounting policies are described in Management s Discussion and Analysis and Note 1 Significant Accounting Policies to the Consolidated Financial Statements in our 2023 Form 10-K. There have been no material changes to the critical accounting policies and estimates previously disclosed in its 2023 Form 10-K remain materially consistent. 
 
 Recently Issued Accounting Standards 
 See Note 3 of Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 1 of this Report for a discussion regarding recently issued accounting standards. 
 
 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 As of September 30, 2024, we had cash and cash equivalents of 212.1 million. Total cash and cash equivalents were 194.5 million as of December 31, 2023. The approximately 17.5 million increase in cash and cash equivalents was the net result of 141.5 million of cash provided by operating activities, offset by 67.0 million of cash used in financing activities, 55.8 million of cash used in investing activities and an unfavorable impact of foreign currency translation of approximately 1.1 million.

 Management s Discussion and Analysis 

 Net cash flows provided by operating activities were 141.5 million in the first nine months of 2024 compared to 199.5 million in the first nine months of 2023. The decrease in net operating cash flow year-over-year reflects higher cash outflows from working capital in 2024, driven by an outflow from Inventory due to timing of sales and orders and higher Accounts payable and accrued liabilities outflows due primarily to higher incentive compensation payments in the current year. 
 Net cash flows used in investing activities were 55.8 million in the first nine months of 2024 compared to 25.8 million in the first nine months of 2023. The increase in cash used in investing activities year-over-year is primarily the result of payments in the current year related to the acquisitions of the Sutai Group Sutai and I.K.V. Tribologie IKVT and its subsidiaries IKV ), partially offset by lower capital expenditures. See Note 2 of Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 1 of this Report for further information about business acquisitions. 
 Net cash flows used in financing activities were 67.0 million in the first nine months of 2024 compared to net cash flows used in financing activities of 150.5 million in the first nine months of 2023. The decrease in net cash outflows was primarily related to 30.5 million of net borrowings on the Company s revolving credit facility in the first nine months of 2024 compared to 112.8 million of net repayments in the first nine months of 2023. In addition, during the first nine months of 2024, the Company made payments of approximately 48.6 million to reduce its long-term debt, a 34.5 million, or 71 , increase compared to the prior year period. Also, the Company made payments of approximately 22.9 million for repurchases of its common stock under its share repurchase program during the first nine months of 2024. The Company also paid 24.5 million of cash dividends during the first nine months of 2024, a 1.1 million, or 5 , increase compared to the prior year period. 
 During June 2022, the Company, and its wholly owned subsidiary, Quaker Houghton B.V., as borrowers, Bank of America, N.A., as administrative agent, U.S. dollar swing line lender and letter of credit issuer, Bank of America Europe Designated Active Company, as Euro Swing Line Lender, certain guarantors and other lenders entered into an amendment to its primary credit facility. The amended credit facility (the Credit Facility established (A) a 150.0 million Euro equivalent senior secured term loan (the Euro Term Loan ), (B) a 600.0 million senior secured term loan (the U.S. Term Loan ), and (C) a 500.0 million senior secured revolving credit facility (the Revolver ), each maturing in June 2027. The Company has the right to increase the amount of the Credit Facility by an aggregate amount not to exceed the greater of 300.0 million or 100 of Consolidated EBITDA, subject to certain conditions including the agreement to provide financing by any lender providing such increase. The Credit Facility contains affirmative and negative covenants, financial covenants and events of default. Financial covenants contained in the Credit Facility include a consolidated interest coverage ratio test and a consolidated net leverage ratio test. As of September 30, 2024, the Company was in compliance with all of the Credit Facility covenants. Refer to the description of the Company s primary Credit Facility in Note 19 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in its 2023 Form 10-K. 
 As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 , the Company had Credit Facility borrowings outstanding of 728.1 million and 744.5 million, respectively. The Company s other debt obligations are primarily industrial development bonds, bank lines of credit and municipality-related loans, which totaled 12.6 million as of September 30, 2024 and 11.1 million as of December 31, 2023 . Total unused capacity under these arrangements, excluding the Credit Facility, as of September 30, 2024 was approximately 35 million . The Company s total net debt as of September 30, 2024, which consists of total borrowings of 740.6 million less cash and cash equivalents of 212.1 million, was approximately 528.6 million . 
 The weighted average variable interest rates incurred on the outstanding borrowings under the Credit Facility during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 were approximately 6.1 and 6.2 , respectively. As of September 30, 2024, the interest rate on the outstanding borrowings under the Credit Facility was approximately 5.8 . As part of the Credit Facility, in addition to paying interest on the outstanding principal, the Company is also required to pay an annual commitment fee ranging from 0.150 to 0.275 related to unutilized commitments under the Revolver, depending on the Company s consolidated net leverage ratio. The Company had unused capacity under the Revolver of approximately 436 million, which is net of bank letters of credit of approximately 3 million, as of September 30, 2024. 
 In order to manage the Company s exposure to variable interest rate risk associated with the Credit Facility, in the first quarter of 2023, the Company entered into 300.0 million notional amounts of three-year interest rate swaps to convert a portion of the Company s variable rate borrowings into an average fixed rate obligation of 3.64 plus an applicable margin as provided in the Credit Facility based on the Company s consolidated net leverage ratio. As of September 30, 2024, the aggregate interest rate on the swaps, including the fixed base rate plus the applicable margin, was approximately 4.9 . See Note 17 of Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 1 of this Report for further information.

 Management s Discussion and Analysis 

 In connection with executing the original credit facility in 2019 and the amended Credit Facility during the second quarter of 2022, the Company capitalized certain third-party and creditor debt issuance costs. Costs attributed to the Euro Term Loan and U.S. Term Loan were recorded as a direct offset of Long-term debt on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet. Costs attributed to the Revolver were recorded within Other assets on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet. These capitalized costs are collectively being amortized into Interest expense over the five-year term of the Credit Facility. As of September 30, 2024, the Company had 1.2 million of debt issuance costs recorded as an offset of Long-term debt on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets and 2.6 million of debt issuance costs recorded within Other assets on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet. Comparatively, as of December 31, 2023, the Company had 1.5 million of debt issuance costs recorded as an offset of Long-term debt on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets and 3.3 million of debt issuance costs recorded within Other assets on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet in Item 1 of this Report. 
 The Company uses foreign exchange forward contracts to economically hedge the impact of the variability in exchange rates on certain assets and/or liabilities denominated in certain foreign currencies. During the first nine months of 2024, the Company entered into and settled forward contracts resulting in other expense of 2.0 million as compared to 2.1 million of other income during the first nine months of 2023 . See Note 17 of Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 1 of this Report for further information . 
 During 2022, the Company s management initiated a global cost and optimization program to improve its cost structure and drive a more profitable and productive organization. The Company has achieved its initial full run-rate cost savings goal from the global cost and optimization program of approximately 20 million. The program is expected to be substantially complete by the end of the first quarter of 2025. The Company recognized Restructuring and related charges of 4.8 million and 6.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, and 2023, respectively, under this program. The Company made cash payments related to the settlement of restructuring liabilities under the program during the first nine months of 2024 of approximately 6.4 million compared to 7.9 million in the first nine months of 2023. The Company expects total one-time cash costs of this program to be approximately 1 to 1.5 times annualized savings. See Note 7 of Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 1 of this Report for further information. 
 As of September 30, 2024, the Company s gross liability for uncertain tax positions, including interest and penalties, was 20.4 million. The Company cannot determine a reliable estimate of the timing of cash flows by period related to its uncertain tax position liability. However, should the entire liability be paid, the amount of the payment may be reduced by up to 6.9 million as a result of offsetting benefits in other tax jurisdictions. 
 As previously disclosed in the Company s 2023 Form 10-K, on February 28, 2024, the Board of Directors of the Company approved a new share repurchase program 2024 Share Repurchase Program ), authorizing the Company to repurchase up to an aggregate of 150 million of the Company s outstanding common stock and replacing the prior share repurchase program. The 2024 Share Repurchase Program was effective immediately and has no expiration date. The Company made certain repurchases under the 2024 Repurchase Program during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as mentioned above. See Item 2 within Part II of this Report for further information. 
 The Company previously disclosed in its 2023 Form 10-K that one of its North American production facilities experienced an electrical fire in 2021 that resulted in property damage and the temporary shutdown of production. The Company and its insurance carrier reviewed the impact of the electrical fire on the production facility s operations as it relates to a potential business interruption insurance claim. In July 2024, the Company and its insurance carrier settled this claim for 1.0 million. 
 The Company believes that its existing cash, anticipated cash flows from operations and available liquidity will be sufficient to support its operating requirements and fund its business objectives for at least the next twelve months, including but not limited to, payments of dividends to shareholders, share repurchases, capital expenditures, other growth opportunities (including potential acquisitions), pension plan contributions, implementing actions to achieve the Company s sustainability goals and other potential known or anticipated contingencies. The Company also believes it has sufficient additional liquidity to support its operating requirements and to fund its business obligations for the period beyond the next twelve months, including the aforementioned items which are expected to recur annually, as well as future principal and interest payments on the Company s Credit Facility, tax obligations and other long-term liabilities. The Company s liquidity is affected by many factors, some based on normal operations of our business and others related to the impact of the pandemic and other global events on our business and on global economic conditions as well as industry uncertainties, which we cannot predict. We also cannot predict economic conditions and industry downturns or the timing, strength or duration of recoveries. We may seek, as we believe appropriate, additional debt or equity financing that would provide capital for corporate purposes, working capital funding, additional liquidity needs or to fund future growth opportunities, including possible acquisitions and organic investments. The timing and amount of potential capital requirements cannot be determined at this time and will depend on a number of factors, including the actual and projected demand for our products, specialty chemical industry conditions, competitive factors, and the condition of financial markets, among others.

 Non-GAAP Measures 
 The information in this Form 10-Q includes non-GAAP financial information that includes EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA margin, non-GAAP operating income, non-GAAP operating margin, taxes on income before equity in net income of associated companies adjusted, non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP earnings per diluted share. The Company believes these non-GAAP financial measures provide meaningful supplemental information as they enhance a reader s understanding of the Company s financial performance and facilitate a comparison among fiscal periods, as the non-GAAP financial measures exclude items that are not considered indicative of future operating performance or not considered core to the Company s operations. Non-GAAP results are presented for supplemental informational purposes only and should not be considered a substitute for the financial information presented in accordance with GAAP. In addition, our definitions of EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA margin, non-GAAP operating income, non-GAAP operating margin, taxes on income before equity in net income of associated companies adjusted, non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP earnings per diluted share, as discussed and reconciled below to the most comparable respective GAAP measures, may not be comparable to similarly named measures reported by other companies. 
 The Company presents EBITDA, which is calculated as net income attributable to the Company before depreciation and amortization, interest expense, net, and taxes on income before equity in net income of associated companies. The Company also presents adjusted EBITDA, which is calculated as EBITDA plus or minus certain items that are not considered indicative of future operating performance or not considered core to the Company s operations. In addition, the Company presents non-GAAP operating income, which is calculated as operating income plus or minus certain items that are not considered indicative of future operating performance or not considered core to the Company s operations. Adjusted EBITDA margin and non-GAAP operating margin are calculated as the percentage of adjusted EBITDA and non-GAAP operating income to consolidated net sales, respectively. The Company believes these non-GAAP measures provide transparent and useful information and are widely used by investors, analysts, and peers in our industry as well as by management in assessing the operating performance of the Company on a consistent basis. 
 Additionally, the Company presents non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP earnings per diluted share as additional performance measures. Non-GAAP net income is calculated as adjusted EBITDA, defined above, less depreciation and amortization, interest expense, net, and taxes on income before equity in net income of associated companies, in each case adjusted, as applicable, for any depreciation, amortization, interest or tax impacts resulting from the non-core items identified in the reconciliation of net income attributable to the Company to adjusted EBITDA. Non-GAAP earnings per diluted share is calculated as non-GAAP net income per diluted share as accounted for under the two-class share method. The Company believes that non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP earnings per diluted share provide transparent and useful information and are widely used by investors, analysts, and peers in our industry as well as by management in assessing the operating performance of the Company on a consistent basis. 
 Certain of the prior period non-GAAP financial measures presented in the following tables have been adjusted to conform with current period presentation. The following tables reconcile the Company s non-GAAP financial measures (unaudited) to their most directly comparable GAAP (unaudited) financial measures (dollars in thousands unless otherwise noted, except per share amounts):

 Consolidated Operations Review Comparison of the Third Quarter of 2024 with the Third Quarter of 2023 
 Net sales were 462.3 million in the third quarter of 2024 compared to 490.6 million in the third quarter of 2023. The net sales decrease of 28.2 million, or 6 , year-over-year reflects a decrease in selling price and product mix of approximately 4 , a decline in sales volumes of approximately 1 , and an unfavorable impact from foreign currency translation of 1 . The decrease in selling price and product mix was primarily attributable to the impact of our index-based customer contracts. The decline in sales volumes was primarily the result of a continuation of soft end market conditions, primarily in the Americas and EMEA segments, partially offset by an increase in sales volumes in the Asia/Pacific segment, continued new business wins across all segments and a contribution from acquisitions in the EMEA and Asia/Pacific segments. 
 Cost of goods sold COGS was 289.7 million in the third quarter of 2024 compared to 307.3 million in the third quarter of 2023, a decrease of approximately 17.6 million, or 6 . The decrease in COGS reflects lower spend on the decline in current year sales volumes and a decrease in the Company s global raw material costs. 
 Gross profit was 172.5 million in the third quarter of 2024 compared to 183.3 million in the third quarter of 2023, a decrease of 10.8 million, or 6 primarily due to the decline in sales as mentioned above. The Company s reported gross margin in the third quarter of 2024 was 37.3 compared to 37.4 in the third quarter of 2023. 
 SG A expense was 118.2 million in the third quarter of 2024 compared to 122.8 million in the third quarter of 2023, a decrease of approximately 4.7 million, or 4 , driven by lower incentive compensation and strategic planning costs, offset by an increase in SG A relating to the IKV and Sutai acquisitions. 
 The Company incurred Restructuring and related charges of 2.6 million and 1.0 million during the third quarter of 2024 and 2023, respectively, related to reductions in headcount and facility closure costs under the Company s restructuring program. See the Non-GAAP Measures section of this Item above and Note 7 of Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements, which appears in Item 1 of this report, for additional information. 
 Operating income in the third quarter of 2024 was 51.7 million compared to 59.5 million in the third quarter of 2023. Excluding non-recurring and non-core expenses that are not indicative of the future operating performance of the Company described in the Non-GAAP Measures section of this Item, above, the Company s non-GAAP operating income was 54.2 million in the third quarter of 2024 and 61.8 million in the third quarter of 2023. The decrease was primarily due to lower sales, partially offset by lower SG A expenses, as described above. 
 The Company had Other income, net of 0.8 million in the third quarter of 2024 as compared to Other expense, net of 2.7 million in the third quarter of 2023. Both the third quarter of 2024 and 2023 included foreign exchange transaction losses, which were higher in the prior year. The third quarter of 2024 also included a business interruption insurance recovery of 1.0 million, other income from non-income tax credits of 0.7 million and other income of 0.4 million relating to adjustments to the earnout provisions for the Sutai acquisition. 
 Interest expense, net, was 10.3 million in the third quarter of 2024 compared to 12.8 million in the third quarter of 2023, a decrease of approximately 2.4 million, primarily as a result of decreases in interest rates and lower outstanding borrowings.

 Management s Discussion and Analysis 

 The Company s effective tax rates for the third quarters of 2024 and 2023 were 28.9 and 30.9 , respectively. The Company s effective tax rate for the third quarter of 2024 was largely driven by the mix of pre-tax earnings, withholding taxes, and changes in uncertain tax positions offset by return to provision adjustments. Comparatively, the effective tax rate for the third quarter of 2023 was largely driven by the mix of pre-tax earnings, changes to the valuation allowance for and the usage of certain foreign tax credits, and return to provision adjustments, withholding taxes, and changes in uncertain tax positions. Excluding the impact of non-core items in each quarter, described in the Non-GAAP Measures section of this Item above, the Company estimates that its effective tax rates for the third quarters of 2024 and 2023 would have been approximately 29 and 28 , respectively. The Company may experience continued volatility in its effective tax rates due to several factors, including the timing of tax audits, the expiration of applicable statutes of limitations as they relate to uncertain tax positions, the unpredictability of timing and amount of certain incentives in various tax jurisdictions, and the timing and amount of certain share-based compensation-related tax benefits, among other factors. In addition, the foreign tax credit valuation allowance, or absence thereof, is based on a number of factors, including forecasted mix of earnings, which may vary. 
 Equity in net income of associated companies was 2.4 million in the third quarter of 2024 compared to 3.3 million in the third quarter of 2023, a decrease of 0.9 million, primarily due to lower current year income from the Company s equity interest in Primex and the Company s 50 equity interest in a joint venture in Korea. 
 Net income attributable to noncontrolling interest was less than 0.1 million in the third quarter of 2024 and 2023. 
 
 Consolidated Operations Review Comparison of the First Nine Months of 2024 with the First Nine Months of 2023 
 Net sales were 1,395.6 million in the first nine months of 2024 compared to 1,486.2 million in the first nine months of 2023. The net sales decrease of 90.6 million, or 6 , year-over-year reflects decreases in selling price and product mix of approximately 5 , a decline in sales volumes of approximately 1 , and an unfavorable impact from foreign currency translation of less than 1 . The decrease in selling price and product mix was primarily attributable to the impact of our index-based customer contracts. The decline in sales volumes was primarily a result of a continuation of soft end market conditions compared to the prior year, primarily in the Americas and EMEA segments, partially offset by an increase in sales volumes in the Asia/Pacific segment, continued new business wins across all segments and a contribution from acquisitions in the EMEA and Asia/Pacific segments. 
 COGS were 865.8 million in the first nine months of 2024 compared to 951.7 million in the first nine months of 2023. The decrease in COGS of approximately 86.0 million, or 9 , reflects lower spend on the decline in current year sales volumes and a decline in the Company s global raw material costs. 
 Gross profit was 529.8 million in the first nine months of 2024 compared to 534.5 million in the first nine months of 2023, a decrease of approximately 4.6 million, or 1 , primarily as a result of the decline in sales as mentioned above, partially offset by a reduction in the Company s raw material costs. The Company s reported gross margin in the first nine months of 2024 was 38.0 compared to 36.0 in the first nine months of 2023. 
 SG A was 359.4 million in the first nine months of 2024 compared to 362.2 million in to the first nine months of 2023, a decrease of 2.9 million, or 1 , primarily driven by foreign currency translation, offset by an increase in SG A relating to the IKV and Sutai acquisitions. 
 The Company incurred Restructuring and related charges of 4.8 million and 6.0 million during the first nine months of 2024 and 2023, respectively, related to reductions in headcount and facility closure costs under the Company s restructuring program. See the Non-GAAP Measures section of this Item, above. 
 Operating income in the first nine months of 2024 was 165.7 million compared to 166.2 million in the first nine months of 2023. Excluding non-recurring and non-core expenses that are not indicative of the future operating performance of the Company described in the Non-GAAP Measures section of this Item, above, the Company s current year non-GAAP operating income decreased to 173.2 million for the first nine months of 2024 compared to 176.9 million in the prior year s first nine months primarily due to lower gross profit, partially offset by lower SG A, as described above. 
 The Company had Other income, net of 2.3 million in the first nine months of 2024 compared to Other expense, net of 8.6 million in the first nine months of 2023, as the Company had lower foreign exchange losses of 2.1 million in the current year compared to losses of 10.0 million in the prior year period. The first nine months of 2024 results also included 3.8 million of non-income tax refunds and other related credits, a 1.0 million business interruption insurance recovery, and a 0.9 million gain recognized for the sale of certain facilities previously classified as held for sale, partially offset by a 0.9 million expense associated with a payment related to a customer product liability dispute, whereas the first nine months of 2023 included 1.0 million of insurance reimbursements related to remediation and restoration of property damage to certain of the Company s facilities. See the Non-GAAP Measures section of this Item, above.

 Management s Discussion and Analysis 

 Interest expense, net, of 31.9 million decreased 6.8 million in the first nine months of 2024 compared to 38.7 million in the first nine months of 2023 primarily as a result of lower outstanding borrowings and decreases in interest rates. 
 The Company s effective tax rates for the first nine months of 2024 and 2023 were 29.7 and 31.1 , respectively. The Company s effective tax rate for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily impacted by the mix of pre-tax earnings, certain one-time charges related to an intercompany intangible asset transfer, and withholding taxes, offset by changes in uncertain tax positions and return to provision adjustments. Comparatively, the effective tax rates for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 were largely impacted by the mix of pre-tax earnings, changes to the valuation allowance for and the usage of certain foreign tax credits, return to provision adjustments, and withholding taxes, partially offset by changes in uncertain tax positions and return to provision adjustments. Excluding the impact of non-core items in each period, described in the Non-GAAP Measures section of this Item, above, the Company estimates that its effective tax rates for the first nine months of 2024 and 2023 would have been approximately 28 in both periods. The Company expects continued volatility in its effective tax rates due to several factors, including the timing and scope of tax audits and the expiration of applicable statutes of limitations as they relate to uncertain tax positions, the unpredictability of the timing and amount of certain incentives in various tax jurisdictions, the treatment of certain acquisition-related costs and the timing and amount of certain share-based compensation-related tax benefits, among other factors. In addition, the foreign tax credit valuation allowance, or absence thereof, is based on a number of factors, including forecasted mix of earnings, which may vary. 
 
 Equity in net income of associated companies was 6.9 million in the first nine months of 2024 compared to 10.7 million in the first nine months of 2023. The decrease of 3.7 million was primarily due to lower current year income from the Company s 50 equity interest in a joint venture in Korea. 
 Net income attributable to noncontrolling interest was less than 0.1 million in the first nine months of 2024 and 2023. 
 
 Reportable Segments Review - Comparison of the Third Quarter of 2024 with the Third Quarter of 2023 
 The Company s reportable segments reflect the structure of the Company s internal organization, the method by which the Company s resources are allocated and the manner by which the chief operating decision maker of the Company assesses performance. The Company has three reportable segments: (i) Americas; (ii) EMEA; and (iii) Asia/Pacific. 
 Segment operating earnings for the Company s reportable segments are comprised of net sales less COGS and SG A directly related to the respective segment s net sales. Operating expenses not directly attributable to the segments, such as certain corporate and administrative costs and Restructuring and related charges, net, are excluded from segment results. Other items not specifically identified with the Company s reportable segments include Interest expense, net , and Other income (expense), net . 
 Americas

This segment s net sales were 220.3 million, a decrease of 25.6 million, or 10 , compared to the third quarter of 2023. This was driven by a decrease in sales volumes of approximately 6 , lower selling price and product mix of approximately 2 , and an unfavorable impact from foreign currency translation of 2 . The current quarter decline in sales volumes compared to the prior year was primarily driven by softer end market conditions broadly across the portfolio, partially offset by new business win s. The decrease in selling price and product mix was primarily attributable to the impact of our index-based customer contracts. The unfavorable foreign exchange impact was primarily due to the strengthening of the U.S. dollar against the Mexican peso and Brazilian real. Segment o perating earnings were 62.1 million, a decrease of 7.0 million, or 10 , compared to the third quarter of 2023, driven by lo wer sales partially offset by improved segment operating margins, driven primarily by lower raw material costs and lower SG A expense. 
 EMEA 
 EMEA represented approximately 29 of the Company s consolidated net sales in the third quarter of 2024 . This segment s net sales were 134.1 million, a decrease of 5.5 million, or 4 , compared to the third quarter of 2023 . This was driven by lower selling price and product mix of approximately 6 , partially offset by an increase in sales volumes of 1 and a favorable impact from foreign currency translation of 1 . The decrease in selling price and product mix was primarily attributable to the impact of our index-based customer contracts. The increase in sales volumes was primarily driven by new business wins and the contribution from the acquisition of IKV which offset softer end market conditions in the region. The favorable foreign curren cy translation impact was primarily due to the weakening of the U.S. dollar against the Euro . Segment operating earnings were 24.6 million, a decrease of 3.3 million, or 12 , compared to the third quarter of 2023, due to the decline in net sales and lower segment operating margins due to higher raw material and other costs.

This was driven by an increase in sales volumes of 6 and a favorable impact from foreign currency translation of 1 , partially offset by a decrease in selling price and product mix of 4 . The increase in sales volumes was primarily driven by new business wins coupled with a modest improvement in the end market environment and the contribution from the acquisition of Sutai. The decrease in selling price and product mix was primarily attributable to the impact of our index-based customer contracts . The favorable foreign exchange impact was primarily due to the weakening of the U.S. dollar against the Chinese renminbi.

 Factors That May Affect Our Future Results 
 Certain information included in this Report and other materials filed or to be filed by us with the SEC, as well as information included in oral statements or other written statements made or to be made by us, contain or may contain forward-looking statements that fall under the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 and the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. These statements can be identified by the fact that they do not relate strictly to historical or current facts and can generally be identified by words such as may, could, should, would, believe, expect, anticipate, estimate, intend, outlook, target, possible, potential, plan or similar expressions, but these terms are not the exclusive means of identifying such statements. We have based these forward-looking statements on assumptions, projections and expectations about future events that we believe are reasonable based on currently available information, including statements regarding the potential effects of the conflicts in Ukraine and the Middle East, inflation, and global supply chain constraints on the Company s business, results of operations, and financial condition; our expectation that we will maintain sufficient liquidity and remain in compliance with the terms of the Company s credit facility; expectations about future demand and raw material costs; and statements regarding the impact of increased raw material costs and pricing initiatives. 
 These forward-looking statements include statements with respect to our beliefs, plans, objectives, goals, expectations, anticipations, intentions, financial condition, results of operations, future performance, and business, which may differ materially from expectations, estimates and projections of many factors, including, but not limited to: 
 the timing and extent of the projected impacts on our business of acts of war or terrorism, including the conflicts in Ukraine and the Middle East, and actions taken by various governments and governmental organizations in response; 
 inflationary pressures, cost increases and the impacts of constraints and disruptions in the global supply chain; 
 the potential timing, impacts, benefits and other uncertainties of acquisitions and divestitures, including our ability to realize synergies, integrate acquisitions or separate divested assets and businesses; 
 the potential for changes in global and regional economic conditions and for a variety of macroeconomic events, including the possibility of global or regional slowdowns or recessions, a global pandemic, interest rate changes, tariffs, inflation, deflation or stagflation and its impact on our business, raw materials purchases and/or profitability of our business impact the value of our assets; and 
 our future results and plans including our sustainability goals and enterprise strategy 
 Such statements include information relating to current and future business activities, operational matters, capital spending, and financing sources. From time to time, forward-looking statements are also included in the Company s other periodic reports on Forms 10-K, 10-Q and 8-K, press releases, and other materials released to, or statements made to, the public. 
 Any or all of the forward-looking statements in this Report, in the Company s 2023 Form 10-K and in any other public statements we make may turn out to be wrong. This can occur as a result of inaccurate assumptions or as a consequence of known or unknown risks and uncertainties. Many factors discussed in this Report will be important in determining our future performance. Consequently, actual results may differ materially from those that might be anticipated from our forward-looking statements. 
 We undertake no obligation to publicly update any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. However, any further disclosures made on related subjects in the Company s subsequent reports on Forms 10-K, 10-Q, 8-K and other related filings should be consulted. A major risk is that demand for the Company s products and services is largely derived from the demand for our customers products, which subjects the Company to uncertainties related to downturns in a customer s business and unanticipated customer production slowdowns and shutdowns. 
 Other major risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, inflationary pressures, including the potential for significant increases in raw material costs; supply chain disruptions; customer financial instability; high interest rates and the possibility of economic recession; economic and political disruptions particularly in light of numerous elections globally and the possibility of regime changes and including the impacts of the military conflicts between Russia and Ukraine and in the Middle East; legislative and regulatory developments including changes to existing laws and regulations, or the way they are interpreted, applied or enforced; tariffs, trade restrictions and the economic and other sanctions imposed by other nations on Russia and Belarus and/or other government organizations; suspensions of activities in Russia by many multinational companies and the potential expansion of military activity; foreign currency fluctuations; significant changes in applicable tax rates and regulations; future terrorist attacks and other acts of violence; the impacts of consolidation in our industry, including loss or consolidation of a major customer; and the potential occurrence of cyber-security breaches, cyber-security attacks and other technology outages and security incidents. 
 Furthermore, the Company is subject to the same business cycles as those experienced by our customers in the steel, automobile, aircraft, industrial equipment, aluminum, and durable goods industries. Other factors could also adversely affect us, including those related to acquisitions and the integration of acquired businesses.
