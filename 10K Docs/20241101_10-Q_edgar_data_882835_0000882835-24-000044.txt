 On August 20, 2024, Roper acquired RCP Vega Holdings, LLC, the parent company of Transact Campus Inc. Transact ), a leading provider of innovative campus technology and integrated payment solutions, including campus identity software and secure access, tuition and fees management software and payment processing, as well as point-of-sale campus commerce solutions. Roper s acquisition of Transact was for a purchase price of , net of cash acquired and certain liabilities assumed.

 The Company accounts for forfeitures of stock-based awards as they occur, with previously recognized compensation reversed in the period in which the awards are forfeited. 
 
 Stock Options During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, options were granted with a weighted-average fair value of per option. During the same nine-month period in 2023, options were granted with a weighted-average fair value of per option. All options were issued with an exercise price equal to the closing price of Roper s common stock on the date of grant, as required by the Company s stock-based compensation plan. 
 
 Roper records compensation expense for employee stock options based on the estimated fair value of the options on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. Historical data is used to estimate the expected price volatility, the expected dividend yield, and the expected option life. The risk-free rate is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant for the expected life of the option.

 Cash received from option exercises for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was and , respectively. 
 
 Restricted Stock Awards During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company granted shares of restricted stock awards with a weighted-average grant date fair value of per share. During the same nine-month period in 2023, the Company granted shares of restricted stock awards with a weighted-average grant date fair value of per share. These awards were granted at the fair market value of the share on the date of grant. 
 
 During 2024, the Company revised its equity compensation strategy to more closely align long-term management incentives with its strategic objective to deliver and sustain higher levels of organic growth. Accordingly, the total number of restricted stock awards granted during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 increased as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023 due primarily to the adoption of a supplemental equity compensation program for the Company s business unit leadership teams under which incremental performance-based restricted stock awards were granted.

performance-based restricted stock awards during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, that include the ability to earn up to of the number of restricted stock awards originally granted contingent upon Roper s performance over a period, subject to a market modifier based on relative total shareholder return. Comparably, during the nine months ended September 30, 2023, performance-based restricted stock awards were granted to certain members of Roper s senior leadership team which did not contain a market modifier and do not have the ability to vest beyond of the original shares granted. 
 
 Due to the extent of performance required by the vesting conditions noted above, these awards are not expected to materially increase stock-based compensation expense relative to the Company s financial performance. 
 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, restricted stock award shares vested with a weighted-average grant date fair value of per share and a weighted-average vest date fair value of per share.

The net proceeds from the issuance of the Notes were used to repay a portion of the borrowings outstanding under our unsecured credit facility, including borrowings incurred on August 20, 2024 to fund the purchase price of the Transact acquisition, as well as to repay a portion of the senior notes due September 15, 2024. 
 
 Each series of Notes bears interest at a fixed rate, as described above. Interest on the 2029 Notes and the 2034 Notes will be payable semi-annually in arrears on April 15 and October 15 of each year, beginning April 15, 2025. Interest on the 2032 Notes will be payable semi-annually in arrears on February 15 and August 15 of each year, beginning February 15, 2025. 
 
 Roper may redeem some or all of the Notes at any time or from time to time, at of their principal amount, plus a make-whole premium based on a spread to U.S. Treasury securities. Roper is also entitled to redeem some or all of the Notes at of their principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest, on or after applicable par call dates in advance of maturity. 
 
 The Notes are unsecured senior obligations of the Company and rank equally in right of payment with all of our existing and future unsecured senior indebtedness. The Notes are effectively subordinated in right of payment to any of our future secured indebtedness to the extent of the value of the collateral securing such indebtedness. The Notes are not, and will not be, guaranteed by any of our subsidiaries and are effectively subordinated in right of payment to all existing and future indebtedness and other liabilities of our subsidiaries.

 and equity interest in Indicor Equity, LLC, respectively. We elected to apply the fair value option as we believe this is the most reasonable method to value this equity investment. The fair value of Roper s equity investment in Indicor is estimated on a quarterly basis and the change in fair value is reported as a component of Equity investments gain, net in our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Earnings. 
 
 Although we believe our assumptions are considered reasonable and are consistent with the plans and estimates included in our Annual Report, there is significant judgment applied to determine fair value. Changes in estimates or the application of alternative assumptions could produce significantly different results. Our valuation methodology utilizes the market multiple approach consisting of comparable guideline public companies revenue and earnings multiples to estimate the fair value of this equity investment. The fair value of the investment reflects management s estimate of assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the equity interest, which the Company has determined to be Level 3 in the FASB fair value hierarchy.

Change in fair value Ending balance 
 
 The Company received dividend distributions from Indicor of and during the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and and during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, which are reported within Equity investments gain, net in our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Earnings. These dividend distributions were intended to offset certain cash taxes payable associated with Roper s ownership stake and were contemplated in the determination of the fair value for the equity investment in Indicor. 
 
 Certinia Investment In August 2023, Roper acquired an limited partnership minority interest in CI Ultimate Holdings, L.P., the parent entity of Certinia Inc., a leading provider of professional services automation software, for .

 The change in our net contract assets/(liabilities) from December 31, 2023 to September 30, 2024 was primarily due to net contract liabilities assumed of approximately associated with the acquisitions completed during 2024, most notably Transact, and the timing of payments and invoicing related to SaaS and post-contract support PCS renewals, driven predominantly by the SaaS renewal cycle of our Frontline business which primarily occurs in the third quarter.

Three Months Ended September 30, 2024 compared to the Three Months Ended September 30, 2023 
 
 Net revenues for the three months ended September 30, 2024 were 1,764.6 as compared to 1,563.4 for the three months ended September 30, 2023, an increase of 12.9 . The components of revenue growth for the three months ended September 30, 2024 were as follows: 
 
 Application Software Network Software Technology Enabled Products Roper Total Revenue Growth 22.5 0.8 4.3 12.9 Less Impact of: Acquisitions 16.9 8.7 Foreign Exchange 0.1 (0.1) 0.1 Organic Revenue Growth 5.5 0.8 4.4 4.1 
 
 In our Application Software segment, net revenues in the third quarter of 2024 were 984.4 as compared to 803.4 in the third quarter of 2023. The growth of 5.5 in organic revenues was broad-based across the segment led by our businesses serving the acute healthcare, legal, and government contracting markets. Gross margin decreased to 68.3 in the third quarter of 2024 as compared to 69.4 in the third quarter of 2023 due primarily to a lower gross margin profile associated with the higher payments revenue mix at Procare and Transact, our 2024 acquisitions, partially offset by operating leverage on higher organic revenues. Selling, general and administrative SG A expenses as a percentage of net revenues decreased to 42.0 in the third quarter of 2024 as compared to 43.7 in the third quarter of 2023, due primarily to cost synergies resulting from the integration of Syntellis, and a lower SG A profile associated with the higher payments revenue mix at Transact and Procare. The resulting operating margin was 26.4 in the third quarter of 2024 as compared to 25.8 in the third quarter of 2023. 
 
 In our Network Software segment, net revenues in the third quarter of 2024 were 367.1 as compared to 364.1 in the third quarter of 2023. The growth of 0.8 in organic revenues was led by our network software businesses serving the construction and alternate site healthcare markets, partially offset by a decline in our businesses serving the freight match and media and entertainment markets. Gross margin decreased to 84.9 in the third quarter of 2024 as compared to 85.3 in the third quarter of 2023 due primarily to revenue mix. SG A expenses as a percentage of net revenues decreased to 39.7 in the third quarter of 2024 as compared to 40.2 in the third quarter of 2023 due primarily to expense reductions resulting from cost structure rationalization at our businesses serving the freight match market and operating leverage on higher organic revenues. As a result, operating margin was 45.2 in both the third quarter of 2024 and 2023. 
 
 In our Technology Enabled Products segment, net revenues in the third quarter of 2024 were 413.1 as compared to 395.9 in the third quarter of 2023. The growth of 4.4 in organic revenues was led by our medical products businesses, excluding our precision measurement business, and growth in our water meter technology business. These increases were partially offset by declines in our access management businesses, primarily attributable to the easing of supply chain issues in the third quarter of 2023, and our precision measurement business due to customer program timing. Gross margin decreased to 57.4 in the third quarter of 2024 as compared to 57.6 in the third quarter of 2023 due primarily to revenue mix and reduced operating leverage associated with our precision measurement business s reduced third quarter 2024 revenues. SG A expenses as a percentage of net revenues increased to 23.2 in the third quarter of 2024 as compared to 22.9 in the third quarter of 2023 due primarily to revenue mix. The resulting operating margin was 34.2 in the third quarter of 2024 as compared to 34.6 in the third quarter of 2023. 
 
 Corporate expenses increased to 70.3, or 4.0 of net revenues, in the third quarter of 2024 as compared to 62.3, or 4.0 of net revenues, in the third quarter of 2023. The dollar increase was due primarily to higher stock-based compensation expense. 
 
 Interest expense, net, increased to 67.7 for the third quarter of 2024 as compared to 42.4 for the third quarter of 2023 due to higher weighted average debt balances and less interest income earned on our cash and cash equivalents. 
 
 Equity investments gain, net, was 37.4 in the third quarter of 2024 due primarily to a 37.6 increase in the fair value of our equity investment in Indicor. Equity investments gain, net, was 33.9 in the third quarter of 2023 due primarily to a 20.1 increase in the fair value of our equity investment in Indicor and 13.2 of dividend distributions received from Indicor. 
 
 22 

Other income, net, of 0.9 for the third quarter of 2024 was composed primarily of foreign exchange gains at our non-U.S. based subsidiaries. Other income, net, of 5.0 for the third quarter of 2023 was composed primarily of a gain on the sale of non-operating assets and foreign exchange gains at our non-U.S. based subsidiaries. 
 
 Income taxes as a percentage of pretax earnings decreased to 21.3 for the third quarter of 2024 as compared to 21.9 for the third quarter of 2023. The 2024 rate was favorably impacted by the recognition of a net tax benefit associated with international legal entity restructuring. 
 
 Backlog is equal to our remaining performance obligations expected to be recognized as revenue within the next 12 months as discussed in Note 13 of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. Backlog increased 3.9 to 3,026.1 at September 30, 2024 as compared to 2,913.7 at September 30, 2023 due primarily to organic growth and acquisitions in our Application Software segment, partially offset by a decrease in our Technology Enabled Products segment. 
 
 Backlog as of September 30, 
 2024 2023 Application Software 2,150.3 1,887.3 Network Software 487.0 467.1 Technology Enabled Products 388.8 559.3 Total 3,026.1 2,913.7 

Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 compared to the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2023 
 
 Net revenues for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 were 5,162.1 as compared to 4,564.3 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, an increase of 13.1 . The components of revenue growth for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 were as follows: 
 
 Application Software Network Software Technology Enabled Products Roper Total Revenue Growth 20.4 2.4 8.3 13.1 Less Impact of: Acquisitions 15.0 7.6 Foreign Exchange 0.1 0.1 (0.1) 0.1 Organic Revenue Growth 5.3 2.3 8.4 5.4 
 
 In our Application Software segment, net revenues in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 were 2,811.4 as compared to 2,335.1 in the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The growth of 5.3 in organic revenues was broad-based across the segment led by our businesses serving the acute healthcare, legal, property and casualty insurance, and project-based private sector markets. Gross margin increased slightly to 69.0 in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to 68.9 in the nine months ended September 30, 2023 due primarily to operating leverage on higher organic revenues, mostly offset by a lower gross margin profile associated with the higher payments revenue mix at our Procare and Transact acquisitions. SG A expenses as a percentage of net revenues decreased to 42.3 in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to 43.2 in the nine months ended September 30, 2023, due primarily to a lower SG A profile associated with the higher payments revenue mix at Procare and Transact, operating leverage on higher organic revenues, and cost synergies resulting from the integration of Syntellis. The resulting operating margin was 26.7 in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to 25.8 in the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 
 In our Network Software segment, net revenues in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 were 1,102.1 as compared to 1,076.7 in the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The growth of 2.3 in organic revenues was led by our network software businesses serving the alternate site healthcare, life insurance/annuities, and construction markets, partially offset by a decline in our businesses serving the freight match and media and entertainment markets. Gross margin remained consistent at 84.9 in both the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. SG A expenses as a percentage of net revenues decreased to 40.3 in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to 41.7 in the nine months ended September 30, 2023 due primarily to expense reductions resulting from cost structure rationalization at our businesses serving the freight match market and operating leverage on higher organic revenues. As a result, operating margin was 44.7 in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to 43.2 in the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 23 

In our Technology Enabled Products segment, net revenues in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 were 1,248.6 as compared to 1,152.5 in the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The growth of 8.4 in organic revenues was led by our medical products businesses, excluding our precision measurement business, and growth in our water meter technology business. These increases were partially offset by a decline in our access management businesses. Gross margin increased to 57.7 in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to 57.2 in the nine months ended September 30, 2023 due primarily to operating leverage on higher organic revenues. SG A expenses as a percentage of net revenues increased to 23.7 in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to 23.2 in the nine months ended September 30, 2023 due primarily to revenue mix. The resulting operating margin was 34.0 in both the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. 
 
 Corporate expenses increased to 194.5, or 3.8 of net revenues, in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to 175.6, or 3.8 of net revenues, in the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The dollar increase was due primarily to higher stock-based compensation expense. 
 
 Interest expense, net, increased to 188.4 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to 114.6 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 due to higher borrowings on our unsecured credit facility and less interest income earned on our cash and cash equivalents, partially offset by lower weighted average fixed-rate debt balances. 
 
 Equity investments gain, net, was 93.6 in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 due primarily to a 92.7 increase in the fair value of our equity investment in Indicor and 9.5 of dividend distributions received from Indicor, partially offset by our proportionate share of net loss associated with our investment in Certinia of 9.8 in accordance with the equity method of accounting. Equity investments gain, net, was 98.7 in the nine months ended September 30, 2023 due primarily to a 76.4 increase in the fair value of our equity investment in Indicor and 25.3 of dividend distributions received from Indicor. 
 
 Income taxes as a percentage of pretax earnings decreased to 21.0 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to 21.8 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The 2024 rate was favorably impacted by the recognition of a net tax benefit associated with international legal entity restructuring. 

Financial Condition, Liquidity, and Capital Resources 
 All currency amounts are in millions 
 
 Selected cash flows for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 were as follows: 
 
 Nine months ended September 30, Cash provided by (used in) continuing operations from: 2024 2023 Operating activities 1,671.0 1,415.7 Investing activities (3,528.2) (2,010.7) Financing activities 1,901.7 103.3 Cash used in discontinued operations (0.4) 
 
 Operating activities Net cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations increased by 18 to 1,671.0 in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to 1,415.7 in the nine months ended September 30, 2023 primarily due to higher net earnings from continuing operations net of non-cash expenses, increased collections on accounts receivable, and the cash payment of 45.0 in 2023 related to the settlement of a patent litigation matter, partially offset by higher cash taxes paid. 
 
 Investing activities Cash used in investing activities from continuing operations during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily for the acquisitions of Procare and Transact. Cash used in investing activities from continuing operations during the nine months ended September 30, 2023 was primarily for business acquisitions, most notably Syntellis and Replicon. 
 
 Financing activities Cash provided by financing activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily from the issuance of 2,000.0 of senior notes and net borrowings under our unsecured credit facility, partially offset by 500.0 of senior notes repaid at maturity and dividend payments. Cash provided by financing activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2023 was primarily from net borrowings under our unsecured credit facility and net proceeds from stock-based compensation, partially offset by 700.0 of senior notes repaid at maturity and dividend payments. 
 
 24 

Total debt consisted of the following: 
 
 As of September 30, 2024 Fixed-rate senior notes 7,500.0 Unsecured credit facility 925.0 Other 0.3 Less: Deferred financing costs (48.7) Total debt, net of deferred financing costs 8,376.6 Less: Current portion (699.0) Long-term debt, net of deferred financing costs 7,677.6 
 
 The interest rate on borrowings under the 3,500.0 unsecured credit facility is calculated based upon various recognized indices plus a margin as defined in the credit agreement. At September 30, 2024, we had 925.0 of borrowings outstanding under our unsecured credit facility and 6.8 of outstanding letters of credit. 
 
 In relation to our total cash and cash equivalents, amounts held at our foreign subsidiaries represented 51.3 or 138.3 at September 30, 2024 as compared to 69.2 or 148.3 at December 31, 2023. The decrease in foreign cash was due primarily to repatriation of 223.2, partially offset by the cash generated at our foreign subsidiaries during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. We intend to repatriate substantially all historical and future earnings. 
 
 We expect existing cash balances, together with cash generated by our operations and amounts available under our credit facility, will be sufficient to fund our operating requirements for the foreseeable future. 
 
 We were in compliance with all debt covenants related to our unsecured credit facility throughout the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 
 
 Net working capital (total current assets, excluding cash, less total current liabilities, excluding debt) was negative 1,268.0 at September 30, 2024 as compared to negative 1,196.6 at December 31, 2023 primarily driven by the increase in deferred revenue predominantly due to the timing of SaaS renewals associated with Frontline as well as the acquisition of Transact. Total debt, net of deferred financing costs was 8,376.6 at September 30, 2024 as compared to 6,330.1 at December 31, 2023. Our leverage on a continuing operations basis is presented in the following table: 
 
 September 30, 2024 December 31, 2023 Total debt, net of deferred financing costs 8,376.6 6,330.1 Less: Cash and cash equivalents (269.6) (214.3) Net debt 8,107.0 6,115.8 Stockholders equity 18,515.5 17,444.8 Total net capital 26,622.5 23,560.6 Net debt / Total net capital 30.5 26.0 
 
 Capital expenditures were 39.2 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to 37.8 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Capitalized software expenditures were 33.4 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to 28.7 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. We expect the aggregate of capital expenditures and capitalized software expenditures for 2024 to be comparable to prior years as a percentage of net revenues. 
 
 On September 15, 2024, 500.0 of 2.350 senior notes due 2024 were repaid at maturity using borrowings under our unsecured credit facility as well as a portion of the net proceeds from the issuance of the Notes. 
 
 25 

Outlook 
 
 Current geopolitical and economic uncertainties, including the current inflationary environment, supply chain disruptions, and labor shortages, could adversely affect our business prospects. An armed conflict (such as the ongoing war in Ukraine, as well as the conflict in the Middle East), significant terrorist attack, other global conflict, widespread cybersecurity event or information technology failure, or public health crisis could cause changes in world economies that would adversely affect us. It is impossible to isolate each of these potential factor s future effects on current economic conditions or any of our businesses. It is also impossible to predict with any reasonable degree of certainty what or when any additional events may occur that also would similarly disrupt the economy and have an adverse impact on our businesses. 
 
 We maintain an active acquisition program; however, future acquisitions will be dependent on numerous factors and it is not feasible to reasonably estimate if or when any such acquisitions will occur and what the impact will be on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. Such acquisitions may be financed by the use of existing credit agreements, future cash flows from operations, future divestitures, the proceeds from the issuance of new debt or equity securities, or any combination of these methods, the terms and availability of which will be subject to market and economic conditions generally. 
 
 We anticipate that our businesses will generate positive cash flows from operating activities, and that these cash flows will permit the reduction of currently outstanding debt in accordance with the repayment schedule. However, the rate at which we can reduce our debt (and reduce the associated interest expense) will be affected by, among other things, the financing and operating requirements of any new acquisitions, the financial performance of our existing companies, and the impact of the aforementioned geopolitical and economic uncertainties and the financial markets generally. None of these factors can be predicted with certainty.
