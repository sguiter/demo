factors raise substantial doubt regarding the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. The Company s ability to
continue as a going concern is dependent upon the Company s ability to raise sufficient financing to acquire or commercialize its
products into a profitable business. The Company intends to finance its commercialization activities and its working capital needs largely
from the sale of equity securities and/or with additional funding from other traditional financing sources until such time that funds
provided by operations are sufficient to fund working capital requirements. The unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements
of the Company do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification of recorded assets, or the amounts and
classifications of liabilities that might be necessary should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern.

Item
2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 

The
following discussion and analysis summarizes the significant factors affecting the consolidated operating results, financial condition,
liquidity and cash flows of our Company as of and for the periods presented below. The following discussion and analysis of our financial
condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes
thereto included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Unless the context requires otherwise, references in this Quarterly
Report on Form 10-Q to we, us, and our refer to Sharps Technology, Inc. 

Forward-Looking
Statements 

The
information in this discussion contains forward-looking statements and information within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities
Act of 1933, as amended, or the Securities Act, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the Exchange Act,
which are subject to the safe harbor created by those sections. These forward-looking statements include, but are not limited
to, statements concerning our strategy, future operations, future financial position, future revenues, projected costs, prospects and
plans and objectives of management. The words anticipates, believes, estimates, expects, 
 intends, may, plans, projects, will, would and similar
expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements, although not all forward-looking statements contain these identifying
words. We may not actually achieve the plans, intentions, or expectations disclosed in our forward-looking statements and you should
not place undue reliance on our forward-looking statements. Actual results or events could differ materially from the plans, intentions
and expectations disclosed in the forward-looking statements that we make. These forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties
that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements, including, without limitation,
the risks set forth in our filings with the SEC. The forward-looking statements are applicable only as of the date on which they are
made, and we do not assume any obligation to update any forward-looking statements . 

Overview 

Since our inception in 2017, we have devoted substantially all our resources to the research and development and commencing the latter
part of 2023 on manufacturing of our safety syringe products. To date, we have not generated any significant revenues from the sale of
syringe products. We have incurred net losses in each year since our inception and, as of September 30, 2024, we had an accumulated deficit
of 29,918,777. Our net loss was 4,769,774 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. Substantially all of our net losses resulted
from costs incurred in connection with our research and development efforts, payroll and consulting fees, stock compensation and general
and administrative costs associated with our operations, including costs incurred for being a public company since April 14, 2022. See
below, Liquidity and Capital Resources and Notes to Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. 

The accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. The Company has not
generated any significant revenue from the sale of syringe products or cash flow from operations since inception. As of September 30,
2024, the Company had working capital of 67,820 which is not expected to be sufficient to fund the Company s planned operations
for the next 12 months. These factors raise substantial doubt regarding the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. The
Company s ability to continue as a going concern is dependent upon the Company s ability to raise sufficient financing to
acquire or commercialize its products into a profitable business. The Company intends to finance its commercialization activities and
its working capital needs largely from the sale of equity securities and/or with additional funding from other traditional financing sources
until such time that funds provided by operations are sufficient to fund working capital requirements. The financial statements of the
Company do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification of recorded assets, or the amounts and classifications
of liabilities that might be necessary should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern. 

22 

We classify our operating expenses as research and development and general
and administrative expenses. We maintain a corporate office located in Melville, New York, but employees and consultants in the US work
remotely and will continue to do so indefinitely. In June 2020, we entered into an agreement to acquire Safegard Medical (Safegard), a
former syringe manufacturing facility in Hungary. Through the closing on July 6, 2022, we were contractually provided the exclusive use
of the facility for research and development and testing in exchange for payment of the seller s operating costs, including among
others, use of Safegard s work force, utility costs and other services. 

In
order to compete in the market, we must maintain inventory. Commencing in the 4 th Quarter of 2022 we started building inventory.
We require commercial quantities of inventory to secure orders. Delivery is expected shortly after receiving orders. 

Although
we currently have production capacity for our products and thus the ability to receive and fulfill orders, we have used the proceeds
from the February 2023, September 2023 fund raising and fund raising in the second and third quarter of 2024 to allow us to either
increase our production capacity, build inventory or support working capital requirements This will help us to generate and fulfill
orders for our current product line and advance our new innovative products in connection with recent collaboration arrangements. We
have produced commercial quantities of our products and built inventory to support orders in late 2024 and in 2025. (See Recent
Developments) 

Products,
Marketing and Sales 

We
continue to be in discussions with healthcare companies and distributors for sales of our disposable syringe and prefillable syringe
products. We intend to market these products to the U.S. and foreign governments. We received a Purchase Order for our first Securegard
sales to a South America distributor which was shipped in June 2024. We will also look to sell our disposable syringe products to hospitals
and clinician offices as opportunities present themselves. 

The Sharps Securegard product line continues to represent our initial disposable
syringe platform to be commercially available to the market. The addition of the Sologard products and SafeR products from Roncadelle
are recent expansions to the Company s product portfolio. These platforms have advanced features and benefits to support the needs
of the market along with a high level of readiness for manufacturing and the ability to provide large commercial quantities for customers. 

As
previously disclosed, there continue to be delays in the commercialization of the Sharps Provensa product line. The product s
specialized technology requires further design and assembly optimization as identified in our previous commercialization efforts. This
on-going product refinement process is typical of the development of new technology for the healthcare market to ensure the products
are safe and effective for use every time. At this time Sharps is not able to determine a timeline for final commercialization of the
Provensa product. 

Research
and Development 

Substantially
all of our research and development expenses to date have been incurred in connection with our syringe products. We expect to continue
to incur research and development expenses for the foreseeable future as we continue to enhance our products to meet the market requirements
for our Sharps syringe product line for its various intended uses throughout the world.

Business
Developments: 

Asset
Purchase Agreement Nephron Pharmaceuticals and Affiliates 

On
September 29, 2022, the Company entered into an agreement (the NPC Agreement with Nephron Pharmaceuticals Corporation NPC and various affiliates of NPC, including InjectEZ, LLC. The NPC Agreement was intended to support several areas of
the Company s development and growth. The Company and NPC intended to supplement the NPC Agreement by entering into a manufacturing
supply agreement, a sales and distribution agreement and a pharma services program to support growth, and a future agreement to support
manufacturing expansion. As noted below, the sales and distribution agreement was terminated on March 8, 2024, and replaced. The original
manufacturing supply agreement, noted above, was replaced as part of the Asset Purchase Agreement, entered into on September 22, 2023
and the Pharma Services agreement continues to be in place, although no activities have occurred to date. Further, under the additional
agreement with NPC and affiliates of NPC Nephron Agreement ), the Company would provide technical advice and assistance
to support manufacturing by InjectEZ, purchase certain quantities of syringes as they may order or require, and collaborate with Nephron
on certain related business endeavors, but no activities have occurred to date. The Company will continue working to amend the terms
of this NPC Agreement and Nephron Agreement, based on the Amended Asset Purchase Agreement below dated May 20, 2024. (See below) 

On
March 8, 2024, the Company and Nephron Pharmaceuticals Corporation terminated their distribution agreement dated December 8, 2022, which
was partially replaced by the Agreement with Roncadelle, as stated below, and we continue to seek other parties to distribute for the
US domestic market. The Company entered into a new logistics services agreement on the warehousing side with Owens and Minor O M to replace Nephron s distribution services. The Company can utilize O M to provide 3PL services for both
the Company and Roncadelle products, in North and South America when needed. 

The
Company and Nephron continue to maintain the Pharma Services Program (PSP), although no activities have occurred to date, which focuses
on the creation of new business development and growth opportunities for both companies. These opportunities will include the development
and sale of next generation drug delivery systems that will be produced by the Company and can be purchased by the healthcare industry,
pharmaceutical markets, and Pharma companies such as Nephron and others. 

On
May 20, 2024, the Company entered into an Amendment to the Asset Purchase Agreement dated September 22, 2023, with Nephron and Nephron s
InjectEZ, LLC, (collectively, the Seller ). The September 22, 2023 agreement superseded the manufacturing and supply agreement
entered into in connection with the NPC Agreement on September 29, 2022, and the Nephron Agreement entered into on September 29, 2022.
The Amended Asset Purchase Agreement includes the purchase of certain assets for 35M plus assumed liabilities of 4M, continues to provide
for the Company to lease the Facility but excludes any leasehold improvements previously included. In connection with the Asset Purchase
agreement, the Company paid a non-refundable deposit of 1M to be held in escrow under an agreeable escrow agreement as a deposit on
the purchase price. The Asset Purchase agreement stipulated that the 1M deposit would be maintained until July 19, 2024, at which date,
if the contemplated transaction was not consummated, through no fault of the Seller, the escrow would be released to the Seller by the
escrow agent. The escrow deposit of 1,000,000 was released to the Seller and recorded in Other Expense as a forfeited agreement cost
in the three months ended June 30, 2024. The Company and Seller continue to work towards a further amendment of the Asset Purchase Agreement.
The closing of the Asset Purchase Agreement is contingent on obtaining further amendments and the necessary financing. There can be no
assurance that the closing of the asset sale will occur.

Critical
Accounting Policies and Significant Judgments and Estimates 

This
management s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our financial statements,
which we have prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of our financial
statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure
of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of our financial statements, as well as the reported revenues and expenses during the
reported periods. We evaluate these estimates and judgments on an ongoing basis. We base our estimates on historical experience and on
various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments
about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these
estimates under different assumptions or conditions. The FMV adjustments, based on the trading price of outstanding warrants classified
as liabilities, could impact the operating results in the reporting periods.

to 225,191 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease of 79,580 was due to reduced R D activities in 2024 as

to 2,133,167 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease of 263,569 was primarily attributable to: i) a decrease
in payroll and consulting fees of 57,000 from 895,000 in 2023 to 838,000 in 2024, primarily due to lower consulting services and
compensation expense, ii) decrease in stock compensation expense, due to the timing of option awards, vesting and options
valuations, of approximately 85,000 from 201,000 in 2023 to 116,000 in 2024. Further, we had decreases in public company and
investor relation costs 65,600), travel 17,000), computer costs 44,000), insurance 39,000), patent fees 10,000), and other

Certain
Warrants require the Fair Market Value FMV to be remeasured at each reporting date while outstanding with
recognition of the changes in fair value to other income or expense in the condensed consolidated statement of operations. For the
three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the Company recorded a 416,560 FMV gain, net of a modification charge of 155,703
for the warrants exercised at the reduced exercise prices and the related modification charge and 572,264 FMV gain to reflect

capital of 67,820 and 1,145,569 as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. The decrease in our working capital

Cash Used in Operating Activities 

The
Company used cash of 5,172,135 and 6,144,937 in operating activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively.
The decrease in cash used of 972,802 was principally due to lower operating expenses during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 

Net
Cash Used in Investing Activities 

For
the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the Company used cash in investing activities of 1,069,659 and 431,379, respectively.
In both periods cash was used to acquire or pay deposits for fixed assets, equipment and software. In 2024, the cash used for acquiring

Off-Balance
Sheet Arrangements 

We
do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements as defined in Regulation S-K Item 303(a)(4). 

Emerging
Growth Company Status 

We
are an emerging-growth company , as defined in the JOBS Act, and, for as long as we continue to be an emerging growth company,
we may choose to take advantage of exemptions from various reporting requirements applicable to other public companies but not to emerging
growth companies, including, but not limited to, not being required to have our independent registered public accounting firm audit our
internal control over financial reporting under Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive
compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements and exemptions from the requirements of holding a nonbinding advisory vote
on executive compensation and stockholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. As an emerging growth company,
we can also delay adopting new or revised accounting standards until such time as those standards apply to private companies. We intend
to avail ourselves of these options. Once adopted, we must continue to report on that basis until we no longer qualify as an emerging
growth company. 

We
will cease to be an emerging growth company upon the earliest of: (i) the end of the fiscal year following the fifth anniversary of the
initial public offering; (ii) the first fiscal year after our annual gross revenue are 1.07 billion or more; (iii) the date on which
we have, during the previous three-year period, issued more than 1.0 billion in non-convertible debt securities; or (iv) the end of
any fiscal year in which the market value of our common stock held by non-affiliates exceeded 700 million as of the end of the second
quarter of that fiscal year. We cannot predict if investors will find our common stock less attractive if we choose to rely on these
exemptions. If, as a result of our decision to reduce future disclosure, investors find our common shares less attractive, there may
be a less active trading market for our common shares and the price of our common shares may be more volatile. 

31 

We
are also a smaller reporting company, meaning that the market value of our stock held by non-affiliates plus the aggregate
amount of gross proceeds to us as a result of the IPO is less than 700 million and our annual revenue was less than 100 million during
the most recently completed fiscal year. We may continue to be a smaller reporting company if either (i) the market value of our stock
held by non-affiliates is less than 250 million or (ii) our annual revenue was less than 100 million during the most recently completed
fiscal year and the market value of our stock held by non-affiliates is less than 700 million. If we are a smaller reporting company
at the time, we cease to be an emerging growth company, we may continue to rely on exemptions from certain disclosure requirements that
are available to smaller reporting companies. Specifically, as a smaller reporting company we may choose to present only the two most
recent fiscal years of audited financial statements in our Annual Report on Form 10-K and, similar to emerging growth companies, smaller
reporting companies have reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation. 

ITEM
3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 

Not
required for smaller reporting companies. 

ITEM
4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 

Evaluation
of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

As
required by Rule 13a-15(b) under the Exchange Act, our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer,
evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on
Form 10-Q. Based upon that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that, as of the end of the period
covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective to provide reasonable assurance
that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed,
summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms and to provide reasonable assurance that
such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer. 

Changes
in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 

There
were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting identified in connection with the evaluation of internal controls that
occurred during the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially
affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

PART
II OTHER INFORMATION 

ITEM
1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS 

From
time to time, we may become involved in legal proceedings arising in the ordinary course of our business. Regardless of outcome, litigation
can have an adverse impact on us due to defense and settlement costs, diversion of management resources, negative publicity, reputational
harm and other factors. 

On
July 10, 2024, Barry Berler Berler ), a co-founder and former Chief Technology Officer of the Company, commenced a lawsuit
in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York, Barry Berler v. Sharps Technology, Inc. and Alan Blackman,
Case No. 2:24-cv-04787. In this case, Berler asserts claims for damages of an aggregate of 456,000 for alleged (1) failure to make full
payment of certain monthly payments under his consulting agreement with the Company (the Consulting Agreement in the amount
of 52,500, (2) failure to pay a bonus with a target of 216,000 under the Consulting Agreement, (3) 187,500, representing 50 of the
severance payment paid by the Company to Mr. Blackman, the Company s co-founder and former Chief Operating Officer and Co-Chairman,
and a declaration and injunctive relief establishing that Berler is the rightful owner of 50 of the Company s Series A Preferred
Stock (which preferred stock is no longer outstanding ). The Company has accrued for the claim for unpaid monthly consulting fees. The
Company believes that Berler s claims are without merit, intends to defend itself vigorously and has requested dismissal of these
claims. In addition, on September 17, 2024, the Company filed an answer and counterclaims with respect thereto, including for recoupment
of certain compensation the Company has previously paid to Berler. 

On
June l7, 2024, Berler filed a demand for arbitration and statement of claim under the commercial arbitration rules of the American Arbitration
Association AAA asserting claims for payment of 500,000 plus interest, under the Company s royalty agreement with
Berler, as amended, rescission thereof and reversion to Berler of the intellectual property rights subject thereto. The Company believes
that Berler s claims are without merit and intends to defend itself vigorously in connection with these claims. 

On
April 3, 2024, Plastomold Industries Ltd. Plastomold commenced a lawsuit against the Company in the United States District
Court for the Eastern District of New York, Plastomold Industries Ltd v. Sharps Technology, Inc., Case No. 2:24-CV-02580, asserting claims
for damages in the amount of 1.762 million for alleged (1) failure to pay invoices, of which approximately 1 million would relate to
a maintenance agreement for units allegedly manufactured and sold using machinery that was defective and has never successfully produced
any saleable products, (2) breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing, (3) unjust enrichment, and (4) conversion.
Plastomold asserts it provided certain products and services to the Company for which its invoices were not fully paid. The Company believes
that Plastomold s claims are without merit and intends to defend itself vigorously. On June 3, 2024, the Company filed an answer
and affirmative defenses and counterclaim, which counterclaim is for damages that the Company believes would exceed the claims asserted
by Plastomold, based on the insufficiency of Plastomold s services and the results thereof, including the failure to provide machinery
capable of reliably manufacturing the designated products in compliance with design specifications and functionality requirements, and
with respect to which test results failed. 

ITEM
1A. RISK FACTORS 

Factors
that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those in this Quarterly Report are any of the risks described in the Form
10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, any of these factors could result in a significant or material adverse effect on our results
of operations or financial condition. Additional risk factors not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also
impair our business or results of operations. As of the date of this Quarterly Report, there have been no material changes to the risk
factors disclosed in the Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. We may disclose changes to such factors or disclose additional
factors from time to time in our future filings with the SEC. 

ITEM
2. UNREGISTERED SALES OF EQUITY SECURITIES AND USE OF PROCEEDS 

Recent
Sale of Unregistered Equity Securities 

During
the quarter ended September 30, 2024 the Company, under Reg A, issued 190,773 (pre reverse: 4.1M) unregistered but qualified shares
of common stock. 

During the quarter ended September
30, 2024 the Company issued 259,091 (pre reserve: 5,700,006) shares of unregistered common stock. 

Use
of Proceeds 

On
April 13, 2022, our Registration Statement on Form S-1 (No. 333-263715) was declared effective by the SEC pursuant to which we
issued and sold an aggregate of 3,750,000 units, (not reverse effected), each consisting of one share of common stock and two
warrants, to purchase one share of common stock for each whole warrant, with an initial exercise price of 4.25 per share (not
reverse affected) and a term of five years. In addition, we granted Aegis Capital Corp., as underwriter a 45-day over-allotment
option to purchase up to 15 of the number of shares included in the units sold in the offering, and/or additional warrants equal to
15 of the number of Warrants included in the units sold in the offering, in each case solely to cover over-allotments, which the
Aegis Capital Corp. partially exercised with respect to 1,125,000 warrants on April 19, 2022. No payments for such expenses were
made directly or indirectly to (i) any of our officers or directors or their associates, (ii) any persons owning 10 or more of any
class of our equity securities or (iii) any of our affiliates. There has been no material change in the expected use of the net
proceeds from our IPO as described in our final prospectus filed with the SEC on April 15, 2022. As of December 31, 2013, we have
used the net proceeds from the IPO for working capital, acquisition of the Hungary facility and capital expenditures.
