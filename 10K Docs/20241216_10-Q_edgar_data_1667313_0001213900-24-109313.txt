Balances 

Contract
liabilities consist of deferred revenue, which are recorded for payments received in advance of the satisfaction of performance obligations . 

The
Company records deferred revenues related to the unsatisfied performance obligations with respect to subscription revenue. The Company s
deferred revenue balance for paid subscriptions was approximately million related to approximately active subscribers, and
approximately million, related to approximately active subscribers, as of October 31, 2024 and July 31, 2024, respectively. 

The
Company also records deferred revenues when users purchase or earn Zedge Credits. Unused Zedge Credits represent the value of the Company s
unsatisfied performance obligation to its users. Revenue is recognized when Zedge App users use Zedge Credits to acquire Zedge Premium
content or upon expiration of the Zedge Credits upon 180 days of account inactivity Breakage ). As of October 31, 2024,
and July 31, 2024, the Company s deferred revenue balance related to Zedge Premium was approximately and , respectively. 

The
amount of deferred revenue recognized in the three months ended October 31, 2024 that was included in the deferred revenue balance at
July 31, 2024 was million. 

Unsatisfied
Performance Obligations 

Substantially
all of the Company s unsatisfied performance obligations relate to contracts with an original expected length of 30 months or less. 

Significant
Judgments 

The
advertising networks and advertising exchanges to which the Company sells its inventory track and report the impressions and revenues
to Zedge, and Zedge recognizes revenues based on these reports. The networks and exchanges base their payments off of those reports and
Zedge independently compares the data to each of the client sites to validate the imported data and identify any differences. The number
of impressions and revenues delivered by the advertising networks and advertising exchanges is determined at the end of each month, which
resolves any uncertainty in the transaction price during the reporting period.

Item 2.
Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 

The
following information should be read in conjunction with the accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements and the
associated notes thereto of this Quarterly Report, and the audited consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto and our Management s
Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations contained in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year
ended July 31, 2024 (the 2024 Form 10-K ), as filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC ). 

As
used below, unless the context otherwise requires, the terms the Company, Zedge, we, us, 
and our refer to Zedge, Inc., a Delaware corporation and its subsidiaries, GuruShots Ltd., Zedge Europe AS and Zedge Lithuania
UAB, collectively. 

Forward-Looking
Statements 

This
Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and
Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, including statements that contain the words believes, anticipates, 
 expects, plans, intends, and similar words and phrases. These forward-looking statements are
subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from future results. Factors that may cause such
differences include, but are not limited to: (1) economic, geopolitical and market conditions can adversely affect our business, results
of operations and financial condition, including our revenue growth and profitability, which in turn could adversely affect our stock
price; (2) our ability to successfully make acquisitions and/or successfully integrate acquisitions that we have made into Zedge without
incurring unanticipated costs or without being subject to other integration issues that may disrupt our existing operations; (3) delay
or failure to realize the expected synergies and benefits of the GuruShots acquisition; (4) the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic on our
employees, customers, partners, and the global financial markets; (5) Russia s invasion of Ukraine, and the international community s
response; and (6) recent attack by Hamas and other terrorist organizations from the Gaza Strip and Lebanon and Israel s war against
them. For further information regarding risks and uncertainties associated with our business, please refer to Item 1A to Part I Risk
Factors in the 2024 Form 10-K. The forward-looking statements are made as of the date of this report and we assume no obligation
to update the forward-looking statements, or to update the reasons why actual results could differ from those projected in the forward-looking
statements. Investors should consult all of the information set forth in this report and the other information set forth from time to
time in our reports filed with the SEC pursuant to the Securities Act of 1933 and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, including the
2024 Form 10-K. 

Trends
and Uncertainties 

Current
Economic Conditions 

The
majority of our users and employees are located outside of the United States exposing us to a range of economic factors and regulations
including foreign exchange fluctuations. There is uncertainty surrounding macroeconomic factors in the U.S. and globally. We believe
these macroeconomic conditions coupled with the global political climate and unrest, including the ongoing wars between Ukraine and Russia
and Israel and Hamas, may negatively impact our performance. 

The Israel-Hamas
and Israel-Hezbollah Conflicts 

Given
our operations in Israel, the impact of economic, political, geopolitical, and military conditions in the region directly affects us,
including conflicts involving missile strikes, infiltrations, and terrorism. Notably, on October 7, 2023, Hamas launched attacks in southern
Israel, resulting in casualties and military engagement. In addition, Hezbollah, another terrorist organization based in Lebanon has
been indiscriminately shelling Israel since October 8, 2023. The extent and duration of this conflict remain uncertain, potentially involving
other groups. Israel s response led to the mobilization of reservists, affecting our workforce. Prior to this, changes in Israel s
judicial system had already raised concerns about the business environment, compounded by recent events, potentially impacting foreign
investment, currency fluctuations, credit ratings, interest rates, and security markets. Furthermore, regional political unrest and threats
from extremist groups, notably Iran, pose additional risks. Management and our Board of Directors are closely monitoring the situation
in Israel to address potential business disruptions and implications.

Overview 

Zedge
builds digital marketplaces and friendly competitive games around content that people use to express themselves. Our leading products
include Zedge Ringtones and Wallpapers, which we refer to as our Zedge App, a freemium digital content marketplace offering
mobile phone wallpapers, video wallpapers, ringtones, and notification sounds as well as pAInt, a generative AI wallpaper maker, GuruShots,
a skill-based photo challenge game, and Emojipedia, the #1 trusted source for all things emoji . Our vision is to enable
and connect creators who enjoy friendly competitions with a community of prospective consumers in order to drive commerce. 

We
are part of the Creator Economy, which Goldman Sachs estimates is worth 250 billion globally. 1 According to
Linktree, over 200 million individuals identify as creators, people who use their influence, skill, and creativity to amass an audience
and monetize it. 2 Furthermore, Influencer Marketing Hub reports that out of 2,000 surveyed creators, 44.9 identify as full-time
creators, 3 and Exploding Topics reports that 10 of influencers earn more than 100,000 per year. 4 We view the
Creator Economy as an opportunity for Zedge to expand our business, especially as we execute by connecting our gamers with our marketplace. 

Our
Zedge app (which is named Zedge Wallpapers in the App Store) offers a wide array of mobile personalization content including
wallpapers, video wallpapers, ringtones, and notification sounds, and is available both in Google Play and the App Store. As of October
31, 2024, our Zedge App had been installed nearly 686 million times since inception and, over the past two fiscal years, has had between
25.0 million and 32.2 million monthly active users MAU ), ending with 25.0 million MAU as of October 31, 2024. MAU is a
key performance indicator KPI for our Zedge app that captures the number of unique users that used our Zedge App during
the final 30 days of the relevant period. Our platform allows creators to upload content to our marketplace and avail it to our users
either for free or, via Zedge Premium, the section of our marketplace where we offer premium content for purchase. In turn,
our users utilize the content to personalize their phones and express their individuality. 

In
fiscal 2023, we introduced pAInt, a generative AI wallpaper maker in the Zedge App. A generative AI wallpaper maker is an implementation
of artificial intelligence software that can create images from text descriptions. To interface with a generative AI image maker, a user
enters a text description of the image they want to create, and the software generates an image based on that description. In addition,
we upgraded Zedge+, our paid subscription offering by bundling together an ad-free experience with value adds making the offering more
compelling. 

We
often refer to our freemium ringtones and wallpapers, our subscription offering, the functionality for creators to market their products
and ancillary offering and features both in our Zedge App and website, as our Zedge Marketplace. 

The
Zedge Marketplace s monetization stack consists of advertising revenue generated when users view advertisements when using the
Zedge App (and the related functionality under the zedge.net website), the in-app sale of Zedge Credits, our virtual currency, that is
used to purchase Zedge Premium content, and a paid-subscription offering that provides an ad-free experience to users that purchase a
monthly, annual or lifetime subscription. In April 2023, we introduced a subscription tier in the iOS version of the app. As of October
31, 2024, we had approximately 698,000 active subscribers. 

In
April 2022, we acquired GuruShots Ltd, a recognized category leader focused on gamifying the photography vertical. GuruShots offers a
platform spanning iOS, Android, and the web that provides a fun, educational and structured way for amateur photographers to compete
in a wide variety of contests showcasing their photos while gaining recognition with votes, badges, and awards. We estimate that the
total addressable market of amateur photographers using their smartphones to take and publicly share artistic photos is 30-40 million
people per month and that the market is still in its infancy. Every month, GuruShots stages more than 300 competitions that result in
players uploading in excess of 600,000 photographs and casting close to 2.4 billion perceived votes, which are calculated
by multiplying the number of votes that each player casts by a weighting factor based on various factors related to that user. To improve
engagement, GuruShots has adopted a set of retention dynamics focused on individual, team and community dynamics that create a sense
of belonging, inspiration, recognition, improvement, and competition. 

GuruShots
utilizes a Free-to-Play business model and generates revenue through in-app purchases of virtual currency. Players can
use this currency to unlock competitions or gain an edge by purchasing resources and participating in additional gameplay. Over the past
seven years, the monthly average paying player spend has increased in excess of 8.4 annually to more than 49.0 per player.

In
fiscal 2024, we revamped GuruShots customer onboarding experience by guiding new players through simplified photo competitions
of limited size and duration. The upgrade was designed to enhance the gaming experience for new players by increasing their potential
for winning and providing immediate gratification. The new onboarding has shown improvements in engagement, retention, and revenue from
new users. In addition, we migrated to a coin-based economy with multiple currencies in order to enable more players to earn and spend
their currency on in-game resources. 

We
market GuruShots to prospective players, primarily via paid user acquisition channels, and utilize a host of creative formats including
static and video ads in order to promote the game. Our marketing team invests material resources in analyzing all attributes of a campaign
ranging from, among others, the creative assets, offer acquisition channel and platform (i.e., iOS, Android, and web), with the goal
of determining whether a specific campaign is likely to yield a profitable customer. When we unearth a successful combination of these
variables we scale up until we experience diminishing returns. Ultimately, we believe that the efforts we are making to advance the product
coupled with the investment in user acquisition can significantly increase GuruShots player base. 

Since
the start of fiscal 2025 Cost per Install (CPI) have trended down leading us to believe that our efforts are yielding fruit. It s
too early to say with conviction whether this trend is sustainable as we scale user acquisition and whether these users will provide
sufficient long-term ROI; however, we believe that these early results are encouraging. 

Beyond
our commitment to growing both the Zedge App and GuruShots on a standalone basis, we believe that there are many potential synergies
that we can capitalize on that exist between the two businesses. Specifically, we plan to enable GuruShots players to become Zedge Premium
artists and sell their photos to our audience of 25+ million MAU (as of October 31, 2024) as standard digital images. In addition, we
are benefitting from the experience that the GuruShots team possesses in gamifying the Zedge App. We believe that successful gamification
can contribute to increasing engagement, retention, and lifetime value, all critical KPIs for our business. Longer term, we believe that
there are complementary content verticals that lend themselves to gamification. One example is our hybrid casual title, AI Art
Master, which has been in soft-launch in the Philippines, Poland, and India, that enables players to create generative AI images
and compete in themed-based competitions with these images. Based on analyzing user data and performing extensive user testing, we will
determine whether to refine the user experience and scale or cease development of this title 

In
August 2021, we acquired Emojipedia Pty Ltd, the world s leading authority dedicated to providing up-to-date and well-researched
emoji definitions, information, and news, as well as World Emoji Day and the annual World Emoji Awards. In October 2024, Emojipedia received
approximately 38.8 million monthly page views and has approximately 10.3 million monthly active users as of October 31, 2024 of which
approximately 48.9 are located in well-developed markets. It is the top resource for all things emoji, offering insights into data and
cultural trends. As a member of the Unicode Consortium, the standards body responsible for approving new emojis, Emojipedia works alongside
major emoji creators including Apple, Google, Meta, and X, formerly known as Twitter. 

We
believe that Emojipedia provides growth potential to the Zedge App, and it was immediately accretive to earnings post acquisition in
August 2021. In the past year, we have made many changes to Emojipedia including overhauling its backend, redesigning the Emojipedia
website, and introducing new entertainment-focused features to the site. We will continue to enhance this offering and are exploring
additional new features which use artificial intelligence, some of which will be released before the end of the calendar year. 

Critical
Accounting Policies 

Our
unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States of America, or U.S. GAAP. Our significant accounting policies are described in Note 1 to the consolidated
financial statements included in the 2024 Form 10-K. The preparation of financial statements requires management to make estimates and
assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses as well as the disclosure of contingent assets
and liabilities. Critical accounting policies are those that require application of management s most subjective or complex judgments,
often as a result of matters that are inherently uncertain and may change in subsequent periods. Our critical accounting policies include
those related to revenue recognition, intangible assets, goodwill, capitalized software and technology development costs, stock-based
compensation and income taxes. Management bases its estimates and judgments on historical experience and other factors that are believed
to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. For
additional discussion of our critical accounting policies, see our Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition
and Results of Operations in the 2024 Form 10-K.

Key
Performance Indicators (KPIs) 

Zedge
App-MAU and ARPMAU 

The
presentation of our results of operations related to our Zedge App includes disclosure of two key performance indicators Monthly
Active Users (MAU) and Average Revenue Per Monthly Active User (ARPMAU). MAU is a key performance indicator that we define as the number
of unique users that used our Zedge App during the previous 30-day period, which is important to understanding the size of our active
user base which is a main driver of our revenue. Changes and trends in MAU are useful for measuring the general health of our business,
gauging both present and potential users/customers experience, assessing the efficacy of product improvements and marketing campaigns
and overall user engagement. 

ARPMAU
is defined as (i) the total revenue derived from Zedge App in a monthly period, divided by (ii) MAU in that same period. ARPMAU for a
particular time period longer than one month is the average ARPMAU for each month during that period. ARPMAU is valuable because it provides
insight into how well we monetize our users and, changes and trends in ARPMAU are indications of how effective our monetization investments
are. 

MAU
decreased 12.3 in the three months ended October 31, 2024 when compared to the same period a year ago. As of October 31, 2024, users
in emerging markets represented about 78.0 of our MAU, as compared to 78.2 from the same period a year ago. 

ARPMAU
for the three months ended October 31, 2024 increased 22.1 when compared to the same period a year ago, primarily due to the increase
in price per advertising impression from the same period a year ago, which was driven by increased competition for our ad inventory as
well as strong year-over-year subscription revenue growth. Subscription revenue and subscription billings for the three months ended
October 31, 2024 increased 21.1 and 56.0 , respectively, when compared to the same period a year ago, as discussed below. 

The
following tables present the MAU Zedge App and ARPMAU Zedge App for the three months ended October 31, 2024 as compared

GuruShots-MAPs
and ARPMAP 

The
presentation of our results of operations related to our GuruShots segment includes disclosure of two key performance indicators as discussed
below: 

Monthly
Active Payers MAPs ). We define a MAP as a unique active user on the GuruShots app or GuruShots.com in a
month who completed at least one in-app purchase IAP during that time period. MAPs for a time period longer than one
month are the average MAPs for each month during that period. We estimate the number of MAPs by aggregating certain data from third-party
attribution platforms. MAP is a key performance indicator because it shows the size of GuruShots active paying user base which
is a main driver of GuruShots revenue. Changes and trends in MAP are useful for measuring the general health of GuruShots 
business, gauging both present and potential users/customers experience, assessing the efficacy of product improvements and marketing
campaigns and overall user engagement. 

Average
Revenue Per Monthly Active Payer ARPMAP ). We define ARPMAP as (i) the total revenue from IAPs
derived from GuruShots and GuruShots.com in a monthly period, divided by (ii) MAPs in that same period. ARPMAP for a particular time
period longer than one month is the average ARPMAP for each month during that period. ARPMAP shows how efficiently we are monetizing
each MAP. 

MAP
decreased 25.9 in the three months ended October 31, 2024 when compared to the same period a year ago, primarily attributable to Apple s
App Tracking Transparence ATT framework which impedes our ability to invest in paid user acquisition PUA campaigns profitably in terms of return on ad spend or ROAS ). As such, we continued to scale back our PUA spend for GuruShots
while testing new campaigns and creatives in order to unearth attractive ROAS scaling opportunities. ARPMAP decreased 15.4 to 43.3
in the three months ended October 31, 2024 from 51.2 in the three months ended October 31, 2023 

The
following table shows our MAP and ARPMAP for the three months ended October 31, 2024 and 2023.

The
following charts present the MAP and ARPMAP GuruShots for the consecutive eight quarters ended October 31, 2024: 

Our
KPIs related to GuruShots are not based on any standardized industry methodology and are not necessarily calculated in the same manner
that other companies or third parties may use to calculate these or similarly titled measures. The numbers that we use to calculate MAP
and ARPMAP are derived from data that we generate internally. While these numbers are based on what we believe to be reasonable judgments
and estimates for the applicable period of measurement, there are inherent challenges in measuring usage and engagement. We regularly
review and may adjust our processes for calculating our internal metrics to improve their accuracy.

and end of the period to subscription revenue recognized in the same period. Subscription billings is a performance measure that we believe
provides useful information to our management and investors as it allows us to better track the growth of the subscription-based portion
of our business, which is a critical part of our business plan.

Three
months Ended October 31, 2024 Compared to Three months Ended October 31, 2023 

For
the three months ended October 31, 2024, our advertising revenue decreased 1.3 compared to the same period in the prior year primarily
due to a 12.3 decrease in MAU partially offset by an increase in price per advertising impression paid by the advertisers on our platform
when compared to the same period a year ago, which was driven by increased competition for our ad inventory. 

For
the three months ended October 31, 2024, our subscription revenue increased 21.1 , and our subscription billings increased 56.0 compared
to the same period in the prior year primarily due to the introduction of our iOS subscription offering in April 2023 and the lifetime
subscription product for Android users we rolled out in August 2023. 

For
the three months ended October 31, 2024, our other revenue increased 122.5 compared to the same period in the prior year primarily due
to the increase in Zedge Premium net revenue. For the three months ended October 31, 2024, Zedge Premium net revenue increased 141.7 
compared to the same period in the prior year primarily attributable to additional revenue from certain AI generative features we rolled
out in our Zedge App in fiscal 2024. 

For
the three months ended October 31, 2024, digital goods and services revenue declined 31.8 compared to the same period in the prior year
primarily due to the 25.9 decrease in GuruShots MAP coupled with 15.4 decrease in ARPMAP for the corresponding periods. 

Direct
cost of revenues . Direct cost of revenues consists primarily of content hosting and content delivery costs.

Direct
cost of revenues decreased 5.1 in the three months ended October 31, 2024 compared to the same period in the prior year primarily due
to the revamping of our backend infrastructure implemented during fiscal 2023. As a percentage of revenue, direct cost of revenues in
the three months ended October 31, 2024 declined to 6.4 from 6.9 for the same period in the prior year. 

Selling,
general and administrative expense . Selling, general and administrative expense SG A consists mainly of payroll
and benefits, stock-based compensation expense (as discussed below), PUA expenses, third-party payment processing fee relate to in-app
purchases, marketing, consulting, professional fees, software licensing SaaS ), recruiting fees, facilities and public
company related expenses.

SG A
expense increased 23.8 in the three months ended October 31, 2024 compared to the same period in the prior year primarily due to higher
PUA, higher compensation expenses (resulting primarily from lower capitalized software and technology development costs) and higher platform
fee paid to Google and Apple offset by lower discretionary spends and lower stock-based compensation expense. In the three months ended
October 31, 2024, we ramped up PUA for our Zedge App significantly but scaled back PUA spend for GuruShots as compared to the same period
in the prior year. We expect to continue our investment in PUA for our Zedge App in the near term provided that the ROAS remains compelling.
As a percentage of revenue, SG A expense in the three months ended October 31, 2024 was 94.6 compared to 77.7 in the three months
ended October 31, 2023. 

Global
headcount as of October 31, 2024 totaled 102 (including 28 at GuruShots) compared to 95 (including 29 at GuruShots) as of October 31,
2023 with the majority of our employees currently based in Lithuania and Israel.

 -25.2 

Stock-based
compensation expenses decreased 25.2 in the three months ended October 31, 2024 compared to the same period in the prior year. The decrease
was primarily attributable to the lower compensation expense related to the DSU grants with both service and market conditions which
are recognized based on the graded vesting method. Certain stock options, DSUs and restricted stock grants are more fully described in
Note 7 Stock-Based Compensation to the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements included in Item 1 to Part I
of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. 

Depreciation
and amortization . Depreciation and amortization consist mainly of amortization of intangible assets in connection with the GuruShots
and Emojipedia acquisitions and capitalized software and technology development costs of our internal developers on various projects
that we invested in specific to the various platforms on which we operate our service.

offsetting the accrued tax benefit of 66,000 based on an estimated effective tax rate of 22.7 . 

In

an effective tax rate of 108 which is higher than the statutory rate primarily due to discrete tax items of 128,000 associated with
the vesting of restricted stock and DSUs in the prior period.

For
the three months ended October 31, 2024, our income from operations related to the Zedge Marketplace decreased to 0.9 million from 1.7
million for the same period in the prior year, primarily due to higher SG A expenses incurred in the current period. 

For
the three months ended October 31, 2024, our loss from operations related to GuruShots was 1.4 million compared to a loss of 1.3
million for the same period in the prior year, primarily due to lower revenue in the current period coupled with higher SG A (primarily
attributable to lower capitalized software and technology development costs) and offset by the decrease in amortization expenses related
to intangible assets impairment as discussed above.

Liquidity
and Capital Resources 

General

At October
31, 2024, we had cash and cash equivalents of 20.2 million and working capital (current assets less current liabilities) of 17.5 million,
compared to 20.0 million and 17.7 million, respectively, at July 31, 2024. We expect that our cash and cash equivalents on hand and
our cash flow from operations will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash requirements for the twelve-month period ending December
16, 2025. We maintain a revolving credit facility of 4 million, including a foreign exchange contract facility of up to 7.5 million
with WAB, as discussed below under Financing Activities and in Note 10, Term Loan and Revolving Credit Facility , to the unaudited

Operating
Activities 

Our
cash flow from operations varies significantly from quarter to quarter and from year to year, depending on our operating results and
the timing of operating cash receipts and payments, specifically trade accounts receivable and trade accounts payable. Cash provided
by operating activities decreased by 90,000 in the three months ended October 31, 2024 to 1.2 million compared to 1.3 million in the
same period in the prior year, primarily attributable to a higher net loss before accounting for the acquisition related charges and
changes in assets and liabilities. 

Changes
in Trade Accounts Receivable 

Gross
trade accounts receivable decreased 0.2 million to 3.2 million at October 31, 2024 from 3.4 million at July 31, 2024, primarily due
to lower revenue in the preceding two months ended October 31, 2024 when compared to the same period ended July 31, 2024. 

Investing
Activities 

Cash
used in investing activities in the three months ended October 31, 2024 and 2024 consisted primarily of capitalized software and technology
development costs related to various projects that we invested in specific to the various platforms on which we operate our service. 

Financing
Activities 

In
the three months ended October 31, 2024 and 2023, we purchased 6,903 shares and 6,328 shares, respectively, of our Class B common stock
from certain employees for 22,000 and 13,000, respectively, to satisfy tax withholding obligations in connection with the vesting of
DSUs. 

In
the three months ended October 31, 2024 and 2023, we repurchased - in connection with the share repurchase program - 219,573 shares and
0 shares, respectively, of our Class B common stock for approximately 782,000 and 0, respectively. 

25 

We
do not anticipate paying dividends on our common stock until we achieve sustainable profitability and retain certain minimum cash reserves.
The payment of dividends in any specific period will be at the sole discretion of our Board of Directors. 

Concentration
of Credit Risk and Significant Customers 

Historically,
we have had very little or no bad debt, which is common with other platforms of our size that derive their revenue from mobile advertising,
as we aggressively manage our collections and perform due diligence on our customers. In addition, the majority of our revenue is derived
from large, credit-worthy customers, e.g. Google, Facebook, Vungle and AppLovin, and we terminate our services with smaller customers
immediately upon balances becoming past due. Since these smaller customers rely on us to derive their own revenue, they generally pay
their outstanding balances on a timely basis. 

In
the three months ended October 31, 2024, we had only one large customer, and that customer represented 30 of our revenue for the period.
In the three months ended October 31, 2023, there were two customers that represented 30 and 11 of our revenue, respectively. At October
31, 2024, three customers represented 43 , 12 and 11 of our accounts receivable balance, respectively. At July 31, 2024, three customers
represented 37 , 15 and 10 of our accounts receivable balance, respectively. All of these significant customers were advertising exchanges
operated by leading companies, and the receivables represent many smaller amounts due from their advertisers. 

Contractual
Obligations and Other Commercial Commitments 

Smaller
reporting companies are not required to provide the information required by this item. 

Off-Balance
Sheet Arrangements 

At
October 31, 2024, we did not have any off-balance sheet arrangements, as defined in relevant SEC regulations that are reasonably
likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital
resources. 

Item 3.
Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risks 

Smaller
reporting companies are not required to provide the information required by this item. 

Item 4.
Controls and Procedures

level as of October 31, 2024. 

Changes

the quarter ended October 31, 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control
over financial reporting.

Item 2.
Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds 

In
October 2021, our Board of Directors authorized a repurchase program of up to 1.5 million shares of our Class B common stock at a maximum
aggregate purchase price of 3 million. In September 2024, upon the completion of the initial 3.0 million repurchase program, our Board
of Directors authorized additional 5 million for the repurchase program with no limitation on the number of shares that may be repurchased.
Repurchases may be made from time to time through open market purchases or through privately negotiated transactions, subject to market
conditions, applicable legal requirements and other relevant factors. Open market repurchases may be structured to occur in accordance
with the requirements of Rule 10b-18. We may also, from time to time, enter into Rule 10b5-1 trading plans to facilitate repurchases
of its shares. The repurchase program does not obligate us to acquire any particular amount of our Class B common stock, has no expiration
date and may be modified, suspended, or terminated at any time at our discretion.
