 of the equity interests in Motion Recruitment Partners, LLC ("MRP") by way of a merger with MRP Merger Sub, Inc. ("Merger Sub"), a newly-formed, wholly owned subsidiary of the Company, with and into MRP Topco ("Topco"), the indirect parent company of MRP and Littlejohn Fund V, L.P. ("Littlejohn"), with Topco surviving the merger (the "Merger"). MRP is a parent company to a group of leading global talent solutions providers and the acquisition is expected to strengthen the scale and capabilities of Kelly's solutions portfolio. Under terms of the merger agreement, the million purchase price was adjusted for estimated cash held by MRP at the closing date and estimated working capital adjustments, resulting in the Company paying cash of million. The acquisition was funded with cash on hand and available credit facilities (see Debt footnote). Total consideration included million of contingent consideration related to an earnout payment with a maximum potential cash payment of million in the event certain financial metrics are met per the terms of the agreement. The earnout payment is based on a multiple of gross profit in excess of an agreed-upon amount during the earnout period, defined as the 12 months ending March 31, 2025, and any necessary payment is due to the seller in the second quarter of 2025. The initial fair value of the earnout was established using a Monte Carlo simulation model and is reassessed on a quarterly basis (see Fair Value Measurements footnote). In the third quarter of 2024, the Company recorded a payable in accounts payable and accrued liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet for a post-close net working capital adjustment of million which will be paid in the fourth quarter of 2024. The merger agreement contains representations and warranties and covenants customary for a transaction of this nature.

 The fair value of the acquired receivables represents the contractual value net of the allowance for potentially uncollectible accounts. Included in the assets purchased in the MRP acquisition was million of intangible assets, made up of million in customer relationships, million associated with MRP's trade names, and million for non-compete agreements. The customer relationships are amortized over years with no residual value, the trade names are amortized over - years with no residual value, and the non-compete agreements are amortized over with no residual value. Goodwill generated from the acquisition was primarily attributable to expanding market potential and the expected revenue and operational synergies and was assigned to the SET operating segment (see Goodwill footnote). None of the goodwill generated from the acquisition is expected to be deductible for tax purposes. 
 
 MRP's results of operations are included in the SET segment. For the third quarter-end 2024, our consolidated revenues and net earnings include million and million from MRP, respectively. For September year-to-date 2024, our consolidated revenues and net earnings include million and million from MRP, respectively.

 million, or million net of cash disposed, which is included in investing activities in the consolidated statements of cash flows. The Company expects to receive additional net cash proceeds to reflect the cash-free, debt-free transaction basis, as well as working capital and other adjustments. The Company does not expect to receive any proceeds from the contingent consideration opportunity associated with the transaction. In the first quarter of 2024, the Company recorded a euro-denominated receivable from Gi of million representing the adjustments that were determinable and expected to be received. In the second quarter of 2024, the Company recorded negative working capital and other adjustments of million, which reduced the net receivable from Gi to million. As of the third quarter-end 2024, the net receivable is million, with the change of million from the second quarter reflecting the foreign currency remeasurement. The Company is actively reconciling the receivable in accordance with the purchase agreement and expects it to be settled upon completion of this process. The receivable is included in prepaid expenses and other current assets in the consolidated balance sheet and included in the gain on the transaction. The total gain on the transaction through third quarter-end 2024 is million, which is recorded in the gain on sale of EMEA staffing operations in the consolidated statements of earnings. 
 
 The disposal group did not meet the requirements to be classified as discontinued operations as the sale did not have a material effect on the Company's operations and did not represent a strategic shift in the Company's strategy. Our consolidated earnings from operations for the third quarter 2023 and September year-to-date 2023 included earnings of million and a loss of million, respectively, from the EMEA staffing operations.

 million with a net payable associated with the forward contract of million recorded in accounts payable and accrued liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet as of third quarter-end 2024. 
 
 On November 2, 2023, the Company entered into a foreign currency forward contract with a notional amount of million to manage the foreign currency risk associated with the sale of our EMEA staffing operations, which was completed on January 2, 2024. This contract was not designated as a hedging instrument; therefore, it was marked-to-market and the changes in fair value were recognized in earnings. The Company's foreign currency forward contract was valued using observable inputs, such as foreign currency exchange rates, and was considered a level 2 liability. The Company recorded an unrealized loss of million for the year-ended 2023 and had a net liability associated with the forward contract of million as of year-end 2023. The Company settled the forward contract on January 5, 2024 for million of cash. Accordingly, the Company recognized a gain of million in the first quarter of 2024 in gain on forward contract on the consolidated statements of earnings, which partially offsets the million loss recognized in 2023, for a total loss of million on the contract. 
 
 Interest Rate Swaps 
 
 On July 17, 2024, the Company entered into interest rate swaps with a notional value of million each to manage fluctuations on our securitization facility due to Secured Overnight Financing Rate ("SOFR") variances (see Debt footnote). These contracts were not designated as hedging instruments; therefore, the mark-to-market fair value changes and the cash settlements on the swaps are recognized in earnings. The Company's interest rate swaps were valued with assistance from a third party based on pricing models using observable inputs, such as SOFR forward rates, and are considered level 2 liabilities, which will be remeasured quarterly. As of third quarter-end 2024, the Company recorded a liability totaling million related to the mark-to-market fair value change of the interest rate swaps with million in accounts payable and accrued liabilities and million in other long-term liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet. In the third quarter of 2024, the Company recorded a total loss of million. This loss includes million related to mark-to-market changes in fair value, which was partially offset by the impact of cash settlements of million, in other income (expense), net in the consolidated statements of earnings. 
 
 Indemnification liabilities 
 
 As of third quarter-end 2024, the Company had an indemnification liability totaling million relating to the sale of our EMEA staffing operations in January 2024. The liability is included in other long-term liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet and the associated expense is included in the gain on sale of EMEA staffing operations in the consolidated statements of earnings. As part of the sale, the Company agreed to indemnify the buyer for losses and costs incurred in connection with certain events or occurrences for an indefinite term. The Company's maximum exposure under these indemnifications is not estimable at this time due to uncertainties to potential outcomes and the facts and circumstances involved in the agreement. Management believes the risk of material exposure is remote. The initial valuation of the indemnification liability was established using a discounted cash flow methodology based on probability weighted-average cash flows discounted by weighted-average cost of capital. The valuation, which represents the fair value, is considered a level 3 liability and is measured on a recurring basis. During the third quarter of 2024, the Company recognized an increase of million to the indemnification liability related to exchange rate fluctuations. 
 
 As of third quarter-end 2024, the Company had an indemnification liability totaling million with million in accounts payable and accrued liabilities and million in other long-term liabilities, and million at year-end 2023, with million in accounts payable and accrued liabilities and million in other long-term liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet related to the 2020 sale of the Brazil operations. As part of the sale, the Company agreed to indemnify the buyer for losses and costs incurred in connection with certain events or occurrences initiated within a six-year period after closing. The aggregate losses for which the Company will provide indemnification shall not exceed million. The valuation of the indemnification liability was established using a discounted cash flow methodology based on probability weighted-average cash flows discounted by weighted-average cost of capital. The valuation, which represents the fair value, is considered a level 3 liability, and is being measured on a recurring basis. During September year-to-date 2024 and 2023, the Company recognized

 Earnout liabilities 
 
 The Company recorded an earnout liability relating to the 2024 acquisition of MRP totaling million in accounts payable and accrued liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet (see Acquisition and Disposition footnote). The valuation of the earnout liability was initially established using the Monte Carlo simulation model and represented the fair value and is considered a level 3 liability. The maximum total cash payment which may be due related to the earnout liability is million. 
 
 The Company had previously recorded an earnout liability relating to the 2020 acquisition of Greenwood/Asher. The initial valuation of the earnout liability was established using a Black Scholes model and represented the fair value and was considered a level 3 liability. During the first quarter of 2023, the Company paid the remaining earnout liability totaling million, representing the year two portion of the earnout. In the consolidated statements of cash flows, million of the payment is reflected as a financing activity representing the initial fair value of the earnout liability, with the remainder flowing through operating activities. 
 
 Equity Investment Without Readily Determinable Fair Value 
 
 On March 1, 2022, the Company sold the majority of its investment in PersolKelly Pte. Ltd. (the "JV"). Prior to February 2022, the Company had a ownership interest in the JV, a staffing services business currently operating in geographies in the Asia-Pacific region. The Company holds a interest in the JV, which is measured using the measurement alternative for equity investments without a readily determinable fair value. The measurement alternative represents cost, less impairment, plus or minus observable price changes.

Interest expense ) ) ) ) Foreign exchange gains (losses) ) ) ) Other ) ) Other income (expense), net ) ) 
 The increase in Interest expense for the third quarter of 2024 reflects the increase in the Company's long-term debt (see Debt footnote). Included in Other for September year-to-date 2024 is million of transaction costs related to the acquisition of MRP (see Acquisition and Disposition footnote). Included in Other for September year-to-date 2023 is a gain of million for the receipt of earnout proceeds in connection with an investment that was sold in 2021. 

million for the third quarter of 2024 and income tax benefit was million for the third quarter of 2023. Income tax expense was million for September year-to-date 2024 and income tax benefit was million for September year-to-date 2023. The quarterly and year-to-date changes are primarily driven by the release of Germany s valuation allowance in the third quarter of 2023. 
 
 Our tax expense is affected by recurring items, such as the amount of pretax income and its mix by jurisdiction, U.S. work opportunity credits and the change in cash surrender value of tax-exempt investments in life insurance policies. It is also affected by discrete items that may occur in any given period but are not consistent from period to period, such as tax law changes, changes in judgment regarding the realizability of deferred tax assets and the tax effects of stock compensation. 
 
 The Company provides valuation allowances against deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax asset will not be realized. The Company continues to monitor its partial foreign tax credit valuation allowance for potential changes in the near term.

 million and million, respectively, of which million was held for sale at year-end 2023. 
 
 The Company maintains insurance coverage which may cover certain losses. When losses exceed the applicable policy deductible and realization of recovery of the loss from existing insurance policies is deemed probable, the Company records receivables from the insurance company for the excess amount, which are included in prepaid expenses and other current assets and other assets in the consolidated balance sheet. At third quarter-end 2024 and year-end 2023, the related insurance receivables amounted to million and million, respectively. 
 
 The Company estimates the aggregate range of reasonably possible losses, in excess of amounts accrued, is million to million as of third quarter-end 2024. This range includes matters where a liability has been accrued but it is reasonably possible that the ultimate loss may exceed the amount accrued and for matters where a loss is believed to be reasonably possible, but a liability has not been accrued. The aggregate range only represents matters in which we are currently able to estimate a range of loss and does not represent our maximum loss exposure. The estimated range is subject to significant judgment and a variety of assumptions and only based upon currently available information. For other matters, we are currently not able to estimate the reasonably possible loss or range of loss. 
 
 While the ultimate outcome of these matters cannot be predicted with certainty, we believe that the resolution of any such proceedings will not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.

 reportable segments in 2024, (1) Professional Industrial, (2) Science, Engineering Technology, (3) Education, and (4) Outsourcing Consulting, reflect the specialty services the Company provides to customers and represent how the business is organized internally. Prior to 2024, the Company also had an International operating segment. Beginning in the first quarter of 2024, the Company's organizational structure no longer includes the International segment following the sale of the EMEA staffing operations in January 2024. Our Mexico operations, which were previously in our International segment, are now included in the Professional Industrial segment. Professional Industrial segment information for the prior year has been recast to conform to the new structure. Intersegment revenue represents revenue earned between the reportable segments and is eliminated from total segment revenue from services. 
 In addition to the change in our segment structure in the first quarter of 2024, we reassessed the allocation of corporate expenses to the operating segments and allocated additional costs which are attributable to the business from corporate. 
 In the first quarter of 2024, the Company changed the primary segment profitability measure from earnings from operations to a business unit profit measure that excludes depreciation and amortization. This change provides management greater visibility into the financial performance of the segments and how they contribute to the Company's overall performance. 
 Prior periods have been recast to reflect the current period allocation method and new segment profitability measurement. The update had no impact on the consolidated financial information.

Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. 
 
 Executive Overview 
 
 As the year progresses, challenging staffing market dynamics continued as employers in most sectors maintained a cautious approach to managing their workforces, deferring hiring decisions, managing existing headcount through attrition, and in some cases choosing not to backfill open roles amid ongoing economic uncertainty. These dynamics put pressure on our business, but we remain focused on capturing growth where it exists and positioning our resources to take advantage of opportunities when conditions improve. 
 
 We remain focused on the future and are building on the aggressive actions we took in 2023 as part of our transformation journey. We continue to build on the goals of our transformation activities to improve Kelly s profitability and accelerate growth over the long term. Our business unit and enterprise function teams, together with the Transformation Management Office, continue to make progress on multiple initiatives to drive organizational efficiency and effectiveness. 
 
 We are also committed to finding new avenues of growth. This includes a refreshed go-to-market strategy with a comprehensive approach to delivering the full suite of Kelly solutions to our large enterprise customers that is intended to capture a greater share of wallet as we move through 2024. We also remain committed to delivering the highest quality of service to all customers regardless of spend or size. In our P I segment, for example, we have enhanced our local delivery model and rolled out our Kelly Now mobile application across the U.S. to meet the needs of clients and talent. 
 
 We completed the sale of our European staffing operations on January 2, 2024 and on June 12, 2024 announced the sale of the Ayers Group, a division of our OCG segment. We move forward with a streamlined operating model focused on North American staffing and solutions and global MSP and RPO solutions. 
 
 To further sharpen our focus on higher-margin, higher-growth specialties, we completed the acquisition of Motion Recruitment Partners, LLC MRP on May 31, 2024. The acquisition of MRP is expected to strengthen the scale and capabilities of Kelly s staffing and consulting solutions across technology, telecommunications, and government specialties in North America, and RPO solutions globally. 
 
 Together these changes represent structural shifts in Kelly s operations and are delivering meaningful improvement to the Company s EBITDA margin which we expect to continue as we move forward in 2024 and beyond. 

Financial Measures 
 
 Reported percentage changes were computed based on actual amounts in thousands of dollars. 
 
 EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization) and EBITDA margin (EBITDA divided by revenue from services) are measures used for understanding the Company's ability to generate cash flow and for judging overall operating performance. EBITDA measures are non-GAAP (Generally Accepted Accounting Principles) measures and are used to supplement measures in accordance with GAAP. Our non-GAAP measures may be calculated differently from those provided by other companies, limiting their usefulness for comparison purposes. Non-GAAP measures should not be considered a substitute for, or superior to, measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. 
 
 Days sales outstanding DSO represents the number of days that sales remain unpaid for the period being reported. DSO is calculated by dividing average net sales per day (based on a rolling three-month period) into trade accounts receivable, net of allowances at the period end. Although secondary supplier revenues are recorded on a net basis (net of secondary supplier expense), secondary supplier revenue is included in the daily sales calculation in order to properly reflect the gross revenue amounts billed to the customer. 
 
 NM (not meaningful) in the following tables is used in place of percentage changes where: the change is in excess of 500 , the change involves a comparison between earnings and loss amounts, or the comparison amount is zero.

 Third Quarter Results 
 
 Revenue from services in the third quarter decreased 7.1 , which primarily reflects the January 2, 2024 sale of our EMEA staffing operations, partially offset by an increase related to the acquisition of MRP in May 2024. Excluding the impact from the sale and the acquisition, revenue from services was flat year-over-year with decreases in the Science, Engineering Technology and Professional Industrial segments offset by increases in the Education and Outsourcing Consulting segments. Compared to the third quarter of 2023 and excluding the impact from the sale and acquisition, revenue from staffing services was flat to the prior year and revenue from outcome-based services decreased 2.2 . In addition, revenue from talent solutions increased 6.0 and permanent placement revenue decreased 30.8 from the prior year, excluding the impact from the sale and the acquisition. 
 
 Gross profit decreased 3.0 largely driven by the sale of our EMEA staffing operations, partially offset by an increase related to the acquisition of MRP. Excluding the impact from the sale and the acquisition, gross profit decreased 6.4 . The gross profit rate increased 100 basis points to 21.4 and was favorably impacted by the sale of our EMEA staffing operations and the acquisition of MRP. Excluding the impact from the sale and acquisition, the gross profit rate declined 140 basis points. These decreases are due primarily to business mix and a decrease in permanent placement revenue, partially offset by a decrease in employee-related costs. Permanent placement revenue has very low direct costs of services and has a disproportionate impact on gross profit rates. The gross profit rate decreased in all segments excluding the sale and the acquisition. 
 
 Total SG A expenses decreased 4.1 , primarily due to the sale of our EMEA staffing operations, partially offset by the acquisition of MRP. Excluding these impacts, SG A expenses decreased 7.0 . SG A expenses in the third quarter of 2024 include 6.1 million of integration costs related to initiatives to integrate MRP and aligning Company processes and 3.1 million of transaction-related costs arising from the sale of our EMEA staffing operations and acquisition of MRP. Included in SG A expenses in the third quarter of 2023 were 15.4 million of transformation and restructuring charges. Actions taken in the third quarter of 2023 were a continuation of the actions that were announced in the second quarter of 2023 as part of the 
 33 

comprehensive transformation initiative. In addition, excluding the impact from the sale and acquisition, as well as transaction, integration, transformation, and restructuring charges, SG A expenses decreased 4.2 primarily due to proactive resource management and lower variable, performance-based incentive compensation expenses in response to lower revenue volume. 
 
 Earnings from operations for the third quarter of 2024 totaled 2.6 million, compared to 0.1 million in the third quarter of 2023. The increase is primarily related to the impact of lower SG A and partially offset by lower revenue compared to the prior year. 
 
 Income tax benefit was 2.6 million for the third quarter of 2024 compared to 4.9 million for the third quarter of 2023. The change primarily relates to the benefit of a deferred tax valuation allowance release in 2023 partially offset by the impact of non-taxable income related to company-owned life insurance assets in 2024. 
 
 The net earnings for the period were 0.8 million, compared to 6.6 million for the third quarter of 2023. 
 
 September Year-to-Date Results 
 
 Revenue from services in the first nine months of 2024 decreased 12.8 , which primarily reflects the January 2, 2024 sale of our EMEA staffing operations, partially offset by an increase related to the acquisition of MRP in May 2024. Excluding the impact from the sale and the acquisition, revenue from services decreased 0.8 . This decline reflects a revenue decline in the Professional Industrial and Science, Engineering Technology segments, partially offset by increases in the Education and Outsourcing Consulting segments excluding the acquisition. Compared to the first nine months of 2023 and excluding the impact from the sale and acquisition, revenue from staffing services was flat to the prior year and revenue from outcome-based services decreased 5.1 . In addition, revenue from talent solutions increased 1.1 and permanent placement revenue decreased 28.5 from the prior year, excluding the impact from the sale and the acquisition. 
 
 Gross profit decreased 11.4 largely driven by the sale of our EMEA staffing operations, partially offset by an increase related to the acquisition of MRP. Excluding the impact from the sale and the acquisition, gross profit decreased 6.4 . The gross profit rate increased 30 basis points to 20.4 and was favorably impacted by the sale of our EMEA staffing operations and the acquisition of MRP. Excluding the impact from the sale and the acquisition, the gross profit rate declined 120 basis points. These decreases are due primarily to business mix and a decrease in permanent placement revenue. Permanent placement revenue has very low direct costs of services and has a disproportionate impact on gross profit rates. The gross profit rate decreased in all segments excluding the sale and the acquisition. 
 
 Total SG A expenses decreased 14.6 , primarily due to the sale of our EMEA staffing operations, partially offset by the acquisition of MRP. Excluding these impacts, SG A expenses decreased 9.2 . Included in SG A expenses in the first nine months of 2024 and 2023 were 6.4 million and 27.6 million of restructuring charges, respectively. Actions taken in both periods were a continuation of the actions that were announced in the second quarter of 2023 as part of the comprehensive transformation initiative. In addition, restructuring actions taken in the first quarter of 2023 reflected management undertaking actions to further our cost management efforts in response to the demand levels and reflected a repositioning of our P I staffing business to better capitalize on opportunities in local markets. SG A expenses in 2024 also include 10.3 million of transaction-related costs arising from the sale of our EMEA staffing operations and acquisition of MRP and 6.1 million of integration costs related to initiatives to integrate MRP and aligning Company processes. Excluding the impact from the sale and acquisition, as well as transaction, integration, and restructuring charges, SG A expenses decreased 8.8 primarily due to structural workforce reductions as part of our transformation initiatives, as well as proactive resource management and lower variable, performance-based incentive compensation expenses in response to lower revenue volume. 
 
 The gain on sale of EMEA staffing operations relates to the completion of the sale in January 2024 in which we have recognized a gain of 1.6 million in the first nine months of 2024. The gain on sale of assets represents the sale of the Company's Ayers Group in the second quarter of 2024 in which we recognized a gain of 5.4 million in the first nine months of 2024. 
 
 Impairment of assets in the second quarter of 2024 represents the impairment of certain right-of-use assets related to our leased headquarters facility. Impairment of assets in the third quarter of 2023 represents the impairment of right-of-use assets related to an unoccupied office space lease exited in the quarter. 
 
 Earnings from operations for the first nine months of 2024 totaled 41.6 million, compared to 17.0 million in the first nine months of 2023. The increase is primarily related to the impact of lower SG A compared to the prior year, the gain on sale of Ayers Group and the gain on sale of our EMEA staffing operations, partially offset by higher asset impairment charges and the impact of lower revenue compared to the prior year. 
 34 

Gain on forward contract of 1.2 million represents the gain recognized in the first quarter of 2024 for the settlement of the foreign currency forward contract in January 2024 that was entered into in 2023 relating to the sale of the EMEA staffing operations. 
 
 Income tax expense was 2.5 million for the first nine months of 2024 compared to an income tax benefit of 5.0 million for the first nine months of 2023. The change primarily relates to changes in pre-tax income and the impact of a deferred tax valuation allowance release in 2023. 
 
 The net earnings for the period were 31.2 million, compared to 25.0 million for the first nine months of 2023.

 Third Quarter Results 
 Professional Industrial revenue from services decreased 2.0 . The decrease was due primarily to a 2.7 decline in revenue from staffing services resulting from lower hours volume, partially offset by higher bill rates. Revenue from outcome-based services was flat year-over-year while revenue from permanent placement fees declined 24.1 as a result of continued lower market demand. 
 
 Science, Engineering Technology revenue from services increased 37.1 . The revenue increase was primarily driven by the acquisition of MRP. Excluding the acquisition, revenue from services decreased 5.1 , primarily due to declines in hours volume in our staffing specialties, partially offset by higher bill rates. Excluding the acquisition, revenue in our outcome-based services decreased 4.9 and permanent placement fees decreased 30.5 , reflecting continued lower market demand. 
 
 Education revenue from services increased 10.9 , driven by increased demand for our services as compared to a year ago, reflecting the impact of net new customer wins and the impact of higher fill rates. 
 
 Outsourcing Consulting revenue from services increased 6.0 as revenue increased in PPO, partially offset by declines in MSP and RPO.

 Third Quarter Results 
 
 Gross profit for the Professional Industrial segment decreased on lower revenue volume. In comparison to the prior year, the gross profit rate decreased by 40 basis points primarily due to declines in permanent placement revenues and business mix which were partially offset by lower employee-related costs. 
 
 The Science, Engineering Technology gross profit increased primarily as a result of the acquisition of MRP. The gross profit rate increased 190 basis points due to the acquisition of MRP which generates higher gross profit rates. This impact was partially offset by a 50 basis point decrease in the gross profit rate in other SET specialties reflecting lower permanent placement fees and business mix, partially offset by lower employee-related costs. 
 
 Gross profit for the Education segment was flat year-over-year despite higher revenue volume. The gross profit rate decreased 160 basis points due primarily to lower permanent placement fees, customer mix, and higher employee-related costs. 
 
 The Outsourcing Consulting gross profit decreased with a decrease in the gross profit rate. The gross profit rate decreased 630 basis points primarily due to a change in business mix within this segment and higher employee-related costs in PPO. The unfavorable business mix was primarily driven by declines in revenue in MSP and RPO, which generates higher margins and improving PPO revenue which generates lower margins.

Financial Condition 
 Historically, we have financed our operations through cash generated by operating activities and access to credit markets. Our working capital requirements are primarily generated from temporary employee payroll, which is generally paid weekly or monthly, and customer accounts receivable, which is generally outstanding for longer periods. Since receipts from customers lag payroll to temporary employees, working capital requirements increase substantially in periods of growth. Conversely, when economic activity slows, working capital requirements may substantially decrease. This may result in an increase in our operating cash flows; however, any such increase would not be sustainable in the event that an economic downturn continued for an extended period. 
 
 As highlighted in the consolidated statements of cash flows, our liquidity and available capital resources are impacted by four key components: cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash, operating activities, investing activities and financing activities. 
 
 Cash, Cash Equivalents and Restricted Cash 
 Cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash totaled 40.4 million at the end of the third quarter of 2024 and 126.5 million at year-end 2023. As further described below, we generated 11.9 million of cash from operating activities, used 355.5 million of cash for investing activities and generated 217.3 million of cash from financing activities. 
 
 Operating Activities 
 In the first nine months of 2024, we generated 11.9 million of net cash from operating activities, as compared to generating 33.4 million in the first nine months of 2023, primarily due to decreased working capital requirements. 
 
 Trade accounts receivable totaled 1.2 billion at the end of the third quarter of 2024. Global DSO was 64 d ays at the end of the third quarter of 2024 and 59 days at year-end 2023, including amounts held for sale, and 63 days at the end of the third quarter of 2023. 
 
 Our working capital position (total current assets less total current liabilities) was 516.5 million at the end of the third quarter of 2024 including the impact of our acquisition of MRP, a decrease of 90.2 million from year-end 2023, excluding amounts held for sale as of year-end 2023. Excluding the decrease in cash, working capital increased 2.8 million from year-end 2023. The current ratio (total current assets divided by total current liabilities) was 1.6 at the end of the third quarter of 2024 and at year-end 2023. 
 
 Investing Activities 
 In the first nine months of 2024, we used 355.5 million of cash for investing activities, as compared to using 10.8 million in the first nine months of 2023. Included in cash used from investing activities in the first nine months of 2024 is 427.4 million of cash used for the acquisition of MRP in May 2024, net of cash received, 9.1 million of cash used for capital expenditures, and 2.4 million of cash used for the settlement of the foreign currency forward contract in January 2024 in connection with the sale of the EMEA staffing operations, partially offset by 77.1 million of proceeds from the sale of the EMEA staffing operations, net of cash disposed and 4.3 million of proceeds from the sale of the Ayers Group. I ncluded in the cash used from investing activities in the first nine months of 2023 is 12.4 million of cash used for capital expenditures, partially offset by 2.0 million for the receipt of the final payment in connection with an investment that was sold in 2021. 
 
 Financing Activities 
 We generated 217.3 million of cash from financing activities in the first nine months of 2024, as compared to using 56.6 million in the first nine months of 2023. The cash generated from financing activities in the first nine months of 2024 is driven by the net borrowings of 228.2 million on the Company's credit facilities in connection with the acquisition of MRP. The cash used for financing activities in the first nine months of 2023 was primarily related to the buyback of the Company's common shares which represented repurchases of the Company's Class A common stock as part of the share repurchase program. Divi dends paid per common share were 0.075 in each of the first three quarters of 2024 and 2023. 
 
 Debt-to-total capital (total debt reported in the consolidated balance sheet divided by total debt plus stockholders equity) is a common ratio to measure the relative capital structure and leverage of the Company. Our ratio of debt-to-total capital was 15.1 at the end of the third quarter of 2024 and 0.0 at year-end 2023.

Critical Accounting Estimates 
 For a discussion of our critical accounting estimates, see Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in our 2023 Form 10-K. 

Contractual Obligations and Commercial Commitments 
 There were no significant changes to our contractual obligations and commercial commitments from those disclosed in the section Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in our 2023 Form 10-K. We have no material unrecorded commitments, losses, contingencies or guarantees associated with any related parties or unconsolidated entities. 

Liquidity 
 
 We expect to meet our ongoing short-term and long-term cash requirements principally through cash generated from operations, available cash and equivalents, securitization of customer receivables and committed unused credit facilities. The credit facilities, which were amended in the second quarter of 2024, now include an accordion feature to increase our combined borrowing capacity by 250.0 million as discussed in the Debt footnote in the notes to our consolidated financial statements. Additional funding sources could include additional bank facilities or sale of non-core assets. To meet significant cash requirements related to our nonqualified retirement plan, we may utilize proceeds from Company-owned life insurance policies. 
 
 We have historically managed our cash and debt closely to optimize our capital structure. As our cash balances build, we tend to pay down debt as appropriate, unless it is needed for organic or inorganic investments that align with our overall growth strategy. Conversely, when working capital needs grow, we tend to use corporate cash and cash available in the global cash pooling arrangement (the "Cash Pool") first, and then access our borrowing facilities. We expect our working capital requirements to increase if demand for our services increases. 
 
 We assess and monitor our liquidity and capital resources globally. We use the Cash Pool, intercompany loans, dividends, capital contributions, redemptions and local lines of credit to meet funding needs and allocate our capital resources among our various subsidiaries. We periodically review our foreign subsidiaries cash balances and projected cash needs. As part of those reviews, we may identify cash that we feel should be repatriated to optimize the Company s overall capital structure. As of the end of the third quarter of 2024, these reviews have not resulted in specific plans to repatriate a majority of our international cash balances. Following the sale of our EMEA staffing operations completed in the first quarter of 2024, discussed below, the Company continues to provide MSP, RPO and Functional Service Provider solutions in the EMEA region. Therefore, we expect much of our remaining international cash will be needed to fund working capital growth in our local operations. 
 
 On January 2, 2024, the Company completed the sale of its EMEA staffing operations to Gi Group Holdings S.P.A. and received cash proceeds of 110.6 million or 77.1 million net of cash disposed. The foreign currency forward contract that the Company entered into on November 2, 2023 to manage the foreign currency risk associated with the transaction was settled on January 5, 2024. A total loss of 2.4 million was realized upon settlement on the contract. The Company expects to receive additional cash proceeds related to the sale to reflect the cash-free, debt-free transaction basis, as well as working capital and other adjustments. The Company does not expect to receive any proceeds from the contingent consideration opportunity associated with the transaction. As of third quarter-end 2024, the Company has recorded a net receivable of 17.6 million. The Company is actively reconciling the receivable in accordance with the purchase agreement and expects it to be settled upon completion of this process. The Company entered into a foreign currency forward contract on February 8, 2024 to manage the foreign currency risk associated with the additional expected proceeds. The Company has recorded a net payable associated with this forward contract of 0.6 million as of third quarter-end 2024. See the Acquisition and Disposition footnote and the Fair Value Measurements footnote in the notes to our consolidated financial statements for more details. 
 
 On May 31, 2024, the Company indirectly acquired 100 of the equity interests in Motion Recruitment Partners, LLC ("MRP") for a purchase price of 425.0 million by way of a merger with MRP Merger Sub, Inc. ("Merger Sub"), a newly-formed, wholly owned subsidiary of the Company, with and into MRP Topco ("Topco"), the indirect parent company of MRP and Littlejohn Fund V, L.P. ("Littlejohn"), with Topco surviving the merger (the "Merger"). Under terms of the merger agreement, the purchase price was adjusted for estimated cash held by MRP at the closing date and estimated working capital adjustments, resulting in the Company paying cash of 440.0 million. The acquisition was funded with cash on hand and available credit 
 45 

facilities. Total consideration includes 3.4 million of contingent consideration related to an earnout payment with a maximum potential cash payment of 60.0 million per the terms of the agreement. The earnout payment is based on a multiple of gross profit in excess of an agreed-upon amount during the earnout period and any necessary payment is due to the seller in the second quarter of 2025. In the third quarter of 2024, the Company recorded a payable for a post-close net working capital adjustment of 1.4 million, which will be paid in the fourth quarter of 2024. See the Acquisition and Disposition footnote in the notes to our consolidated financial statements for more details. 
 
 As of the end of the third quarter of 2024, we had million of available capacity on our 150.0 million revolving credit facility and million of available capacity on our 250.0 million securitization facility. The revolving credit facility carried million of long-term borrowings on the term benchmark line of credit. The securitization facility carried million of long-term borrowings and million of standby letters of credit related to workers compensation. On July 17, 2024, we entered into a 50.0 million 12-month interest rate swap and a 50.0 million 18-month interest rate swap that effectively locked in the variable SOFR component of our interest rate for a portion of the long-term borrowings on the Securitization Facility at a fixed rate of 4.772 and 4.468 from the July 17, 2024 effective date through July 17, 2025 and January 17, 2026, respectively. As of third quarter-end 2024, the Company recorded a liability totaling million related to the mark-to-market fair value change of the interest rate swaps. See the Fair Value Measurements footnote and the Debt footnote in the notes to our consolidated financial statements for more details. 
 
 Together, the revolving credit and securitization facilities provide the Company with committed funding capacity that may be used for general corporate purposes subject to financial covenants and restrictions. We believe our cash flow from operations, the availability of liquidity under our credit facilities, including the accordion feature which allows us to increase our borrowing capacity and our ability to access capital from financial markets will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash requirements, while maintaining sufficient liquidity for normal operating purposes. As of the end of the third quarter of 2024, we met the debt covenants related to our revolving credit facility and securitization facility. 
 
 We monitor the credit ratings of our banking partners on a regular basis and have regular discussions with them. Based on our reviews and communications, we believe the risk of one or more of our banks not being able to honor commitments is insignificant. We also review the ratings and holdings of our money market funds and other investment vehicles regularly to ensure high credit quality and access to our invested cash.

in the Company s expectations. Certain risk factors are discussed more fully under Risk Factors in Part I, Item 1A of the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K. 

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk. 
 There have been no significant changes to our exposure management and procedures in relation to our market risk, foreign currency risk, and interest rate risk and procedures during the third quarter of 2024 and September year-to date 2024 as compared to the respective risk exposures and procedures disclosed in Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk, set forth in Part II Item 7A, of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, other than factors discussed below. 
 Foreign Currency 
 We are exposed to foreign currency risk primarily related to our foreign subsidiaries. Exchange rates impact the U.S. dollar value of our reported earnings, our investments in and held by subsidiaries, local currency denominated borrowings and intercompany transactions with and between subsidiaries. Our foreign subsidiaries primarily derive revenues and incur expenses within a single country and currency which, as a result, provide a natural hedge against currency risks in connection with normal business operations. Accordingly, changes in foreign currency rates vs. the U.S. dollar and euro generally do not impact local cash flows. Intercompany transactions which create foreign currency risk include services, royalties, loans, contributions and distributions. 
 On November 2, 2023, the Company entered into a foreign currency forward contract with a notional amount of million to manage the foreign currency risk associated with the sale of our EMEA staffing operations, which was completed on January 2, 2024. This contract was not designated as a hedging instrument; therefore, it was marked-to-market and the changes in fair value were recognized in earnings. An unrealized loss of 3.6 million associated with the forward contract was recorded as of year-end 2023. A total loss of 2.4 million was realized upon settlement on January 5, 2024; therefore, the Company recorded a gain of 1.2 million in the first quarter of 2024 (see Fair Value Measurements footnote in the notes to our consolidated financial statements for more details). 
 On February 8, 2024, the Company entered into a foreign currency forward contract with a notional amount of million to manage the foreign currency risk associated with the expected additional proceeds related to the sale of our EMEA staffing operations (see Acquisition and Disposition footnote in the notes to our consolidated financial statements). The expected proceeds are recorded as a euro-denominated receivable which is remeasured each period. The forward contract was designated as a fair value hedge, with the mark-to-market changes of the forward contract offsetting the mark-to-market changes of the receivable in the gain on sale of EMEA staffing operations in the consolidated statement of earnings. An unrealized loss of 0.6 million associated with the forward contract was recorded in the first nine months of 2024 (see Fair Value Measurements footnote in the notes to our consolidated financial statements for more details), which was settled in October 2024. 
 Interest Rates 
 We are exposed to interest rate risks through our use of our credit facilities and other local borrowings, when applicable. Due to our outstanding debt balance associated with our most recent acquisition, on July 17, 2024, we entered into a 50.0 million 12-month interest rate swap and a 50.0 million 18-month interest rate swap that effectively locked in the variable SOFR component of our interest rate for a portion of the long-term borrowings on the Securitization Facility at a fixed rate of 4.772 and 4.468 from its July 17, 2024 effective date through July 17, 2025 and January 17, 2026, respectively. A hypothetical fluctuation of 10 of market interest rates would not have had a material impact on 2024 third quarter earnings. 
 We are exposed to market risk as a result of our obligation to pay benefits under our nonqualified deferred compensation plan and our related investments in company-owned variable universal life insurance policies. The obligation to employees increases and decreases based on movements in the equity and debt markets. The investments in mutual funds, as part of the Company-owned variable universal life insurance policies, are designed to mitigate, but not eliminate, this risk with offsetting gains and losses.

Item 4. Controls and Procedures. 
 Based on their evaluation as of the end of the period covered by this Form 10-Q, the Company s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that the Company s disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934) are effective at a reasonable assurance level. 
 On May 31, 2024, we completed the acquisition of MRP (see Acquisition and Disposition footnote) and have implemented new processes and internal controls to assist us in the preparation and disclosure of financial information. Given the significance of the MRP acquisition and the complexity of systems and business processes, we intend to exclude the acquired MRP business from our assessment and report on internal control over financial reporting for the year ending December 29, 2024. 
 Other than the acquisition discussed above, there were no changes in the Company s internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the Company s most recent fiscal quarter that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company s internal control over financial reporting.

PART II. OTHER INFORMATION 

Item 1. Legal Proceedings. 
 The Company is continuously engaged in litigation, threatened ligation, claims, audits or investigations arising in the ordinary course of its business, such as matters alleging employment discrimination, wage and hour violations, claims for indemnification or liability, violations of privacy rights, anti-competition regulations, commercial and contractual disputes, and tax-related matters which could result in a material adverse outcome. We record accruals for loss contingencies when we believe it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. Such accruals are recorded in accounts payable and accrued liabilities and in accrued workers compensation and other claims in the consolidated balance sheet. The Company maintains insurance coverage which may cover certain claims. When claims exceed the applicable policy deductible and realization of recovery of the claim from existing insurance policies is deemed probable, the Company records receivables from the insurance company for the excess amount, which are included in prepaid expenses and other current assets and other assets in the consolidated balance sheet. 
 
 While the outcome of these matters currently pending cannot be predicted with certainty, we believe that the resolution of any such proceedings will not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. 
 
 In January 2018, the Hungarian Competition Authority (the "Authority") initiated proceedings against a local industry trade association and its members, due to alleged infringement of national competition regulations. The Authority announced its decision on December 18, 2020, levying a fine against the trade association with joint and several secondary liability placed on the 20 member companies. The Authority apportioned secondary liability against us as a member company to be approximately 300,000. Certain member companies exercised their right to challenge the decision in Court. On or about October 3, 2023, the Court issued its decision which repealed the Authority's decision and ordered a repeated procedure to determine the amount of the imposed fine as well as the allocation between the parties. Although Kelly's staffing operations in Hungary was sold to Gi Group Holdings S.P.A. ("Gi") in January 2024, we have agreed to indemnify Gi for any liability resulting from this matter. The Company does not believe that resolution of this matter will have a material adverse effect upon the Company s competitive position, results of operations, cash flows or financial position. 

Item 1A. Risk Factors. 
 There have been no material changes in the Company's risk factors previously disclosed in Part I, Item 1A of the Company's Annual Report filed on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023.
