Trustmark had no unused commitments on modified loans to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty at September 30, 2024. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, payment defaults of LHFI that were modified within the twelve months prior to that default to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty were immaterial. Trustmark has utilized loans 90 days or more past due to define payment default in determining modified loans that have subsequently defaulted. If Trustmark determines that a modified loan (or a portion of a loan) has subsequently been deemed uncollectible, the loan (or a portion of the loan) is charged off against the ACL, LHFI. Trustmark closely monitors the performance of loans that are modified to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty to understand the effectiveness of its modification efforts.

A loan is collateral dependent when the borrower is experiencing financial difficulty and repayment of the loan is expected to be provided substantially through the sale of the collateral. The following provides a qualitative description by class of loan of the collateral that secures Trustmark s collateral-dependent LHFI: Loans secured by real estate Loans within these loan classes are secured by liens on real estate properties. There have been no significant changes to the collateral that secures these financial assets during the period.

key quality ratios that are compared against bank tolerances. The loan indicators are total classified outstanding, total criticized outstanding, nonperforming loans, nonperforming assets, delinquencies and net loan losses. Due to the homogeneous nature of consumer loans, Trustmark does not assign a formal internal risk rating to each credit and therefore the criticized and classified measures are primarily composed of commercial loans. In addition to monitoring portfolio credit quality indicators, Trustmark also measures how effectively the lending process is being managed and risks are being identified. As part of an ongoing monitoring process, Trustmark grades the commercial portfolio segment as it relates to credit file completion and financial statement exceptions, underwriting, collateral documentation and compliance with law as shown below: Credit File Completeness and Financial Statement Exceptions evaluates the quality and condition of credit files in terms of content and completeness and focuses on efforts to obtain and document sufficient information to determine the quality and status of credits. Also included is an evaluation of the systems/procedures used to ensure compliance with policy. 

 Underwriting evaluates whether credits are adequately analyzed, appropriately structured and properly approved within loan policy requirements. A properly approved credit is approved by an adequate authority in a timely manner with all conditions of approval fulfilled. Total policy exceptions measure the level of underwriting and other policy exceptions within a portfolio segment. 

 Collateral Documentation focuses on the adequacy of documentation to perfect Trustmark s collateral position and substantiate collateral value. Collateral exceptions measure the level of documentation exceptions within a portfolio segment. Collateral exceptions occur when certain collateral documentation is either not present or not current. 

 Compliance with Law focuses on underwriting, documentation, approval and reporting in compliance with banking laws and regulations. Primary emphasis is directed to the Financial Institutions Reform, Recovery and Enforcement Act of 1989 (FIRREA), Regulation O requirements and regulations governing appraisals. 

 Commercial Credits Trustmark has established a loan grading system that consists of ten individual credit risk grades (risk ratings) that encompass a range from loans where the expectation of loss is negligible to loans where loss has been established. The model is based on the risk of default for an individual credit and establishes certain criteria to delineate the level of risk across the ten unique credit risk grades. Credit risk grade definitions are as follows: Risk Rate (RR) 1 through RR 6 Grades one through six represent groups of loans that are not subject to criticism as defined in regulatory guidance. Loans in these groups exhibit characteristics that represent low to moderate risk measured by using a variety of credit risk criteria such as cash flow coverage, debt service coverage, balance sheet leverage, liquidity, management experience, industry position, prevailing economic conditions, support from secondary sources of repayment and other credit factors that may be relevant to a specific loan. In general, these loans are supported by properly margined collateral and guarantees of principal parties. 

 Other Assets Especially Mentioned (Special Mention) (RR 7) a loan that has a potential weakness that if not corrected will lead to a more severe rating. This rating is for credits that are currently protected but potentially weak because of an adverse feature or condition that if not corrected will lead to a further downgrade. 

21 

thousand (excluding those portions of the debt that are government guaranteed or are secured by Trustmark deposits or marketable securities) or more. 

 Any loan that is believed to not share similar risk characteristics with the rest of the pool will be individually assessed. Otherwise, the loan will be left within the pool based on the results of the assessment. 

 Commercial accruing loans deemed to be a modified loan to a borrower experiencing financial difficulty with total exposure of thousand (excluding those portions of the debt that are government guaranteed or are secured by Trustmark deposits or marketable securities) or more. If the loan is believed to not share similar risk characteristics with the rest of the loan pool, the loan will be individually assessed. Otherwise, the loan will be left within the pool and monitored on an ongoing basis. 

 Each loan officer assesses the appropriateness of the internal risk rating assigned to their credits on an ongoing basis. Trustmark s Asset Review area conducts independent credit quality reviews of the majority of Trustmark s commercial loan portfolio both on the underlying credit quality of each individual loan class as well as the adherence to Trustmark s loan policy and the loan administration process. In addition to the ongoing internal risk rate monitoring described above, Trustmark s Credit Quality Review Committee meets monthly and performs a review of all loans of thousand or more that are either delinquent 30 days or more or on nonaccrual. This review includes recommendations regarding risk ratings, accrual status, charge-offs and appropriate servicing officer as well as evaluation of problem credits for determination of modified status. Quarterly, the Credit Quality Review Committee reviews and modifies continuous action plans for all credits risk rated seven or worse for relationships of 100 thousand or more. In addition, periodic reviews of significant development, construction, multi-family, nonowner-occupied and other commercial credits are performed. These reviews assess each particular project with respect to location, project valuations, progress of completion, leasing status, current financial information, rents, operating expenses, cash flow, adherence to budget and projections and other information that is pertinent to the particular type of credit as applicable. Summary results are reviewed by Senior and Regional Credit Officers in addition to the Chief Credit Officer with a determination made as to the appropriateness of existing risk ratings and accrual status. Consumer Credits The Retail Credit Review Committee, Management Credit Policy Committee and the Enterprise Risk Committee review the volume and percentage of consumer loan delinquencies and losses to monitor the overall quality of the consumer portfolio. Trustmark monitors the levels and severity of past due consumer LHFI on a daily basis through its collection activities. A detailed assessment of consumer LHFI delinquencies is performed monthly at both a product and market level.

Past Due LHFS LHFS past due days or more totaled million and million at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 , respectively. LHFS past due 90 days or more are serviced loans eligible for repurchase, which are fully guaranteed by the Government National Mortgage Association (GNMA). GNMA optional repurchase programs allow financial institutions to buy back individual delinquent mortgage loans that meet certain criteria from the securitized loan pool for which the institution provides servicing. At the servicer s option and without GNMA s prior authorization, the servicer may repurchase such a delinquent loan for an amount equal to of the remaining principal balance of the loan. This buy-back option is considered a conditional option until the delinquency criteria are met, at which time the option becomes unconditional. When Trustmark is deemed to have regained effective control over these loans under the unconditional buy-back option, the loans can no longer be reported as sold and must be brought back onto the balance sheet as loans held for sale, regardless of whether Trustmark intends to exercise the buy-back option. These loans are reported as held for sale with the offsetting liability being reported as short-term borrowings. Trustmark did not exercise its buy-back option on any delinquent loans serviced for GNMA during the first nine months of 2024 or 2023.

Trustmark determines the fair value of the MSR using a valuation model administered by a third party that calculates the present value of estimated future net servicing income. Trustmark considers the conditional prepayment rate (CPR), which is an estimated loan prepayment rate that uses historical prepayment rates for previous loans similar to the loans being evaluated, the float rate, which is the interest rate earned on escrow balances, and the discount rate as some of the primary assumptions used in determining the fair value of the MSR. An increase in either the CPR or discount rate assumption will result in a decrease in the fair value of the MSR, while a decrease in either assumption will result in an increase in the fair value of the MSR. An increase in the float rate will result in an increase in the fair value of the MSR, while a decrease in the float rate will result in a decrease in the fair value of the MSR. At September 30, 2024 , the fair value of the MSR included an assumed average prepayment speed of CPR and an average discount rate of compared to an assumed average prepayment speed of CPR and an average discount rate of at September 30, 2023. Mortgage Loans Serviced/Sold During the first nine months of 2024 and 2023 , Trustmark sold million and million, respectively, of residential mortgage loans. Gains on these sales were recorded as noninterest income in mortgage banking, net and totaled million for the first nine months of 2024 compared to million for the first nine months of 2023.

Trustmark is subject to losses in its loan servicing portfolio due to loan foreclosures. Trustmark has obligations to either repurchase the outstanding principal balance of a loan or make the purchaser whole for the economic benefits of a loan if it is determined that the loan sold was in violation of representations or warranties made by Trustmark at the time of the sale, herein referred to as mortgage loan servicing putback expenses. Such representations and warranties typically include those made regarding loans that had missing or insufficient file documentation, loans that do not meet investor guidelines, loans in which the appraisal does not support the value and/or loans obtained through fraud by the borrowers or other third parties. Generally, putback requests may be made until the loan is paid in full. However, mortgage loans delivered to Federal National Mortgage Association (FNMA) and Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (FHLMC) on or after January 1, 2013 are subject to the Representations and Warranties Framework, which provides certain instances in which FNMA and FHLMC will not exercise their remedies, including a putback request, for breaches of certain selling representations and warranties, such as payment history and quality control review. When a putback request is received, Trustmark evaluates the request and takes appropriate actions based on the nature of the request. Trustmark is required by FNMA and FHLMC to provide a response to putback requests within days of the date of receipt. The total mortgage loan servicing putback expenses are included in other expense. At both September 30, 2024 and 2023 , Trustmark had a reserve for mortgage loan servicing putback expenses of thousand.

billion and billion, respectively. Letters of credit are conditional commitments issued by Trustmark to insure the performance of a customer to a third-party. A financial standby letter of credit irrevocably obligates Trustmark to pay a third-party beneficiary when a customer fails to repay an outstanding loan or debt instrument. A performance standby letter of credit irrevocably obligates Trustmark to pay a third-party beneficiary when a customer fails to perform some contractual, nonfinancial obligation. When issuing letters of credit, Trustmark uses the same policies regarding credit risk and collateral, which are followed in the lending process. At September 30, 2024 and 2023, Trustmark s maximum exposure to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by the customer for letters of credit was million and million, respectively. These amounts consist primarily of commitments with maturities of less than , which have an immaterial carrying value. Trustmark holds collateral to support standby letters of credit when deemed necessary. As of September 30, 2024 and 2023 , the fair value of collateral held was million and million, respectively. ACL on Off-Balance Sheet Credit Exposures Trustmark maintains a separate ACL on off-balance sheet credit exposures, including unfunded loan commitments and letters of credit, which is included on the accompanying consolidated balance sheet as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. During the first quarter of 2024, Management decided to implement a performance trends qualitative factor for unfunded commitments. The same assumptions are applied in this calculation that the funded balances utilize with the addition of using the funding rates on the unfunded commitments. The performance trends qualitative factor reserve is then added to the other calculated reserve to get a total reserve for off-balance sheet credit exposures. During the third quarter of 2024, Management implemented the External Factor Credit Quality Review qualitative factor for unfunded commitments. The same assumptions are applied in this calculation that the funded balances utilize with the addition of using the funding rates on the unfunded commitments. The Credit Quality Review qualitative factor reserve is then added to the other calculated reserve to get a total reserve for off-balance sheet credit exposures.

Balance at end of period 

Adjustments to the ACL on off-balance sheet credit exposures are recorded to PCL, off-balance sheet credit exposures. The decrease in the ACL on off-balance sheet credit exposures for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily due to the decrease in required reserves as a result of a decrease in unfunded commitments coupled with the decrease in the quantitative reserve rates due to changes in the macroeconomic factors. The decreases were partially offset by an increase in required reserves as a result of implementing the External Factor - Credit Quality Review qualitative factor. The decrease in the ACL on off-balance sheet credit exposures for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily due to the decrease in required reserves as a result of a decrease in unfunded commitments partially offset by an increase in required reserves as a result of implementing the performance trend and External Factor - Credit Quality Review qualitative factors. The increase in the ACL on off-balance sheet credit exposures for the three months ended September 30, 2023 was primarily due to the weakening macroeconomic forecasts as well as the net adjustment to the qualitative factors. The decrease in the ACL on off-balance sheet credit exposures for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 was primarily due to decreases in unfunded balances for the construction, land development and other land portfolio and other construction loan portfolio. No credit loss estimate is reported for off-balance sheet credit exposures that are unconditionally cancellable by Trustmark or for undrawn amounts under such arrangements that may be drawn prior to the cancellation of the arrangement. Legal Proceedings TNB and its subsidiaries are parties to lawsuits and other claims that arise in the ordinary course of business. Some of the lawsuits assert claims related to the lending, collection, servicing, investment, trust and other business activities, and some of the lawsuits allege substantial claims for damages. In accordance with FASB ASC Subtopic 450-20, Loss Contingencies, TNB will establish an accrued liability for any litigation matter if and when such matter presents loss contingencies that are both probable and reasonably estimable. At the present time, TNB believes, based on its evaluation and the advice of legal counsel, that a loss in any currently pending legal proceeding is not probable and a reasonable estimate cannot reasonably be made.

. Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), net of tax, is not included in computing regulatory capital. Trustmark elected the five-year phase-in transition period (through December 31, 2024) related to adopting FASB ASU 2016-13 for regulatory capital purposes. Failure to meet minimum capital requirements can result in certain mandatory and possibly additional discretionary actions by regulators that, if undertaken, could have a direct material effect on the financial statements of Trustmark and TNB and limit Trustmark s and TNB s ability to pay dividends. As of September 30, 2024, Trustmark and TNB exceeded all applicable minimum capital standards. In addition, Trustmark and TNB met applicable regulatory guidelines to be considered well-capitalized at September 30, 2024. To be categorized in this manner, Trustmark and TNB maintained, as applicable, minimum common equity Tier 1 risk-based capital, Tier 1 risk-based capital, total risk-based capital and Tier 1 leverage ratios as set forth in the accompanying table, and were not subject to any written agreement, order or capital directive, or prompt corrective action directive issued by their primary federal regulators to meet and maintain a specific capital level for any capital measures. There are no significant conditions or events that have occurred since September 30, 2024, which Management believes have affected Trustmark s or TNB s present classification.

million with a related ACL of million in collateral-dependent LHFI, compared to outstanding balances of million with a related ACL of million in collateral-dependent LHFI at December 31, 2023. The collateral-dependent LHFI are classified as Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy. Nonfinancial Assets and Liabilities Certain nonfinancial assets measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis include foreclosed assets (upon initial recognition or subsequent impairment), nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities measured at fair value in the second step of a goodwill impairment test, and intangible assets and other nonfinancial long-lived assets measured at fair value for impairment assessment. Other real estate includes assets that have been acquired in satisfaction of debt through foreclosure and is recorded at the fair value less cost to sell (estimated fair value) at the time of foreclosure. Fair value is based on independent appraisals and other relevant factors. In the determination of fair value subsequent to foreclosure, Management also considers other factors or recent developments, such as changes in market conditions from the time of valuation and anticipated sales values considering plans for disposition, which could result in an adjustment to lower the collateral value estimates indicated in the appraisals. Periodic revaluations are classified as Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy since assumptions are used that may not be observable in the market. Foreclosed assets of thousand were remeasured during the first nine months of 2024 , requiring write-downs of thousand to reach their current fair values compared to thousand of foreclosed assets that were remeasured during the first nine months of 2023 , requiring write-downs of thousand. Fair Value of Financial Instruments FASB ASC Topic 825, Financial Instruments, requires disclosure of the fair value of financial assets and financial liabilities, including those financial assets and financial liabilities that are not measured and reported at fair value on a recurring basis or non-recurring basis.

thousand and a net loss of million, respectively, were recorded as noninterest income (loss) in mortgage banking, net for changes in the fair value of LHFS accounted for under the fair value option, compared to net losses of thousand and thousand for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively. Interest and fees on LHFS and LHFI for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 included million and million, respectively, of interest earned on LHFS accounted for under the fair value option, compared to million and million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 , respectively. Election of the fair value option allows Trustmark to reduce the accounting volatility that would otherwise result from the asymmetry created by accounting for the financial instruments at the lower of cost or fair value and the derivatives at fair value. The fair value option election does not apply to GNMA optional repurchase loans which do not meet the requirements under FASB ASC Topic 825 to be accounted for under the fair value option. GNMA optional repurchase loans totaled million and million at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively, and are included in LHFS on the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. For additional information regarding GNMA optional repurchase loans, please see the section captioned Past Due LHFS included in Note 3 LHFI and ACL, LHFI.

billion compared to billion at December 31, 2023. Trustmark records any gains or losses on these cash flow hedges in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). Gains and losses on derivatives representing hedge components excluded from the assessment of effectiveness are recognized over the life of the hedge on a systematic and rational basis, as documented at hedge inception in accordance with Trustmark s accounting policy election. The earnings recognition of excluded components included in interest and fees on LHFS and LHFI totaled thousand and thousand of amortization expense for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, compared to thousand and thousand of amortization expense for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively. As interest payments are received on Trustmark's variable-rate a ssets, amounts reported in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) are reclassified into interest and fees on LHFS and LHFI in the accompanying consolidated statements of income (loss) during the same period. During the next twelve months, Trustmark estimates that million will be reclassified as a reduction to interest and fees on LHFS and LHFI. This amount could differ due to changes in interest rates, hedge de-designations or the addition of other hedges.

million at September 30, 2024 compared to million at December 31, 2023. Changes in the fair value of these exchange-traded derivative instruments are recorded as noninterest income (loss) in mortgage banking, net and are offset by changes in the fair value of the MSR. The impact of this strategy resulted in a net negative ineffectiveness of million and million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the impact was a net negative ineffectiveness of million and million, respectively. As part of Trustmark s risk management strategy in the mortgage banking area, derivative instruments such as forward sales contracts are utilized. Trustmark s obligations under forward sales contracts consist of commitments to deliver mortgage loans, originated and/or purchased, in the secondary market at a future date. Changes in the fair value of these derivative instruments are recorded as noninterest income (loss) in mortgage banking, net and are offset by changes in the fair value of LHFS. Trustmark s off-balance sheet obligations under these derivative instruments totaled million at September 30, 2024 , with a negative valuation adjustment of thousand, compared to million, with a negative valuation adjustment of thousand, at December 31, 2023. Trustmark also utilizes derivative instruments such as interest rate lock commitments in its mortgage banking area. Interest rate lock commitments are residential mortgage loan commitments with customers, which guarantee a specified interest rate for a specified time period. Changes in the fair value of these derivative instruments are recorded as noninterest income (loss) in mortgage banking, net and are offset by the changes in the fair value of forward sales contracts. Trustmark s off-balance sheet obligations under these derivative instruments totaled million at September 30, 2024 , with a positive valuation adjustment of thousand, compared to million, with a positive valuation adjustment of thousand, at December 31, 2023. Trustmark offers certain derivatives products directly to qualified commercial lending clients seeking to manage their interest rate risk. Trustmark economically hedges interest rate swap transactions executed with commercial lending clients by entering into offsetting interest rate swap transactions with institutional derivatives market participants. Derivatives transactions executed as part of this program are not designated as qualifying hedging relationships and are, therefore, carried at fair value with the change in fair value recorded as noninterest income (loss) in bank card and other fees. Because these derivatives have mirror-image contractual terms, in addition to collateral provisions which mitigate the impact of non-performance risk, the changes in fair value are expected to substantially offset. The offsetting interest rate swap transactions are either cleared through the Chicago Mercantile Exchange for clearable transactions or booked directly with institutional derivatives market participants for non-clearable transactions. The Chicago Mercantile Exchange rules legally characterize variation margin collateral payments made or received for centrally cleared interest rate swaps as settlements rather than collateral. As a result, centrally cleared interest rate swaps included in other assets and other liabilities are presented on a net basis in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. At September 30, 2024 , Trustmark had interest rate swaps with an aggregate notional amount of billion related to this program, compared to billion at December 31, 2023. Credit-risk-related Contingent Features Trustmark has agreements with its financial institution counterparties that contain provisions where if Trustmark defaults on any of its indebtedness, including default where repayment of the indebtedness has not been accelerated by the lender, then Trustmark could also be declared in default on its derivatives obligations. At September 30, 2024, the termination value of i nterest rate swaps in a liability position, which includes accrued interest but excludes any adjustment for nonperformance risk, related to these agreements totaled million compared to million at December 31, 2023. At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 , Trustmark had posted collateral of million and million, respectively, against its obligations because of negotiated thresholds and minimum transfer amounts under these agreements. If Trustmark had breached any of these triggering provisions at September 30, 2024, it could have been required to settle its obligations under the agreements at the termination value. Credit risk participation agreements arise when Trustmark contracts with other financial institutions, as a guarantor or beneficiary, to share credit risk associated with certain interest rate swaps. These agreements provide for reimbursement of losses resulting from a third-party default on the underlying swap. At September 30, 2024 , Trustmark had entered into risk p articipation agreements as a beneficiary with aggregate notional amounts of million compared to risk participation agreements as a beneficiary with an aggregate notional amount of million at December 31, 2023. At September 30, 2024 , Trustmark had entered into risk participation agreements as a guarantor with aggregate notional amounts of million compared to risk participation agreements as a guarantor with aggregate notional amounts of million at December 31, 2023. The aggregate fair values of these risk participation agreements were immaterial at both September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023.

Noninterest expenses for back-office operations support are allocated to segments based on estimated uses of those services. Trustmark measures the net interest income of its business segments with a process that assigns cost of funds or earnings credit on a matched-term basis. This process, called funds transfer pricing , charges an appropriate cost of funds to assets held by a business unit, or credits the business unit for potential earnings for carrying liabilities. The net of these charges and credits flows through to the General Banking Segment, which contains the management team responsible for determining TNB s funding and interest rate risk strategies.

the amendments of ASU 2023-07 related to annual disclosure requirements effective , and will present any newly required annual disclosures in its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ending December 31, 2024. Trustmark intends to adopt the amendments of ASU 2023-07 related to interim disclosure requirements effective January 1, 2025, and will present any newly required interim disclosures beginning with its Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the period ending March 31, 2025. Adoption of ASU 2023-07 is t expected to have a material impact to Trustmark s consolidated financial statements or results of operations. Pending Accounting Pronouncements ASU 2023-09, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures. Issued in December 2023, ASU 2023-09 is intended to improve the disclosures for income taxes to address requests from investors, lenders, creditors and other allocators of capital (collectively, "investors") that use the financial statements to make capital allocation decisions. During the FASB's 2021 agenda consultation process and other stakeholder outreach, investors highlighted that the current system of income tax disclosures does not provide enough information to understand the tax provision for an entity that operates in multiple jurisdictions. Investors currently rely on the rate reconciliation table and other disclosures, including total income taxes paid in the statement of cash flows, to evaluate income tax risks and opportunities. The amendments in ASU 2023-09 will require consistent categories and greater disaggregation of information in the rate reconciliation disclosure as well as disclosure of income taxes paid disaggregated by jurisdiction. The amendments of ASU 2023-09 are effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2024, and early adoption is permitted for annual financial statements that have not yet been issued or made available for issuance. Trustmark intends to adopt the amendments of ASU 2023-09 effective , and will include the required disclosures in its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ending December 31, 2025. Trustmark is currently evaluating the changes to disclosures required by ASU 2023-09; however, adoption of ASU 2023-09 is t expected to have a material impact to Trustmark s consolidated financial statements or results of operations. 

ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 
 The following provides a narrative discussion and analysis of Trustmark Corporation s (Trustmark) financial condition and results of operations. This discussion should be read in conjunction with the unaudited consolidated financial statements and the supplemental financial data included in Part I. Item 1. Financial Statements of this report. 
 Description of Business 
 Trustmark, a Mississippi business corporation incorporated in 1968, is a bank holding company headquartered in Jackson, Mississippi. Trustmark s principal subsidiary is Trustmark National Bank (TNB), initially chartered by the State of Mississippi in 1889. At September 30, 2024, TNB had total assets of 18.478 billion, which represented approximately 99.99 of the consolidated assets of Trustmark. 
 Through TNB and its other subsidiaries, Trustmark operates as a financial services organization providing banking and other financial solutions through offices and 2,500 full-time equivalent associates (measured at September 30, 2024) located in the states of Alabama, Florida (primarily in the northwest or Panhandle region of that state, which is referred to herein as Trustmark s Florida market), Georgia (primarily in Atlanta, which is referred to herein as Trustmark's Georgia market), Mississippi, Tennessee (in the Memphis and Northern Mississippi regions, which are collectively referred to herein as Trustmark s Tennessee market), and Texas (primarily in Houston, which is referred to herein as Trustmark s Texas market). Trustmark s operations are managed along two operating segments: General Banking Segment and Wealth Management Segment. For a complete overview of Trustmark s business, see the section captioned The Corporation included in Part I. Item 1. Business of Trustmark s Annual Report on Form 10-K for its fiscal year ended December 31, 2023 (2023 Annual Report). 
 62 

Executive Overview 
 In addition to the significant non-routine transactions that were completed during the second quarter of 2024, Trustmark's financial results for the first nine months of 2024 reflected continued growth in loans held for investment (LHFI), an increase in noninterest income and disciplined expense management. Please see the section captioned "Non-GAAP Financial Measures" for additional information regarding the significant non-routine transactions. Trustmark's capital position remained solid, reflecting the consistent profitability of its diversified financial services businesses. These accomplishments are the result of focused efforts to enhance Trustmark's long-term performance and competitiveness. Trustmark continues to implement technology and streamline processes to enhance its ability to grow and serve customers. Trustmark is well-positioned to compete in changing economic conditions and create long-term value for its shareholders. Trustmark s Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of 0.23 per share. The dividend is payable December 15, 2024, to shareholders of record on December 1, 2024. 
 Recent Economic and Industry Developments 
 Economic activity improved slightly during the first nine months of 2024; however, economic concerns remain as a result of the cumulative weight of uncertainty regarding the potential economic impact of geopolitical developments, such as the conflicts in Ukraine and the Middle East, inflation, other economic and industry volatility, the 2024 election cycle in the United States, higher energy prices and broader price pressures. Doubts surrounding the near-term direction of global markets and the potential impact on the United States economy are expected to persist for the near term. While Trustmark's customer base is wholly domestic, international economic conditions affect domestic economic conditions, and thus may have an impact upon Trustmark's financial condition or results of operations. 
 Market interest rates began to rise during 2022 after an extended period at historical lows. Starting in March 2022, the FRB began raising the target federal funds rate for the first time in three years and continued with multiple increases throughout 2022 and the first half of 2023. The FRB maintained the target federal funds rate at a range of 5.25 to 5.50 from July 2023 through September 2024. In September 2024, the FRB lowered the target federal funds rate to a range of 4.75 to 5.00 based on its confidence that inflation was moving substantially toward 2.00 and that the risks to achieving the FRB's employment and inflation goals were roughly balanced. In addition, the FRB increased the interest that it pays on reserves multiple times during 2022 and the first half of 2023 from 0.10 to 5.40 as of July 2023. The FRB maintained the rate it pays on reserves at 5.40 from July 2023 through September 2024. In September 2024, the FRB lowered the rate is pays on reserves to 4.90 . Prior period rate increases increased the competitive pressures on the deposit cost of funds. While rate cuts potentially reduce those competitive pressures, they increase pressure on Trustmark's net interest margin, a key component to its financial results. While the FRB has suggested that further rate cuts may occur in the near term, it is not possible to predict the direction, pace or magnitude of further changes in interest rates, or the impact any such rate changes will have on Trustmark's results of operations. 
 In the October 2024 Summary of Commentary on Current Economic Conditions by Federal Reserve District, the twelve Federal Reserve Districts reports suggested that during the reporting period (covering the period from August 26, 2024 through October 11, 2024) economic activity was little changed. Reports by the twelve Federal Reserve Districts (Districts) noted the following during the reporting period: 
 Most Districts reported declining manufacturing activity. Activity in the banking sector was generally steady to up slightly and loan demand was mixed, with some Districts noting improvement in the outlook due to the recent decline in interest rates. Reports on consumer spending were mixed, with some Districts noting shifts in the composition of purchases, mostly towards less expensive alternatives. 

The housing market activity was generally steady as inventory continued to expand in much of the nation and home values largely held steady or rose slightly. Uncertainty about the path of mortgage rates kept some buyers on the sidelines and the lack of affordable housing remained a persistent problem in many communities. Commercial real estate markets were generally flat. 

The short-lived dockworkers strike caused only minor temporary disruptions. Hurricane damage impacted crops and prompted pauses in business activity and tourism in the Southeast. Agricultural activity was flat to down modestly, with some crop prices remaining unprofitably low. Energy activity was also unchanged or down modestly and lower energy prices compressed producers' margins. Despite elevated uncertainty, contacts were somewhat more optimistic about the longer-term outlook. 

Employment activity increased slightly during the reporting period, with more than half of the Districts reporting slight or modest growth and the remaining Districts reporting little or no change. Demand for workers eased somewhat and worker availability improved. However, contacts noted that it remained difficult to find workers with certain skills or for certain industries, such as technology, manufacturing and construction. Wages generally continued to rise at a modest to moderate pace. Contacts in multiple Districts pointed to a slowdown in the pace of wage increases as a result of improvements in worker 

63 

availability. Larger than usual pay increases were still reported for some workers, such as those in the skilled trades or in remote areas. 

Inflation continued to moderate with selling prices reportedly increasing at a slight to modest pace in most Districts. Home prices edged up in many Districts, while rents were reported to be steady or down slightly. Many Districts noted increasing price sensitivity among consumers. Input prices generally rose moderately. Several industries noted more acute pressures from rising insurance and healthcare costs. Multiple Districts reported that input prices generally rose faster than selling prices, compressing firms profit margins. 

Reports by the Federal Reserve s Sixth District, Atlanta (which includes Trustmark s Alabama, Florida, Georgia and Mississippi market regions), Eighth District, St. Louis (which includes Trustmark s Tennessee market region), and Eleventh District, Dallas (which includes Trustmark s Texas market region), noted similar findings for the reporting period as those discussed above. The Federal Reserve s Sixth District also noted that although loan growth was modest, financial institutions noted anticipating additional future loan demand in a lower rate environment and multifamily lending increased moderately as the demand for housing continued to exceed supply. The Federal Reserve s Sixth District reported that deposits, including large time deposits, increased modestly, borrowings continued to decline as banks reduced reliance on more expensive sources of funding, and rising cash balances drove increasing cash-to-assets ratios at District institutions and across the industry broadly. The Federal Reserve s Eighth District also noted that banks were able to adjust deposit rates downward without receiving much pushback from customers, past-due credit card payments increased but bankers' credit quality forecasts continued to be favorable and bankers reported positive moves in their capital and balance sheets due to favorable changes in bond values. The Federal Reserve s Eleventh District reported that credit tightening continued and loan nonperformance rose but at a slower pace, there was a notable uptick in concern for the performance of office commercial real estate loans, and bankers reported working with borrowers to keep commercial real estate loans in good standing prior to maturity when they can be refinanced. The Federal Reserve s Eleventh District also noted that despite increased concerns, bankers' outlooks turned sharply optimistic and contacts expect a significant improvement in loan demand and business activity six months from now, although they still anticipate continued deterioration in loan performance. 
 Financial Highlights 
 Trustmark reported net income of 51.3 million, or basic and diluted earnings per share (EPS) of 0.84, in the third quarter of 2024, compared to 34.0 million, or basic and diluted EPS of 0.56, in the third quarter of 2023. Trustmark s reported performance during the quarter ended September 30, 2024 produced a return on average tangible equity of 12.86 , a return on average assets of 1.10 , an average equity to average assets ratio of 10.39 and a dividend payout ratio of 27.38 , compared to a return on average tangible equity of 11.32 , a return on average assets of 0.72 , an average equity to average assets ratio of 8.46 and a dividend payout ratio of 41.07 during the quarter ended September 30, 2023. 
 Trustmark reported net income of 166.7 million, or basic and diluted EPS of 2.72, for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 129.4 million, or basic and diluted EPS of 2.12 and 2.11, respectively, for the same time period in 2023. Trustmark's reported performance during the first nine months of 2024 produced a return on average tangible equity of 15.79 , a return on average assets of 1.19 , an average equity to average assets ratio of 9.52 and a dividend payout ratio of 25.37 , compared to return on average tangible equity of 14.77 , a return on average assets of 0.93 , an average equity to average assets ratio of 8.37 and a dividend payout ratio of 32.55 for the first nine months of 2023. 
 Trustmark completed the sale of FBBI during the second quarter of 2024. As such, financial results for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, consist of both continuing and discontinued operations. The discontinued operations include the financial results of FBBI prior to the sale as well as the net gain on the sale in the second quarter. Trustmark reported net income from continuing operations of 51.3 million and a net loss from continuing operations of 11.1 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, compared to net income from continuing operations of 30.6 million and 119.4 million, respectively, for the same time periods in 2023. Trustmark's reported performance from continuing operations for the three and nine month ended September 30, 2024 produced a return on average tangible equity of 12.86 and -1.02 , respectively, and a return on average assets of 1.10 and -0.08 , respectively, compared to a return on average tangible equity of 9.72 and 13.03 , respectively, and a return on average assets of 0.65 and 0.86 , respectively, for the same time periods in 2023. The net loss from continuing operations for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was principally due to the loss on the sale of available for sale securities during the second quarter of 2024. 
 Total revenue, which is defined as net interest income plus noninterest income (loss), for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was 192.3 million, an increase of 16.7 million, or 9.5 , when compared to the same time period in 2023, principally due to an increase in net interest income primarily resulting from increases in interest and fees from loans held for sale (LHFS) and LHFI and interest on securities as well as a decline in other interest expense, partially offset by an increase in interest expense on deposits. Total revenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 364.2 million, a decrease of 163.8 million, or 31.0 , when compared to the same 
 64 

time period in 2023, reflecting a decline in noninterest income, primarily as a result of the loss on the sale of available for sale securities partially offset by an increase in other, net, and an increase in net interest income, primarily resulting from increases in interest and fees from LHFS and LHFI and interest on securities as well as a decline in other interest expense, partially offset by an increase in interest expense on deposits. 
 Net interest income for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 totaled 154.7 million and 428.6 million, respectively, an increase of 16.1 million, or 11.6 , and 12.4 million, or 3.0 , respectively, when compared to the same time periods in 2023, principally attributable to increases in interest and fees from LHFS and LHFI and interest on securities as well as a decline in other interest expense, partially offset by an increase in interest expense on deposits. Interest income totaled 251.6 million and 720.6 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, an increase of 23.1 million, or 10.1 , and 74.6 million, or 11.6 , respectively, when compared to the same time periods in 2023, principally due to increases in interest and fees on LHFS and LHFI, primarily as a result of the higher interest rate environment and loan growth, and interest on securities, primarily as a result of restructuring the securities portfolio during the second quarter of 2024. Interest expense totaled 96.9 million and 292.0 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, an increase of 7.0 million, or 7.8 , and 62.2 million, or 27.1 , respectively, when compared to the same time periods in 2023. The increase in interest expense when the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 are compared to the same time periods in 2023 was principally due to an increase in interest on deposits primarily due to rising interest rates, increased competition for deposits and higher average balances, partially offset by a decrease in other interest expense primarily due to a decrease in short-term Federal Home Loan Bank (FHLB) advances. 
 Noninterest income (loss) for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 totaled 37.6 million and a negative 64.4 million, respectively, an increase of 641 thousand, or 1.7 , and a decrease of 176.2 million, respectively, when compared to the same time periods in 2023. The decrease in noninterest income (loss) when the first nine months of 2024 is compared to the same time period in 2023 was primarily due to the 182.8 million loss on the sale of the available for sale securities during the second quarter of 2024, partially offset by an increase in other, net. Other, net totaled 13.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, an increase of 5.9 million, or 76.6 , when compared to the same time period in 2023, principally due to the 8.1 million Visa C shares fair value adjustment during the second quarter of 2024 as well as an increase in cash management service fees, partially offset by the 4.8 million noncredit-related loss on the sale of 1-4 family mortgage loans recorded during the second quarter of 2024. 
 Noninterest expense for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 totaled 123.3 million and 361.3 million, respectively, a decrease of 7.0 million, or 5.4 , and 8.2 million, or 2.2 , respectively, when compared to the same time periods in 2023. The decrease in noninterest expense for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was principally due to the 6.5 million litigation settlement expense recorded during the third quarter of 2023 as well as a decline in services and fees partially offset by an increase in other expense. The decrease in noninterest expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was principally due to the 6.5 million litigation settlement expense recorded during the third quarter of 2023 as well as declines in services and fees and salaries and employee benefits partially offset by an increase in other expense. Services and fees for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 totaled 25.7 million and 74.9 million, respectively, a decrease of 1.7 million, or 6.4 , and 5.4 million, or 6.8 , respectively, when compared to the same time periods in 2023, principally due to declines in outside services and fees, primarily related to other services and fees and legal expense, communication expense, primarily related to telephone expense, and advertising expense, partially offset by an increase in data processing expenses related to software. Salaries and employee benefits totaled 197.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, a decrease of 1.9 million, or 1.0 , when compared to the same time period in 2023, principally due to declines in commissions related to mortgage production, other salaries expense and medical insurance expense, partially offset by an increase in salaries expense primarily due to general merit increases. Other expense totaled 17.3 million and 48.7 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, an increase of 2.3 million, or 15.1 , and 5.7 million, or 13.3 , respectively, when compared to the same time periods in 2023. The increase in other expense when the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 are compared to the same time periods in 2023 was principally due to increases in FDIC assessment expense, primarily due to an increase in the assessment rate, and other real estate expense, net, primarily attributable to a reserve for other real estate write-down recorded for one foreclosed property in the Texas market region which was under contract to be sold during the fourth quarter of 2024. 
 Trustmark s total PCL on LHFI for the three months ended September 30, 2024 totaled 7.9 million, a decrease of 399 thousand, or 4.8 , when compared to the same time period in 2023. The PCL, LHFI for the three months ended September 30, 2024 primarily reflected increases in required reserves related to individually analyzed LHFI and the implementation of the External Factor-Credit Quality Review qualitative factor, partially offset by declines in required reserves resulting from the update of the macroeconomic forecasts and net changes in other qualitative reserve factors. During the third quarter of 2024, Trustmark activated the External Factor Credit Quality Review qualitative factor to ensure reserve adequacy for collectively evaluated commercial loans that may not have been identified and downgraded timely for various reasons. Please see the section captioned Allowance for Credit Losses: LHFI for additional information regarding the External Factor-Credit Quality Review qualitative factor. The PCL, LHFI for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 totaled 39.0 million and included a 8.6 million PCL, LHFI sale of 1-4 family mortgage loans for the credit-related portion of the loss on the sale of the 1-4 family mortgage loans. The PCL, LHFI, excluding the PCL, LHFI sale of 1-4 family 
 65 

mortgage loans, for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 totaled 30.3 million, compared to 19.8 million for the same time period in 2023. The PCL on LHFI, excluding the PCL, LHFI 1-4 family mortgage loans, for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 primarily reflected an increase in required reserves as a result of net adjustments to the qualitative factors due to credit migration, implementation of the External Factor-Credit Quality Review qualitative factor, and specific reserves for individually analyzed LHFI, partially offset by net changes in the macroeconomic forecast associated with specific loss driver models as a result of loss driver updates and net changes in other qualitative reserve factors. 
 The PCL on off-balance sheet credit exposures totaled a negative 1.4 million and a negative 5.2 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, compared to 104 thousand and a negative 1.9 million, respectively, for the same time periods in 2023. The release in PCL on off-balance sheet credit exposures for the three months ended September 30, 2024, primarily reflected a decrease in required reserves as a result of a decrease in unfunded commitments and changes in the total reserve rate, partially offset by an increase in required reserves as a result of implementing the External Factor-Credit Quality Review qualitative reserve factor. The release in PCL on off-balance sheet credit exposures for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, primarily reflected a decrease in required reserves as a result of a decrease in unfunded commitments and changes in the total reserve rate, partially offset by an increase in required reserves as a result of implementing the performance trend and the External Factor-Credit Quality Review qualitative reserve factors. Please see the section captioned Provision for Credit Losses for additional information regarding the PCL on LHFI and off-balance sheet credit exposures. 
 At September 30, 2024, nonperforming assets totaled 77.7 million, a decrease of 29.1 million, or 27.3 , compared to December 31, 2023, reflecting declines in both nonaccrual LHFI and other real estate. Nonaccrual LHFI totaled 73.8 million at September 30, 2024, a decrease of 26.2 million, or 26.2 , relative to December 31, 2023, primarily as a result of the sale of 1-4 family mortgage loans during the second quarter of 2024 as well as the resolution of two large nonaccrual commercial credits in the Texas and Alabama market regions, partially offset by three large commercial credits placed on nonaccrual in the Alabama and Texas market regions. Other real estate, net totaled 3.9 million at September 30, 2024, a decrease of 2.9 million, or 42.9 , when compared to December 31, 2023, principally due to properties sold in the Mississippi and Alabama market regions and a reserve for other real estate write-downs recorded for a foreclosed property in the Texas market region which is under contract to be sold during the fourth quarter of 2024, partially offset by properties foreclosed in the Mississippi market region. 
 LHFI totaled 13.100 billion at September 30, 2024, an increase of 149.6 million, or 1.2 , compared to December 31, 2023. The increase in LHFI during the first nine months of 2024 was primarily due to net growth in LHFI secured by real estate and other commercial loans and leases partially offset by declines in commercial and industrial LHFI and state and other political subdivision LHFI. For additional information regarding changes in LHFI and comparative balances by loan category, see the section captioned LHFI. 
 Management has continued its practice of maintaining excess funding capacity to provide Trustmark with adequate liquidity for its ongoing operations. In this regard, Trustmark benefits from its strong deposit base, its investment portfolio and its access to funding from a variety of external funding sources such as upstream federal funds lines, FHLB advances and brokered deposits. See the section captioned Capital Resources and Liquidity for further discussion of the components of Trustmark s excess funding capacity. 
 Total deposits were 15.241 billion at September 30, 2024, a decrease of 328.8 million, or 2.1 , compared to December 31, 2023. During the first nine months of 2024, noninterest-bearing deposits decreased 54.8 million, or 1.7 , principally due to declines in consumer noninterest-bearing demand deposit accounts. Interest-bearing deposits decreased 274.0 million, or 2.2 , during the first nine months of 2024, primarily due to declines in public and consumer interest checking accounts, consumer savings accounts and brokered certificates of deposits (CDs), partially offset by growth in commercial interest checking accounts and commercial and consumer money market deposit accounts (MMDA) and CDs. 
 Federal funds purchased and securities sold under repurchase agreements totaled 365.6 million at September 30, 2024, a decrease of 40.1 million, or 9.9 , compared to December 31, 2023, principally due to a decrease in upstream federal funds purchased. Other borrowings totaled 443.5 million at September 30, 2024, a decrease of 39.8 million, or 8.2 , compared to December 31, 2023, principally due to a decline in outstanding short-term FHLB advances with the FHLB of Dallas. 
 Recent Legislative and Regulatory Developments 
 On September 17, 2024, the FDIC finalized changes to its Statement of Policy on Bank Merger Transactions (Policy Statement), which outlines factors that the FDIC will consider when evaluating a proposed bank merger transaction. Also on September 17, 2024, the United States Department of Justice (DOJ) withdrew its 1995 Bank Merger Guidelines and announced that it will instead evaluate the competitive impact of bank mergers using its 2023 Merger Guidelines that the DOJ applies to mergers in all industries. Compared to the 1995 Bank Merger Guidelines, the 2023 Merger Guidelines set forth more stringent concentration limits and add several largely qualitative bases on which the DOJ may challenge a merger. While the effect of these changes for particular transactions remains 
 66 

unclear, both the Policy Statement and the change in the DOJ s bank merger antitrust policy may make it more difficult and/or costly for banks to obtain regulatory approval for an acquisition or otherwise result in more onerous conditions to obtain approval for an acquisition. 
 On July 30, 2024, the FDIC issued a proposed rule that would revise the FDIC s regulations governing the classification and treatment of brokered deposits. The proposal would, among other changes, broaden the definition of deposit broker to include agents that place or facilitate the placement of third-party deposits at only one insured depository institution and agents that receive a fee or other remuneration in exchange for the placement of deposits. In addition, the proposal would narrow the exception to the definition of deposit broker for agents whose primary purpose is not the placement of funds with depository institutions. While Trustmark is evaluating the potential impact of the proposed rule, if the rule is finalized as proposed, Trustmark may be required to classify a greater amount of its deposits obtained with the involvement of third parties as brokered deposits. An increase in the amount of brokered deposits on Trustmark s balance sheet could, among other consequences, increase Trustmark s deposit insurance assessment costs. 
 For additional information regarding legislation and regulation applicable to Trustmark, see the section captioned Supervision and Regulation included in Part I. Item 1. Business of Trustmark s 2023 Annual Report.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures 
 In addition to capital ratios defined by U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) and banking regulators, Trustmark utilizes various tangible common equity measures when evaluating capital utilization and adequacy. Tangible common equity, as defined by Trustmark, represents common equity less goodwill and identifiable intangible assets. Trustmark's common equity Tier 1 capital includes common stock, capital surplus and retained earnings, and is reduced by goodwill and other intangible assets, net of associated net deferred tax liabilities as well as disallowed deferred tax assets and threshold deductions as applicable. 
 Trustmark believes these measures are important because they reflect the level of capital available to withstand unexpected market conditions. Additionally, presentation of these measures allows readers to compare certain aspects of Trustmark s capitalization to other organizations. These ratios differ from capital measures defined by banking regulators principally in that the numerator excludes shareholders equity associated with preferred securities, the nature and extent of which varies across organizations. In Management s experience, many stock analysts use tangible common equity measures in conjunction with more traditional bank capital ratios to compare capital adequacy of banking organizations with significant amounts of goodwill or other intangible assets, typically stemming from the use of the purchase accounting method in accounting for mergers and acquisitions. 
 These calculations are intended to complement the capital ratios defined by GAAP and banking regulators. Because GAAP does not include these capital ratio measures, Trustmark believes there are no comparable GAAP financial measures to these tangible common equity ratios. Despite the importance of these measures to Trustmark, there are no standardized definitions for them and, as a result, Trustmark s calculation methods may not be comparable with those of other organizations. Also, there may be limits in the usefulness of these measures to investors. As a result, Trustmark encourages readers to consider its consolidated financial statements and the notes related thereto in their entirety and not to rely on any single financial measure.

Trustmark discloses certain non-GAAP financial measures, including net income adjusted for significant non-routine transactions, because Management uses these measures for business planning purposes, including to manage Trustmark s business against internal projected results of operations and to measure Trustmark s performance. Trustmark views these as measures of its core operating business, which exclude the impact of the items detailed below, as these items are generally not operational in nature. These non-GAAP financial measures also provide another basis for comparing period-to-period results as presented in the accompanying selected financial data table and the consolidated financial statements by excluding potential differences caused by non-operational and unusual or non-recurring items. Readers are cautioned that these adjustments are not permitted under GAAP. Trustmark encourages readers to consider its consolidated financial statements and the notes related thereto in their entirety, and not to rely on any single financial measure. 
 Trustmark completed the following significant non-routine transactions during the second quarter of 2024, which are included in the financial results for the nine months ended September 30, 2024: 
 70 

On May 31, 2024, TNB closed the sale of its wholly owned subsidiary, Fisher Brown Bottrell Insurance, Inc., (FBBI) to Marsh McLennan Agency LLC, consistent with the terms as previously announced on April 23, 2024. Trustmark recognized a net gain on the sale of 228.3 million 171.2 million, net of taxes) in income from discontinued operations. The operations of FBBI prior to the sale are included in income from discontinued operations for the current and prior periods. 

Trustmark restructured its investment securities portfolio by selling 1.561 billion of available for sale securities with an average yield of 1.36 , which generated a loss of 182.8 million 137.1 million, net of taxes) and was recorded to noninterest income (loss) in security gains (losses), net. Trustmark also purchased 1.378 billion of available for sale securities with an average yield of 4.85 . 

Trustmark sold a portfolio of 1-4 family mortgage loans that were at least three payments delinquent and/or nonaccrual at the time of selection totaling 56.2 million, which resulted in a loss of 13.4 million 10.1 million, net of taxes). The portion of the loss related to credit totaled 8.6 million 6.5 million, net of taxes) and was recorded as adjustments to charge-offs and the provision for credit losses (PCL). The noncredit-related portion of the loss totaled 4.8 million 3.6 million, net of taxes) and was recorded to noninterest income (loss) in other, net. 

On April 8, 2024, Visa commenced an initial exchange offer expiring on May 3, 2024, for any and all outstanding shares of Visa Class B-1 common stock (Visa B-1 shares). Holders participating in the exchange offer would receive a combination of Visa Class B-2 common stock (Visa B-2 shares) and Visa Class C common stock (Visa C shares) in exchange for Visa B-1 shares that were validly tendered and accepted for exchange by Visa. TNB tendered its 38.7 thousand Visa B-1 shares, which were accepted by Visa. In exchange for each Visa B-1 share that was validly tendered and accepted for exchange by Visa, TNB received 50.0 of a newly issued Visa B-2 share and newly issued Visa C shares equivalent in value to 50.0 of a Visa B-1 share. The Visa C shares that were received by TNB were recognized at fair value, which resulted in a gain of 8.1 million 6.0 million, net of taxes) and was recorded to noninterest income (loss) in other, net during the second quarter of 2024. During the third quarter of 2024, TNB sold all of the Visa C shares for approximately the same carrying value as of June 30, 2024. The Visa B-2 shares were recorded at their nominal carrying value.

Results of Operations 
 Net Interest Income 
 Net interest income is the principal component of Trustmark s income stream and represents the difference, or spread, between interest and fee income generated from earning assets and the interest expense paid on deposits and borrowed funds. Fluctuations in interest 
 71 

rates, as well as volume and mix changes in earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities, can materially impact net interest income. The net interest margin is computed by dividing fully taxable equivalent (FTE) net interest income by average interest-earning assets and measures how effectively Trustmark utilizes its interest-earning assets in relationship to the interest cost of funding them. The accompanying yield/rate analysis tables show the average balances for all assets and liabilities of Trustmark and the interest income or expense associated with earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities. The yields and rates have been computed based upon interest income and expense adjusted to a FTE basis using the federal statutory corporate tax rate in effect for each of the periods shown. Loans on nonaccrual have been included in the average loan balances, and interest collected prior to these loans having been placed on nonaccrual has been included in interest income. Loan fees included in interest associated with the average LHFS and LHFI balances were immaterial. 
 Net interest income-FTE for the three months ended September 30, 2024, increased 16.1 million, or 11.3 , when compared to the same time period in 2023 principally due to increases in interest and fees on LHFS and LHFI-FTE and interest on securities-taxable as well as a decline in other interest expense, partially offset by an increase in interest on deposits. Net interest income-FTE for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 increased 12.3 million, or 2.9 , when compared with the same time period in 2023 principally due to increases in interest and fees on LHFS and LHFI-FTE and interest on securities-taxable as well as a decline in other interest expense, partially offset by an increase in interest on deposits and a decline in other interest income. The net interest margin-FTE for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 increased 40 basis points to 3.69 and 9 basis points to 3.43 , respectively, when compared to the same time periods in 2023, principally due to increases in the yields on the LHFS and LHFI portfolios and the securities portfolio, primarily due to the restructuring of the available for sale securities portfolio during the second quarter of 2024, partially offset by an increase in the cost of interest-bearing deposits. 
 Average interest-earning assets for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was 17.016 billion compared to 17.110 billion for the same time period in 2023, a decline of 94.9 million, or 0.6 , principally due to a decline in average total securities and average other earning assets partially offset by an increase in average loans (LHFS and LHFI). Average interest-earning assets for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 17.097 billion compared to 17.076 billion for the same time period in 2023, an increase of 21.5 million, or 0.1 , principally due to an increase in average loans (LHFS and LHFI) largely offset by a decline in average total securities and average other earning assets. Average loans (LHFS and LHFI) increased 452.7 million, or 3.5 , and 555.3 million, or 4.4 , when the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, are compared to the same time periods in 2023, principally due to an increase in the average balance of the LHFI portfolio of 442.0 million, or 3.5 , and 538.1 million, or 4.3 , respectively. The increase in the LHFI portfolio when the balances at September 30, 2024 are compared to September 30, 2023 was principally due to net growth in LHFI secured by real estate and other commercial loans and leases partially offset by declines in commercial and industrial loans and state and other political subdivision loans. Average total securities declined 472.6 million, or 13.5 , and 374.9 million, or 10.4 , respectively, when the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 are compared to the same time periods in 2023, principally due to available for sale securities sold net of available for sale securities purchased as part of the restructuring of the available for sale securities portfolio during the second quarter of 2024 as well as calls, maturities and pay-downs of the loans underlying GSE guaranteed securities. Average other earning assets decreased 75.4 million, or 11.0 , and 157.2 million, or 21.0 , respectively, when the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 are compared to the same time periods in 2023, primarily due to decreases in reserves held at the FRBA and investments in FHLB stock. 
 Interest income-FTE for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 totaled 254.9 million and 730.6 million, respectively, an increase of 23.1 million, or 10.0 , and 74.4 million, or 11.3 , respectively, while the yield on total earning assets increased to 5.96 and 5.71 , respectively, compared to 5.38 and 5.14 , respectively, for the same time periods in 2023. The increase in interest income-FTE for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily due to increases in interest and fees on LHFS and LHFI-FTE and interest on securities-taxable. The increase in interest income-FTE for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily due to increases in interest and fees on LHFS and LHFI-FTE and interest on securities-taxable partially offset by a decline in other interest income. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, interest and fees on LHFS and LHFI-FTE increased 13.9 million, or 6.7 , and 67.9 million, or 11.7 , respectively, while the yield on LHFS and LHFI increased 21 basis points to 6.55 and 43 basis points to 6.50 , respectively, when compared to the same time periods in 2023, primarily due to the higher interest rate environment as well as the increase in the average balance of LHFI. Interest on securities-taxable increased 9.5 million, or 57.4 , and 9.6 million, or 19.1 , respectively, when the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 are compared to the same time periods in 2023, while the yield on securities-taxable increased to 3.44 and 2.48 , respectively, compared to 1.89 and 1.87 , respectively, principally due to the restructuring of the available for sale securities portfolio during the second quarter of 2024. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, other interest income declined 2.7 million, or 9.9 , while the yield on other earning assets increased 68 basis points to 5.55 when compared to the same time period in 2023, principally due to a decline in interest earned on reserves held at the FRBA. 
 Average interest-bearing liabilities for the three months ended September 30, 2024 totaled 13.088 billion compared to 13.105 billion for the same time period in 2023, a decrease of 17.2 million, or 0.1 , principally due to declines in average other borrowings and average federal funds purchased and securities sold under repurchase agreements largely offset by growth in average interest-bearing 
 72 

deposits. Average interest-bearing liabilities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 totaled 13.280 billion compared to 12.914 billion for the same time period in 2023, an increase of 365.6 million, or 2.8 , principally due to growth in interest-bearing deposits partially offset by a decline in average other borrowings. Average interest-bearing deposits for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 increased 594.4 million, or 5.1 , and 1.038 billion, or 9.3 , respectively, when compared to the same time periods in 2023, reflecting growth in average time deposits and average interest-bearing demand deposits, partially offset by declines in average savings deposits. Average federal funds purchased and securities sold under repurchase agreements for the three months ended September 30, 2024 decreased 39.1 million, or 9.4 , when compared to the same time period in 2023, principally due to a decline in upstream federal funds purchased. Average other borrowings for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 decreased 572.5 million, or 52.2 , and 671.4 million, or 51.6 , respectively, when compared to the same time periods in 2023, principally due to the decrease in outstanding short-term FHLB advances with the FHLB of Dallas as a result of changes in funding needs. 
 Interest expense for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 totaled 96.9 million and 292.0 million, respectively, an increase of 7.0 million, or 7.8 , and 62.2 million, or 27.1 , respectively, when compared with the same time periods in 2023, while the rate on total interest-bearing liabilities increased 22 basis points and 56 basis points, respectively, to 2.94 , principally due to an increase in interest on deposits partially offset by a decline in other interest expense. Interest on deposits for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 increased 16.2 million, or 23.3 , and 88.3 million, or 53.5 , respectively, while the rate on interest-bearing deposits increased 42 basis points to 2.81 and 80 basis points to 2.77 , respectively, when compared to the same time periods in 2023, primarily due to higher interest rates, reflecting the increased competitive pressures on deposits, and increases in average balances of time deposits and MMDA accounts. Other interest expense for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 decreased 8.7 million, or 59.4 , and 27.2 million, or 54.8 , respectively, while the rate on other borrowings decreased 79 basis points to 4.53 and 35 basis points to 4.75 , respectively, when compared to the same time periods in 2023, primarily due to the decrease in outstanding short-term FHLB advances with the FHLB of Dallas.

Provision for Credit Losses 
 The PCL, LHFI is the amount necessary to maintain the ACL for LHFI at the amount of expected credit losses inherent within the LHFI portfolio. The amount of PCL and the related ACL for LHFI are based on Trustmark s ACL methodology. The PCL, LHFI, excluding the PCL, LHFI sale of 1-4 family mortgage loans, totaled 7.9 million and 30.3 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, compared to 8.3 million and 19.8 million, respectively, for the same time periods in 2023. The PCL on LHFI, excluding the PCL, LHFI sale of 1-4 family mortgage loans, for the three months ended September 30, 2024 primarily reflected increases in required reserves related to individually analyzed LHFI and the implementation of the External Factor-Credit Quality Review qualitative factor, partially offset by declines in required reserves resulting from the update of the macroeconomic forecasts and net changes in other qualitative reserve factors. The PCL on LHFI, excluding the PCL, LHFI 1-4 family mortgage loans, for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 primarily reflected an increase in required reserves as a result of net adjustments to the qualitative factors due to credit migration, implementation of the External Factor-Credit Quality Review qualitative factor, and specific reserves for individually analyzed LHFI, partially offset by net changes in the macroeconomic forecast associated with specific loss driver models as a result of loss driver updates and net changes in other qualitative reserve factors. 
 FASB ASC Topic 326 requires Trustmark to estimate expected credit losses for off-balance sheet credit exposures which are not unconditionally cancellable by Trustmark. Trustmark maintains a separate ACL for off-balance sheet credit exposures, including unfunded commitments and letters of credit. Adjustments to the ACL on off-balance sheet credit exposures are recorded to the PCL, off-balance sheet credit exposures. The PCL, off-balance sheet credit exposures totaled a negative 1.4 million and a negative 5.2 
 75 

million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, compared to 104 thousand and a negative 1.9 million, respectively, for the same time periods in 2023. The release in PCL on off-balance sheet credit exposures for the three months ended September 30, 2024, primarily reflected a decrease in required reserves as a result of a decrease in unfunded commitments and changes in the total reserve rate, partially offset by an increase in required reserves as a result of implementing the External Factor-Credit Quality Review qualitative reserve factor. The release in PCL on off-balance sheet credit exposures for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, primarily reflected a decrease in required reserves as a result of a decrease in unfunded commitments and changes in the total reserve rate, partially offset by an increase in required reserves as a result of implementing the performance trend and the External Factor-Credit Quality Review qualitative reserve factors. 
 See the section captioned Allowance for Credit Losses for information regarding Trustmark s ACL methodology as well as further analysis of the PCL.

 The decrease in mortgage banking, net for the three months ended September 30, 2024 when compared to the same time period in 2023 was principally due to an increase in the net negative hedge ineffectiveness, partially offset by an increase in the gain on sales of loans, net. The decrease in mortgage banking, net for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 when compared to the same time period in 2023 was principally due to increases in the net negative hedge ineffectiveness and the run-off of the MSR, partially offset by an increase in the gain on sales of loans, net. Mortgage loan production for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 392.1 million and 1.046 billion, respectively, an increase of 2.2 million, or 0.6 , and a decrease of 136.7 million, or 11.6 , respectively, when 
 76 

compared to the same time periods in 2023. Loans serviced for others totaled 8.691 billion at September 30, 2024, compared with 8.403 billion at September 30, 2023, an increase of 287.9 million, or 3.4 . 
 Representing a significant component of mortgage banking income is the gain on sales of loans, net. The increase in the gain on sales of loans, net when the three months ended September 30, 2024 is compared to the same time period in 2023, was primarily the result of higher profit margins in secondary marketing activities and an increase in the mortgage valuation adjustment, partially offset by a decline in the volume of loans sold. The increase in the gain on sales of loans, net when the nine months ended September 30, 2024 is compared to the same time period in 2023, was primarily the result of higher profit margins in secondary marketing activities partially offset by declines in the mortgage valuation adjustment and the volume of loans sold. Loan sales totaled 288.5 million and 843.6 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, a decrease of 55.2 million, or 16.1 , and 49.4 million, or 5.5 , respectively, when compared with the same time periods in 2023.

 Salaries and Employee Benefits 
 The decrease in salaries and employee benefits when the nine months ended September 30, 2024 is compared to the same time period in 2023 was principally due to declines in commissions related to mortgage production, other salaries expense and medical insurance expense, partially offset by an increase in salaries expense primarily due to general merit increases.

 The increase in other expense when the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 is compared to the same time period in 2023 was principally due to increases in FDIC assessment expense, primarily due to an increase in the assessment rate, and other real estate expense, net, primarily attributable to a reserve for other real estate write-down recorded for one foreclosed property in the Texas market region which was under contract to be sold during the fourth quarter of 2024. The increase in FDIC assessment rate was principally due to increases in the overall assessment rate and the 2-basis point increase in the initial base assessment rate by the FDIC during the second quarter of 2023 as part of the FDIC's final rule to restore the DIF to required levels. 
 Results of Segment Operations 
 For a description of the methodologies used to measure financial performance and financial information by reportable segment, please see Note 19 Segment Information included in Part I. Item 1. Financial Statements of this report. The Insurance Segment is included in discontinued operations for all periods presented in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets and the consolidated statements of income (loss). For additional information about discontinued operations, please see Note 2 - Discontinued Operations included in Part I. Item 1. Financial Statements of this report. The following discusses changes in the results of operations of each reportable segment for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. 
 General Banking 
 Net interest income for the General Banking Segment increased 12.6 million, or 3.1 , when the nine months ended September 30, 2024 is compared with the same time period in 2023. The increase in net interest income was principally due to increases in interest and fees on LHFS and LHFI and interest on securities as well as a decline in other interest expense, primarily due to a decline in FHLB advances with the FHLB of Dallas, partially offset by an increase in interest on deposits and a decline in other interest income, primarily due to a decline in reserves held at the FRBA. The PCL (LHFI and off-balance sheet credit exposures) for the General Banking Segment for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 totaled 33.6 million compared to a PCL of 20.0 million for the same time period in 2023, an increase of 13.6 million, or 68.0 . Excluding the 8.6 million PCL, LHFI sale of 1-4 family mortgage loans, the PCL for the General Banking Segment totaled 25.0 million for the first nine months of 2024, an increase of 5.0 million, or 24.9 . For more information on these net interest income and PCL items, please see the sections captioned Financial Highlights and Results of Operations. 
 Noninterest income (loss) for the General Banking Segment decreased 177.9 million when the first nine months of 2024 is compared to the same time period in 2023, primarily due to the net loss on the sale of available for sale securities, the noncredit-related loss on the sale of 1-4 family mortgage loans and a decrease in mortgage banking, net, partially offset by the gain on the conversion of Visa Class B-1 shares to Visa Class C shares and increases in cash management service fees and nonsufficient fund (NSF) and overdraft fees. Noninterest income (loss) for the General Banking Segment includes service charges on deposit accounts; wealth management; bank card and other fees; mortgage banking, net; other, net and security gains (losses), net. For more information on these noninterest income items, please see the analysis included in the section captioned Noninterest Income (Loss). 
 78 

Noninterest expense for the General Banking Segment decreased 8.4 million, or 2.4 , when the first nine months of 2024 is compared with the same time period in 2023, principally due to litigation settlement expense recorded in the third quarter of 2023 as well as declines in outside services and fees, salaries and employee benefits, advertising expenses and communications expense, partially offset by increases in FDIC assessment expense, other real estate expense and data processing charges related to software. For more information on these noninterest expense items, please see the analysis included in the section captioned Noninterest Expense. 
 Wealth Management 
 Net income for the Wealth Management Segment for the first nine months of 2024 decreased 628 thousand, or 9.7 , when compared to the same time period in 2023, primarily due to an increase in the PCL partially offset by an increase in noninterest income. The PCL for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 totaled 162 thousand compared to a negative PCL of 2.1 million for the same period in 2023, an increase of 2.3 million. Noninterest income for the Wealth Management Segment, which primarily includes income related to investment management, trust and brokerage services, increased 1.7 million, or 6.5 , when the first nine months of 2024 is compared to the same time period in 2023, primarily due to an increase in income from brokerage and investment services. Noninterest expense for the Wealth Management Segment increased 149 thousand, or 0.6 , when the first nine months of 2024 is compared to the same time period in 2023, principally due to an increase in salaries and employee benefits expense, primarily related to broker commissions and trust incentives, partially offset by a decrease in business process outsourcing expense. 
 At September 30, 2024 and 2023, Trustmark held assets under management and administration of 9.425 billion and 8.235 billion, respectively, and brokerage assets of 2.742 billion and 2.431 billion, respectively. 
 Income Taxes 
 For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, Trustmark s combined effective tax rate from continuing operations was 17.8 and 64.0 , respectively, compared to 17.1 and 15.1 , respectively, for the same time periods in 2023. The increase in the effective tax rate from continuing operations for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was principally due to the significant non-routine transactions that occurred during the second quarter of 2024. Excluding the significant non-routine transactions, Trustmark s combined effective tax rate from continuing operations for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 17.4 . Trustmark s effective tax rate continues to be less than the statutory rate primarily due to various tax-exempt income items and its utilization of income tax credit programs. Trustmark invests in partnerships that provide income tax credits on a Federal and/or State basis i.e. , new market tax credits, low-income housing tax credits or historical tax credits). The income tax credits related to these partnerships are utilized as specifically allowed by income tax law and are recorded as a reduction in income tax expense. 
 Financial Condition 
 Earning assets serve as the primary revenue streams for Trustmark and are comprised of securities, loans, federal funds sold, securities sold under reverse repurchase agreements and other earning assets. Average earning assets totaled 17.097 billion, or 91.6 of total average assets, for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 17.076 billion, or 91.5 of total average assets, for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, an increase of 21.5 million, or 0.1 . 
 Securities 
 The securities portfolio is utilized by Management to manage interest rate risk, generate interest income, provide liquidity and use as collateral for public deposits and wholesale funding. Risk and return can be adjusted by altering duration, composition and/or balance of the portfolio. The weighted-average life of the portfolio was 4.7 years at September 30, 2024 compared to 4.5 years at December 31, 2023. The increase in the weighted-average life of the portfolio was principally due to the restructuring of the available for sale securities portfolio during the second quarter of 2024. 
 When compared to December 31, 2023, total investment securities decreased by 105.0 million, or 3.3 , during the first nine months of 2024. This decrease resulted primarily from available for sale securities sold net of available for sale securities purchased as part of the restructuring of the available for sale securities portfolio during the second quarter of 2024 as well as calls, maturities and pay-downs of the loans underlying GSE guaranteed securities, partially offset by improvements in the fair market value of the available for sale securities and available for sale securities purchased during the third quarter of 2024. Trustmark sold 1.561 billion of available for sale securities generating a loss of 182.8 million during the first nine months of 2024, compared to no securities sold during the first nine months of 2023. 
 During 2022, Trustmark reclassified approximately 766.0 million of securities available for sale to securities held to maturity to mitigate the potential adverse impact of a rising interest rate environment on the fair value of the available for sale securities and the related impact on tangible common equity. At the date of these transfers, the net unrealized holding loss on the available for sale 
 79 

securities totaled approximately 91.9 million 68.9 million net of tax). The resulting net unrealized holding losses are being amortized over the remaining life of the securities as a yield adjustment in a manner consistent with the amortization or accretion of the original purchase premium or discount on the associated security. 
 At September 30, 2024, the net unamortized, unrealized loss on all transferred securities included in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) (AOCI) in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets totaled 49.3 million compared to 57.6 million at December 31, 2023. 
 Available for sale securities are carried at their estimated fair value with unrealized gains or losses recognized, net of taxes, in AOCI, a separate component of shareholders equity. At September 30, 2024, available for sale securities totaled 1.726 billion, which represented 56.0 of the securities portfolio, compared to 1.763 billion, or 55.3 of total securities, at December 31, 2023. At September 30, 2024, unrealized gains, net on available for sale securities totaled 34.2 million compared to unrealized losses, net of 196.1 million at December 31, 2023. At September 30, 2024, available for sale securities consisted of U.S. Treasury securities, direct obligations of government agencies and GSE guaranteed mortgage-related securities. 
 Held to maturity securities are carried at amortized cost and represent those securities that Trustmark both intends and has the ability to hold to maturity. At September 30, 2024, held to maturity securities totaled 1.358 billion, which represented 44.0 of the total securities portfolio, compared to 1.426 billion, or 44.7 of total securities, at December 31, 2023. 
 Management continues to focus on asset quality as one of the strategic goals of the securities portfolio, which is evidenced by the investment of 100.0 of the portfolio in U.S. Treasury securities, direct obligations of government agencies, GSE-backed obligations and other Aaa-rated securities as determined by Moody s Investors Services (Moody s). None of the securities owned by Trustmark are collateralized by assets which are considered sub-prime. Furthermore, outside of stock ownership in the FHLB of Dallas and FRBA, Trustmark does not hold any other equity investment in a GSE or other governmental entity. 
 As of September 30, 2024, Trustmark did not hold securities of any one issuer with a carrying value exceeding 10 of total shareholders equity, other than certain GSEs which are exempt from inclusion. Management continues to closely monitor the credit quality as well as the ratings of the debt and mortgage-backed securities issued by the GSEs and held in Trustmark s securities portfolio. 
 The following tables present Trustmark s securities portfolio by amortized cost and estimated fair value and by credit rating, as determined by Moody s, at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 in thousands):

LHFI increased 149.6 million, or 1.2 , compared to December 31, 2023. The increase in LHFI during the first nine months of 2024 was primarily due to net growth in LHFI secured by real estate and other commercial loans and leases partially offset by declines in commercial and industrial LHFI and state and other political subdivision LHFI. 
 LHFI secured by real estate increased 324.2 million, or 3.5 , during the first nine months of 2024, reflecting net growth in other real estate secured LHFI, other construction LHFI, LHFI secured by nonfarm, nonresidential properties (NFNR), and other LHFI secured by 1-4 family residential properties, partially offset by net declines in construction, land development and other land LHFI and LHFI secured by 1-4 family residential properties. Other real estate secured LHFI increased 163.2 million, or 12.4 , during the first nine months of 2024, primarily due to other construction loans that moved to LHFI secured by multi-family residential properties in the Alabama, Texas and Mississippi market regions. Excluding other construction loan reclassifications, other real estate secured LHFI decreased 175.5 million, or 13.4 , during the first nine months of 2024 principally due to declines in LHFI secured by multi-family residential properties in the Alabama and Mississippi market regions. Other construction loans increased 105.7 million, or 12.2 , during the first nine months of 2024 primarily due to new construction loans in the Alabama, Mississippi, Texas, Georgia and Florida market regions partially offset by other construction loans moved to other loan categories upon the completion of the related construction project. During the first nine months of 2024, 729.0 million loans were moved from other construction to other loan categories, including 338.8 million to multi-family residential loans, 362.9 million to nonowner-occupied loans and 27.3 million to owner-occupied loans. Excluding all reclassifications between loan categories, growth in other construction loans across all six market regions totaled 811.7 million, or 93.5 , during the first nine months of 2024. NFNR LHFI increased 93.1 million, or 2.7 , during the first nine months of 2024 principally due to other construction loans that moved to NFNR LHFI in the Mississippi, Alabama, Texas and Georgia market regions. Excluding other construction loan reclassifications, NFNR LHFI decreased 297.0 million, or 8.5 , during the first nine months of 2024 principally due to declines in nonowner-occupied loans and owner-occupied loans in the Mississippi, Texas, Tennessee and Florida market regions. Other LHFI secured by 1-4 family residential properties increased 25.4 million, or 4.1 , during the first nine months of 2024, principally due to growth in the Mississippi, Florida, Texas and Alabama market regions. LHFI secured by construction, land development and other land decreased 28.1 million, or 4.4 , during the first nine months of 2024 primarily due to declines in land development loans in the Alabama and Mississippi market regions, partially offset by growth in the 
 81 

1-4 family construction loans in the Alabama and Tennessee market regions. LHFI secured by 1-4 family residential properties decreased 35.2 million, or 1.5 , during the first nine months of 2024 primarily in the Mississippi market region as a result of the sale of 1-4 family mortgage loans during the second quarter of 2024. Trustmark's LHFI secured by 1-4 family residential properties are primarily included in the Mississippi market region because these loans are centrally analyzed and approved as part of the mortgage line of business which is located in Jackson, Mississippi. 
 Other commercial loans and leases increased 86.8 million, or 15.6 , during the first nine months of 2024, principally due to increases in equipment finance leases in the Georgia market region and other commercial loans in the Tennessee market region, partially offset by declines in other commercial loans in the Mississippi market region. Trustmark's commercial leases are included in the Georgia market region because these leases are centrally analyzed and approved as part of the Equipment Finance line of business which is located in Atlanta, Georgia. Commercial and industrial LHFI declined 155.8 million, or 8.1 , during the first nine months of 2024 reflecting declines in the Tennessee, Mississippi, Texas and Florida market regions, partially offset by growth in the Georgia and Alabama market regions. State and other political subdivision LHFI declined 92.5 million, or 8.5 , during the first nine months of 2024, reflecting declines in the Mississippi, Texas, Georgia and Tennessee market regions. 
 The following table provides information regarding Trustmark s home equity loans and home equity lines of credit which are included in the LHFI secured by 1-4 family residential properties for the periods presented in thousands):

52.5 

52.2 

Due to the increased risk associated with second liens, loan terms and underwriting guidelines differ from those used for products secured by first liens. Loan amounts and loan-to-value ratios are limited and are lower for second liens than first liens. Also, interest rates and maximum amortization periods are adjusted accordingly. In addition, regardless of lien position, the passing credit score for approval of all home equity lines of credit is generally higher than that of term loans. The ACL on LHFI is also reflective of the increased risk related to second liens through application of a greater loss factor to this portion of the portfolio. 
 Trustmark s variable rate LHFI are based primarily on various prime and SOFR interest rate bases. The following tables provide information regarding the interest rate terms of Trustmark s LHFI as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 in thousands):

Allowance for Credit Losses 
 LHFI 
 Trustmark s ACL methodology for LHFI is based upon guidance within FASB ASC Subtopic 326-20, Financial Instruments Credit Losses Measured at Amortized Cost, as well as applicable regulatory guidance from its primary regulator. The ACL is a valuation account that is deducted from the loans amortized cost basis to present the net amount expected to be collected on the loans. Credit quality within the LHFI portfolio is continuously monitored by Management and is reflected within the ACL for loans. The ACL is an 
 84 

estimate of expected losses inherent within Trustmark s existing LHFI portfolio. The ACL on LHFI is adjusted through the PCL, LHFI and reduced by the charge off of loan amounts, net of recoveries. 
 The loan loss estimation process involves procedures to appropriately consider the unique characteristics of Trustmark s LHFI portfolio segments. These segments are further disaggregated into loan classes, the level at which credit risk is estimated. When computing allowance levels, credit loss assumptions are estimated using a model that categorizes loan pools based on loss history, delinquency status and other credit trends and risk characteristics, including current conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts about the future. Evaluations of the portfolio and individual credits are inherently subjective, as they require estimates, assumptions and judgments as to the facts and circumstances of particular situations. 
 During the second quarter of 2024, Trustmark executed a sale on a portfolio of 1-4 family mortgage loans that were at least three payments delinquent and/or nonaccrual at the time of selection. As a result of this sale, a credit mark was established for a sub-pool of the loans in the sale. Due to the lack of historical experience and the use of industry data for this sub-pool, management elected to use the credit mark for reserving purposes on a go forward basis for this sub-pool that meet the same credit criteria of being three payments delinquent and/or nonaccrual. All loans of the sub-pool that meet the above credit criteria will be removed from the 1-4 family residential properties pool and placed into a separate pool with the credit mark reserve applied to the total balance. 
 The econometric models currently in production reflect segment or pool level sensitivities of probability of default (PD) to changes in macroeconomic variables. By measuring the relationship between defaults and changes in the economy, the quantitative reserve incorporates reasonable and supportable forecasts of future conditions that will affect the value of Trustmark's assets, as required by FASB ASC Topic 326. Under stable forecasts, these linear regressions will reasonably predict a pool s PD. However, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the macroeconomic variables used for reasonable and supportable forecasting changed rapidly. At the macroeconomic levels experienced during the COVID-19 pandemic, it was not clear that the models in production would produce reasonably representative results since the models were originally estimated using data beginning in 2004 through 2019. During this period, a traditional, albeit severe, economic recession occurred. Thus, econometric models are sensitive to similar future levels of PD. 
 In order to prevent the econometric models from extrapolating beyond reasonable boundaries of their input variables, Trustmark chose to establish an upper and lower limit process when applying the periodic forecasts. In this way, Management will not rely upon unobserved and untested relationships in the setting of the quantitative reserve. This approach applies to all input variables, including: Southern Unemployment, National Unemployment, National Gross Domestic Product (GDP), National Home Price Index (HPI), National Commercial Real Estate (CRE) Price Index and the BBB 7-10 Year US Corporate Bond Index. The upper and lower limits are based on the distribution of the macroeconomic variable by selecting extreme percentiles at the upper and lower limits of the distribution, the 1st and 99th percentiles, respectively. These upper and lower limits are then used to calculate the PD for the forecast time period in which the forecasted values are outside of the upper and lower limit range. Due to multiple periods having a PD or loss given default (LGD) at or near zero as a result of the improving macroeconomic forecasts, Management implemented PD and LGD floors to account for the risk associated with each portfolio. The PD and LGD floors are based on Trustmark's historical loss experience and applied at a portfolio level. 
 The external factors qualitative factor is Management s best judgment on the loan or pool level impact of all factors that affect the portfolio that are not accounted for using any other part of the ACL methodology (i.e., natural disasters, changes in legislation, impacts due to technology and pandemics). During the third quarter of 2024, Trustmark activated the External Factor Credit Quality Review qualitative factor. This qualitative factor ensures reserve adequacy for collectively evaluated commercial loans that may not have been identified and downgraded timely for various reasons. This qualitative factor population is all commercial loans risk rated 1-5. These loans are then applied to the historical average of the Watch/Special Mention rated percentage. Then the balance of these loans are applied additional reserves based on the same reserve rates utilized in the performance trends qualitative factor for Watch/Special Mention rated loans. Then the Watch/Special Mention population is applied the historical Substandard rated percentage and then subsequently applied the Substandard reserve rate utilized in the performance trends qualitative factor as well. The historical Watch/Special Mention and Substandard rated percentage averages captures the weighted-average life of the commercial loan portfolio. Thus, Trustmark will allocate additional reserves to capture the proportion of potential Watch/Special Mention and Substandard rated credits that may not have been categorized as such at any given point in time through the life of the commercial loan portfolio. 
 During 2022, Management elected to activate the nature and volume of the portfolio qualitative factor as a result of a sub-pool of the secured by 1-4 family residential properties growing to a significant size along with the underlying nature being different as well. The nature and volume of the portfolio qualitative factor utilizes a WARM methodology that uses industry data for the assumptions to support the qualitative adjustment. The industry data is used to compile a PD based on credit score ranges along with using the industry data to compile an LGD. The sub-pools of credits are then aggregated into the appropriate credit score bands in which a weighted-average loss rate is calculated based on the PD and LGD for each credit score range. This weighted-average loss rate is then applied to the expected balance for the sub-segment of credits. This total is then used as the qualitative reserve adjustment. 
 85 

Trustmark's current quantitative methodologies do not completely incorporate changes in credit quality. As a result, Trustmark utilizes the performance trends qualitative factor. This factor is based on migration analyses, that allocates additional ACL to non-pass/delinquent loans within each pool. In this way, Management believes the ACL will directly reflect changes in risk, based on the performance of the loans within a pool, whether declining or improving. 
 The performance trends qualitative factor is estimated by properly segmenting loan pools into risk levels by risk rating for commercial credits and delinquency status for consumer credits. A migration analysis is then performed quarterly using a third-party software and the results for each risk level are compiled to calculate the historical PD average for each loan portfolio based on risk levels. This average historical PD rate is updated annually. For the mortgage portfolio, Trustmark uses an internal report to incorporate a roll rate method for the calculation of the PD rate. In addition to the PD rate for each portfolio, Management incorporates the quantitative rate and the k value derived from the Frye-Jacobs method to calculate a loss estimate that includes both PD and LGD. The quantitative rate is used to eliminate any additional reserve that the quantitative reserve already includes. Finally, the loss estimate rate is then applied to the total balances for each risk level for each portfolio to calculate a qualitative reserve. 
 Determining the appropriateness of the allowance is complex and requires judgment by Management about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. In future periods, evaluations of the overall LHFI portfolio, in light of the factors and forecasts then prevailing, may result in significant changes in the allowance and credit loss expense. 
 For a complete description of Trustmark s ACL methodology and the quantitative and qualitative factors included in the calculation, please see Note 4 LHFI and Allowance for Credit Losses, LHFI included in Part I. Item 1. Financial Statements of this report. 
 At September 30, 2024, the ACL on LHFI was 157.9 million, an increase of 18.6 million, or 13.3 , when compared with December 31, 2023. The increase in the ACL during the first nine months of 2024 was principally due to net adjustments to the qualitative factors due to credit migration, implementation of the External Factor-Credit Quality Review qualitative factor, and an increase in specific reserves on individually analyzed LHFI, partially offset by net changes in the macroeconomic forecast associated with specific loss driver models as a result of loss driver updates and net changes in other qualitative reserve factors. Allocation of Trustmark s 157.9 million ACL on LHFI, represented 1.08 of commercial LHFI and 1.64 of consumer and home mortgage LHFI, resulting in an ACL to total LHFI of 1.21 as of September 30, 2024. This compares with an ACL to total LHFI of 1.08 at December 31, 2023, which was allocated to commercial LHFI at 0.85 and to consumer and mortgage LHFI at 1.81 .

The increase in net charge-offs when the three months ended September 30, 2024 is compared to the same time period in 2023 was principally due to an increase in gross charge-offs in the Alabama market region, primarily related to one large nonaccrual commercial credit, and a decline in recoveries in the Tennessee market region, partially offset by a decrease in gross charge-offs in the Texas market region. The increase in net charge-offs when the nine months ended September 30, 2024, is compared to the same time period in 2023 was principally due to the charge-offs related to the sale of 1-4 family mortgage loans during the second quarter of 2024 and an increase in gross charge-offs in the Alabama and Texas market regions, primarily related to two large nonaccrual commercial credits, as well as a decline in recoveries in the Tennessee market region.

The PCL, LHFI, excluding the PCL, LHFI 1-4 family mortgage loans, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 totaled 0.24 and 0.30 , respectively, of average loans (LHFS and LHFI) compared to 0.26 and 0.21 , respectively, of average loans (LHFS and LHFI) for the same time periods in 2023. The PCL on LHFI, excluding the PCL, LHFI sale of 1-4 family mortgage loans, for the three months ended September 30, 2024 primarily reflected increases in required reserves related to individually analyzed LHFI and the implementation of the External Factor-Credit Quality Review qualitative factor, partially offset by declines in required reserves resulting from the update of the macroeconomic forecasts and net changes in other qualitative reserve factors. The PCL on LHFI, excluding the PCL, LHFI 1-4 family mortgage loans, for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 primarily reflected an increase in required reserves as a result of net adjustments to the qualitative factors due to credit migration, implementation of the External Factor-Credit Quality Review qualitative factor, and specific reserves for individually analyzed LHFI, partially offset by net changes in the macroeconomic forecast associated with specific loss driver models as a result of loss driver updates and net changes in other qualitative reserve factors. 
 Off-Balance Sheet Credit Exposures 
 Trustmark maintains a separate ACL on off-balance sheet credit exposures, including unfunded loan commitments and letters of credit, which is included on the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. Expected credit losses for off-balance sheet credit exposures are estimated by calculating a commitment usage factor over the contractual period for exposures that are not unconditionally cancellable by Trustmark. Trustmark calculates a loan pool level unfunded amount for the period. Trustmark calculates an expected funding rate each period which is applied to each pool s unfunded commitment balances to ensure that reserves will be applied to each pool based upon balances expected to be funded based upon historical levels. Additionally, a reserve rate is applied to the unfunded commitment balance, which incorporates both quantitative and a majority of the qualitative aspects of the current period s expected credit loss rate. The reserve rate that is applied excludes the reserve impact of the performance trends qualitative factor. During the first quarter of 2024, Management decided to implement a performance trends qualitative factor for unfunded commitments. Additionally, during the third quarter of 2024, Management implemented the External Factor Credit Quality Review qualitative factor for unfunded commitments. The same assumptions are applied in these calculations that the funded balances utilize with the addition of using the funding rates on the unfunded commitments. The performance trends qualitative factor reserve and the External Factor Credit Quality Review qualitative factor reserve are then added to the other calculated reserve to get a total reserve for off-balance sheet credit exposures. See the section captioned ACL on Off-Balance Sheet Credit Exposures in Note 13 Contingencies included in Part I. Item 1. Financial Statements of this report for complete description of Trustmark s ACL methodology on off-balance sheet credit exposures. 
 Adjustments to the ACL on off-balance sheet credit exposures are recorded to the PCL, off-balance sheet credit exposures. At September 30, 2024, the ACL on off-balance sheet credit exposures totaled 28.9 million compared to 34.1 million at December 31, 2023, a decrease of 5.2 million, or 15.2 . The PCL, off-balance sheet credit exposures totaled a negative 1.4 million and a negative 5.2 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, compared to 104 thousand and a negative 1.9 million, respectively, for the same time periods in 2023. The release in PCL on off-balance sheet credit exposures for the three months ended September 30, 2024, primarily reflected a decrease in required reserves as a result of a decrease in unfunded commitments and changes in the total reserve rate, partially offset by an increase in required reserves as a result of implementing the External Factor-Credit Quality Review qualitative reserve factor. The release in PCL on off-balance sheet credit exposures for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, primarily reflected a decrease in required reserves as a result of a decrease in unfunded commitments and changes in the total reserve rate, partially offset by an increase in required reserves as a result of implementing the performance trend and the External Factor-Credit Quality Review qualitative reserve factors.

 Nonaccrual LHFI 
 At September 30, 2024, nonaccrual LHFI totaled 73.8 million, or 0.55 of total LHFS and LHFI, reflecting a decrease of 26.2 million, or 26.2 , relative to December 31, 2023. The decrease in nonaccrual LHFI during the first nine months of 2024 was primarily as a result of the sale of 1-4 family mortgage loans during the second quarter of 2024 as well as the resolution of two large nonaccrual commercial credits in the Texas and Alabama market regions, partially offset by three large commercial credits placed on nonaccrual in the Alabama and Texas market regions. 
 For additional information regarding nonaccrual LHFI, see the section captioned Nonaccrual and Past Due LHFI included in Note 4 LHFI and Allowance for Credit Losses, LHFI in Part I. Item 1. Financial Statements of this report. 
 Other Real Estate 
 Other real estate at September 30, 2024 decreased 2.9 million, or 42.9 , when compared with December 31, 2023. The decrease in other real estate was principally due to properties sold in the Mississippi and Alabama market regions and a reserve for other real estate write-downs recorded for a foreclosed property in the Texas market region which is under contract to be sold during the fourth quarter of 2024, partially offset by properties foreclosed in the Mississippi market region. During the first nine months of 2024, Trustmark foreclosed and subsequently sold properties totaling 3.0 million in the Mississippi market region, 2.1 million of which was sold as part of the sale of 1-4 family mortgage loans during the second quarter of 2024.

Other real estate is revalued on an annual basis or more often if market conditions necessitate. Subsequent to foreclosure, losses on the periodic revaluation of the property are charged against the reserve for other real estate write-downs or net income in other real estate expense, if a reserve does not exist. Write-downs of other real estate increased 2.0 million when the first nine months of 2024 is compared to the same time period in 2023, primarily due to reserve for other real estate write-downs for a foreclosed property in the Texas market region which was under contract to be sold during the fourth quarter of 2024. 
 For additional information regarding other real estate, please see Note 6 Other Real Estate included in Part I. Item 1. Financial Statements of this report. 
 Deposits 
 Trustmark s deposits are its primary source of funding and primarily consist of core deposits from the communities Trustmark serves. Deposits include interest-bearing and noninterest-bearing demand accounts, savings, MMDA, CDs and individual retirement accounts. Total deposits were 15.241 billion at September 30, 2024 compared to 15.570 billion at December 31, 2023, a decrease of 328.8 million, or 2.1 . During the first nine months of 2024, noninterest-bearing deposits decreased 54.8 million, or 1.7 , principally due to declines in consumer noninterest-bearing demand deposit accounts. Interest-bearing deposits decreased 274.0 million, or 2.2 , during the first nine months of 2024, primarily due to declines in public and consumer interest checking accounts, consumer savings accounts and brokered CDs, partially offset by growth in commercial interest checking accounts and commercial and consumer MMDA and CDs. 
 At September 30, 2024, Trustmark's total uninsured deposits were 5.402 billion, or 35.4 of total deposits, compared to 5.601 billion, or 36.0 of total deposits, at December 31, 2023. 
 89 

Borrowings 
 Trustmark uses short-term borrowings, such as federal funds purchased, securities sold under repurchase agreements and short-term FHLB advances, to fund growth of earning assets in excess of deposit growth. See the section captioned Liquidity for further discussion of the components of Trustmark s excess funding capacity. 
 Federal funds purchased and securities sold under repurchase agreements totaled 365.6 million at September 30, 2024 compared to 405.7 million at December 31, 2023, a decrease of 40.1 million, or 9.9 , principally due to a decrease in upstream federal funds purchased. At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, 40.6 million and 35.7 million, respectively, represented customer related transactions, such as commercial sweep repurchase balances. Trustmark had 325.0 million of upstream federal funds purchased at September 30, 2024 compared to 370.0 million at December 31, 2023. 
 Other borrowings totaled 443.5 million at September 30, 2024, a decrease of 39.8 million, or 8.2 , when compared with 483.2 million at December 31, 2023, principally due to a decline in outstanding short-term FHLB advances with the FHLB of Dallas. 
 Legal Environment 
 Information required in this section is set forth under the heading Legal Proceedings of Note 13 Contingencies included in Part I. Item 1. Financial Statements of this report. 
 Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 
 Information required in this section is set forth under the heading Lending Related of Note 13 Contingencies included in Part I. Item 1. Financial Statements of this report. 
 Capital Resources and Liquidity 
 Trustmark places a significant emphasis on the maintenance of a strong capital position, which promotes investor confidence, provides access to funding sources under favorable terms and enhances Trustmark s ability to capitalize on business growth and acquisition opportunities. Higher levels of liquidity, however, bear corresponding costs, measured in terms of lower yields on short-term, more liquid earning assets and higher expenses for extended liability maturities. Trustmark manages capital based upon risks and growth opportunities as well as regulatory requirements. Trustmark utilizes a capital model in order to provide Management with a monthly tool for analyzing changes in its strategic capital ratios. This allows Management to hold sufficient capital to provide for growth opportunities and protect the balance sheet against sudden adverse market conditions, while maintaining an attractive return on equity to shareholders. 
 At September 30, 2024, Trustmark s total shareholders equity was 1.980 billion, an increase of 318.2 million, or 19.2 , when compared to December 31, 2023. During the first nine months of 2024, shareholders equity increased primarily as a result of a 172.8 million positive net change in the fair market value of securities available for sale, principally due to the restructuring of the available for sale securities portfolio during the second quarter of 2024, as well as net income of 166.7 million, partially offset by common stock dividends of 42.6 million. 
 Regulatory Capital 
 Trustmark and TNB are subject to minimum risk-based capital and leverage capital requirements, as described in the section captioned Capital Adequacy included in Part I. Item 1. Business of Trustmark s 2023 Annual Report, which are administered by the federal bank regulatory agencies. These capital requirements, as defined by federal regulations, involve quantitative and qualitative measures of assets, liabilities and certain off-balance sheet instruments. Trustmark s and TNB s minimum risk-based capital requirements include a capital conservation buffer of 2.5 . AOCI is not included in computing regulatory capital. Trustmark elected the five-year phase-in transition period (through December 31, 2024) related to adopting FASB ASU 2016-13 for regulatory capital purposes. Failure to meet minimum capital requirements can result in certain mandatory and possibly additional discretionary actions by regulators that, if undertaken, could have a direct material effect on the financial statements of Trustmark and TNB and limit Trustmark s and TNB s ability to pay dividends. At September 30, 2024, Trustmark and TNB exceeded all applicable minimum capital standards. In addition, Trustmark and TNB met applicable regulatory guidelines to be considered well-capitalized at September 30, 2024. To be categorized in this manner, Trustmark and TNB maintained minimum common equity Tier 1 risk-based capital, Tier 1 risk-based capital, total risk-based capital and Tier 1 leverage ratios, and were not subject to any written agreement, order or capital directive, or prompt corrective action directive issued by their primary federal regulators to meet and maintain a specific capital level for any capital measures. There are no significant conditions or events that have occurred since September 30, 2024 which Management believes have affected Trustmark s or TNB s present classification. 
 90 

In 2020, Trustmark enhanced its capital structure with the issuance of 125.0 million of subordinated notes. At September 30, 2024, the carrying amount of the subordinated notes was 123.6 million compared to 123.5 million at December 31, 2023. The subordinated notes mature December 1, 2030 and are redeemable at Trustmark s option under certain circumstances. For regulatory capital purposes, the subordinated notes qualified as Tier 2 capital for Trustmark at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. Trustmark may utilize the full carrying value of the subordinated notes as Tier 2 capital until December 1, 2025 (five years prior to maturity). Beginning December 1, 2025, the subordinated notes will phase out of Tier 2 capital 20.0 each year until maturity. 
 In 2006, Trustmark enhanced its capital structure with the issuance of trust preferred securities. For regulatory capital purposes, the trust preferred securities qualified as Tier 1 capital at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. Trustmark intends to continue to utilize 60.0 million in trust preferred securities issued by Trustmark Preferred Capital Trust I (the Trust) as Tier 1 capital up to the regulatory limit, as permitted by the grandfather provision in the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act and the Basel III Final Rule. 
 Refer to the section captioned Regulatory Capital included in Note 16 Shareholders Equity in Part I. Item 1. Financial Statements of this report for an illustration of Trustmark s and TNB s actual regulatory capital amounts and ratios under regulatory capital standards in effect at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. 
 Dividends on Common Stock 
 Dividends per common share for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 were 0.69. Trustmark s indicated dividend for 2024 is 0.92 per common share, which is the same as dividends per common share declared in 2023. 
 Stock Repurchase Program 
 From time to time, Trustmark's Board of Directors has authorized stock repurchase plans. In general, stock repurchase plans allow Trustmark to proactively manage its capital position and return excess capital to shareholders. Shares purchased also provide Trustmark with shares of common stock necessary to satisfy obligations related to stock compensation awards. 
 On December 6, 2022, the Board of Directors of Trustmark authorized a stock repurchase program, effective January 1, 2023, under which 50.0 million of Trustmark's outstanding common stock could be acquired through December 31, 2023. No shares were repurchased under this authority. 
 On December 5, 2023, the Board of Directors of Trustmark authorized a new stock repurchase program, effective January 1, 2024, under which 50.0 million of Trustmark's outstanding common stock may be acquired through December 31, 2024. The repurchase program, which is subject to market conditions and management discretion, will be implemented through open market repurchases or privately negotiated transactions. No shares were repurchased under this authority during the first nine months of 2024. 
 Liquidity 
 Liquidity is the ability to ensure that sufficient cash flow and liquid assets are available to satisfy current and future financial obligations, including demand for loans and deposit withdrawals, funding operating costs and other corporate purposes. Consistent cash flows from operations and adequate capital provide internally generated liquidity. Furthermore, Management maintains funding capacity from a variety of external sources to meet daily funding needs, such as those required to meet deposit withdrawals, loan disbursements and security settlements. Liquidity strategy also includes the use of wholesale funding sources to provide for the seasonal fluctuations of deposit and loan demand and the cyclical fluctuations of the economy that impact the availability of funds. Management keeps excess funding capacity available to meet potential demands associated with adverse circumstances. 
 The asset side of the balance sheet provides liquidity primarily through maturities and cash flows from loans and securities as well as the ability to pledge or sell certain loans and securities. The liability portion of the balance sheet provides liquidity primarily through noninterest and interest-bearing deposits. Trustmark utilizes federal funds purchased, FHLB advances, securities sold under repurchase agreements, the Federal Reserve Discount Window (Discount Window) and brokered deposits to provide additional liquidity. Access to these additional sources represents Trustmark s incremental borrowing capacity. 
 Trustmark's liquidity position is continuously monitored and adjustments are made to manage the balance as deemed appropriate. Liquidity risk management is an important element to Trustmark's asset/liability management process. Trustmark regularly models liquidity stress scenarios to assess potential liquidity outflows or funding problems resulting from economic disruptions or other significant occurrences as deemed appropriate by Management. These scenarios are incorporated into Trustmark's contingency funding plan, which provides the basis for the identification of its liquidity needs. 
 91 

Deposit accounts represent Trustmark s largest funding source. Average deposits totaled 15.412 billion for the first nine months of 2024 and represented approximately 82.6 of average liabilities and shareholders equity, compared to average deposits of 14.810 billion, which represented 79.4 of average liabilities and shareholders equity for the first nine months of 2023. For more information on average interest-bearing deposits, please see the analysis included in the section captioned Net Interest Income. 
 Trustmark had 540.0 million held in an interest-bearing account at the FRBA at September 30, 2024, compared to 712.0 million held at December 31, 2023. 
 Trustmark utilizes brokered deposits to supplement other wholesale funding sources. At both September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, brokered sweep MMDA deposits totaled 10.6 million. In addition, Trustmark had 399.9 million of brokered CDs at September 30, 2024 compared to 578.8 million at December 31, 2023. 
 At September 30, 2024, Trustmark had 325.0 million of upstream federal funds purchased compared to 370.0 million of upstream federal funds purchased at December 31, 2023. Trustmark maintains adequate federal funds lines to provide sufficient short-term liquidity. 
 Trustmark maintains a relationship with the FHLB of Dallas, which provided 350.0 million of outstanding short-term and no long-term advances at September 30, 2024, compared to 400.0 million of outstanding short-term and no long-term advances at December 31, 2023. Under the existing borrowing agreement, Trustmark had sufficient qualifying collateral to increase FHLB advances or letters of credit with the FHLB of Dallas by 4.052 billion at September 30, 2024. 
 In addition, at September 30, 2024, Trustmark had no short-term or long-term FHLB advances outstanding with the FHLB of Atlanta compared to no short-term and 58 thousand in long-term FHLB advances at December 31, 2023, which were acquired in the BancTrust merger in 2013. Trustmark had non-member status and thus no additional borrowing capacity with the FHLB of Atlanta. 
 Additionally, Trustmark has the ability to leverage its unencumbered investment securities as collateral. At September 30, 2024, Trustmark had approximately 1.043 billion available in unencumbered Treasury and agency securities compared to 842.0 million in unencumbered Treasury and agency securities at December 31, 2023. 
 Another borrowing source is the Discount Window. At September 30, 2024, Trustmark had approximately 1.191 billion available in collateral capacity at the Discount Window primarily from pledges of commercial and industrial LHFI, compared with 1.374 billion at December 31, 2023. 
 During 2020, Trustmark issued 125.0 million aggregate principal amount of its 3.625 fixed-to-floating rate subordinated notes. At September 30, 2024, the carrying amount of the subordinated notes was 123.6 million compared to 123.5 million at December 31, 2023. The subordinated notes mature December 1, 2030 and are redeemable at Trustmark s option under certain circumstances. The subordinated notes are unsecured obligations and are subordinated in right of payment to all of Trustmark s existing and future senior indebtedness, whether secured or unsecured. The subordinated notes are obligations of Trustmark only and are not obligations of, and are not guaranteed by, any of its subsidiaries, including TNB. 
 During 2006, Trustmark completed a private placement of 60.0 million of trust preferred securities through a newly formed Delaware trust affiliate, the Trust. The trust preferred securities mature September 30, 2036 and are redeemable at Trustmark s option. The proceeds from the sale of the trust preferred securities were used by the Trust to purchase 61.9 million in aggregate principal amount of Trustmark s junior subordinated debentures. 
 The Board of Directors of Trustmark currently has the authority to issue up to 20.0 million preferred shares with no par value. The ability to issue preferred shares in the future will provide Trustmark with additional financial and management flexibility for general corporate and acquisition purposes. At September 30, 2024, Trustmark had no shares of preferred stock issued and outstanding. 
 Management believes that Trustmark has sufficient liquidity and capital resources to meet presently known cash flow requirements arising from ongoing business transactions. As of September 30, 2024, Management is not aware of any events that are reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on Trustmark's liquidity, capital resources or operations. In addition, Management is not aware of any regulatory recommendations regarding liquidity that would have a material adverse effect on Trustmark. 
 In the ordinary course of business, Trustmark has entered into contractual obligations and has made other commitments to make future payments. Please refer to the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements included in Part I. Item 1. Financial Statements of this report and Trustmark's 2023 Annual Report for the expected timing of such payments as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. There have been no material changes in Trustmark's contractual obligations since year-end.

Asset/Liability Management 
 Overview 
 Market risk reflects the potential risk of loss arising from adverse changes in interest rates and market prices. Trustmark has risk management policies to monitor and limit exposure to market risk. Trustmark s primary market risk is interest rate risk created by core banking activities. Interest rate risk is the potential variability of the income generated by Trustmark s financial products or services, which results from changes in various market interest rates. Market rate changes may take the form of absolute shifts, variances in the relationships between different rates and changes in the shape or slope of the interest rate term structure. 
 Following the LIBOR cessation date of June 30, 2023, the nationwide process for replacing LIBOR in financial contracts that mature thereafter and that do not provide for an effective means to replace LIBOR upon its cessation took effect pursuant to the Adjustable Interest Rate (LIBOR) Act. For contracts in which a party has the discretion to identify a replacement rate, the Adjustable Interest Rate (LIBOR) Act also provides a safe harbor to parties if they choose the SOFR-based benchmark replacement rate to be identified by the FRB. Trustmark had a significant number of loans, derivative contracts, borrowings and other financial instruments with attributes that were either directly or indirectly dependent on LIBOR. As of September 30, 2024, all of Trustmark s LIBOR exposure was remediated or in the process of being remediated. The transition from LIBOR could create costs and additional risk. Trustmark cannot predict what the ultimate impact of the transition from LIBOR will be; however, Trustmark has implemented various measures to manage the transition and mitigate risks. For additional information regarding the transition from LIBOR and Trustmark s management of this transition, please see the respective risk factor included in Part I. Item 1A. Risk Factors, of Trustmark s 2023 Annual Report. 
 Management continually develops and applies cost-effective strategies to manage these risks. Management s Asset/Liability Committee sets the day-to-day operating guidelines, approves strategies affecting net interest income and coordinates activities within policy limits established by the Board of Directors of Trustmark. A key objective of the asset/liability management program is to quantify, monitor and manage interest rate risk and to assist Management in maintaining stability in the net interest margin under varying interest rate environments. 
 Derivatives 
 Trustmark uses financial derivatives for management of interest rate risk. Management s Asset/Liability Committee, in its oversight role for the management of interest rate risk, approves the use of derivatives in balance sheet hedging strategies. The most common derivatives employed by Trustmark are interest rate lock commitments, forward contracts (both futures contracts and options on futures contracts), interest rate swaps, interest rate caps and interest rate floors. As a general matter, the values of these instruments are designed to be inversely related to the values of the assets that they hedge i.e ., if the value of the hedged asset falls, the value of the related hedge rises). In addition, Trustmark has entered into derivatives contracts as counterparty to one or more customers in connection with loans extended to those customers. These transactions are designed to hedge interest rate exposure of the customers and are not entered into by Trustmark for speculative purposes. Increased federal regulation of the derivatives markets may increase the cost to Trustmark to administer derivatives programs. 
 Derivatives Designated as Hedging Instruments 
 Trustmark engages in a cash flow hedging program to add stability to interest income and to manage its exposure to interest rate movements. Interest rate swaps designated as cash flow hedges involve the receipt of fixed-rate amounts from a counterparty in exchange for Trustmark making variable-rate payments over the life of the agreements without exchange of the underlying notional amount. Interest rate floor spreads designated as cash flow hedges involve the receipt of variable-rate amounts if interest rates fall below the purchased floor strike rate on the contract and payments of variable rate amounts if interest rates fall below the sold floor strike rate on the contract. Trustmark uses such derivatives to hedge the variable cash flows associated with existing and anticipated variable-rate loan assets. At September 30, 2024, the aggregate notional value of Trustmark's interest rate swaps and floor spreads designated as cash flow hedges totaled 1.390 billion compared to 1.125 billion at December 31, 2023. 
 Trustmark records any gains or losses on these cash flow hedges in AOCI. Gains and losses on derivatives representing hedge components excluded from the assessment of effectiveness are recognized over the life of the hedge on a systematic and rational basis, as documented at hedge inception in accordance with Trustmark s accounting policy election. The earnings recognition of excluded components included in interest and fees on LHFS and LHFI totaled 132 thousand and 341 thousand of amortization expense for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, compared to 13 thousand and 35 thousand of amortization expense for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively. As interest payments are received on Trustmark's variable-rate assets, amounts reported in AOCI are reclassified into interest and fees on LHFS and LHFI in the accompanying consolidated statements of income during the same period. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, Trustmark reclassified a loss, net of tax, of 3.6 million and 10.9 million, respectively, into interest and fees on LHFS and LHFI, compared to 3.5 million and 8.7 million for the same time periods in 2023, respectively. During the next twelve months, Trustmark estimates that 5.8 million will be reclassified 
 93 

as a reduction to interest and fees on LHFS and LHFI. This amount could differ due to changes in interest rates, hedge de-designations or the addition of other hedges. 
 Derivatives Not Designated as Hedging Instruments 
 As part of Trustmark s risk management strategy in the mortgage banking business, various derivative instruments such as interest rate lock commitments and forward sales contracts are utilized. Rate lock commitments are residential mortgage loan commitments with customers, which guarantee a specified interest rate for a specified period of time. Trustmark s obligations under forward contracts consist of commitments to deliver mortgage loans, originated and/or purchased, in the secondary market at a future date. The gross notional amount of Trustmark s off-balance sheet obligations under these derivative instruments totaled 197.5 million at September 30, 2024, with a positive valuation adjustment of 560 thousand, compared to 171.4 million, with a negative valuation adjustment of 150 thousand at December 31, 2023. 
 Trustmark utilizes a portfolio of exchange-traded derivative instruments, such as Treasury note futures contracts and option contracts, to achieve a fair value return that economically hedges changes in fair value of the MSR attributable to interest rates. These transactions are considered freestanding derivatives that do not otherwise qualify for hedge accounting under GAAP. The total notional amount of these derivative instruments was 296.5 million at September 30, 2024 compared to 285.0 million at December 31, 2023. These exchange-traded derivative instruments are accounted for at fair value with changes in the fair value recorded as noninterest income (loss) in mortgage banking, net and are offset by the changes in the fair value of the MSR. The MSR fair value represents the present value of future cash flows, which among other things includes decay and the effect of changes in interest rates. Ineffectiveness of hedging the MSR fair value is measured by comparing the change in value of hedge instruments to the change in the fair value of the MSR asset attributable to changes in interest rates and other market driven changes in valuation inputs and assumptions. The impact of this strategy resulted in a net negative ineffectiveness of 2.5 million and 1.0 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the impact was a net negative ineffectiveness of 8.1 million and 4.1 million, respectively. 
 Trustmark offers certain interest rate derivatives products directly to qualified commercial lending clients seeking to manage their interest rate risk under loans they have entered into with TNB. Trustmark economically hedges interest rate swap transactions executed with commercial lending clients by entering into offsetting interest rate swap transactions with institutional derivatives market participants. Derivatives transactions executed as part of this program are not designated as qualifying hedging relationships under GAAP and are, therefore, carried on Trustmark s financial statements at fair value with the change in fair value recorded as noninterest income in bank card and other fees. Because these derivatives have mirror-image contractual terms, in addition to collateral provisions which mitigate the impact of non-performance risk, the changes in fair value are expected to substantially offset. The Chicago Mercantile Exchange rules legally characterize variation margin collateral payments made or received for centrally cleared interest rate swaps as settlements rather than collateral. As a result, centrally cleared interest rate swaps included in other assets and other liabilities are presented on a net basis in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. As of September 30, 2024, Trustmark had interest rate swaps with an aggregate notional amount of 1.721 billion related to this program, compared to 1.500 billion as of December 31, 2023. 
 Credit-Risk-Related Contingent Features 
 Trustmark has agreements with its financial institution counterparties that contain provisions where if Trustmark defaults on any of its indebtedness, including default where repayment of the indebtedness has not been accelerated by the lender, then Trustmark could also be deemed to be in default on its derivatives obligations. 
 At September 30, 2024, the termination value of interest rate swaps in a liability position, which includes accrued interest but excludes any adjustment for nonperformance risk, related to these agreements totaled 2.0 million compared to 1.4 million at December 31, 2023. At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, Trustmark had posted collateral of 2.9 million and 2.0 million, respectively, against its obligations because of negotiated thresholds and minimum transfer amounts under these agreements. If Trustmark had breached any of these triggering provisions at September 30, 2024, it could have been required to settle its obligations under the agreements at the termination value (which is expected to approximate fair market value). 
 Credit risk participation agreements arise when Trustmark contracts with other financial institutions, as a guarantor or beneficiary, to share credit risk associated with certain interest rate swaps. These agreements provide for reimbursement of losses resulting from a third-party default on the underlying swap. At September 30, 2024, Trustmark had entered into nine risk participation agreements as a beneficiary with an aggregate notional amount of 60.3 million compared to six risk participation agreements as a beneficiary with an aggregate notional amount of 40.1 million at December 31, 2023. At September 30, 2024, Trustmark had entered into thirty-six risk participation agreements as a guarantor with an aggregate notional amount of 286.2 million compared to thirty-five risk participation agreements as a guarantor with an aggregate notional amount of 304.7 million at December 31, 2023. The aggregate fair values of these risk participation agreements were immaterial at both September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. 
 94 

Trustmark s participation in the derivatives markets is subject to increased federal regulation of these markets. Trustmark believes that it may continue to use financial derivatives to manage interest rate risk and also to offer derivatives products to certain qualified commercial lending clients in compliance with the Volcker Rule. However, the increased federal regulation of the derivatives markets has increased the cost to Trustmark of administering its derivatives programs. Some of these costs (particularly compliance costs related to the Volcker Rule and other federal regulations) are expected to recur in the future. 
 Market/Interest Rate Risk Management 
 The primary purpose in managing interest rate risk is to invest capital effectively and preserve the value created by the core banking business. This is accomplished through the development and implementation of lending, funding, pricing and hedging strategies designed to maximize net interest income performance under varying interest rate environments subject to specific liquidity and interest rate risk guidelines. 
 Financial simulation models are the primary tools used by Management s Asset/Liability Committee to measure interest rate exposure. The significant increase in short-term market interest rates and the overall interest rate environment is likely to affect the balance sheet composition and rates. The simulation incorporates assumptions regarding the effects of such changes based on a combination of historical analysis and expected behavior. Using a wide range of scenarios, Management is provided with extensive information on the potential impact on net interest income caused by changes in interest rates. Models are structured to simulate cash flows and accrual characteristics of Trustmark s balance sheet. Assumptions are made about the direction and volatility of interest rates, the slope of the yield curve and the changing composition of Trustmark s balance sheet, resulting from both strategic plans and customer behavior. In addition, the model incorporates Management s assumptions and expectations regarding such factors as loan and deposit growth, pricing, prepayment speeds and spreads between interest rates. 
 Based on the results of the simulation models using static balances, the table below summarizes the effect various one-year interest rate shift scenarios would have on net interest income compared to a base case, flat scenario at September 30, 2024 and 2023.

Management cannot provide any assurance about the actual effect of changes in interest rates on net interest income. The estimates provided do not include the effects of possible strategic changes in the balances of various assets and liabilities throughout 2024 or additional actions Trustmark could undertake in response to changes in interest rates. Management will continue to prudently manage the balance sheet in an effort to control interest rate risk and maintain profitability over the long term. 
 Another component of interest rate risk management is measuring the economic value-at-risk for a given change in market interest rates. The economic value-at-risk may indicate risks associated with longer-term balance sheet items that may not affect net interest income at risk over shorter time periods. Trustmark uses computer-modeling techniques to determine the present value of all asset and liability cash flows (both on- and off-balance sheet), adjusted for prepayment expectations, using a market discount rate. The economic value of equity (EVE), also known as net portfolio value, is defined as the difference between the present value of asset cash flows and the present value of liability cash flows. The resulting change in EVE in different market rate environments, from the base case scenario, is the amount of EVE at risk from those rate environments. 
 The following table summarizes the effect that various interest rate shifts would have on net portfolio value at September 30, 2024 and 2023.

Trustmark determines the fair value of the MSR using a valuation model administered by a third party that calculates the present value of estimated future net servicing income. The model incorporates assumptions that market participants use in estimating future net servicing income, including estimates of prepayment speeds, discount rate, default rates, cost to service (including delinquency and 
 95 

foreclosure costs), escrow account earnings, contractual servicing fee income and other ancillary income such as late fees. Management reviews all significant assumptions quarterly. Mortgage loan prepayment speeds, a key assumption in the model, is the annual rate at which borrowers are forecasted to repay their mortgage loan principal. The discount rate used to determine the present value of estimated future net servicing income, another key assumption in the model, is an estimate of the required rate of return investors in the market would require for an asset with similar risk. Both assumptions can, and generally will, change as market conditions and interest rates change. 
 By way of example, an increase in either the prepayment speed or discount rate assumption will result in a decrease in the fair value of the MSR, while a decrease in either assumption will result in an increase in the fair value of the MSR. In recent years, there have been significant market-driven fluctuations in loan prepayment speeds and discount rates. These fluctuations can be rapid and may continue to be significant. Therefore, estimating prepayment speed and/or discount rates within ranges that market participants would use in determining the fair value of the MSR requires significant management judgment. 
 At September 30, 2024, the MSR fair value was 125.9 million, compared to 142.4 million at September 30, 2023. The impact on the MSR fair value of a 10 adverse change in prepayment speed or a 100 basis point increase in discount rate at September 30, 2024, would be a decline in fair value of approximately 4.7 million and 4.9 million, respectively, compared to a decline in fair value of approximately 5.0 million and 6.0 million, respectively, at September 30, 2023. Changes of equal magnitude in the opposite direction would produce similar increases in fair value in the respective amounts.

 Information required in this section is set forth under the heading Legal Proceedings of Note 13 Contingencies in Part I. Item 1 Financial Statements of this report. 
 96 

In accordance with FASB Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) Topic 450-20, Loss Contingencies, Trustmark will establish an accrued liability for litigation matters when those matters present loss contingencies that are both probable and reasonably estimable. At the present time, Trustmark believes, based on its evaluation and the advice of legal counsel, that a loss in any such proceeding is not probable and reasonably estimable. All matters will continue to be monitored for further developments that would make such loss contingency both probable and reasonably estimable. In view of the inherent difficulty of predicting the outcome of legal proceedings, Trustmark cannot predict the eventual outcomes of the currently pending matters or the timing of their ultimate resolution. Trustmark currently believes, however, based upon the advice of legal counsel and Management s evaluation and after taking into account its current insurance coverage, that the legal proceedings currently pending should not have a material adverse effect on Trustmark s consolidated financial condition. 
 ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS 
 There has been no material change in the risk factors previously disclosed in Trustmark s 2023 Annual Report.
