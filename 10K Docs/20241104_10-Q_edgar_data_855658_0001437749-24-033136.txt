Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements 
 
 This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q contains forward-looking statements that involve estimates, assumptions, risks, and uncertainties. Any statements about our expectations, beliefs, plans, objectives, assumptions, or future events or performance are not historical facts and may be forward-looking. We use words or phrases such as anticipate, believe, could, estimate, expect, intend, plan, "possible," predict, projects, may, will, should, continue, ongoing, future, potential, and similar words or phrases to identify forward-looking statements. 
 
 Forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, statements about: our target or expected financial performance and our ability to achieve those results; our expectations related to attracting and retaining key personnel; future impacts of the ongoing military conflicts between Ukraine and Russia, and in the Middle East, and the outbreak of new, or expansion of current, military conflicts or terrorism; the impact of any continuing trade or travel restrictions on the export and import of products between the U.S. and China; the impact of any deterioration in relations between Taiwan and China, and other factors affecting military, political, or economic conditions in Taiwan or elsewhere in Asia; the impact of tariffs, trade sanctions, license requirements or similar actions on our suppliers and customers; the impact of inflationary pressures; future impacts of global pandemics, epidemics, and other public health problems; our business strategy; our opportunities to increase our addressable market; our expectations and strategies regarding market trends and opportunities, including market drivers such as wireless and wireline communications infrastructure deployments, data center servers and networking equipment, client computing platforms, industrial Internet of Things, factory automation, robotics, automotive electronics, smart homes, prosumers, and other applications; our expectations regarding the growth of AI-related revenue; our expectations regarding our customer base and the impacts of our customers actions on our business; our expectations regarding both new and existing product offerings; our gross margin growth and our strategies to achieve gross margin growth and other financial results; our future investments in research and development; future financial results or accounting treatments; our judgments involved in accounting matters, including revenue recognition, inventories and cost of revenue, and income taxes; actions we may take regarding the design and continued effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting; our use of cash; our beliefs regarding the adequacy of our liquidity, capital resources and facilities; whether we will consider and act upon acquisition opportunities to extend our product, technology and product offerings, and the impact of such opportunities on our business; our expectations regarding taxes, including unrecognized tax benefits, and tax adjustments and allowances; whether we will pursue future stock repurchases and how any future repurchases will be funded; the future price volatility of our stock and the effects of that volatility; our ability to prevent and respond to information technology system failures, security breaches and incidents, cyber-attacks or fraud, and the occurrence and impact of such cybersecurity incidents; the costs of mitigating cybersecurity risks; the impact of artificial intelligence ("AI"); the impact of laws and regulations addressing privacy, data protection, and cybersecurity and our ability to comply with the same; our ability to comply with other laws and regulations, the costs of such compliance, and costs incurred if we fail to comply with such laws and regulations; and our beliefs regarding legal or administrative proceedings. 
 
 These forward-looking statements are based on estimates and assumptions that are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those statements expressed in the forward-looking statements. The key factors, among others, that could cause our actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements include global economic conditions and uncertainty, including as a result of trade-related restrictions or tariffs, inflationary pressures, or the effect of any downturn in the economy on capital markets and credit markets; the effects of global military conflicts, pandemics or widespread global health problems and the actions by governments, businesses, and individuals in response to the situation, the effects of which may give rise to or amplify the risks associated with many of these factors listed here; our ability to attract and retain key personnel; and other factors more fully described herein or that are otherwise described from time to time in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC"), including, but not limited to, the items discussed in Part I, Item 1A, Risk Factors, in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 30, 2023 filed with the SEC on February 16, 2024 and any additional or updated risk factors discussed in any subsequent Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q filed since that date. 
 
 You should not unduly rely on forward-looking statements because our actual results could differ materially from those e xpressed by us. In addition, any forward-looking statem ent applies only as of the date of this filing. We do not plan to, and undertake no obligation to, update any forward-looking statements to reflect new information or new events, circumstances or developments, or otherwise.

Market-Based and Performance-Based Stock Compensation 
 
 In the first and third quarters of fiscal 2024, we granted awards of RSUs with a market condition to certain executives. Under the terms of these grants, the RSUs with a market condition vest after a three -year period based on the Company s total shareholder return ("TSR") relative to the Russell 3000 index, which condition is measured for the grants on either the third anniversary of the grant date, or equally on the first, second, and third anniversary of the grant date, depending on the executive. The awards may vest at or , depending on the executive, if the 75th percentile of the market condition is achieved, with of the units vesting at the 55th percentile, zero vesting if relative TSR is below the 25th percentile, and vesting scaling for achievement between the 25th and 75th percentile. 

In the second and third quarters of fiscal 2024, we also granted awards of RSUs with a performance condition to certain executives. Under the terms of these grants, the RSUs with a performance condition will vest if the Company achieves year-over-year revenue growth in excess of an industry benchmark, and the number of shares vested will scale for achievement of year-over-year revenue growth compared to certain targets, with maximum vesting up to . The performance condition will be measured annually after each fiscal year-end for one - fourth of the grants beginning in fiscal 2025 through the end of fiscal 2028. Vesting of these awards occurs months after the end of each measurement period and the entire award cannot be fully earned until five and a half years from grant date. 
 
 In the third quarter of fiscal 2024, we also granted awards of RSUs with a market condition to our new chief executive officer with vesting tied to the Company's stock price appreciation. The number of shares that become eligible to vest can range from to of the target number of shares, based on the Company's stock price growth over the -year service period, which ranges from to stock price growth calculated based on the simple average of the closing Company share price for the trailing 60 trading days up to and including the measurement date. No vesting occurs for stock price growth below . Vesting will occur annually after years for a portion of the vesting eligible RSUs. 
 
 In the first nine months of fiscal 2024, certain awards with a market condition or performance condition granted in prior fiscal years vested. During the first quarter of fiscal 2024 , the market condition for awards granted to certain executives in the first quarter of fiscal 2021 exceeded the 75th percentile of their TSR condition, and these awards vested at or , as applicable for the respective executive. Also during the first quarter of fiscal 2024, the second tranche of awards granted in fiscal 2021 and 2022 with a performance condition vested. Under the terms of these grants, the RSUs with a performance condition will vest based on the Company generating specified levels of year-over-year revenue growth, which are measured annually for one - fourth of the grants after each fiscal year-end through the end of fiscal 2024, with vesting of each tranche occurring 13 months after the performance condition is met. Vesting of these awards scales for achievement of year-over-year revenue growth compared to certain targets, with maximum vesting up to . The second tranche of these awards vested at the level of achievement, as the Company met the maximum year-over-year revenue growth performance criteria as of December 31, 2022. For the third tranche of these awards, the Company met the year-over-year revenue growth performance criteria at the level of achievement as of December 30, 2023. 
 
 For our awards with a market condition or performance condition, we incurred stock compensation expense of approximately million, partially offset by benefits from forfeitures of approximately million due to executive departures, in the third quarter of fiscal 2024. In the first nine months of fiscal 2024, we recorded benefits from forfeitures of approximately million due to executive departures, which was partially offset by stock compensation expense of approximately million. We incurred stock compensation expense of approximately million and million in the third quarter and first nine months of fiscal 2023, respectively. These amounts are recorded as components of total stock-based compensation.

 During the third quarter of fiscal 2024, we repurchased shares for million, or an average price paid per share of , under the 2024 Repurchase Program. During the first nine months of fiscal 2024, we have repurchased a total of shares for million, or an average price paid per share of . All repurchases were open market transactions funded from available working capital. All shares repurchased pursuant to the 2024 Repurchase Program were retired by the end of the third quarter of fiscal 2024. As of September 28, 2024 , the remaining portion of the amount authorized for the 2024 Repurchase Program is approximately million. 

million and million, respectively. For the first nine months of fiscal 2024 and 2023, we recorded income tax expense of approximately million and million, respectively. Income taxes for the three and nine -month periods ended September 28, 2024 and September 30, 2023 represent tax at the federal, state, and foreign statutory tax rates in addition to federal tax credits, withholding taxes, excess benefits from stock compensation, as well as other non-deductible items in federal, state, and foreign jurisdictions. The difference between the U.S. federal statutory tax rate of and our effective tax rates for the three and nine months ended September 28, 2024 resulted primarily from non-deductible items in federal, state, and foreign jurisdictions, foreign rate differentials, federal tax credits, and the discrete impacts of excess tax benefits from stock compensation and for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 resulted primarily from U.S. valuation allowance, foreign withholding taxes, foreign rate differentials, and the discrete impacts of excess tax benefits from stock compensation. 
 
 The portion of our uncertain tax positions (including penalties and interest) recorded as a liability wa s million and million a t September 28, 2024 and December 30, 2023 , respectively, and is included as a component of Other long-term liabilities on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. The resolution of audits or expiration of statute of limitations could reduce our uncertain tax positions. The estimated potential reduction in our uncertain tax positions in the next 12 months is up to million. 

million, punitive damages, and other remedies. On January 18, 2024, the court dismissed the claims against the Company by Ms. De Jaray and Mr. Oswald. The trial for the remaining claims was held from January 30, 2024 to February 15, 2024. On February 13, 2024, the Court granted the Company s Rule 50 motion in part and entered judgment in the Company s favor as to all of Mr. De Jaray s claims and Apex-Micro s negligence claims. On February 15, 2024, the jury found that the Company was not liable for all outstanding claims and judgment was entered in favor of the Company. On March 15, 2024, Mr. De Jaray and Apex-Micro filed a Notice of Appeal to the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. On March 18, 2024, Ms. De Jaray filed a separate Notice of Appeal. Ms. De Jaray s appeal was dismissed for failure to prosecute on August 1, 2024. In response to Mr. De Jaray and Apex Micro's request for an extension, their appeal opening brief was due October 7, 2024. Mr. De Jaray and Apex Micro failed to file their appeal opening brief on October 7 th . Mr. De Jaray's and Apex Micro's appeal was dismissed for failure to prosecute on October 30, 2024. 
 
 From time to time, we are exposed to certain additional asserted and unasserted potential claims. We review the status of each significant matter and assess its potential financial exposure. If the potential loss from any claim or legal proceeding is considered probable and a range of possible losses can be estimated, we then accrue a liability for the estimated loss. Legal proceedings are subject to uncertainties, and the outcomes are difficult to predict. Because of such uncertainties, accruals are based only on the best information available at the time. As additional information becomes available, we reassess the potential liability related to pending claims and litigation and may revise estimates. 

ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 
 
 The following discussion should be read along with the unaudited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, as well as the audited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto and Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in our 2023 10-K. 

Overview 
 
 Lattice Semiconductor Corporation and its subsidiaries Lattice, the Company, we, us, or our develop technologies that we monetize through differentiated programmable logic semiconductor products, silicon-enabling products, system solutions, design services, and technology licenses. Lattice is the low power programmable leader. We solve customer problems across the network, from the Edge to the Cloud, in the Communications, Computing, Industrial, Automotive, and Consumer markets. Our technology, long-standing relationships, and commitment to world-class support helps our customers quickly and easily unleash their innovation to create a smart, secure, and connected world. 
 
 Lattice has focused its strategy on delivering programmable logic products and related solutions based on low power, small size, and ease of use. We also serve our customers with intellectual property ("IP") licensing and various other services. Our product development activities include new proprietary products, advanced packaging, existing product enhancements, software development tools, soft IP, and system solutions for high-growth applications such as Edge Artificial Intelligence, wireless and wireline infrastructure, platform security, and factory automation. 

Critical Accounting Policies and Use of Estimates 
 
 Critical accounting policies are those that are both most important to the portrayal of a company's financial condition and results of operations, and that require management's most difficult, subjective, and complex judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. There have been no material changes to the items that we disclosed as our critical accounting policies and estimates in Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in our 2023 10-K. 
 
 The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and judgments affecting the amounts reported in our consolidated condensed financial statements and the accompanying notes. We base our estimates and judgments on historical experience, knowledge of current conditions, and our beliefs of what could occur in the future considering available information. While we believe that our estimates, assumptions, and judgments are reasonable, they are based on information available when made, and because of the uncertainty inherent in these matters, actual results may differ materially from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. We evaluate our estimates and judgments on an ongoing basis. 

Impact of Global Economic Activity on our Business 
 
 Increased financial market volatility, inflationary pressure, interest rate changes, recessionary concerns, uncertainty in the financial and banking industry, and geopolitical tension continue to impact business globally and may impact our operations by causing disruption to our labor markets and supply chains. The extent to which increased financial market volatility, inflationary pressures, global pandemics, and related uncertainty will impact our business activities will depend on future developments that are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted at this time. Additionally, our business is impacted by the cyclic correction affecting the broader semiconductor industry, which has seen softened demand across our end markets.

Revenue by End Market 
 
 We sell our products globally to a broad base of customers in three primary end market groups: Communications and Computing, Industrial and Automotive, and Consumer. Across our end markets, our products are increasingly used for Artificial Intelligence ("AI")-related applications, including device usage in AI-optimized servers in data centers, AI-enabled PCs, and AI-enabled robotics and ADAS systems, among others. We also provide IP licensing and services to these end markets. 
 
 Within these end markets, there are multiple drivers, including: 

Communications and computing: data center servers and networking equipment, client computing platforms, and wireless and wireline communications infrastructure deployments, 

Industrial and automotive: factory automation, robotics, automotive electronics, and industrial Internet of Things ("IoT"), 

Consumer: smart home, prosumer, and other applications. 

The end market data we use is derived from data provided to us b y our distributors and end customers. Wi th a diverse base of customers who may manufacture end products spanning multiple end markets, the assignment of revenue to a specific end market requires the use of judgment. We also recognize certain revenue fo r which end customers an d end markets are not yet known. We assign this revenue first to a specific end market using historical and anticipated usage of the specific products, if possible, and allocate the remainder to the end markets based on either historical usage for each product family or industry application data for certain product types. 
 
 The following are examples of end market applications for the periods presented: 

Communications and Computing 
 Industrial and Automotive 
 Consumer 

Wireless 
 Security and Surveillance

Revenue from the Communications and Computing end market decreased by 11 for the third quarter of fiscal 2024 compared to the third quarter of fiscal 2023 and decreased by 14 for the first nine months of fiscal 2024 compared to the first nine months of fiscal 2023 primarily due to weaker demand in telecommunications infrastructure deployments and end customers rebalancing their inventory levels, partially offset by stronger demand in data center applications. 
 
 Revenue from the Industrial and Automotive end market decreased by 51 for the third quarter of fiscal 2024 compared to the third quarter of fiscal 2023 and decreased by 44 for the first nine months of fiscal 2024 compared to the first nine months of fiscal 2023 primarily due to softer end market demand and end customers rebalancing their inventory levels. 
 
 While we do not consider AI applications as a distinct end market, we expect AI-related revenue to grow over the next few years based on the growing pipeline of AI-related design wins. Our AI revenue is derived from applications across all three of our end market segments. 

Revenue by Geography 
 
 We have a diverse base of customers where distributors represent a significant portion of our total revenue. Our revenue by geographical market is based on the ship-to location of our customers, which can vary from time to time. Revenue from Asia decreased in the periods presented primarily due to the macroeconomic environment in the region, while revenue from the Americas and Europe decreased due to reduced demand in these regions for our products in the Industrial and Automotive end market.

Research and development expense includes headcount-related costs, including cash- and stock-based compensation and benefits, R D equipment, engineering wafers, licenses, and outside engineering services. These expenditures are for the design of new products, IP cores, processes, packaging, and software solutions. The decrease in Research and development expense for the third quarter of fiscal 2024 compared to the third quarter of fiscal 2023 was due primarily to lower costs for R D equipment and outside services, partially offset by increased headcount-related costs. The increase in Research and development expense for the first nine months of f iscal 2024 compared to the first nine months of fiscal 2023 was due primarily to increased headcount-related costs, partially offset by lower costs for R D equipment and outside services. We believe that investing in research and development is important to delivering innovative products to our customers.

The decrease in Selling, general, and administrative expense for the third quarter of fiscal 2024 compared to the third quarter of fiscal 2023 was primarily due to lower headcount-related costs and legal expenses. The decrease in Selling, general, and administrative expense for the first nine months of fiscal 2024 compared to the first nine months of fiscal 2023 was primarily due to a reduction in stock compensation expense from the forfeiture of equity awards by departing executives and lower headcount-related costs, partially offset by other costs such as legal expenses.

Our Income tax expense is partially offset by federal tax credits and excess tax benefits from stock-based compensation. The lower income tax expense for the current year periods was primarily due to decreased worldwide income, partially offset by the valuation allowance over the federal deferred tax assets present during 2023. 

Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 
 The following sections discuss material changes in our financial condition from the end of fiscal 2023, including the effects of changes in our Consolidated Balance Sheets, and the effects of our credit arrangements and contractual obligations on our liquidity and capital resources. There continues to be uncertainty around the extent of market volatility, inflationary pressures, interest rate changes, recessionary concerns, uncertainty in the financial and banking industry, and geopolitical tension, which may impact our liquidity and working capital needs in future periods. 
 
 We have historically financed our operating and capital resource requirements through cash flows from operations, and from the issuance of long-term debt to fund acquisitions. Cash provided by or used in operating activities will fluctuate from period to period due to fluctuations in operating results, the timing and collection of accounts receivable, and required inventory levels, among other things. 
 
 We believe that our financial resources, including current cash and cash equivalents, cash flow from operating activities, and our credit facilities, will be sufficient to meet our liquidity and working capital needs through at least the next 12 months. On September 1, 2022, we entered into our 2022 Credit Agreement, as described in "Note 5 - Long-Term Debt" under Part I, Item 1 of this report. As of September 28, 2024, we did not have significant long-term commitments for capital expenditures. For further information on our cash commitments for operating lease liabilities, see "Note 7 - Leases" under Part I, Item 1 of this report. 
 
 In the future, we may continue to consider acquisition opportunities to further extend our product or technology portfolios and further expand our product offerings. In connection with funding capital expenditures, acquisitions, securing additional wafer supply, increasing our working capital, or other operations, we may seek to obtain equity or additional debt financing. We may also seek to obtain equity or additional debt financing if we experience downturns or cyclical fluctuations in our business that are more severe or longer than we anticipated when determining our current working capital needs.

As of September 28, 2024, we had Cash and cash equivalents of 124.3 million, of which approximately 48.4 million was held by our foreign subsidiaries. We manage our global cash requirements considering, among other things, (i) available funds among our subsidiaries through which we conduct business, (ii) the geographic location of our liquidity needs, and (iii) the cost to access international cash balances. The repatriation of non-US earnings may require us to withhold and pay foreign income tax on dividends. This should not result in our recording significant additional tax expense as we have accrued expense based on current withholding rates. As of September 28, 2024, we could access all cash held by our foreign subsidiaries without incurring significant additional expense. 
 
 The net decrease in Cash and cash equivalents of 4.0 million between December 30, 2023 and September 28, 2024 was primarily driven by cash flows from the following activities:

Table of Contents 

Operating activities Cash provided by operating activities results from net income adjusted for certain non-cash items and changes in assets and liabilities. Cash provided by operating activities for the first nine months of fiscal 2024 was 95.5 million compared to 197.6 million for the first nine months of fiscal 2023. This decrease of 102.1 million was primarily driven by 124.1 million less cash provided by net income adjusted for non-cash items, partially offset by 22.0 million of net changes in working capital, primarily in Accounts receivable and Accrued liabilities. 
 
 Investing activities Investing cash flows consist primarily of transactions related to capital expenditures and payments for software and intellectual property licenses. Net cash used by investing activities in the first nine months of fiscal 2024 was 27.7 million compared to 25.3 million in the first nine months of fiscal 2023. 
 
 Financing activities Financing cash flows consist primarily of activity on our long-term debt, repurchases of common stock, tax payments related to the net share settlement of restricted stock units, and proceeds from the exercise of options to acquire common stock. Net cash used by financing activities in the first nine months of fiscal 2024 was 71.6 million compared to 203.1 million in the first nine months of fiscal 2023. This 131.5 million decrease was due to the following activities. During the first nine months of fiscal 2024, we had no balance outstanding on our long-term debt, while during the first nine months of fiscal 2023 we made discretionary payments totaling 130.0 million on revolving loans under the 2022 Credit Agreement. During the first nine months of fiscal 2024, we repurchased approximately 0.8 million shares of common stock for 47.0 million compared to repurchases in the first nine months of fiscal 2023 of approximately 0.4 million shares of common stock for 30.0 million. Payments for tax withholdings on vesting of RSUs partially offset by employee exercises of stock options used net cash flows of 24.6 million in the first nine months of fiscal 2024, a decrease of approximately 18.5 million from the net 43.1 million used in the first nine months of fiscal 2023.

Accounts receivable, net as of September 28, 2024 decreased by approximately 12.9 million, or 12 , compared to December 30, 2023. This decrease was due to lower revenue shipments as well as the timing of when our customers want our products. We calculate Days sales outstanding on the basis of a 365-day year as Accounts receivable, net at the end of the quarter divided by sales during the quarter annualized and then multiplied by 365.

Inventories as of September 28, 2024 increased 5.7 million, or approximately 6 , compared to December 30, 2023 primarily as a result of product buildup ahead of new product ramps and end customers rebalancing their inventory levels. Days of inventory on hand increased over the period due to lower revenue. 
 
 The Days of inventory on hand ratio compares the inventory balance at the end of a quarter to the cost of sales in that quarter. We calculate Days of inventory on hand on the basis of a 365-day year as Inventories at the end of the quarter divided by Cost of sales during the quarter annualized and then multiplied by 365. 
 
 Credit Arrangements 
 
 On September 1, 2022, we entered into our 2022 Credit Agreement. The details of this arrangement are described in "Note 5 - Long-Term Debt" in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q . 
 
 As of September 28, 2024 , we had no used or unused credit arrangements beyond the secured revolving loan facility described in the 2022 Credit Agreement.

ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 
 
 Market risk represents the risk of loss that may impact our financial position due to adverse changes in financial market prices and rates. Our market risk exposure is primarily a result of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates. We assess these risks on a regular basis and have established policies that are designed to protect against the adverse effects of these and other potential exposures. There have been no material changes to either the foreign currency exchange rate risk or interest rate risk previously disclosed in Part II, Item 7A, "Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk," of our 2023 10-K. 

ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 
 
 Conclusion Regarding the Effectiveness of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 
 In connection with the filing of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act )) as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based on this evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that our disclosure controls were effective as of the end of the period covered by this report. 

Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 
 There were no changes in our internal controls over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act) that occurred during the third quarter of fiscal 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 

Inherent Limitations on Effectiveness of Controls 
 
 We do not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures or our internal control over financial reporting will prevent all errors and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, have been detected. These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty, and that breakdowns can occur because of a simple error or mistake. Additionally, controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people or by management override of the controls. The design of any system of controls also is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions; over time, controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or the degree of compliance with policies or procedures may deteriorate. Because of the inherent limitations in a cost-effective control system, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected.

 The information set forth above under " Note 12 - Contingencies - Legal Proceedings " contained in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements is incorporated herein by reference. 

ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS 
 
 In addition to the other information set forth in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, you should carefully consider the risk factors associated with our business previously described in Part I, Item 1A, Risk Factors, in our 2023 10-K. There have been no material changes in the risk factors included in our 2023 10-K, and this report should be read in conjunction with the risk factors set forth in our 2023 10-K. These risk factors are not the only risks facing our company. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we may currently deem to be immaterial could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, or operating results, including those related to adverse macroeconomic conditions, such as rising inflation and labor shortages, which may affect demand for our products or increase our product or labor costs, negatively impacting our revenues, gross margins, and overall financial results. If any of these risks occur, our business, financial condition, operating results, and cash flows could be materially adversely affected, and the trading price of our common stock could decline. These factors, together with all of the other information in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, including our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, should be carefully considered before making an investment decision relating to our common stock.

Vesting in each case is subject to Participant continuing to be a Service Provider through the applicable vesting date, as further described in Section 10(j) of the Terms and Conditions of Restricted Stock Grant. 

In the event Participant ceases to be a Service Provider for any or no reason before Participant vests in the Shares of Restricted Stock, the unvested Restricted Stock will be forfeited and automatically transferred to and reacquired by the Company at no cost to the Company upon the date of such termination and Participant will have no further rights thereunder.

Exhibit A 

TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF RESTRICTED STOCK GRANT 

1) Grant . The Company hereby grants to the individual named in the Notice of Restricted Stock Grant (the Notice of Grant attached as Part I of this Award Agreement (the Participant under the Plan an Award of Shares of Restricted Stock, subject to all of the terms and conditions in this Award Agreement and the Plan, which is incorporated herein by reference. Subject to Section 18(c) of the Plan, in the event of a conflict between the terms and conditions of the Plan and the terms and conditions of this Award Agreement, the terms and conditions of the Plan will prevail. 

2) Escrow of Shares . All Shares of Restricted Stock will, upon execution of this Award Agreement, be delivered and deposited with an escrow holder designated by the Company (the Escrow Holder ). The Shares of Restricted Stock will be held by the Escrow Holder until such time as the Shares of Restricted Stock vest or the date Participant ceases to be a Service Provider. 

(a) The Escrow Holder will not be liable for any act it may do or omit to do with respect to holding the Shares of Restricted Stock in escrow while acting in good faith and in the exercise of its judgment. 

(b) Upon Participant s termination as a Service Provider for any reason, the Escrow Holder, upon receipt of written notice of such termination, will take all steps necessary to accomplish the transfer of the unvested Shares of Restricted Stock to the Company. Participant hereby appoints the Escrow Holder with full power of substitution, as Participant s true and lawful attorney-in fact with irrevocable power and authority in the name and on behalf of Participant to take any action and execute all documents and instruments, including, without limitation, stock powers which may be necessary to transfer the certificate or certificates evidencing such unvested Shares of Restricted Stock to the Company upon such termination. 

(c) The Escrow Holder will take all steps necessary to accomplish the transfer of Shares of Restricted Stock to Participant after they vest following Participant s request that the Escrow Holder do so. 

(d) Subject to the terms hereof, Participant will have all the rights of a stockholder with respect to the Shares while they are held in escrow, including without limitation, the right to vote the Shares, except that no dividends or other distributions will be paid with respect to any Shares underlying any unvested portion of the Award of Restricted Stock. 

(e) In the event of any extraordinary dividend or other extraordinary distribution (whether in the form of cash, Shares, other securities, or other property), recapitalization, stock split, reverse stock split, reorganization, merger, consolidation, split-up, spin-off, combination, reclassification, repurchase, or exchange of Shares or other securities of the Company, or other change in the corporate structure of the Company affecting the Shares (other than any ordinary dividends or other ordinary distributions), the Shares of Restricted Stock will be increased, reduced or otherwise changed, and by virtue of any such change Participant will in his or her capacity as owner of unvested Shares of Restricted Stock be entitled to new or additional or different shares of stock, cash or securities (other than rights or warrants to purchase securities); such new or additional or different shares, cash or securities will thereupon be considered to be unvested Shares of Restricted Stock and will be subject to all of the conditions and restrictions which were applicable to the unvested Shares of Restricted Stock pursuant to this Award Agreement. If Participant receives rights or warrants with respect to any unvested Shares of Restricted Stock, such rights or warrants may be held or exercised by Participant, provided that until such exercise any such rights or warrants and after such exercise any shares or other securities acquired by the exercise of such rights or warrants will be considered to be unvested Shares of Restricted Stock and will be subject to all of the conditions and restrictions which were applicable to the unvested Shares of Restricted Stock pursuant to this Award Agreement. The Administrator in its absolute discretion at any time may accelerate the vesting of all or any portion of such new or additional shares of stock, cash or securities, rights or warrants to purchase securities or shares or other securities acquired by the exercise of such rights or warrants. 

(f) The Company may instruct the transfer agent for its Common Stock to place a legend on the certificates representing the Restricted Stock or otherwise note its records as to the restrictions on transfer set forth in this Award Agreement. 

3) Vesting Schedule . Except as provided in Section 4, and subject to Section 5, the Shares of Restricted Stock awarded by this Award Agreement will vest in accordance with the vesting provisions set forth in the Notice of Grant. Shares of Restricted Stock scheduled to vest on a certain date or upon the occurrence of a certain condition will not vest in Participant in accordance with any of the provisions of this Award Agreement, unless Participant will have been continuously a Service Provider from the Grant Date until the date such vesting occurs, as further described in Section 10(j). For the avoidance of doubt, if Participant ceases to be a Service Provider prior to any scheduled vesting date, Participant will not earn or be entitled to any pro-rated vesting for any portion of time before the respective vesting date during which Participant was a Service Provider, nor will Participant be entitled to any compensation for lost vesting. 

4) Administrator Discretion . The Administrator, in its discretion, may accelerate the vesting of the balance, or some lesser portion of the balance, of the unvested Shares of Restricted Stock at any time, subject to the terms of the Plan. If so accelerated, such Restricted Stock will be considered as having vested as of the date specified by the Administrator. 

5) Forfeiture upon Termination of Status as a Service Provider . Notwithstanding any contrary provision of this Award Agreement, as of the time of Participant s termination as a Service Provider for any or no reason, the balance of the Shares of Restricted Stock that have not yet vested will be forfeited by the Participant and automatically transferred to and reacquired by the Company at no cost to the Company upon: (a) the 30th day following the Termination of Service Date (as defined below) if Participant s Termination of Service is due to the Participant s death (or any earlier date on or following the Termination of Service Date determined by the Administrator) or (b) the Termination of Service Date if Participant s Termination of Service is for any reason other than the Participant s death, in all cases, subject to applicable laws and Participant will have no further rights thereunder. Participant will not be entitled to a refund of the price paid for the Shares of Restricted Stock, if any, returned to the Company pursuant to this Section 5. Participant hereby appoints the Escrow Agent with full power of substitution, as Participant s true and lawful attorney-in-fact with irrevocable power and authority in the name and on behalf of Participant to take any action and execute all documents and instruments, including, without limitation, stock powers which may be necessary to transfer the certificate or certificates evidencing such unvested shares to the Company upon such termination of service. 

For purposes of the Shares of Restricted Stock, the Termination of Service Date means the date on which the Participant last actively provides continuous services for the Company (regardless of the reason such continuous service terminates and whether or not such termination is later found to be invalid or in breach of employment laws in the jurisdiction where the Participant is providing services or the terms of the Participant s employment or service agreement, if any), and unless otherwise expressly provided in this Agreement or determined by the Administrator, the Participant s right to vest in the Shares of Restricted Stock will terminate as of such date and will not be extended by any notice period (e.g., the Participant s period of service would not include any contractual notice period or any period of garden leave or similar period mandated under employment laws (including common law, if applicable) in the jurisdiction where Participant is providing services to Participant s Employer (defined below) or by Participant s employment or service agreement, if any). The Administrator shall have the exclusive discretion to determine when the Participant is no longer actively providing services for purposes of the Shares of Restricted Stock (including whether the Participant may still be considered to be providing services while on a leave of absence). 

6) Death of Participant . Any distribution or delivery to be made to Participant under this Award Agreement will, if Participant is then deceased, be made to the administrator or executor of Participant s estate. Any such transferee must furnish the Company with (a) written notice of his or her status as transferee, and (b) evidence satisfactory to the Company to establish the validity of the transfer and compliance with any laws or regulations pertaining to said transfer. 

7) Responsibility for Taxes . Notwithstanding any contrary provision of this Award Agreement, no Shares of Restricted Stock may be released from the escrow established pursuant to Section 2, unless and until satisfactory arrangements (as determined by the Administrator) will have been made by Participant with respect to the payment of Tax-Related Items which the Company determines must be withheld with respect to such Shares. Participant acknowledges that, regardless of any action taken by the Company or, if different, the Parent or Subsidiary employing or retaining Participant (the Employer ), the ultimate liability for all Tax-Related Items is and remains Participant s sole responsibility and may exceed the amount, if any, actually withheld by the Company or the Employer. Participant further acknowledges that the Company and/or the Employer (i) make no representations or undertakings regarding the treatment of any Tax-Related Items in connection with any aspect of the Restricted Stock, including, but not limited to, the grant, vesting or release from escrow of the Shares of Restricted Stock, the filing of an election under Section 83(b) of the Code (the 83(b) Election with respect to the Shares of Restricted Stock, the subsequent sale of Shares acquired pursuant to this Award Agreement and the receipt of any dividends; and (ii) do not commit to and are under no obligation to structure the terms of the grant or any aspect of the Restricted Stock to reduce or eliminate Participant s liability for Tax-Related Items or achieve any particular tax result. Further, if Participant is subject to Tax-Related Items in more than one jurisdiction, Participant acknowledges that the Company and/or the Employer (or former employer, as applicable) may be required to withhold or account for Tax-Related Items in more than one jurisdiction. 

The Administrator, in its sole discretion and pursuant to such procedures as it may specify from time to time, may permit or require Participant to satisfy such Tax-Related Items, in whole or in part (without limitation) by (a) paying cash, (b) electing to have the Company withhold otherwise deliverable Shares, (c) selling a sufficient number of such Shares otherwise deliverable to Participant through such means as the Company may determine in its sole discretion (whether through a broker or otherwise) and without further consent from Participant, (d) electing to have the Company or the Employer withhold from Participant s wages or other cash compensation payable to Participant, or (e) any other method of withholding determined by the Company and permitted by Applicable Laws and the Plan. To the extent determined appropriate by the Company in its discretion, it will have the right (but not the obligation) to satisfy any withholding obligations or rights with regard to Tax-Related Items by means of method (b) above and, until determined otherwise by the Company, this will be the method by which such withholding obligations or rights with regard to Tax-Related Items are satisfied; provided, however, that if Participant is a Section 16 officer of the Company under the Exchange Act, the Company will, in all cases, satisfy any Tax-Related Items by means of method (b) above, unless the use of such withholding method is problematic under applicable tax or securities law or has materially adverse accounting consequences, in which case the obligation for Tax-Related Items may be satisfied by one or a combination of the other methods above. 

The Company may withhold or account for Tax-Related Items by considering statutory or other withholding rates, including minimum or maximum rates applicable in Participant s jurisdiction(s). In the event of over-withholding, Participant may receive a refund of any over-withheld amount in cash (with no entitlement to the equivalent in Shares), or, if not refunded, Participant may be able to seek a refund from the local tax authorities. In the event of under-withholding, Participant may be required to pay additional Tax-Related Items directly to the applicable tax authority. If the obligation for Tax-Related Items is satisfied by withholding in Shares, for tax purposes, Participant will be deemed to have been issued the full number of Shares subject to the vested Restricted Stock, notwithstanding that a number of the Shares is held back solely for the purpose of paying the Tax-Related Items. 

If Participant fails to make satisfactory arrangements for the payment of any Tax-Related Items hereunder at the time any applicable Shares of Restricted Stock otherwise are scheduled to vest pursuant to Sections 3 or 4, at the time Participant files a timely 83(b) Election with the IRS, or the Tax-Related Items related to the Shares of Restricted Stock otherwise are due, Participant will permanently forfeit such Shares of Restricted Stock and any right to receive Shares thereunder and the Shares of Restricted Stock will be returned to the Company at no cost to the Company. 

Participant understands that Section 83 of the Code taxes as ordinary income the difference between the purchase price, if any, of the Shares and the Fair Market Value of the Shares as of each vesting date. If Participant is a U.S. taxpayer, Participant understands that Participant may elect, for purposes of U.S. tax law, to be taxed at the time the Shares are granted rather than when such Shares vest by filing an 83(b) Election with the IRS within thirty (30) days from the Grant Date of the Award of Shares of Restricted Stock. A sample form for making this 83(b) Election is attached as Exhibit A-1 hereto. 

8) Rights as Stockholder . Neither Participant nor any person claiming under or through Participant will have any of the rights or privileges of a stockholder of the Company in respect of any Shares deliverable hereunder unless and until certificates representing such Shares will have been issued, recorded on the records of the Company or its transfer agents or registrars, and delivered to Participant or the Escrow Agent. Except as provided in Section 2(f), after such issuance, recordation and delivery, Participant will have all the rights of a stockholder of the Company with respect to voting such Shares and receipt of dividends and distributions on such Shares.

Exhibit A 

TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF RESTRICTED STOCK UNIT GRANT 

1) Grant . The Company hereby grants to the individual named in the Notice of Restricted Stock Unit Grant (the Notice of Grant attached as Part I of this Award Agreement (the Participant under the Plan an Award of Restricted Stock Units, subject to all of the terms and conditions in this Award Agreement and the Plan, which is incorporated herein by reference. Subject to Section 18(c) of the Plan, in the event of a conflict between the terms and conditions of the Plan and the terms and conditions of this Award Agreement, the terms and conditions of the Plan will prevail. 

2) Company s Obligation to Pay . Each Restricted Stock Unit represents the right to receive a Share on the date it vests. Unless and until the Restricted Stock Units will have vested in the manner set forth in Section 3, Participant will have no right to the payment of any such Restricted Stock Units. Prior to the actual payment of any vested Restricted Stock Units, such Restricted Stock Units will represent an unsecured obligation of the Company, payable (if at all) only from the general assets of the Company. Any Restricted Stock Units that vest in accordance with Sections 3 or 4 will be paid to Participant (or in the event of Participant s death, to his or her estate) in whole Shares, subject to Participant satisfying any applicable withholding obligations for Tax-Related Items. Subject to the provisions of Section 4, such vested Restricted Stock Units shall be paid in whole Shares as soon as practicable after vesting, but in each such case within the period 60 days following the vesting date. In no event will Participant be permitted, directly or indirectly, to specify the taxable year of the payment of any Restricted Stock Units payable under this Award Agreement. 

3) Vesting Schedule . Except as provided in Section 4, and subject to Section 5, the Restricted Stock Units awarded by this Award Agreement will vest in accordance with the vesting provisions set forth in the Notice of Grant. Restricted Stock Units scheduled to vest on a certain date or upon the occurrence of a certain condition will not vest in Participant in accordance with any of the provisions of this Award Agreement, unless Participant will have been continuously a Service Provider from the Grant Date until the date such vesting occurs, as further described in Section 10(j). For the avoidance of doubt if Participant ceases to be a Service Provider prior to any scheduled vesting date, Participant will not earn or be entitled to any pro-rated vesting for any portion of time before the respective vesting date during which Participant was a Service Provider, nor will Participant be entitled to any compensation for lost vesting. 

4) Administrator Discretion . The Administrator, in its discretion, may accelerate the vesting of the balance, or some lesser portion of the balance, of the unvested Restricted Stock Units at any time, subject to the terms of the Plan. If so accelerated, such Restricted Stock Units will be considered as having vested as of the date specified by the Administrator. The payment of Shares in settlement of any Restricted Stock Units vesting pursuant to this Section 4 shall in all cases be paid at a time or in a manner that is exempt from, or complies with, Section 409A. 

Notwithstanding anything in the Plan or this Award Agreement to the contrary, if the vesting of the balance, or some lesser portion of the balance, of the Restricted Stock Units is accelerated in connection with Participant s termination as a Service Provider (provided that such termination is a separation from service within the meaning of Section 409A, as determined by the Company), other than due to death , and if (x) Participant is a specified employee within the meaning of Section 409A at the time of such termination as a Service Provider and (y) the payment of such accelerated Restricted Stock Units will result in the imposition of additional tax under Section 409A if paid to Participant on or within the six (6) month period following Participant s termination as a Service Provider, then the payment of such accelerated Restricted Stock Units will not be made until the date six (6) months and one (1) day following the date of Participant s termination as a Service Provider, unless Participant dies following his or her termination as a Service Provider, in which case, the Restricted Stock Units will be paid in Shares to Participant s estate as soon as practicable following his or her death. It is the intent of this Award Agreement that it and all payments and benefits hereunder be exempt from, or comply with, the requirements of Section 409A so that none of the Restricted Stock Units provided under this Award Agreement or Shares issuable thereunder will be subject to the additional tax imposed under Section 409A, and any ambiguities herein will be interpreted to be so exempt or so comply. Each payment payable under this Award Agreement is intended to constitute a separate payment for purposes of Treasury Regulation Section 1.409A-2(b)(2). For purposes of this Award Agreement, Section 409A means Section 409A of the Code, and any final Treasury Regulations and U.S. Internal Revenue Service guidance thereunder, as each may be amended from time to time. 

5) Forfeiture upon Termination of Status as a Service Provider . Notwithstanding any contrary provision of this Award Agreement, as of the time of Participant s termination as a Service Provider for any or no reason, the Restricted Stock Units that have not yet vested will be forfeited by the Participant upon: (a) the 30th day following the Termination of Service Date (as defined below) if Participant s Termination of Service is due to the Participant s death (or any earlier date on or following the Termination of Service Date determined by the Administrator) or (b) the Termination of Service Date if Participant s Termination of Service is for any reason other than the Participant s death, in all cases, subject to applicable laws. 

For purposes of the Restricted Stock Units, the Termination of Service Date means the date on which the Participant last actively provides continuous services for the Company (regardless of the reason such continuous service terminates and whether or not such termination is later found to be invalid or in breach of employment laws in the jurisdiction where the Participant is providing services or the terms of the Participant s employment or service agreement, if any), and unless otherwise expressly provided in this Agreement or determined by the Administrator, the Participant s right to vest in these Restricted Stock Units will terminate as of such date and will not be extended by any notice period (e.g., the Participant s period of service would not include any contractual notice period or any period of garden leave or similar period mandated under employment laws (including common law, if applicable) in the jurisdiction where Participant is providing services to Participant s Employer (defined below) or by Participant s employment or service agreement, if any). The Administrator shall have the exclusive discretion to determine when the Participant is no longer actively providing services for purposes of the Restricted Stock Units (including whether the Participant may still be considered to be providing services while on a leave of absence). 

6) Death of Participant . Any distribution or delivery to be made to Participant under this Award Agreement will, if Participant is then deceased, be made to the administrator or executor of Participant s estate. Any such transferee must furnish the Company with (a) written notice of his or her status as transferee, and (b) evidence satisfactory to the Company to establish the validity of the transfer and compliance with any laws or regulations pertaining to said transfer. 

7) Responsibility for Taxes . Notwithstanding any contrary provision of this Award Agreement, no Shares will be issued to Participant, unless and until satisfactory arrangements (as determined by the Administrator) will have been made by Participant with respect to the payment of Tax-Related Items. Participant acknowledges that, regardless of any action taken by the Company or, if different, the Parent or Subsidiary employing or retaining Participant (the Employer ), the ultimate liability for all Tax-Related Items is and remains Participant s sole responsibility and may exceed the amount, if any, actually withheld by the Company or the Employer. Participant further acknowledges that the Company and/or the Employer (i) make no representations or undertakings regarding the treatment of any Tax-Related Items in connection with any aspect of the Restricted Stock Units, including, but not limited to, the grant, vesting or settlement of the Restricted Stock Units, the subsequent sale of Shares acquired pursuant to such settlement and the receipt of any dividends or dividend equivalents; and (ii) do not commit to and are under no obligation to structure the terms of the grant or any aspect of the Restricted Stock Units to reduce or eliminate Participant s liability for Tax-Related Items or achieve any particular tax result. Further, if Participant is subject to Tax-Related Items in more than one jurisdiction, Participant acknowledges that the Company and/or the Employer (or former employer, as applicable) may be required to withhold or account for Tax-Related Items in more than one jurisdiction. 

The Administrator, in its sole discretion and pursuant to such procedures as it may specify from time to time, may permit or require Participant to satisfy such Tax-Related Items, in whole or in part (without limitation) by (a) paying cash, (b) electing to have the Company withhold otherwise deliverable Shares, (c) selling a sufficient number of such Shares otherwise deliverable to Participant through such means as the Company may determine in its sole discretion (whether through a broker or otherwise) and without further consent from Participant, (d) electing to have the Company or the Employer withhold from Participant s wages or other cash compensation payable to Participant, or (e) any other method of withholding determined by the Company and permitted by Applicable Laws and the Plan. To the extent determined appropriate by the Company in its discretion, it will have the right (but not the obligation) to satisfy any withholding obligations or rights with regard to Tax-Related Items by means of method (b) above and, until determined otherwise by the Company, this will be the method by which such withholding obligations or rights with regard to Tax-Related Items are satisfied; provided, however, that if Participant is a Section 16 officer of the Company under the Exchange Act, the Company will, in all cases, satisfy any Tax-Related Items by means of method (b) above, unless the use of such withholding method is problematic under applicable tax or securities law or has materially adverse accounting consequences, in which case the obligation for Tax-Related Items may be satisfied by one or a combination of the other methods above. 

The Company may withhold or account for Tax-Related Items by considering statutory or other withholding rates, including minimum or maximum rates applicable in Participant s jurisdiction(s). In the event of over-withholding, Participant may receive a refund of any over-withheld amount in cash (with no entitlement to the equivalent in Shares), or, if not refunded, Participant may be able to seek a refund from the local tax authorities. In the event of under-withholding, Participant may be required to pay additional Tax-Related Items directly to the applicable tax authority. If the obligation for Tax-Related Items is satisfied by withholding in Shares, for tax purposes, Participant will be deemed to have been issued the full number of Shares subject to the vested Restricted Stock Units, notwithstanding that a number of the Shares is held back solely for the purpose of paying the Tax-Related Items. 

If Participant fails to make satisfactory arrangements for the payment of any Tax-Related Items hereunder at the time any applicable Restricted Stock Units otherwise are scheduled to vest pursuant to Sections 3 or 4 or Tax-Related Items related to Restricted Stock Units otherwise are due, Participant will permanently forfeit such Restricted Stock Units and any right to receive Shares thereunder and the Restricted Stock Units will be returned to the Company at no cost to the Company. 

8) Rights as Stockholder . Neither Participant nor any person claiming under or through Participant will have any of the rights or privileges of a stockholder of the Company in respect of any Shares deliverable hereunder unless and until certificates representing such Shares will have been issued, recorded on the records of the Company or its transfer agents or registrars, and delivered to Participant. After such issuance, recordation and delivery, Participant will have all the rights of a stockholder of the Company with respect to voting such Shares and receipt of dividends and distributions on such Shares. 

9) No Guarantee of Continued Service . PARTICIPANT ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT THE VESTING OF THE RESTRICTED STOCK UNITS PURSUANT TO THE VESTING SCHEDULE HEREOF IS EARNED ONLY BY CONTINUING AS A SERVICE PROVIDER AND NOT THROUGH THE ACT OF BEING HIRED, BEING GRANTED THIS AWARD OF RESTRICTED STOCK UNITS OR ACQUIRING SHARES HEREUNDER. PARTICIPANT FURTHER ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT THIS AWARD AGREEMENT, THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREUNDER AND THE VESTING SCHEDULE SET FORTH HEREIN DO NOT CONSTITUTE AN EXPRESS OR IMPLIED PROMISE OF CONTINUED ENGAGEMENT AS A SERVICE PROVIDER FOR THE VESTING PERIOD, FOR ANY PERIOD, OR AT ALL, AND WILL NOT INTERFERE IN ANY WAY WITH PARTICIPANT S RIGHT OR THE RIGHT OF THE COMPANY (OR THE EMPLOYER) TO TERMINATE PARTICIPANT S RELATIONSHIP AS A SERVICE PROVIDER AT ANY TIME, WITH OR WITHOUT CAUSE. 

10) Nature of Grant . By accepting the Award, Participant acknowledges, understands and agrees that: 

(a) the grant of the Restricted Stock Units is exceptional, voluntary and occasional and does not create any contractual or other right to receive future grants of Restricted Stock Units, or benefits in lieu of Restricted Stock Units, even if Restricted Stock Units have been granted in the past; 

(b) all decisions with respect to future Restricted Stock Units or other grants, if any, will be at the sole discretion of the Company; 

(c) the Restricted Stock Unit grant and Participant s participation in the Plan shall not be interpreted as forming an employment or service contract with the Company, the Employer, or any Parent or Subsidiary; 

(d) Participant is voluntarily participating in the Plan;

 PERFORMANCE MATRIX 

General: 

The number of Eligible RSUs (if any) will be determined based upon the achievement of the Average Company Stock Price Hurdle(s) during the Performance Period, subject to Participant s continuous service as a Service Provider through the applicable vesting date, in accordance with the terms and conditions of this Award Agreement. For the avoidance of doubt, (i) each Average Company Stock Price Hurdle may only be achieved once during the Performance Period, (ii) more than one Average Company Stock Price Hurdle may be achieved on a particular date, and (iii) an Average Company Stock Price Hurdle may be achieved at any time during the Performance Period. Except as provided below in the event of a Change in Control, no partial achievement will occur and no Restricted Stock Units will become Eligible RSUs for achievement between two Average Company Stock Price Hurdles. 

Definitions : 

Achievement Date means the first Trading Day occurring during the Performance Period in which an Average Company Stock Price Hurdle is achieved. 

Average Company Stock Price means the simple average of the closing price (or, the closing bid, if no sales were reported) of a Share as quoted on NASDAQ (or such other established stock exchange or national market system on which the Common Stock is listed) for the trailing sixty (60) Trading Days up to and including the day of measurement during the Performance Period. 

Average Company Stock Price Hurdle means each Average Company Stock Price set forth in the table below. The Average Company Stock Price Hurdle is achieved when the applicable Average Company Stock Price listed in the table below is achieved in accordance with the terms of this Award Agreement. 

Closing means the closing of the first Change in Control that occurs following the Grant Date. 

Initial Company Stock Price means the simple average of the closing price (or, the closing bid, if no sales were reported) of a Share as quoted on NASDAQ (or such other established stock exchange or national market system on which the Common Stock is listed) for the trailing sixty (60) Trading Days up to and including the Trading Day prior to the Grant Date. The Initial Company Stock Price will be adjusted to reflect any transaction described in Section 15(a) of the Plan. The Administrator, in order to prevent diminution or enlargement of the benefits or potential benefits intended to be provided under the Award Agreement, will make the determination of any such adjustments required in connection with such event. 

Per Share Deal Price means the total amount of cash consideration and value of any non-cash consideration received or potentially receivable for a Share by holders of Common Stock in connection with a Change in Control. The value of any non-cash consideration will be determined in good faith by the Administrator, except that if such non-cash consideration is in the form of publicly traded securities, then the value of such publicly traded securities will be based on the closing trading price of such publicly traded securities on the date of Closing. 

Performance Period means the period (i) commencing on the first Trading Day on or after the Grant Date, and (ii) ending on the first to occur of (A) the date Participant ceases to be a Service Provider for any reason, (B) a Closing, or (C) the six (6) year anniversary following the Grant Date. 

Performance Goals : 

As detailed in the table below, the Award of Restricted Stock Units is divided into six (6) tranches, each a Tranche , with each Tranche representing a percentage of the Target Number of Restricted Stock Units subject to the Award specified next to the applicable Tranche number in the table below. Each Tranche has an Average Company Stock Price associated with such Tranche that must be achieved during the Performance Period for the applicable Average Company Stock Price Hurdle to be achieved and any Restricted Stock Units to become Eligible RSUs. If the Average Company Stock Price Hurdle associated with a Tranche is not achieved during the Performance Period, the Restricted Stock Units subject to such Tranche will not become Eligible RSUs and the Restricted Stock Units subject to such Tranche will terminate for no consideration. On each Achievement Date, a number of RSUs will become Eligible RSUs equal to the Applicable Percentage of Target Number of RSUs That Become Eligible RSUs corresponding to the applicable Average Company Stock Price Hurdle for the applicable Tranche in the table below, subject to Participant remaining a Service Provider through the Achievement Date, and will be subject to vesting as set forth in the Notice of Grant.

5

200 

6 

300 of Initial Company Stock Price 

250 

The applicable percentage that becomes Eligible RSUs will be reduced by the percentage that previously was achieved and became Eligible RSUs. 

For example, assume an Initial Company Stock Price of 50.00 and the Average Company Stock Price on January 15, 2025, is 62.50. Further, assume that the Performance Period has not terminated and no Average Company Stock Price Hurdles have been achieved as of such date. January 15, 2025, will be an Achievement Date for 25 of the Target Number of Restricted Stock Units subject to the Award and such Restricted Stock Units will become Eligible RSUs on such date. Such Eligible RSUs will be scheduled to vest in accordance with the vesting schedule set forth in the Notice of Grant, subject to Participant remaining a Service Provider on the applicable Vesting Date. 

Employment Condition and Forfeiture : 

In order for any Restricted Stock Units subject to the Award to become Eligible RSUs, Participant must have continuously served as a Service Provider through the applicable Achievement Date. If Participant ceases to be a Service Provider for any reason, any unvested Restricted Stock Units subject to the Award will immediately terminate and be forfeited for no consideration. Further, any Restricted Stock Units that are not Eligible RSUs as of the end of the Performance Period will immediately terminate and be forfeited for no consideration. 

Change in Control : 

If a Change in Control occurs during the Performance Period, then immediately prior to the Closing, rather than applying the definition of Average Company Stock Price set forth above, Average Company Stock Price will instead mean the Per Share Deal Price. After determining the Average Company Stock Price pursuant to the preceding sentence, the same rules under the table set forth above apply in determining whether any additional Average Company Stock Price Hurdles are achieved and whether any additional Restricted Stock Units will become Eligible RSUs as of immediately prior to the Closing except that if the Average Company Stock Price is at a level that is between the Average Company Stock Price Hurdles for two consecutive Tranches and the Company has not satisfied the Average Company Stock Price Hurdle for the higher-numbered of such two Tranches (the Partially Achieved Tranche ), then the Average Company Stock Price Hurdle will be considered to be partially achieved for such Partially Achieved Tranche and a number of Restricted Stock Units subject to the Partially Achieved Tranche will be considered Eligible RSUs, which number will be determined by applying linear interpolation between such two Tranches (with any resulting fractional RSU rounded down), effective as of immediately prior to the Closing, subject to Participant remaining a Service Provider as of immediately prior to the Closing. At the Closing, any Restricted Stock Units that are not Eligible RSUs, after first applying the provisions of this paragraph, will terminate for no consideration. Following the Closing, any Eligible RSUs will remain subject to the vesting schedule set forth herein.
