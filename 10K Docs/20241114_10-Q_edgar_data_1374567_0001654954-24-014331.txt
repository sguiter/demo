Under ASC 842, the Company determines whether the arrangement is or contains a lease based on the unique facts and circumstances present. Most leases with a term greater than one year are recognized on the balance sheet as right-of-use assets, lease liabilities and, if applicable, long-term lease liabilities. The Company elected not to recognize leases with a term less than one year on its balance sheet. Operating lease right-of-use (ROU) assets and their corresponding lease liabilities are recorded based on the present value of lease payments over the expected remaining lease term. The interest rate implicit in lease contracts is typically not readily determinable. As a result, the Company utilizes its incremental borrowing rates, which are the rates incurred to borrow on a collateralized basis over a similar term, an amount equal to the lease payments in a similar economic environment. In accordance with the guidance in ASC 842, components of a lease should be split into three categories: lease components (e.g. land, building, etc.), non-lease components (e.g. common area maintenance, consumables, etc.), and non-components (e.g. property taxes, insurance, etc.) Then the fixed and in-substance fixed contract consideration (including any related to non-components) must be allocated based on fair values to the lease components and non-lease components. Although separation of lease and non-lease components is required, the Company elected the practical expedient to not separate lease and non-lease components. The lease component results in an operating right-of-use asset being recorded on the balance sheet and amortized on a straight-line basis as lease expense.

Management reviews long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of such assets may not be recoverable. Recoverability of these assets is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount to forecasted undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset. If the carrying amount exceeds its estimated future cash flows, then an impairment charge is recognized to the extent that the carrying amount exceeds the asset s fair value. Management has determined no asset impairment occurred during the three months ended September 30, 2024.

Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Results of Operations The following table sets forth, for the periods indicated, information derived from the Company s Interim Unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements, expressed as a percentage of net sales. The discussion that follows the table should be read in conjunction with the Company s Interim Unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements. Three Months Ended (unaudited) September 30, 2024 September 30, 2023 Net sales 100 100 Cost of goods sold 74 74 Gross profit 26 26 Operating Expenses 28 26 Income from operations (2 0 The following table represents the net sales and percentage of net sales by product type: Three Months Ended (unaudited) (Dollars in thousands) September 30, 2 024 September 30, 2023 Net Sales: Liberator 3,110 54 3,324 54 Jaxx 1,820 32 1,799 29 Avana 485 8 531 9 Products purchased for resale 210 4 249 4 Other 131 2 224 4 Total Net Sales 5,756 100 6,126 100 25 Table of Contents Three Months Ended September 30, 2024 Compared to Three Months Ended September 30, 2023 Net sales . Sales for the three months ended September 30, 2024, were approximately 5,756,000, a 6 decrease from the comparable prior year period. The major components of net sales, by product, are as follows: Liberator sales - Sales of Liberator branded products decreased 214,000, or 6 , during the quarter from the comparable prior year period, due primarily to lower sales through our wholesale channels. Weaker consumer sentiment continues to drag the sector. Jaxx sales Jaxx product sales increased 1 from the prior year first quarter to 1,820,000. We continue to develop our marketing efforts into the special education market, which offsets the decline in the competitive online market place. Avana sales Net sales of Avana products decreased 9 during the quarter from the comparable prior year quarter to 485,000. Sales of this product line have been impacted by lower-priced competitive products in the marketplace, production constraints which resulted in longer delivery lead times which resulted in lower sales through drop ship channels including Amazon, Overstock and Wayfair. Products purchased for resale This product category decreased by 16 , or 39,000, from the prior year first quarter due to lower sales of certain products through our e-commerce website, Liberator.com. We believe our focus on expanding our online third party drop ship business will return this channel to growth. Gross margin . Gross profit, derived from net sales less the cost of goods sold, includes the cost of materials, direct labor, manufacturing overhead, freight costs, royalties and depreciation. Gross profit margin, as a percentage of sales, increased to 26 from 26 in the prior year first quarter. Gross profit decreased to 1,517,000 from 1,582,000 in the prior year first quarter. Operating expenses . Total operating expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2024 were approximately 28 of net sales, or approximately 1,639,000, compared to 26 of net sales, or approximately 1,614,000, for the same period in the prior year. Other income (expense) . Interest expense during the first quarter decreased from approximately 96,000) in the first quarter of fiscal 2024 to approximately 89,000) in the first quarter of fiscal 2025. The decrease was primarily due to the reduction in notes payable. Net Loss. For the three months ended September 30, 2024, we had a net loss of 210,000 as compared to a net loss of 126,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in net loss was primarily due to the decrease in Liberator product sales. 26 Table of Contents Variability of Results The Company has experienced significant quarterly fluctuations in operating results and anticipate that these fluctuations may continue in future periods. Operating results have fluctuated as a result of changes in sales levels to consumers and wholesalers, competition, seasonality costs associated with new product introductions, and increases in raw material costs. In addition, future operating results may fluctuate as a result of factors beyond the Company s control such as foreign exchange fluctuation, changes in government regulations, and economic changes in the regions in which it operates and sells. A portion of the Company s operating expenses are relatively fixed and the timing of increases in expense levels is based in large part on forecasts of future sales. Therefore, if net sales are below expectations in any given period, the adverse impact on results of operations may be magnified by the Company s inability to meaningfully adjust spending in certain areas, or the inability to adjust spending quickly enough, as in personnel and administrative costs, to compensate for a sales shortfall. The Company may also choose to increase spending in response to market conditions, and these decisions may have a material adverse effect on financial condition and results of operations. Liquidity and Capital Resources The following table summarizes the Company s cash flows: Three Months Ended September 30 , Cash flow data: 2024 2023 (Unaudited) (Dollars in thousands) Cash provided by operating activities 132 171 Cash used in investing activities (1 (32 Cash provided by financing activities (91 (43 As of September 30, 2024, the Company s cash and cash equivalents totaled 1,067,862, compared to 1,132,317 in cash and cash equivalents as of September 30, 2023. For purposes of reporting cash flows, the Company considers all highly liquid debt instruments purchased with a maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents. The Company s principal sources of liquidity are the Company s cash flow that the Company generates from its operations, availability of borrowings under its line of credit and cash raised through debt financings. Operating Activities Net cash provided by operating activities was 132,000 during the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 171,000 net cash provided by operating activities in the three months ended September 30, 2023. The primary components of the cash provided by operating activities in the current year is the decrease in Inventory of 283,000 offset in part by an increase in accounts receivable of 137,000. Investing Activities Cash used in investing activities in the three months ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023 was 1,000 and 32,000, respectively, related to the purchase of computer equipment and the installation of certain production equipment during the periods. Financing Activities Cash used by financing activities during the three months ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023 of 91,000 and 43,000 respectively, primarily attributable to the repayment of the secured and unsecured notes payable and payments made on equipment notes. 27 Table of Contents Non-GAAP Financial Measures Reconciliation of net income to Adjusted EBITDA for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023: Three Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 (in thousands) Net loss (210 (126 Plus interest expense, financing costs and income tax 89 96 Plus depreciation and amortization expense 109 99 Plus stock-based compensation expense 9 (6 Adjusted EBITDA (3 63 As used herein, Adjusted EBITDA represents net income before interest income, interest expense, income taxes, depreciation, amortization, and stock-based compensation expense. The Company has excluded the non-cash expenses and stock-based compensation, as they do not reflect the cash-based operations of the Company. Adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure which is not required by or defined under GAAP. The presentation of this financial measure is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the financial measures prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP, including the net income of the Company or net cash provided by operating activities. Management recognizes that non-GAAP financial measures have limitations in that they do not reflect all of the items associated with the Company s net income or net loss as determined in accordance with GAAP and are not a substitute for or a measure of the Company s profitability or net earnings. Adjusted EBITDA is presented because the Company believes it is useful to investors as a measure of comparative operating performance and liquidity, and because it is less susceptible to variances in actual performance resulting from depreciation and non-cash charges for stock-based compensation expense. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements The Company does not use off-balance sheet arrangements with unconsolidated entities or related parties, nor does it use other forms of off-balance sheet arrangements. Accordingly, the Company s liquidity and capital resources are not subject to off-balance sheet risks from unconsolidated entities. As of September 30, 2024, the Company did not have any off-balance sheet arrangements, as defined in Item 303(a)(4)(ii) of SEC Regulation S-K. Critical accounting policies The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reported periods. The more critical accounting estimates include estimates related to revenue recognition, accounts receivable allowances and impairment of long-lived assets. The Company also has adopted other key accounting policies, which involve the use of estimates, judgments and assumptions that are significant to understanding the Company s results, which are described in Note 2 to its unaudited consolidated financial statements appearing in this report. Recent accounting pronouncements The Company does not believe that any recently issued effective pronouncements, or pronouncements issued but not yet effective, if adopted, would have a material effect on the unaudited consolidated accompanying financial statements. ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK The Company does not enter into any transactions using derivative financial instruments or derivative commodity instruments and believe that the Company s exposure to market risk associated with other financial instruments is not material. 28 Table of Contents ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures The Company maintains a set of disclosure controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the Company in reports that it files or submits under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in SEC rules and forms and to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to management to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures.

 CODE OF ETHICS
 
 luvu_ex141.htm EXHIBIT 14.1 Luvu Brands, Inc. Code of Ethics Introduction This Code of Ethics (the Code of Luvu Brands, Inc. (the Company covers a wide spectrum of business practices and procedures. They do not cover every issue that may arise, but they set out some basic principles to guide all directors, officers, employees and certain selected consultants of the Company 1 . We expect all of our directors, officers, employees and those consultants to comply with them and to seek to avoid even the appearance of improper behavior. This Code should also be provided to and followed by the Company s agents and representatives, including consultants. If a law conflicts with a policy in this Code, you must comply with the law. If you have any questions about these conflicts, you should ask your supervisor how to handle the situation. Those who violate this Code may be subject to disciplinary action. Depending on the nature of the violation, the disciplinary action may include termination of employment. If you are in a situation, which you believe may violate or lead to a violation of this Code, follow the recommendations described below. Compliance with Laws, Rules and Regulations Obeying the law, both in letter and in spirit, is the foundation on which the Company s ethical standards and our reputation are built. All employees must respect and obey the laws of the cities, states and nations in which we operate. Although not all employees are expected to know the details of these laws, it is important to know enough to determine when to seek advice from supervisors, managers, the Company s legal counsel or other appropriate personnel. If requested, the Company will hold information and training sessions to promote compliance with laws, rules and regulations, including insider trading laws. Conflicts of Interest A conflict of interest exists when a person s private interest interferes in any way with the interests of the Company. A conflict may arise when an employee takes actions or has interests that may make it difficult to perform duties for the Company objectively and effectively. Conflicts of interest arise whenever a family member of an employee provides goods or services (including as an employee) or otherwise engages in business with the Company. All of these relationships require prior approval of our Board of Directors. Conflicts of interest may also arise when an employee, or members of his or her family, receives improper personal benefits as a result of his or her position with the Company. For example, loans to, or guarantees of obligations of, employees and their family members may create conflicts of interest. By law, the Company cannot make any loans to its executive officers and directors. It is almost always a conflict of interest for a Company employee to work simultaneously for a competitor, client or supplier. You are not allowed to provide services for a competitor as a consultant or act as a board member. The best policy is to avoid any direct or indirect business connection with our clients, suppliers or competitors, except on our behalf. Conflicts of interest are prohibited as a matter of company policy, except under specific guidelines approved by the Company s board of directors (the Board ). Conflicts of interest may not always be clear-cut, so if you have a question, you should consult with higher levels of management or the Company s legal counsel. Any employee who becomes aware of a conflict or potential conflict should bring it to the attention of a supervisor, manager or other appropriate personnel or consult the procedures described below. Our executive officers and directors and certain other persons must also comply with our Insider Trading Policy. _______________ 1 When the Code discusses employees, it also should be understood to include all officers and directors and certain consultants who are officers are subject to the Code. A-1 Insider Trading Employees who have access to confidential information are not permitted to use or share that information for trading purposes or for any other purpose except the conduct of our business. All non-public information about the Company should be considered confidential information. To use non-public information for personal benefit (financial or otherwise) or to tip others who might make an investment decision on the basis of this information is not only unethical but also illegal under the federal securities laws. In order to comply with the securities laws against insider trading, the Company has adopted a specific policy governing employees trading in securities of the Company. The Company is required to provide you with a copy of our Insider Trading Policy. If you have not received this Policy, please notify your supervisor. Corporate Opportunities Employees are prohibited from taking for themselves personally, opportunities that are discovered through the use of the Company s property, information or from their position with the Company without the consent of the Board. No employee may use the Company s property, information, or their position with the Company, for improper personal gain. Under no circumstances may an employee compete with the Company directly or indirectly. Employees owe a duty of loyalty to the Company to advance its legitimate interests when the opportunity to do so arises. Competition and Fair Dealing We seek to outperform our competition fairly and honestly. Stealing proprietary information, possessing trade secret information that was obtained without the owner s consent, or inducing such disclosures by past or present employees of other companies is prohibited. Each employee should endeavor to respect the rights of and deal fairly with the Company s clients, suppliers, competitors and other employees. No employee should take unfair advantage of anyone through manipulation, concealment, abuse of privileged information, misrepresentation of material facts, or any other intentional unfair dealing practice. The purpose of business entertainment and gifts in a commercial setting is to create goodwill and sound working relationships, not to gain unfair advantage with clients. No gift or entertainment should be offered, given, provided or accepted by any employee, family member of an employee, or agent unless it: (1) is not a cash gift, (2) is consistent with customary business practices, (3) is not excessive in value, (4) cannot be construed as a bribe or payoff and (5) does not violate any laws or regulations. Please discuss with your supervisor any gifts or proposed gifts which you are not certain are appropriate. 2 Discrimination and Harassment The diversity of the Company s employees is a tremendous asset. We are firmly committed to providing equal opportunity in all aspects of employment and will not tolerate any illegal discrimination or harassment. Examples may include derogatory comments based on racial, religious, sexual identity, disability, or ethnic characteristics and unwelcome sexual advances. If you believe that any type of discrimination or harassment has occurred, the Company has a Whistleblower Policy which provides for an anonymous procedure. See Reporting Any Illegal or Unethical Behavior at page 4 of the Code. Health and Safety The Company strives to provide each employee with a safe and healthy work environment. Each employee has responsibility for maintaining a safe and healthy workplace for all employees by following safety and health rules and practices and reporting accidents, injuries and unsafe equipment, practices or conditions. Violence and threatening behavior are not permitted. Employees should report to work in condition to perform their duties, free from the influence of illegal drugs or alcohol. The use of alcohol or illegal drugs (or the use of legal prescriptions contrary to a physician s advice) in the workplace will not be tolerated. Record-Keeping The Company requires honest and accurate recording and reporting of information in order to make responsible business decisions. For example, only the true and actual number of hours worked should be reported. Some employees are authorized to use business expense accounts, which must be documented and recorded accurately. If you are not sure whether a certain expense is legitimate, ask your supervisor or our Chief Financial Officer. All of the Company s books, records, accounts and financial statements must be maintained in reasonable detail, must appropriately reflect the Company s transactions and must conform both to applicable legal requirements and to the Company s system of internal controls. Unrecorded or off the books funds or assets should not be maintained unless permitted by applicable law or regulation. Business records and communications often become public, and we should avoid exaggeration, derogatory remarks, guesswork, or inappropriate characterizations of people and companies that can be misunderstood. Side letters with suppliers or customers are forbidden unless approved by our legal counsel. This applies equally to e-mail, internal memos, and formal reports. Records should always be retained or destroyed according to the Company s record retention policies. In accordance with those policies, in the event of litigation or governmental investigation please consult the Company s legal counsel. 3 Emails, Texts and Social Media Before you send an email or text, think. Will you be embarrassed or will the Company be subject to liability if the email or text becomes public or is obtained by a party that is antagonistic to the Company? Nobody is authorized to use social media, email or text messaging for the business of the Company, except as expressly authorized by the Chief Executive Officer. Confidentiality Employees must maintain the confidentiality of confidential information entrusted to them by the Company or its clients except when disclosure is authorized by the Company s legal counsel or required by laws or regulations. Confidential information includes all non-public information that might be of use to competitors, or harmful to the Company or its clients if disclosed. It also includes information that suppliers and clients have entrusted to us. The obligation to preserve confidential information continues even after employment ends. Protection and Proper Use of the Company s Assets All employees should endeavor to protect the Company s assets and ensure their efficient use. Theft, carelessness, and waste have a direct impact on the Company s profitability. Any suspected incident of fraud or theft should be immediately reported for investigation. The Company s equipment should not be used for non-Company business, though incidental personal use may be permitted. The obligation of employees to protect the Company s assets includes its proprietary information. Proprietary information includes intellectual property such as trade secrets, patents, trademarks, and copyrights, as well as business, marketing and service plans, ideas, designs, databases, records, salary information and any unpublished financial data and reports. While unauthorized use or distribution of this information would violate company policy, it could also be illegal and result in civil or even criminal penalties. Payments to Government Personnel The U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act prohibits giving anything of value, directly or indirectly, to officials of foreign governments or foreign political candidates in order to obtain or retain business. It is strictly prohibited to make illegal payments to government officials of any country. This also applies to the making of improper payments to obtain business from commercial clients in the United States. In addition, the U.S. government has a number of laws and regulations regarding business gratuities which may be accepted by U.S. government personnel. The promise, offer or delivery to an official or employee of the U.S. government of a gift, favor or other gratuity in violation of these rules would not only violate Company policy but could also be a criminal offense. State and local governments, as well as foreign governments, may have similar rules. Our legal counsel can provide guidance to you in this area. 4 Reporting Any Illegal or Unethical Behavior Employees are encouraged to talk to supervisors, managers or other appropriate personnel about observed illegal or unethical behavior and when in doubt about the best course of action in a particular situation. It is the policy of the Company not to allow retaliation for reports of misconduct by others made in good faith by employees. Employees are expected to cooperate in internal investigations of misconduct. Any employee may submit a good faith concern regarding questionable accounting or auditing matters or other matters without fear of dismissal or retaliation of any kind to the Chief Financial Officer or the Company s legal counsel who are listed on the last page of this Code. A full statement of the Company s Whistleblower Policy for Reporting Violations, Complaints or Concerns is attached as Appendix A to this Code. Compliance Procedures We must all work to ensure prompt and consistent action against violations of this Code. However, in some situations it is difficult to know if a violation has occurred. Since we cannot anticipate every situation that will arise, it is important that we have a way to approach a new question or problem. These are the steps to keep in mind: Make sure you have all the facts in order to reach the right solutions; we must be as fully informed as possible. Ask yourself: What specifically am I being asked to do? Does it seem unethical or improper? This will enable you to focus on the specific question you are faced with, and the alternatives you have. Use your judgment and common sense; if something seems unethical or improper, it probably is. Clarify your responsibility and role. In most situations, there is shared responsibility. Are your colleagues informed? It may help to get others involved and discuss the problem. Discuss the problem with your supervisor. This is the basic guidance for all situations. In many cases, your supervisor will be more knowledgeable about the question, and will appreciate being brought into the decision-making process. Remember that it is your supervisor s responsibility to help solve problems. Seek help from Company resources. In the rare case where it may not be appropriate to discuss an issue with your supervisor, or where you do not feel comfortable approaching your supervisor with your question, discuss it with your office manager or with a human resources officer. You may report ethical violations in confidence and without fear of retaliation. Additionally, if your situation requires that your identity be kept confidential, your anonymity will be protected. Further, you may speak with the Company s legal counsel on any of these matters. Under no circumstances does the Company permit or tolerate any form of retaliation against employees for good faith reports of potential ethical violations. 5 Always ask first, act later. If you are unsure of what to do in any situation, seek guidance before you act.

 INSIDER TRADING POLICY
 
 luvu_ex191.htm EXHIBIT 19.1 MEMORANDUM TO: Luvu Brands, Inc. FROM: Nason Yeager Gerson Harris Fumero, P.A. DATE: August 1, 2023 RE: Insider Trading Policy We believe that the best way to protect Luvu Brands, Inc. (the Company and its executive officers, directors and employees from potential liability from the insider trading under the federal securities laws is to adopt and implement and enforce a clear policy that defines insider trading and prohibits all employees, officers, directors and other individuals who are aware of Material Non-Public Information (as defined beginning at page 5) from trading in the Company s securities or providing Material Non-Public Information to other persons who may trade on the basis of that information. Engaging in securities transactions on the basis of Material Non-Public Information or the communication of such information to others who use it in securities trading violates the federal securities laws. Such violations are likely to result in harsh consequences for the individuals involved including exposure to investigations by the Securities and Exchange Commission SEC ), criminal and civil prosecution, and disgorgement of any profits realized or losses avoided and penalties three times any profits gained or losses avoided. Insider trading violations expose the Company, its management, and other personnel acting in supervisory capacities to potential civil liabilities and penalties for the actions of employees under their control who engage in insider trading violations. This Memorandum constitutes the Company s implementation and the requirements of the Policy and sets forth procedures to assure that Material Non-Public Information will not be used by Insiders (as defined below) in securities transactions and that the confidentiality of such information will be maintained. Strict compliance with these policies and procedures is expected of all Insiders, including members of their households, and any infringement thereof may result in sanctions, including termination of office or employment. I. The Statement of Policy A. Who Does This Policy Apply To? Insiders are directors, officers and all employees of the Company. Additionally, the following persons may also be subject to the restrictions contained in this Policy (i) members of any subsidiary s Board of Directors; (ii) the Company s independent contractors and consultants; and (iii) other persons associated with the Company and its subsidiaries who receive or have access to Material Non-Public Information. As an Insider this Policy applies to you. The same restrictions that apply to you, also apply to your family members who reside with you, anyone else who lives in your household and any family members who do not live in your household but whose transactions in Company securities are directed by you or are subject to your influence or control. You are responsible for making sure that the purchase or sale of any security covered by this Policy by any such person complies with this Policy. All Directors, Officers and Employees August 1, 2023 Page 2 Please note that certain restrictions and requirements under this Policy are applicable to only certain individuals. The Blackout Periods apply to officers, directors, consultants in the finance/accounting department and any other employee at the vice president level or above who are notified by the Compliance Officer. The Event-Specific Trading Restriction Periods apply to all directors, officers and the persons designated by the Chief Executive Officer or the Compliance Officer. Additionally, the pre-clearance requirements apply to our officers, directors, and employees in the finance/accounting department, any other employee at the vice president level or above and others who are uniquely situated to know of material financial or other information and are given notice in writing from an officer. If you have any doubt regarding whether you fall within these category, please contact the Compliance Officer. For purposes of this Policy, our Compliance Officer is the Chairman or in his absence the Chief Executive Officer. All Insiders are expected to maintain the confidentiality of Non-Public Material Information. Disclosure of such information to any individual outside of the Company, whether or not in the form of a recommendation to purchase or sell the securities of the Company, is prohibited and may be criminal. If anyone becomes aware of a leak of Material Non-Public Information, whether inadvertent or otherwise, they should immediately be reported to our Compliance Officer. This duty of confidentiality does not preclude an Insider from using Non-Public Material Information in connection with such person s duties to the Company. As a general policy, the Company and all Insiders shall follow all laws, rules and regulations relating to Insider trading. This includes Regulation FD which provides that selective disclosure of Material Non-Public Information is generally illegal. B. What are the Prohibited Activities? No Trading Based on Material Non-Public Information . The Policy prohibits trading based on Material Non-Public Information. The SEC will presume that if you are in possession of Material Non-Public Information, your trading is based on it. No Trading in Other Corporations. You may not trade in the securities of any other company if you are aware of Material Non-Public Information about that company which you obtained in the course of your employment with the Company. All Directors, Officers and Employees August 1, 2023 Page 3 No Tipping . You may not pass Material Non-Public Information on to others or recommend to anyone the purchase or sale of any securities when you are aware of such information. This practice known as tipping, also violates the securities laws and can result in the same civil and criminal penalties that apply to insider trading, even though you did not trade and did not gain any benefit from another s trading. While the law is developing in this area, the Policy prohibits the disclosure of Material Non-Public Information in the same manner as other Company policies protect its confidential information. Social Media . Social Media including Facebook, Twitter and Instagram are public communications. The prohibition against using Material Non-Public Information in this Memorandum applies to using any form of social media. Further, without approval from our Chief Executive Officer or Compliance Officer, no one shall use social media on behalf of the Company. Expert Networks. A new phenomenon called Expert Networks has developed over the last number of years. Essentially Expert Networks are consulting companies formed for the purpose of gathering information from employees of public companies and then selling the information to hedge funds. The law is evolving and the line between immaterial and material information is often blurred. However, it is the Company s policy that Insiders may not speak or otherwise communicate with third parties about the Company s business unless it is part of their duties as an Insider. For example, our officers may discuss information about the Company that is not Material Non-Public Information in order to generate business or develop partnerships. No Dissemination of Material Non-Public Information. You should not discuss any confidential information within the hearing range of outsiders, including friends and relatives. It is particularly important to exercise care and refrain from discussing Material Non-Public Information in public places such as elevators, trains, taxis, airplanes, lavatories, restaurants, or other places where the discussions might be overheard. No Short-Term Trading. No Insider who purchases Company securities in the open market may sell any Company securities of the same class during the 30 days following the purchase. Executive officers and directors must wait more than six months to buy or sell after an offsetting or opposite way transaction. Short Sale Transactions . No Insider may engage in short sales of the Company s securities. Short sales are the sale of securities which the seller does not own. The seller is speculating that the price will fall, in the hope of later purchasing the same number of securities at a lower price, thereby making a profit. An Insider who bets against the Company sends an alarming signal to his or her broker. In addition, Section 16(c) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 prohibits officers and directors from engaging in short sales. All Directors, Officers and Employees August 1, 2023 Page 4 Hedging Transactions. No Insider may enter into a hedging transaction. When an Insider engages in this type of transaction, this Insider may no longer have the same objectives as the Company s other stockholders. Margin Accounts and Pledges. No Insider may hold Company securities in a margin account or pledge Company securities as collateral for a loan. C. What Transactions Does this Policy Apply To? Personal Transactions . This Policy applies to your personal transactions and those indirectly through a spouse, friend, corporation or other entity. Types of Securities . Purchases and sales of stock, derivative securities such as put and call options and convertible notes or preferred stock. Stock Options/Warrants . This Policy applies to: (i) any sale of stock as part of a broker-assisted cashless exercise of options or warrants, or any other market sale for the purpose of generating the cash needed to pay the exercise price of an option or warrants and (ii) any sale of common stock received upon exercise of options or warrants. Former Insiders . This Policy continues to apply to former Insiders in possession of Material Non-Public Information at the time their status as an Insider terminates. No former Insider may trade Company securities until that information has become public or is no longer material. D. Rule 10b5-1 Plans as an Exception The restrictions outlined above shall not prohibit transfers of Company securities made pursuant to a written contract, letter of instruction or plan that (a) complies with the requirements of Rule 10b5-1 (a Plan and (b) complies with all of the following: Review and Approve the Proposed Arrangement in Advance . The Company will require all Plans to be in writing and submitted to the Company for approval prior to any transactions under the Plan. This will allow the Company to ensure that each Plan is in compliance with the requirements of Rule 10b5-1 and Company policies with regard to lock-up agreements, among other items, allowing the individual to conduct transactions under the Plan without preclearance by the Company. Because of recent concerns arising from possible abuses of Plans, the Company may require evidence that the party exercising trading authority has no personal or substantial business relationship with the Insider. The Blackout Periods and Event-Specific Trading Restrictions do not apply to transactions conducted pursuant to a Plan. If you are subject to and within either a Blackout Period or Event Specific Trading Restriction period, you may not enter into, modify or terminate a Plan. All Directors, Officers and Employees August 1, 2023 Page 5 Add Additional Safeguards . It is essential that the Company ensure that there is no Material Non-Public Information that the Insider has knowledge of that has not been publicly disclosed at the time the Plan is adopted. In addition, if the Plan is going to be modified or terminated, notice must immediately be given to the Company and all transactions effected pursuant to the Plan must cease. Any change to an approved Plan will necessitate submission of the revised Plan to the Company for review and approval before transactions may resume. Consider a Public Announcement . On a case by case basis, the Company will consider whether a public announcement in connection with each Plan under Rule 10b5-1 is appropriate. Establish Procedures with Third Parties . In order to ensure that a Plan complies with Rule 10b5-1 in all respects, the Company will set up procedures with the parties handling the transactions under the Plan, including reminding them of the need to file Form 144s and Form 4s (where applicable). Any involvement by the Company and its counsel in reviewing a 10b5-1 Plan does not constitute approval or legal advice. E. What is Material Non-Public Information? Material Information What is material is often difficult to evaluate and is always judged in hindsight. Generally, information is material if there is a substantial likelihood that a reasonable investor would consider it important in deciding whether to buy, hold or sell a security. Both positive and negative information can be considered material. While it is not possible to define all categories of material information, there are various categories of information that are particularly sensitive and, as a general rule, should always be considered material. Examples of such information include: News relating to new agreements or revenue events Updates on the Company s technology including the operation of its new authenticators Financial results Projections of future earnings or losses or other earnings guidance News of a pending or proposed merger or an acquisition or disposition of significant assets Gain or loss of a substantial customer or supplier All Directors, Officers and Employees August 1, 2023 Page 6 Stock splits New equity or debt offerings Significant litigation exposure due to actual or threatened litigation Major changes in management Important changes in the Company s business Impending bankruptcy or financial liquidity problems Non-Public Information Non-public information is information that has not been disclosed to the general public and is not available to the general public. For most companies including the Company, disclosure on its website is still not considered public by the SEC. One common misconception is that material information loses its non-public status as soon as a press release is issued. Non-public information will generally be deemed to be public when (i) it is filed with the SEC or a press release is issued and the public has had a period of time (as much as 24 hours) to fully absorb the information. F. Blackout Periods/Event-Specific Trading Restriction Periods Blackout Periods for All Employees and Insiders All officers, directors, employees and certain consultants in the finance/accounting department are prohibited from trading in the Company s securities during certain Blackout Periods. The Company will notify consultants if they are subject to the Blackout Periods. The four Blackout Periods begin on the 16 th day of the last month of each fiscal quarter and end one day following the Company s issuance of its quarterly (or annual) earnings release or the filing of the Company s financial statements with the SEC if no earnings release is issued (an Earnings Announcement ). Example: If the quarter ends on June 30 th , the Blackout Period begins after the market closes on June 15 th (or prior trading day if the 15 th is not a trading day) and all trading of the Company s securities by Insiders must cease until an Earnings Announcement is released. If the Earnings Announcement is made after the market close on August 14 th , the Blackout Period would end at the market opening on August 16 th . Therefore, your Trading Window (when you can trade) for a quarter ending June 30 th , in this example, would begin August 16 th (or the next trading day) and would end after the market close on September 15 th (or the prior trading day as explained above). The Company reserves the right to shorten or close the Trading Window without prior notice. All Directors, Officers and Employees August 1, 2023 Page 7 Event Specific Blackout Periods From time to time, an event may occur that is material to the Company and is known by only a few directors, officers and/or employees. So long as the event remains material and nonpublic, all directors, officers and the persons designated by the Chief Executive Officer or the Compliance Officer may not trade Company common stock. In addition, the Company s financial results may be sufficiently material in a particular fiscal quarter that, in the judgment of the Compliance Officer, designated persons should refrain from trading in Company common stock even sooner than the typical Blackout Period described above. In that situation, the Compliance Officer may notify these persons that they should not trade in the Company s common stock, without disclosing the reason for the restriction. During a Blackout period, gifts to family members and trust controlled by the Insider are permissible since such parties are subject to the Policy. The existence of an event-specific trading restriction period or extension of a Blackout Period will not be announced to the Company as a whole, and should not be communicated to any other person. Even if the Compliance Officer has not designated you as a person who should not trade due to an event-specific restriction, you should not trade while aware of Material Non-Public Information. Exceptions will not be granted during an event-specific trading restriction period. G. Preclearance Due to the Company s size, preclearance is required for all Insiders. Of course, family members of any of these people require preclearance. A request for preclearance must be submitted to the Compliance Officer on the form attached to this Policy as Exhibit A at least two days in advance of the proposed transaction. Preclearance requires the approval of the Compliance Officer and/or our SEC counsel. If your trade is pre-cleared by the Compliance Officer, the transaction must be effected within five trading days. If the transaction is not effected within that time period will be subject to pre-clearance again. The responsibility for determining whether the Insider has Material Non-Public Information rests with the Insider, and preclearance of the transaction does not constitute legal advice and does not in any way insulate the Insider from liability under the securities laws. For executive officers and directors, preclearance permits our legal counsel to review the proposed trade to ascertain if there is any possible violation of the short-swing trading rules. H. Compliance and Company Assistance The Company is indebted to all Insiders who have helped to make the Company successful and is appreciative of all efforts on its behalf. To protect the Company and its shareholders, it is necessary to implement the foregoing Policy. The Company appreciates your continued cooperation and support in this effort. You should remember that the ultimate responsibility for adhering to this Policy and avoiding improper trading rests with you. If you violate this Policy, the Company may take disciplinary action, including dismissal for cause. Each of you should sign one copy of this Policy and return it to the Company acknowledging that you have read and understand it. If anyone has any questions or wants to have an office conference concerning the issues raised by this Policy, please contact the Compliance Officer. All Directors, Officers and Employees August 1, 2023 Page 8 I. Transactions with the Company While there can be no anti-fraud issues with transactions with an issuer since there is no deception or breach of duty, because of optics, transactions of an Insider with the Company may be permitted if precleared. An examples is the cashless exercise of an option granted by the Company. J. Annual Update On annual basis (as well as initially with all new employees or significant consultants), this Policy will be distributed to all recipients who will be asked to acknowledge receipt in writing. All Directors, Officers and Employees August __, 2023 Page 9 I acknowledge that I have read and understand this Memorandum and to abide by the Company s Policy on stock trading.
