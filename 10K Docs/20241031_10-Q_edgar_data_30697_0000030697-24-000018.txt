 Executive Overview 
 
 Our Business 
 
 As of September 29, 2024, the Wendy s restaurant system was comprised of 7,292 restaurants, with 6,011 Wendy s restaurants in operation in the U.S. Of the U.S. restaurants, 398 were operated by the Company and 5,613 were operated by a total of 210 franchisees. In addition, at September 29, 2024, there were 1,281 Wendy s restaurants in operation in 31 foreign countries and U.S. territories. Of the international restaurants, 1,268 were operated by a total of 109 franchisees and 13 were operated by the Company in the United Kingdom (the U.K. ). 
 
 The revenues from our restaurant business are derived from two principal sources: (1) sales at Company-operated restaurants and (2) franchise-related revenues, including royalties, national advertising funds contributions, rents and franchise fees received from Wendy s franchised restaurants. Company-operated restaurants comprised approximately 5 of the total Wendy s system as of September 29, 2024. 
 
 Wendy s operating results are impacted by a number of external factors, including commodity costs, labor costs, intense price competition, unemployment and consumer spending levels, general economic and market trends and weather. 
 
 Wendy s long-term growth opportunities include delivering accelerated global growth through (1) driving same-restaurant sales momentum across all dayparts, (2) accelerating our consumer-facing digital platforms and technologies and (3) expanding the Company s footprint across the globe. 
 
 Key Business Measures 
 
 We track our results of operations and manage our business using the following key business measures, which includes a non-GAAP financial measure: 
 
 Same-Restaurant Sales - We report same-restaurant sales commencing after new restaurants have been open for 15 continuous months and as soon as reimaged restaurants reopen. Restaurants temporarily closed for more than one week are excluded from same-restaurant sales. This methodology is consistent with the metric used by our management for internal reporting and analysis. The table summarizing same-restaurant sales below in Results of Operations provides the same-restaurant sales percent changes. 
 
 Company-Operated Restaurant Margin - We define Company-operated restaurant margin as sales from Company-operated restaurants less cost of sales divided by sales from Company-operated restaurants. Cost of sales includes food and paper, restaurant labor and occupancy, advertising and other operating costs. Cost of sales excludes certain costs that support restaurant operations that are not allocated to individual restaurants, which are included in General and administrative. Cost of sales also excludes depreciation and amortization expense and impairment of long-lived assets. Therefore, as Company-operated restaurant margin as presented excludes certain costs as described above, its usefulness may be limited and may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies in our industry. 
 
 Company-operated restaurant margin is influenced by factors such as price increases, the effectiveness of our advertising and marketing initiatives, featured products, product mix, fluctuations in food and labor costs, restaurant openings, remodels and closures and the level of our fixed and semi-variable costs. 
 
 Systemwide Sales - Systemwide sales is a non-GAAP financial measure, which includes sales by both Company-operated restaurants and franchised restaurants. Franchised restaurants sales are reported by our franchisees and represent their revenues from sales at franchised Wendy s restaurants. The Company s consolidated financial statements do not include sales by franchised restaurants to their customers. The Company s royalty and advertising 
 26 

funds revenues are computed as percentages of sales made by Wendy s franchisees. As a result, sales by Wendy s franchisees have a direct effect on the Company s royalty and advertising funds revenues and profitability. 
 
 The Company calculates same-restaurant sales and systemwide sales growth on a constant currency basis. Constant currency results exclude the impact of foreign currency translation and are derived by translating current year results at prior year average exchange rates. The Company believes excluding the impact of foreign currency translation provides better year over year comparability. 
 
 Same-restaurant sales and systemwide sales exclude sales from Argentina due to that country s highly inflationary economy. The Company considers economies that have had cumulative inflation in excess of 100 over a three-year period as highly inflationary. 
 
 The Company believes its presentation of same-restaurant sales, Company-operated restaurant margin and systemwide sales provide a meaningful perspective of the underlying operating performance of the Company s current business and enables investors to better understand and evaluate the Company s historical and prospective operating performance. The Company believes that these metrics are important supplemental measures of operating performance because they highlight trends in the Company s business that may not otherwise be apparent when relying solely on GAAP financial measures. The Company believes investors, analysts and other interested parties use these metrics in evaluating issuers and that the presentation of these measures facilitates a comparative assessment of the Company s operating performance. With respect to same-restaurant sales and systemwide sales, the Company also believes that the data is useful in assessing consumer demand for the Company s products and the overall success of the Wendy s brand. 
 
 The non-GAAP financial measure discussed above does not replace the presentation of the Company s financial results in accordance with GAAP. Because all companies do not calculate non-GAAP financial measures in the same way, this measure as used by other companies may not be consistent with the way the Company calculates such measure.

 Wendy s long-term growth opportunities include driving same-restaurant sales across all dayparts through quality differentiation, exciting menu innovation and compelling value offerings. Global same-restaurant sales increased 0.2 in the third quarter of 2024 and increased 3.0 on a two-year basis.

 Digital 
 
 Wendy s long-term growth opportunities include accelerating consumer-facing digital platforms and technologies to drive global systemwide sales. Over the past several years, the Company has invested significant resources to focus on consumer-facing technology, including activating mobile ordering via Wendy s mobile app, launching the Wendy s Rewards loyalty program in the U.S. and Canada and establishing delivery agreements with third-party vendors. The Company is also continuing to make digital investments and is partnering with key technology providers to help execute our digital, restaurant technology and enterprise technology initiatives and support our technology innovation and growth. The Company s digital business has continued to grow and digital sales as a percent of global systemwide sales increased from approximately 12.8 during the first nine months of 2023 to approximately 17.1 during the first nine months of 2024. 
 
 New Restaurant Development 
 
 Wendy s long-term growth opportunities include expanding the Company s footprint across the globe. To promote new restaurant development, the Company has provided franchisees with certain incentive programs for qualifying new restaurants, in addition to our build to suit development fund. In July and September 2024, Wendy s announced a new development incentive structure in the U.S. and Canada and select international markets, respectively, that provides for reductions in royalty and national advertising fees for qualifying new restaurants for two, three or four years of operation based on the number of restaurants committed to under the development agreement. In addition, the Company has development agreements in place with a number of franchisees that contractually obligate such franchisees to open additional Wendy s restaurants over a specified timeframe. During the nine months ended September 29, 2024, Wendy s added 52 net new restaurants across the system. 
 
 Organizational Redesign 
 
 In February 2023, the Board of Directors approved a plan to redesign the Company s organizational structure to better support the execution of the Company s long-term growth strategy by maximizing organizational efficiency and streamlining decision making (the Organizational Redesign Plan ). As a result of the Organizational Redesign Plan, the Company held its general and administrative expense in 2023 relatively flat compared with 2022. Additionally, in January 2024, the Board of Directors announced the appointment of Kirk Tanner as the Company s new President and Chief Executive Officer, effective February 5, 2024. Mr. Tanner succeeded Todd A. Penegor, the Company s previous President and Chief Executive Officer, who departed from the Company in February 2024. The Company expects to incur total costs of approximately 18 million related to the Organizational Redesign Plan, including costs related to the succession of the President and Chief Executive Officer role. Of the total costs, approximately 15 million will be cash expenditures expected through 2026. Costs related to the Organizational Redesign Plan are recorded to Reorganization and realignment costs. During the nine months ended September 29, 2024, the Company recognized costs totaling 8.3 million, which primarily included severance and related employee costs. The Company expects to incur additional costs aggregating approximately 0.8 million, comprised primarily of share-based compensation. The Company expects costs related to the Organizational Redesign Plan to continue into 2026.

 The decrease in sales during the third quarter and the first nine months of 2024 was primarily due to (1) a 1.6 and 1.3 decrease in global Company-operated same-restaurant sales of 4.1 million and 9.4 million, respectively, and (2) net closures of Company-operated restaurants of 0.3 million and 2.2 million, respectively.

 Franchise royalty revenue during the third quarter of 2024 increased 2.5 million, of which (1) 2.1 million was due to net new restaurant development and (2) 0.7 million was due to a 0.4 increase in global franchise same-restaurant sales. Franchise royalty revenue during the first nine months of 2024 increased 10.3 million, of which (1) 6.1 million was due to net new restaurant development and (2) 3.9 million was due to a 0.8 increase in global franchise same-restaurant sales. Franchise same-restaurant sales during the third quarter and first nine months of 2024 increased due to higher average check, partially offset by a decrease in customer count. 
 
 The increase in franchise fees during the third quarter and the first nine months of 2024 was primarily due to (1) higher fees for providing information technology services to franchisees of 0.5 million and 1.3 million, respectively, and (2) an increase in other miscellaneous franchise fees of 1.5 million and 2.4 million, respectively.

 The increase in franchise rental income during the third quarter and the first nine months of 2024 was primarily due to (1) the impact of amending certain existing leases of 1.3 million and 2.8 million, respectively, (2) the impact of entering into new leases of 0.6 million and 1.6 million, respectively, and (3) an increase in executory costs of 0.3 million and 0.7 million, respectively.

 The increase in advertising funds revenue during the third quarter of 2024 was primarily due to promotional activity of 12.0 million. During the first nine months of 2024, advertising funds revenue also increased due to (1) net new restaurant development of 4.5 million and (2) an increase in franchise same-restaurant sales in the U.S. and Canada of 2.3 million.

 The decrease in cost of sales, as a percent of sales, during the third quarter and the first nine months of 2024 was primarily due to (1) higher average check and (2) labor efficiencies. These impacts were partially offset by (1) an increase in restaurant labor rates and (2) a decrease in customer count.

 On an interim basis, advertising funds expense is recognized in proportion to advertising funds revenue. The Company expects advertising funds expense to be higher than advertising funds revenue by approximately 22.0 million for 2024, which represents the Company s plan to fund incremental breakfast advertising. The increase in advertising funds expense during the third quarter and the first nine months of 2024 was primarily due to (1) the same factors as described above for Advertising Funds Revenue and (2) the recognition of the expected Company breakfast advertising spend in excess of advertising funds revenue of 6.6 million and 14.8 million, respectively. 
 
 General and Administrative Third Quarter Nine Months 2024 2023 Change 2024 2023 Change Employee compensation and benefits 35.2 31.1 4.1 103.4 96.1 7.3 Share-based compensation 6.7 6.4 0.3 17.8 15.7 2.1 Incentive compensation 2.5 5.4 (2.9) 15.0 20.4 (5.4) Professional fees 14.9 13.2 1.7 42.2 42.8 (0.6) Other, net 3.5 3.2 0.3 9.6 9.3 0.3 62.8 59.3 3.5 188.0 184.3 3.7 
 
 The increase in general and administrative expenses during the third quarter of 2024 was primarily due to (1) higher employee compensation and benefits and (2) an increase in professional fees. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in incentive compensation accruals, reflecting lower operating performance as compared to plan in 2024 versus 2023.

 27.9 25.5 2.4 27.3 25.8 1.5 
 
 The effective tax rates for the third quarter and the first nine months of 2024 and 2023 were impacted by variations in income before income taxes, adjusted for recurring items such as non-deductible expenses and state income taxes, as well as non-recurring discrete items. The increase in the effective tax rate for the third quarter of 2024 was primarily due to (1) an increase in the tax effects of our foreign operations, (2) a decrease in the benefit from share-based compensation and (3) an increase in state income taxes, including discrete changes to state deferred income taxes. The increase in the effective tax rate for the first nine months of 2024 was primarily due to (1) an increase in the tax effects of our foreign operations and (2) a decrease in the benefit from share-based compensation. These changes were partially offset by a one-time adjustment to our foreign deferred income taxes related to prior periods. 
 
 Numerous countries have enacted the Organization of Economic Corporation and Development s framework on a global minimum tax (referred to as Pillar 2 ), with the earliest effective date for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2023. While the Company does not expect this enactment will have a material impact on the condensed consolidated financial statements, we will continue to evaluate and monitor as additional guidance and clarification becomes available.

 The increase in Wendy s U.S. revenues during the third quarter and the first nine months of 2024 was primarily due to (1) higher advertising fund revenue and (2) net new franchise restaurant development.

Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 
 Cash Flows 
 
 Our primary sources of liquidity and capital resources are cash flows from operations and borrowings under our securitized financing facility. Our principal uses of cash are operating expenses, capital expenditures, repurchases of common stock and dividends to stockholders. 
 
 Our anticipated cash requirements for the remainder of 2024, exclusive of operating cash flow requirements, consist principally of: 
 
 capital expenditures of approximately 38.0 million to 48.0 million, resulting in total anticipated cash capital expenditures for the year of approximately 90.0 million to 100.0 million; 
 
 cash dividends aggregating approximately 51.0 million as discussed below in Dividends; and 
 
 stock repurchases under the Company s January 2023 Authorization as discussed below in Stock Repurchases. 
 
 Based on current levels of operations, the Company expects that available cash and cash flows from operations will provide sufficient liquidity to meet operating cash requirements for the next 12 months. 
 
 We currently believe we have the ability to pursue additional sources of liquidity if needed or desired to fund operating cash requirements or for other purposes. However, there can be no assurance that additional liquidity will be readily available or available on terms acceptable to us. 
 
 The table below summarizes our cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities for the first nine months of 2024 and 2023: 
 Nine Months 2024 2023 Change Net cash provided by (used in): Operating activities 286.7 269.5 17.2 Investing activities (68.8) (55.5) (13.3) Financing activities (250.6) (373.2) 122.6 Effect of exchange rate changes on cash (1.6) 0.3 (1.9) Net decrease in cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash (34.3) (158.9) 124.6 
 
 38 

Operating Activities 
 
 Cash provided by operating activities consists primarily of net income, adjusted for non-cash expenses such as depreciation and amortization, deferred income tax and share-based compensation, and the net change in operating assets and liabilities. Cash provided by operating activities was 286.7 million and 269.5 million in the first nine months of 2024 and 2023, respectively. The change was primarily due to (1) a decrease in cash paid for cloud computing arrangements and (2) the timing of payments for marketing expenses of the national advertising funds. These changes were partially offset by lower net income, adjusted for non-cash expenses. 
 
 Investing Activities 
 
 Cash used in investing activities was 68.8 million and 55.5 million in the first nine months of 2024 and 2023, respectively. The change was primarily due to an increase in expenditures associated with the Company s franchise development fund of 19.1 million, partially offset by (1) a decrease in capital expenditures of 3.3 million and (2) an increase in proceeds from dispositions of 2.9 million. 
 
 Financing Activities 
 
 Cash used in financing activities was 250.6 million and 373.2 million in the first nine months of 2024 and 2023, respectively. The change was primarily due to (1) a decrease in repurchases of the Company s common stock of 82.4 million and (2) a decrease in repayments of long-term debt of 39.3 million, reflecting the impact of repurchases of the Company s 7 debentures during the first nine months of 2023. 
 
 Long-Term Debt, Including Current Portion 
 
 We may from time to time seek to repurchase portions of our outstanding long-term debt, including our 7 debentures and/or our senior secured notes, through open market purchases, privately negotiated transactions or otherwise. No debt repurchases were made during the nine months ended September 29, 2024. Future repurchases, if any, will depend on prevailing market conditions, our liquidity requirements, contractual restrictions and other factors. Whether or not to repurchase any debt and the size and timing of any such repurchases will be determined at our discretion. 
 
 There were no material changes to the Company s debt obligations since December 31, 2023. The Company was in compliance with its debt covenants as of September 29, 2024. 
 
 Dividends 
 
 On March 15, 2024, June 17, 2024, and September 17, 2024, the Company paid quarterly cash dividends per share of .25, aggregating 153.4 million. On October 31, 2024, the Company announced a dividend of .25 per share to be paid on December 16, 2024 to stockholders of record as of December 2, 2024. As a result, the Company expects that its total cash requirement for the fourth quarter of 2024 will be approximately 51.0 million based on the number of shares of its common stock outstanding at October 24, 2024. The Company currently intends to continue to declare and pay quarterly cash dividends; however, there can be no assurance that any additional quarterly dividends will be declared or paid or of the amount or timing of such dividends, if any. 
 
 Stock Repurchases 
 
 In January 2023, our Board of Directors authorized a repurchase program for up to 500.0 million of our common stock through February 28, 2027, when and if market conditions warrant and to the extent legally permissible (the January 2023 Authorization ). During the nine months ended September 29, 2024, the Company repurchased 3.4 million shares under the January 2023 Authorization with an aggregate purchase price of 59.6 million, of which 0.2 million was accrued as of September 29, 2024, and excluding excise tax and commissions. As of September 29, 2024, the Company had 250.4 million of availability remaining under the January 2023 Authorization. Subsequent to September 29, 2024 through October 24, 2024, the Company repurchased 0.2 million shares under the January 2023 Authorization with an aggregate purchase price of 2.7 million, excluding applicable excise tax and commissions. 
 39 

General Inflation, Commodities and Changing Prices 
 
 Inflationary pressures on labor directly impacted our consolidated results of operations during the nine months ended September 29, 2024, and we expect this to continue throughout the remainder of 2024. We attempt to manage any inflationary costs and commodity price increases through selective menu price increases and product mix. Delays in implementing such menu price increases and competitive pressures may limit our ability to recover such cost increases in the future. Inherent volatility experienced in certain commodity markets, such as those for beef, chicken, pork, cheese and grains, could have a significant effect on our results of operations and may have an adverse effect on us in the future. The extent of any impact will depend on our ability to manage such volatility through product mix and selective menu price increases. 
 
 Seasonality 
 
 Wendy s restaurant operations are moderately seasonal. Wendy s average restaurant sales are normally higher during the summer months than during the winter months. Because our business is moderately seasonal, results for a particular quarter are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be achieved for any other quarter or for the full fiscal year. 

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk. 
 
 As of September 29, 2024 there were no material changes from the information contained in the Company s Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023. 

Item 4. Controls and Procedures. 
 
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 
 The management of the Company, under the supervision and with the participation of the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of its disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) or 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act )) as of September 29, 2024. Based on such evaluations, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that as of September 29, 2024, the disclosure controls and procedures of the Company were effective at a reasonable assurance level in (1) recording, processing, summarizing and reporting, on a timely basis, information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act and (2) ensuring that information required to be disclosed by the Company in such reports is accumulated and communicated to management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 
 
 Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
 
 There were no changes in the internal control over financial reporting of the Company during the third quarter of 2024 that materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, its internal control over financial reporting. 
 
 Inherent Limitations on Effectiveness of Controls 
 
 There are inherent limitations in the effectiveness of any control system, including the potential for human error and the possible circumvention or overriding of controls and procedures. Additionally, judgments in decision-making can be faulty and breakdowns can occur because of a simple error or mistake. An effective control system can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the control objectives of the system are adequately met. Accordingly, the management of the Company, including its Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, does not expect that the control system can prevent or detect all error or fraud. Finally, projections of any evaluation or assessment of effectiveness of a control system to future periods are subject to the risks that, over time, controls may become inadequate because of changes in an entity s operating environment or deterioration in the degree of compliance with policies or procedures.

Risk Factors and Item 7. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and in our other current and periodic filings with the SEC. 
 
 In addition to the factors described above, there are risks associated with our predominantly franchised business model that could impact our results, performance and achievements. Such risks include our ability to identify, attract and retain experienced and qualified franchisees, our ability to effectively manage the transfer of restaurants between and among franchisees, the business and financial health of franchisees, the ability of franchisees to meet their royalty, advertising, development, reimaging and other commitments, participation by franchisees in brand strategies and the fact that franchisees are independent third parties that own, operate and are responsible for overseeing the operations of their restaurants. Our predominantly franchised business model may also impact the ability of the Wendy s system to effectively respond and adapt to market changes. 
 
 All future written and oral forward-looking statements attributable to us or any person acting on our behalf are expressly qualified in their entirety by the cautionary statements contained or referred to above. New risks and uncertainties arise from time to time, and factors that we currently deem immaterial may become material, and it is impossible for us to predict these events or how they may affect us. We assume no obligation to update any forward-looking statements after the date of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q as a result of new information, future events or developments, except as required by federal securities laws, although we may do so from time to time. We do not endorse any projections regarding future performance that may be made by third parties. 

Item 1. Legal Proceedings. 
 
 The Company is involved in litigation and claims incidental to our business. We provide accruals for such litigation and claims when we determine it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the loss is reasonably estimable. The Company believes it has adequate accruals for all of its legal and environmental matters. We cannot estimate the aggregate possible range of loss for our existing litigation and claims due to various reasons, including, but not limited to, many proceedings being in preliminary stages, with various motions either yet to be submitted or pending, discovery yet to occur, and significant factual matters unresolved. In addition, most cases seek an indeterminate amount of damages and many involve multiple parties. Predicting the outcomes of settlement discussions or judicial or arbitral decisions is thus inherently difficult and future developments could cause these actions or claims, individually or in aggregate, to have a material adverse effect on the Company s financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows of a particular reporting period. 
 
 42 

Item 1A. Risk Factors. 
 
 In addition to the information contained in this report, you should carefully consider the risk factors disclosed in our Form 10-K, which could materially affect our business, financial condition or future results. Except as described elsewhere in this report, there have been no material changes from the risk factors previously disclosed in our Form 10-K. 

Item 2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds.
