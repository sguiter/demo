The
inputs for the Black-Scholes valuation model and the Monte Carlo simulation model require management s significant assumptions.
Prior to the Company s initial public offering, the price per share of common stock was determined by the Company s board
based on recent prices of common stock sold in private offerings. Subsequent to the initial public offering, the price per share of common
stock is determined by using the closing market price on the Nasdaq Capital Market on the grant date. The risk-free interest rates are
based on the rate for U.S. Treasury securities at the date of grant with maturity dates approximately equal to the expected life at the
grant date. The expected life is based on the simplified method for the time-based awards and the life of the option for the performance-based
awards, in accordance with the SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin Nos. 107 and 110. The expected volatility is estimated based on historical
volatility information of peer companies that are publicly available in combination with the Company s calculated volatility since
being publicly traded for the time-based awards. For the performance-based awards, the Company s full historical volatility was
used to value the options. 

All
assumptions used to calculate the grant date fair value of non-employee options are generally consistent with the assumptions used for
options granted to employees. In the event the Company terminates any of its consulting agreements, the unvested options issued in connection
with the agreements would also be cancelled.

the 18-month anniversary of the Effective Date, the Company shall have the option to prepay all, but not less than all, of the Term Loans
advanced by the Lenders under the A R Loan Agreement, provided the Company (i) provides written notice to Collateral Agent of its
election to prepay the Term Loans at least seven Business Days prior to such prepayment, and (ii) pays to Lenders on the date of such
prepayment, payable to each Lender in accordance with its respective Pro Rata Share, an amount equal to the sum of (A) all outstanding
principal of the Term Loans plus accrued and unpaid interest thereon through the prepayment date, (B) the Final Fee, (C) the Prepayment
Fee, plus (D) all other outstanding Obligations that are due and payable, including, without limitation, Lenders Expenses and
interest at the Default Rate with respect to any past due amounts. At May 30, 2024, the Company recognized the Final Fee of million
as additional debt principal and a corresponding debt discount to be amortized over the life of the loan. 

In
connection with the funding of each of the Term C Loan, the Term D Loan, the Term E Loan and the Term F Loan, the Company agreed to issue
to Innovatus and Oxford warrants to purchase that number of shares of the Company s common stock equal to of the principal
amount of the applicable Term Loan divided by the exercise price, which shall, with respect to the Term C Loan, be equal to the lower
of (i) the volume weighted average closing price of the Company s common stock for the five-trading day period ending on the last
trading day immediately preceding the execution of the A R Loan Agreement or (ii) the closing price on the last trading day immediately
preceding the execution of the A R Loan Agreement. Accordingly, on May 30, 2024, the Company issued warrants with an exercise
price of per share. The relative fair value of the warrants was approximately million. For the additional Term Loans, the
exercise price will be based on the lower of (i) the exercise price for the Warrants issued pursuant to the Term C Loan or (ii) the volume
weighted average closing price of the Company s common stock for the five-trading day period ending on the last trading day immediately
preceding the applicable Term Loan funding. The Warrants may be exercised on a cashless basis and are exercisable through the tenth anniversary
of the applicable funding date. The number of shares of common stock for which each Warrant is exercisable and the associated exercise
price are subject to certain proportional adjustments as set forth in such Warrant. 

The
Company evaluated the change of terms under ASC 470-50, Debt Modification and Extinguishment , and concluded the
change in terms did not result in significant and consequential changes to the economic substance of the debt and thus resulted in a
modification of the debt and not an extinguishment of the debt.

Overview

Celcuity
is a clinical-stage biotechnology company focused on the development of targeted therapies for treatment of multiple solid tumor indications.
The Company s lead therapeutic candidate is gedatolisib, a pan-PI3K/mTOR inhibitor. Its mechanism of action and pharmacokinetic
properties are highly differentiated from other currently approved and investigational therapies that target PI3K or mTOR alone or together.
In 2022, the Company began enrolling patients in VIKTORIA-1, a Phase 3 study evaluating gedatolisib and fulvestrant with and without
Ibrance (palbociclib) as second line treatment for patients with HR+, HER2- advanced breast cancer. In early 2024, the Company began
enrolling patients in CELC-G-201, a Phase 1b/2 study evaluating gedatolisib combined with Nubeqa (darolutamide) in patients with
metastatic castration resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC). In May 2024, the Company announced plans to initiate VIKTORIA-2, a Phase 3 trial
evaluating gedatolisib combined with fulvestrant plus a CDK 4/6 inhibitor as first-line treatment for patients with HR+, HER2- advanced
breast cancer. The first patient is expected to be enrolled in the second quarter of 2025. The Company s CELsignia companion diagnostic
platform is uniquely able to analyze live patient tumor cells to identify new groups of cancer patients likely to benefit from already
approved targeted therapies. 

Gedatolisib
is a potent, well-tolerated, reversible, ATP-competitive, pan-PI3K/mTOR inhibitor that selectively targets all Class I isoforms of PI3K
and mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR). In April 2021, we obtained exclusive global development and commercialization rights to gedatolisib
under a license agreement with Pfizer, Inc. We believe gedatolisib s unique mechanism of action, differentiated chemical structure,
favorable pharmacokinetic properties, and intravenous formulation offer distinct advantages over currently approved and investigational
therapies that target PI3K or mTOR alone or together. 

Overcomes
 limitations of therapies that only inhibit a single Class I PI3K isoform or only one mTOR kinase complex. 

Gedatolisib
 is a pan-class I isoform PI3K inhibitor with low nanomolar potency for the p110 , p110 , p110 , and p110 
 isoforms and mTORC1 and mTORC2 complexes. Each PI3K isoform and mTOR complex is known to preferentially affect different signal transduction
 events that involve tumor cell survival, depending upon the aberrations associated with the linked pathway. When a therapy only inhibits
 a single Class I isoform (e.g., alpelisib, a PI3K- inhibitor) or only one mTOR kinase complex (e.g., everolimus, an mTORC1
 inhibitor), numerous feedforward and feedback loops between the PI3K isoforms and mTOR complexes cross-activate the uninhibited sub-units.
 This, in turn, induces compensatory resistance that can reduce the efficacy of isoform specific PI3K or single mTOR kinase complex
 inhibitors. Inhibiting all four PI3K isoforms and both mTOR complexes, as gedatolisib does, thus prevents the confounding effect
 of isoform interaction that may occur with isoform-specific PI3K inhibitors and the confounding interaction between PI3K isoforms
 and mTOR. 

Better
 tolerated by patients than oral PI3K and mTOR drugs. 

Gedatolisib
 is administered intravenously (IV) on a four-week cycle of three weeks-on, one week-off, in contrast to the orally administered pan-PI3K
 or dual PI3K/mTOR inhibitors that are no longer being clinically developed. Oral pan-PI3K or PI3K/mTOR inhibitors have repeatably
 been found to induce significant side effects that were not well tolerated by patients. This typically leads to a high proportion
 of patients requiring dose reductions or treatment discontinuation. The challenging toxicity profile of these drug candidates ultimately
 played a significant role in the decisions to halt their development, despite showing promising efficacy. By contrast, gedatolisib
 stabilizes at lower concentration levels in plasma compared to orally administered PI3K inhibitors, resulting in less toxicity, while
 maintaining concentrations sufficient to inhibit PI3K/mTOR signaling. 

Isoform-specific
 PI3K inhibitors administered orally were developed to reduce toxicities in patients. While the range of toxicities associated with
 isoform-specific inhibitors is narrower than oral pan-PI3K or PI3K/mTOR inhibitors, administering them orally on a continuous basis
 still leads to challenging toxicities. The experience with an FDA approved oral p110- specific inhibitor, Piqray, illustrates
 the challenge. In its Phase 3 pivotal trial Piqray was found to induce a Grade 3 or 4 adverse event AE related to hyperglycemia
 in 39 of patients evaluated. In addition, 26 of patients discontinued alpelisib due to treatment related AEs. By contrast,
 in the 103-patient dose expansion portion of the Phase 1b clinical trial with gedatolisib, only 7 of patients experienced Grade
 3 or 4 hyperglycemia and less than 9 discontinued treatment. 

17 

As
of September 30, 2024, 492 patients with solid tumors have received gedatolisib in eight completed clinical trials. Of the 492 patients,
129 were treated with gedatolisib as a single agent in three clinical trials. The remaining 363 patients received gedatolisib in combination
with other anti-cancer agents in five clinical trials. Additional patients received gedatolisib in combination with other anti-cancer
agents in nine investigator sponsored clinical trials. 

A
Phase 1b trial (B2151009) evaluating patients with HR+/HER2- metastatic breast cancer was initiated in 2016 and subsequently enrolled
138 patients. Four patients from this study continue to receive study treatment, as of September 30, 2024, each of whom have received
study treatment for more than five years. The B2151009 clinical was an open label, multiple arm Phase 1b study that evaluated gedatolisib
in combination with palbociclib (CDK4/6 inhibitor) and fulvestrant or letrozole in patients with HR+/HER2- advanced breast cancer. Thirty-five
patients were enrolled in two dose escalation arms to evaluate the safety and tolerability and to determine the maximum tolerated dose MTD of gedatolisib when used in combination with the standard doses of palbociclib and endocrine therapy (letrozole or
fulvestrant). The MTD was determined to be 180 mg administered intravenously once weekly. A total of 103 patients were subsequently enrolled
in one of four expansion arms (A, B, C, D). 

High
objective overall response rates ORR were observed in all four expansion arms and were comparable in each arm for PIK3CA
wild-type WT and PIK3CA mutant MT patients. As of the data cut-off date, March 16, 2023, for treatment- na ve patients in Escalation Arm A and Expansion
Arm A (n=41), median progression free survival (mPFS) was 48.6 months, median duration of response (mDOR) was 46.9 months, and ORR was
79 , respectively. This data compares favorably to published data for current first-line standard-of-care treatments for patients with
HR+, HER2- advanced breast cancer. In patients who received prior hormonal therapy alone or in combination with a CDK4/6 inhibitor (Arms
B, C, and D), ORR (including unconfirmed partial responses) ranged from 36 to 77 . Each arm achieved its primary endpoint target, which
was reporting higher ORR in the study arm than ORR from either the PALOMA-2 (ORR=55 study that evaluated palbociclib plus letrozole
for Arm A or the PALOMA-3 study (ORR=25 that evaluated palbociclib plus fulvestrant for Arms B, C, and D. For all enrolled patients,
a clinical benefit rate (CBR) of 79 was observed. Median progression free survival was 12.9 months for patients who received
a prior CDK4/6 inhibitor and were treated in the study with the Phase 3 dosing schedule (Arm D). 

Gedatolisib
combined with palbociclib and endocrine therapy demonstrated a favorable safety profile with manageable toxicity. The majority of treatment
emergent AEs were Grade 1 and 2. The most frequently observed AEs included stomatitis/mucosal inflammation, the
majority of which were Grade 1 and 2. The most common Grade 4 AEs were neutropenia and neutrophil count decrease, which were assessed
as related to treatment with palbociclib. No grade 5 AEs were reported in this study. 

We
are currently enrolling patients in a Phase 3, open-label, randomized clinical trial (VIKTORIA-1) to evaluate the efficacy and safety
of two regimens in adults with HR+/HER2- advanced breast cancer whose disease has progressed after prior CDK4/6 therapy in combination
with an aromatase inhibitor: 1) gedatolisib in combination with palbociclib and fulvestrant; and 2) gedatolisib in combination with fulvestrant.
Approximately two hundred clinical sites in North America, Europe, South America, Asia, and Australia have been selected to participate
in the study. The first clinical site was activated in the third quarter of 2022, and the first patient was dosed in December 2022. 

The
VIKTORIA-1 clinical trial will enable separate evaluation of subjects according to their PIK3CA status. Subjects who meet
eligibility criteria and are PIK3CA WT will be randomly assigned (1:1:1) to receive a regimen of either gedatolisib, palbociclib,
and fulvestrant (Arm A), gedatolisib and fulvestrant (Arm B), or fulvestrant (Arm C). Subjects who meet eligibility criteria and are
PIK3CA MT will be randomly assigned (3:3:1) to receive a regimen of either gedatolisib, palbociclib, and fulvestrant (Arm D) or
alpelisib and fulvestrant (Arm E), or gedatolisib and fulvestrant (Arm F). Enrollment of the PIK3CA WT cohort is 100 enrolled and
enrollment in the PIK3CA MT cohort is on plan. The PIK3CA WT cohort represents approximately 60 of the total patients enrolled to
date in VIKTORIA-1. Based on our current forecast of reaching the event thresholds that will trigger primary analysis in both the
PIKCA WT and MT cohorts, we expect to report topline data for the PIK3CA WT cohort sometime in late Q1 2025 or during Q2 2025
and to report topline data for the PIK3CA MT cohort in the second half of 2025. If the results from the PIK3CA wild-type patient cohort are positive, we would expect to file a new drug application, or NDA, with this
data and follow-up with a supplemental NDA for the PIK3CA mutant cohort if those results are positive. If gedatolisib ultimately does
receive FDA approval for both the PIK3CA wild-type and mutant populations, we estimate the peak revenue potential for this second-line
indication could exceed 2 billion.

We
received approval from the FDA in mid-2023 to proceed with the clinical development of gedatolisib in combination with Nubeqa (darolutamide),
an approved androgen receptor inhibitor, for the treatment of patients with mCRPC. We have since initiated a Phase 1b/2 study (CELC-G-201)
that will enroll up to 54 participants with mCRPC who progressed after treatment with an androgen receptor inhibitor. We dosed our first
patient in this trial in February 2024. 

In
the Phase 1b portion of the study, Celcuity expects that 36 participants will be randomly assigned to receive 600 mg darolutamide combined
with either 120 mg gedatolisib in Arm 1 or 180 mg gedatolisib in Arm 2. An additional 12 participants will then be enrolled in the Phase
2 portion of the study at the recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) level to enable evaluation of 30 participants treated with the RP2D of
gedatolisib. 

The
primary objectives of the Phase 1b portion of the trial include assessment of the safety and tolerability of gedatolisib in combination
with darolutamide and determination of the recommended Phase 2 dose of gedatolisib. The primary objective of the Phase 2 portion of the
trial is to assess the radiographic progression-free survival (rPFS) at six months of patients who received the RP2D. We expect to report preliminary data in Q2 of 2025. 

The
Phase 3 VIKTORIA-2 clinical trial, an open-label, randomized study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of gedatolisib combined with
fulvestrant plus a CDK4/6 inhibitor in comparison to fulvestrant plus a CDK4/6 inhibitor as first-line treatment for patients with
HR+/HER2- advanced breast cancer who are endocrine therapy resistant is on track to enroll its first Patient in Q2 2025. For the
CDK4/6 inhibitor, investigators may choose either ribociclib or palbociclib. The safety profile of gedatolisib combined with
fulvestrant and palbociclib is well described, but the investigational combination of gedatolisib with ribociclib has not yet been
clinically tested. Therefore, a safety run-in of approximately 12-36 subjects will evaluate the safety profile of gedatolisib
combined with ribociclib and fulvestrant. The safety run-in will be completed, and gedatolisib s Phase 3 dose confirmed,
before enrolling patients in the Phase 3 portion of the study. 

For
the Phase 3 study, approximately 638 subjects who meet the eligibility criteria will be assigned to a cohort based on their PIK3CA mutation
status. After the investigator selects the CDK4/6 inhibitor for a subject, the subject will then be randomly assigned on a 1:1 basis
to either Arm A (gedatolisib, fulvestrant, and Investigator s choice of ribociclib or palbociclib) or Arm B (fulvestrant and Investigator s
choice of ribociclib or palbociclib). 

The
clinical trial primary endpoints are progression free survival (PFS), per RECIST 1.1 criteria, as assessed by blinded independent central
review. The primary PFS endpoints will be evaluated separately in subjects who are PI3KCA WT and PI3KCA MT. 

The
study s design was reviewed and discussed with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) during a Type C meeting. This global
trial is expected to enroll subjects at up to 200 clinical sites across North America, Europe, Latin America, and Asia. Site qualification activities to support activation for the 200 sites is on track. 

Recent
Developments 

Enrollment in our VIKTORIA-1 study remains robust and on-track. The PIK3CA WT cohort is 100 enrolled, and enrollment
in the PIK3CA MT cohort is on plan. Based on our current forecast of reaching the event thresholds that will trigger primary analysis
in both the PIK3CA WT and MT cohorts, we expect to report topline data for the PIK3CA WT cohort sometime in late Q1 2025 or during Q2
2025 and to report topline data for the PIK3CA MT cohort in the second half of 2025. 

The Phase 1b/2 clinical trial, evaluating gedatolisib in combination with darolutamide for the treatment of patients
with metastatic castration resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC), is ongoing and expected to report preliminary data in Q2 2025 

The VIKTORIA-2 Phase 3 clinical trial remains on track to enroll its first patient in Q2 2025. Site qualification
activities to support activation of up to 200 sites across North America, Europe, Latin America, and Asia are on track. 

Overall
survival data from the B2151009 Phase 1b clinical trial will be presented at the San Antonio Breast Cancer Symposium (SABCS), taking
place December 10-13, 2024. 

Additional
nonclinical data further characterizing the mechanism of action of gedatolisib and its effect on breast cancer cell metabolic functions
will also be presented at the SABCS. 

In
October, Cancers published results of nonclinical studies in gynecological cancer cell line models highlighting the differences between
single-node inhibitors of the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway and gedatolisib. The published manuscript is available online and on the publications
section of Celcuity s website . 

Results
of Operations 

We
have not generated any revenue from sales to date, and we continue to incur significant research and development and other expenses related
to our ongoing operations. As a result, we are not and have never been profitable and have incurred losses in each period since our inception
in 2012. For the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, we reported a net loss of approximately 29.8 million and 18.4 million,
respectively, and for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we reported a net loss of approximately 75.1 million and 44.9 million,
respectively. As of September 30, 2024, we had an accumulated deficit of approximately 235.2 million. As of September 30, 2024,
we had cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments of approximately 264.1 million.

Components
of Operating Results 

Revenue

To
date, we have not generated any revenue. With the execution of the Pfizer license agreement in April 2021, whereby we acquired exclusive
world-wide licensing rights to develop and commercialize gedatolisib, we initiated a Phase 3 clinical trial, VIKTORIA-1, in 2022 to support
potential regulatory approval to market gedatolisib as a second line treatment for HR+, HER2- advanced breast cancer. In August 2023,
we announced plans to proceed with the clinical development of gedatolisib in combination with Nubeqa (darolutamide), an approved
androgen receptor inhibitor, for the treatment of patients with mCRPC. In May 2024, we announced plans to initiate a Phase 3 clinical
trial, VIKTORIA-2, to evaluate gedatolisib plus a CDK4/6 inhibitor and fulvestrant as a first-line treatment for patients with HR+, HER2-,
advanced breast cancer who are endocrine therapy resistant. If we obtain regulatory approvals to market gedatolisib, we expect to initially
generate revenue from sales of the drug for the treatment of breast cancer patients. 

Research
and Development 

Since
our inception, we have primarily focused on research and development of gedatolisib, a PI3K/mTOR targeted therapy and our CELsignia platform
and corresponding tests. Research and development expenses primarily include: 

employee-related
 expenses related to our research and development activities, including salaries, benefits, recruiting, travel and stock-based compensation
 expenses; 

laboratory
 supplies; 

consulting
 fees paid to third parties; 

clinical
 trial costs; 

validation
 costs for gedatolisib; 

facilities
 expenses; and 

legal
 costs associated with patent applications. 

Internal
and external research and development costs are expensed as they are incurred. As we continue development of gedatolisib and manage
studies and clinical trials, including the VIKTORIA-1 Phase 3 clinical trial, the CELC-G-201 Phase 1b/2 clinical trial, and the
VIKTORIA-2 Phase 3 clinical trial and other clinical trials to evaluate the efficacy of targeted therapies in cancer patients
selected with one of our CELsignia tests, the proportion of research and development expenses allocated to external spending will
grow at a faster rate than expenses allocated to internal expenses. 

General
and Administrative 

General
and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries, benefits and stock-based compensation related to our executive, finance and
support functions. Other general and administrative expenses include professional fees for auditing, tax, and legal services associated
with being a public company, director and officer insurance, investor relations and travel expenses for our general and administrative
personnel. 

Sales
and Marketing 

Sales
and marketing expenses consist primarily of professional and consulting fees related to these functions. To date, we have incurred
immaterial sales and marketing expenses as we continue to focus primarily on the development of our first drug, gedatolisib,
managing the VIKTORIA-1 Phase 3 clinical trial, the CELC-G-201 Phase 1b/2 clinical trial, and the VIKTORIA-2 Phase 3 clinical trial.
We would expect to begin to incur increased sales and marketing expenses in anticipation of the commercialization of our first drug,
gedatolisib. These increased expenses are expected to include employee-related, consulting costs and professional fees.

Research
and Development 

Our
research and development expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2024 were approximately 27.6 million, representing an
increase of approximately 10.1 million, or 58 , compared to the same period in 2023. Of the 10.1 million increase in research and
development expense, 6.3 million was primarily related to costs supporting on-going activities for the VIKTORIA-1 and CELC-G-201
trials and the initiation of the VIKTORIA-2 Phase 3 pivotal trial. The remaining 3.8 million was related to increased employee and
consulting expenses. 

Our
research and development expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 were approximately 70.7 million, representing an
increase of approximately 28.2 million, or 66 , compared to the same period in 2023. Of the 28.2 million increase in research and
development expenses, 20.8 was primarily related to costs supporting on-going activities for the VIKTORIA-1 and CELC-G-201 trials
and activities supporting the initiation of the VIKTORIA-2 Phase 3 pivotal trial. The remaining 7.4 million was related to
increased employee and consulting expenses. 

Conducting
a significant amount of research and development is central to our business model. We plan to increase our research and development expenses
for the foreseeable future as we seek to develop gedatolisib and manage the VIKTORIA-1 Phase 3, the CELC-G-201 Phase 1b/2 and the VIKTORIA-2
Phase 3 pivotal trial. 

General
and Administrative 

Our
general and administrative expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2024 were approximately 2.5 million, representing an increase
of approximately 1.1 million, or 75 , compared to the same period in 2023. Of the 1.1 million increase in general and administrative
expense, 0.9 million was related to increased employee and consulting expenses. The remaining 0.2 million of the 1.1 million increase
resulted from professional fees and other administrative expenses. 

Our
general and administrative expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 were approximately 6.1 million, representing an increase
of approximately 2.1 million, or 53 , compared to the same period in 2023. Employee related expenses accounted for 1.5 million of the
 2.1 million increase. The remaining 0.6 million of the increase resulted from professional fees and other administrative expenses. 

We
anticipate that our general and administrative expenses will increase in future periods, reflecting both increased costs in connection
with the potential future commercialization of gedatolisib, an expanding infrastructure, and increased professional fees associated with
public company regulatory developments and other compliance matters.

Interest
Expense 

Interest
expense for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was 3.3 million and represents an increase of 2.0 million, or 144 , compared
to the same period in 2023. Interest expense is the result of a Loan Agreement that was executed in April 2021, amended in August 2022
and March 2024, and further amended and restated in May 2024. The increase is due primarily to the incremental 61.7 million funding
of Term Loan C in May 2024. The 3.3 million of interest expense includes 0.7 million of non-cash interest expense. 

Interest
expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 7.0 million and represents an increase of 3.1 million, or 78 , compared to
the same period in 2023. The increase is due primarily to the incremental 61.7 million funding of Term Loan C in May 2024. The 7.0
million of interest expense includes 1.9 million of non-cash interest expense. 

Interest
Income 

Interest
income for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was 3.6 million and represents an increase of 1.7 million compared to the same
period in 2023. The increase was primarily from the closing of additional equity and debt financing activities in May 2024, leading to
higher cash, cash equivalents and short-term investment balances. 

Interest
income for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 8.7 million and represents an increase of 3.2 million compared to the same
period in 2023. The increase was primarily from the closing of additional equity and debt financing activities in May 2024, leading to
higher cash, cash equivalents and short-term investment balances. 

Liquidity

our inception, we have incurred losses and cumulative negative cash flows from operations. Through September 30, 2024, we have funded
our operations primarily through private placements and registered offerings of our equity securities and unsecured convertible notes,
and borrowings under loan agreements. From inception through September 30, 2024, we raised an aggregate of approximately 368.7 million
of net proceeds through sales of our securities, and as of September 30, 2024 had 100.0 million of borrowings under loan agreements,
not including payable-in-kind interest. As of September 30, 2024, our cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments were approximately

pursuant to the Open Market Sale Agreement with Jefferies LLC, as agent, the Company sold 285,714 and 149,700 shares of common stock,
respectively, at an average selling price of 17.55 per share, generating gross proceeds of 7.6 million before deducting commissions

Jefferies agreement. 

Equity
Offering : On May 30, 2024, the Company entered into an underwriting agreement with Leerink Partners LLC, TD Securities (USA) LLC
and Stifel, Nicolaus Company, Incorporated as representatives of the several underwriters relating to the issuance and sale of
3,871,000 shares of common stock, at a price to the public of 15.50, generating gross proceeds of approximately 60.0 million. The offering
closed on May 31, 2024 and resulted in net proceeds to the Company of approximately 56.3 million after deducting underwriting discounts
and other offering expenses payable by the Company. The Company intends to use the net proceeds from the offering for working capital
and general corporate purposes, which may include research and development expenditures, clinical trial expenditures, expansion of business
development activities and other general corporate purposes.

Loan
Agreement. On May 30, 2024, the Company entered into an Amended and Restated Loan and Security Agreement (the A R Loan
Agreement with Innovatus Life Sciences Lending Fund I, LP, a Delaware limited partnership Innovatus ), as collateral
agent, and the Lenders including Innovatus in its capacity as a Lender and Oxford Finance LLC Oxford ), pursuant to which
Innovatus and Oxford, as Lenders, have agreed to make certain term loans Term Loans to the Company in the aggregate principal
amount of up to 180 million. The A R Loan Agreement amends and restates, in its entirety, that certain Loan and Security Agreement,
dated April 8, 2021, as amended, between the Company and Innovatus, as collateral agent, and the Lenders named therein. 

Funding
of the first 100 million under the A R Loan Agreement occurred on May 30, 2024, including tranche payments of 16.8 million (the
 Term A Loan and 21.5 million (the Term B Loan reflecting repayment of the principal amount of loans under
the Prior Loan Agreement plus accrued payment-in-kind interest, in addition to 61.7 million of new borrowings (the Term C Loan ).
The Company will be eligible to draw on a fourth tranche of 30 million (the Term D Loan and fifth tranche of 50 million
(the Term E Loan ), in each case upon achievement of certain clinical trial milestones and satisfaction of certain financial
covenants determined on a pro forma as-funded basis. The Lenders may, in their sole discretion upon the Company s request, make
additional term loans to the Company of 45 million (the Term F Loan ). Funding of these additional tranches is also subject
to other customary conditions and limits on when the Company can request funding for such tranches. Costs associated with the new borrowings
was approximately 2.4 million. 

The
Company is entitled to make interest-only payments for thirty-six months, or up to forty-eight months if certain conditions are met.
The Term Loans will mature on May 1, 2029 and will bear interest at a rate equal to the sum of (a) the greater of (i) the Prime Rate
(as defined in the A R Loan Agreement) or (ii) 7.75 , plus (b) 2.85 , provided that 1.0 of such interest will be payable in-kind
by adding an amount equal to such 1.0 of the outstanding principal amount to the then outstanding principal balance on a monthly basis
through May 31, 2027. The A R Loan Agreement is secured by all assets of the Company. Proceeds will be used for working capital purposes
and to fund the Company s general business requirements, including the Phase 3 VIKTORIA-2 clinical trial. The A R Loan Agreement
contains customary representations and warranties and covenants, subject to customary carve-outs, and includes financial covenants related
to liquidity and other financial measures. Innovatus has the right, at its election and until August 9, 2025, to convert up to 20 of
the outstanding principal of the Term A Loan into shares of the Company s common stock at a price per share of 10.00 (the Conversion
Right ). Innovatus will continue to have the right to exercise a previously disclosed warrant granted to it under the Prior Loan
Agreement to purchase 26,042 shares of common stock at a price per share of 14.40 through April 8, 2031. 

The
A R Loan Agreement contains a Final Fee, which is equal to 4.5 of the initial funding of the agreement and is due on the earliest
to occur of (a) the Maturity Date, (b) the acceleration of any Term Loan, and (c) the prepayment of the Term Loans. There is also a contingent
non-utilization fee for both the Term D and Term E loans. If the Company achieves the Term D Milestone and (i) fails to draw the full
amount of the Term D Loan during the Term D Draw Period and (ii) fails to notify Collateral Agent, at any time before the date that is
four weeks after the Company s achievement of the Term D Milestone, of the Company s intent not to draw the full amount of
the Term D Loan, a non-utilization fee of 900,000, with respect to the Term D Loan shall become due and payable on the earliest of (i)
the termination of the Term D Draw Period, (ii) the Maturity Date, (iii) the acceleration of any Term Loan, and (iv) the prepayment in
whole of the Term Loans. If the Company achieves the Term E Milestone and (i) fails to draw the full amount of the Term E Loan during
the Term E Draw Period and (ii) fails to notify Collateral Agent, at any time before the date that is four weeks after the Company s
achievement of the Term E Milestone, of the Company s intent not to draw the full amount of the Term E Loan, a non-utilization
fee of 1,500,000, with respect to the Term E Loan shall become due and payable on the earliest of (i) the termination of the Term E
Draw Period, (ii) the Maturity Date, (iii) the acceleration of any Term Loan, and (iv) the prepayment in whole of the Term Loans. After
the 18-month anniversary of the Effective Date, the Company shall have the option to prepay all, but not less than all, of the Term Loans
advanced by the Lenders under the A R Loan Agreement, provided the Company (i) provides written notice to Collateral Agent of its
election to prepay the Term Loans at least seven Business Days prior to such prepayment, and (ii) pays to Lenders on the date of such
prepayment, payable to each Lender in accordance with its respective Pro Rata Share, an amount equal to the sum of (A) all outstanding
principal of the Term Loans plus accrued and unpaid interest thereon through the prepayment date, (B) the Final Fee, (C) the Prepayment
Fee, plus (D) all other outstanding Obligations that are due and payable, including, without limitation, Lenders Expenses and
interest at the Default Rate with respect to any past due amounts. At May 30, 2024, the Company recognized the Final Fee of 4.5 million
as additional debt principal and a corresponding debt discount to be amortized over the life of the loan. 

24 

In
connection with the funding of each of the Term C Loan, the Term D Loan, the Term E Loan and the Term F Loan, the Company agreed to issue
to Innovatus and Oxford warrants to purchase that number of shares of the Company s common stock equal to 2.5 of the principal
amount of the applicable Term Loan divided by the exercise price, which shall, with respect to the Term C Loan, be equal to the lower
of (i) the volume weighted average closing price of the Company s common stock for the five-trading day period ending on the last
trading day immediately preceding the execution of the A R Loan Agreement or (ii) the closing price on the last trading day immediately
preceding the execution of the A R Loan Agreement. Accordingly, on May 30, 2024, the Company issued 103,876 warrants with an exercise
price of 14.84 per share. The relative fair value of the warrants was approximately 1.2 million. For the additional Term Loans, the
exercise price will be based on the lower of (i) the exercise price for the Warrants issued pursuant to the Term C Loan or (ii) the volume
weighted average closing price of the Company s common stock for the five-trading day period ending on the last trading day immediately
preceding the applicable Term Loan funding. The Warrants may be exercised on a cashless basis and are exercisable through the tenth anniversary
of the applicable funding date. The number of shares of common stock for which each Warrant is exercisable and the associated exercise
price are subject to certain proportional adjustments as set forth in such Warrant. 

We
expect that our research and development and general and administrative expenses will increase as we continue to develop
gedatolisib, manage the VIKTORIA-1 Phase 3 clinical trial, the CELC-G-201 Phase 1b/2 trial and the VIKTORIA-2 Phase 3 pivotal
trial, conduct other studies and clinical trials, and pursue other business development activities. We would also expect to incur
sales and marketing expenses as we commercialize gedatolisib. We expect to use cash on hand, together with the funds to be received
under the debt and equity financings described above, to fund our research and development expenses, clinical trial costs, capital
expenditures, working capital, sales and marketing expenses, and general corporate expenses. 

Based
on our current business plan, we believe that our current cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments together with available borrowings
under the Innovatus Loan Agreement will provide sufficient cash to finance our operations and pay obligations when due through 2026. 

Our
expectations as to how long our current capital resources will be sufficient to fund our operations are based on assumptions that may
not be accurate, and we could use our current capital resources sooner than we currently expect. In addition, we may seek to raise additional
capital to finance capital expenditures and operating expenses over the next several years as we launch our integrated therapeutic and
companion diagnostic strategy and expand our infrastructure, commercial operations and research and development activities, and to take
advantage of financing or other opportunities that we believe to be in the best interests of the Company and our stockholders. Additional
capital may be raised through the sale of common or preferred equity or convertible debt securities, entry into debt facilities or other
third-party funding arrangements. The sale of equity and convertible debt securities may result in dilution to our stockholders and those
securities may have rights senior to those of our common shares. Agreements entered into in connection with such capital raising activities
could contain covenants that would restrict our operations or require us to relinquish certain rights. Additional capital may not be
available on reasonable terms, or not at all.

Recent
Accounting Pronouncements 

From
time-to-time new accounting pronouncements are issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board or other standard setting bodies and
adopted by us as of the specified effective date. Unless otherwise discussed in Note 2 to our unaudited condensed financial statements
included in Item 1 of Part I of this Quarterly Report, we believe that the impact of recently issued standards that are not yet effective
will not have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations upon adoption. 

Critical
Accounting Policies and Use of Estimates 

Our
management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based on our unaudited condensed financial
statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make
estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities
at the date of the financial statements, as well as the reported expenses during the reporting periods. These items are monitored and
analyzed by us for changes in facts and circumstances, and material changes in these estimates could occur in the future. We base our
estimates on historical experience and on various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of
which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other
sources. Changes in estimates are reflected in reported results for the period in which they become known. Actual results may differ
materially from these estimates. 

Our
significant accounting policies are more fully described in Note 2 to our unaudited condensed financial statements included in Item 1
of Part I of this Quarterly Report.
