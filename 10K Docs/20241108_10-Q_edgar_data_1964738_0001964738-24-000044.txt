and , respectively. The prior period s lower effective tax rate is primarily due to the tax benefit recognized as a result of the expiration of the statute of limitations on uncertain tax positions. 
 
 The effective tax rates for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 were and , respectively. The prior period s lower effective tax rate is primarily due to the tax benefit recognized as a result of the expiration of the statute of limitations on uncertain tax positions. 
 
 In 2021, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development OECD announced Pillar Two Model Rules which call for the taxation of large multinational corporations at a global minimum tax rate of 15 . Many non-U.S. tax jurisdictions, including Ireland, have either recently enacted legislation to adopt certain components of the Pillar Two Model Rules beginning in fiscal year 2024 or announced their plans to enact legislation in future years. The Company s income tax provision for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, reflects currently enacted legislation and guidance related to the OECD model rules. 
 
 The Company s income tax provision or benefit for the interim periods is determined based on an estimated annual effective tax rate, adjusted for discrete items. Because significant foreign earnings are generated by the Company s subsidiaries organized in jurisdictions with lower statutory tax rates, the Company s estimated annual effective tax rate may be materially impacted if earnings in these lower-tax jurisdictions fluctuate. 
 
 The Company recognizes deferred tax assets to the extent that it believes these assets are more likely than not to be realized based on evaluation of all available positive and negative evidence. On the basis of this evaluation, the Company continues to maintain a valuation allowance to reduce its deferred tax assets to the amount realizable. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, valuation allowances were million and million, respectively. The decrease is primarily due to separation-related adjustments in connection with the Spin-Off on April 1, 2024, which is reflected in the condensed consolidated and combined statements of changes in equity.

 series of senior notes with a combined aggregate principal amount of billion: billion aggregate principal amount of senior notes due 2027, billion aggregate principal amount of senior notes due 2029, billion aggregate principal amount of senior notes due 2031, billion aggregate principal amount of senior notes due 2034, aggregate principal amount of senior notes due 2054, and billion aggregate principal amount of senior notes due 2064 (collectively, the Senior Notes ). Interest payments on the Senior Notes are due semi-annually until maturity, with the first payment due in August 2024. The Company recorded million of debt issuance costs related to the Senior Notes. Debt issuance costs are presented as a reduction of debt in the condensed consolidated and combined balance sheets and are amortized as a component of interest expense over the term of the related debt using the effective interest method. 
 In connection with the issuance of the senior notes, the Company entered into a registration rights agreement with the initial purchasers, pursuant to which the Company is obligated to use commercially reasonable efforts to file with the SEC and cause to become effective a registration statement with respect to an offer to exchange each series of Senior Notes for registered notes with terms that are substantially identical in all material respects to the notes of such series. 
 The Senior Notes were offered as part of the financing for the Spin-Off. In connection with the consummation of the Spin-Off, Solventum made direct and indirect cash payments to 3M as partial consideration for 3M s transfer of its health care business to Solventum. All of the net proceeds from the offering of the notes were paid to 3M, other than amounts retained in order to achieve the million retained cash target. 
 The Senior Notes are governed by an indenture and supplemental indenture between the Company and a trustee (collectively, the Indenture ). The Indenture contains certain customary affirmative and negative covenants, including restrictions on the Company s ability to consolidate, merge, convey, transfer or lease substantially all of its assets. In addition, the Indenture contains other customary terms, including certain events of default, upon the occurrence of which, the Senior Notes may be declared immediately due and payable. 
 Credit Facilities 
 On February 16, 2024, the Company entered into credit agreements providing for: 
 a senior unsecured revolving credit facility in an aggregate committed amount of billion expiring in 2029 (the Revolving Credit Facility and 
 an senior unsecured term loan credit facility in an aggregate principal amount of million and a senior unsecured term credit loan facility in an aggregate principal amount of billion (together, the Term Loan Credit Facilities , and together with the Revolving Credit Facility, the Credit Facilities ). 
 The Company intends to use the Credit Facilities for general corporate purposes. At September 30, 2024, there are amounts outstanding under the Revolving Credit Facility. On March 7, 2024, the Company drew on the Term Loan Credit Facilities in the amount of billion. These Term Loan Credit Facilities have a floating interest rate based on a Secured Overnight Financing Rate SOFR index. 
 In August 2024, the Company repaid million of the aggregate principal amount outstanding under the senior unsecured term loan credit facility. 
 Commercial Paper 
 On March 4, 2024, the Company entered into a commercial paper program that allows it to issue up to billion aggregate principal amount of short-term notes to finance short-term liabilities. Any such issuance will mature within days from date of issue. There was commercial paper outstanding as of September 30, 2024.

 billion compared to a carrying value of billion. The Company did not have any outstanding debt obligations at December 31, 2023. The fair value was estimated using quoted market prices for the publicly registered Senior Notes, which are classified as Level 2 within the fair value hierarchy. The fair values and principal values consider the terms of the related debt and exclude the impacts of debt discounts. Because there is no active market for trading outstanding term loans, the fair values of the Term Loan Credit Facilities are estimated to be equal to their respective carrying values. 

NOTE 9. 
 
 international plans covering employees in countries were transferred to Solventum from 3M in March 2024. 
 As these plans are sponsored by Solventum, they are accounted for as single employer plans. Therefore, the funded status is reflected in the condensed consolidated and combined balance sheets, and the net periodic benefit costs are included in the condensed consolidated and combined statements of income. 
 The Company has made deposits for its defined benefit plans with independent trustees. In certain non-U.S. jurisdictions, trust funds and deposits with insurance companies are maintained to provide pension benefits to plan participants and their beneficiaries. There are no plan assets in the non-qualified plan due to its nature. For the U.S. postretirement health care benefit plan, the Company has set aside amounts at least equal to annual benefit payments with an independent trustee.

lawsuits in the United States and Canadian putative class action with a single named plaintiff, alleging that they underwent various joint arthroplasty, cardiovascular, and other surgeries and later developed surgical site infections due to the use of the Bair Hugger patient warming system. Under the terms of the Separation and Distribution Agreement, dated as of March 31, 2024, by and between Solventum and 3M (the Separation and Distribution Agreement ), Solventum has agreed to indemnify 3M for uninsured liabilities related to the Bair Hugger patient warming system, to manage the litigation, and pay for legal expenses. 
 The plaintiffs seek damages and other relief based on theories of strict liability, negligence, breach of express and implied warranties, failure to warn, design and manufacturing defect, fraudulent and/or negligent misrepresentation/concealment, unjust enrichment, and violations of various state consumer fraud, deceptive or unlawful trade practices and/or false advertising acts. 
 The U.S. Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation JPML consolidated all cases pending in federal courts to the U.S. District Court for the District of Minnesota to be managed in a multi-district litigation MDL proceeding. In July 2019, the court excluded several of the plaintiffs causation experts, and granted summary judgment for 3M in all cases pending at that time in the MDL. Plaintiffs appealed that decision to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit. Plaintiffs also appealed a 2018 jury verdict in favor of 3M in the first bellwether trial in the MDL and appealed the dismissal of another bellwether case. In August 2021, a panel of the appellate court reversed the district court s exclusion of the plaintiffs causation experts and the grant of summary judgment for 3M. 3M sought further appellate en banc review by the full Eighth Circuit court. In November 2021, the Eighth Circuit court denied 3M s petition for rehearing en banc. In May 2022, the U.S. Supreme Court declined 3M's February 2022 request to review the Eighth Circuit court's decision. Separately, in August 2021, the Eighth Circuit court affirmed the 2018 jury verdict in 3M s favor in the only bellwether trial in the MDL. 
 In February 2022, the MDL court ordered the parties to engage in any mediation sessions that a court-appointed mediator deems appropriate. Mediation sessions took place in May and August 2022 without success in resolving the litigation. In 2023, the MDL assigned a new mediator to facilitate discussions of the litigation and possible resolution. The MDL court denied plaintiffs April 2023 motion to disqualify the judge and magistrate judge overseeing the MDL. The parties, working with the new mediator, agreed on a bellwether process, selecting cases. The MDL court transferred the non-Minnesota bellwether cases during April 2024. Bellwether cases are set for trial beginning in April 2025. of the bellwether cases have now been voluntarily dismissed by plaintiffs.

The Minnesota Court of Appeals affirmed the state court orders in their entirety and the Minnesota Supreme Court denied plaintiffs petition for review and entered the final dismissal in 2019, effectively ending the Minnesota state court cases. 
 In June 2016, 3M was served with a putative class action filed in the Ontario Superior Court of Justice for all Canadian residents who underwent various joint arthroplasty, cardiovascular, and other surgeries and later developed surgical site infections that the representative plaintiff claims were due to the use of the Bair Hugger patient warming system. The representative plaintiff seeks relief (including punitive damages) under Canadian law based on theories similar to those asserted in the MDL. 
 For product liability litigation matters described in this section for which a liability has been recorded, the amount recorded is included in the disclosed amounts in the preceding Process for Disclosure and Recording of Liabilities Related to Legal Proceedings section and are not material to the Company s results of operations or financial condition. In addition, the Company is not able to estimate a possible loss or range of possible loss in excess of the recorded liability at this time. 
 Federal False Claims Act/Qui Tam Litigation 
 In October 2019, 3M acquired Acelity, Inc. and its KCI subsidiaries, including Kinetic Concepts, Inc. and KCI USA, Inc. As previously disclosed in the SEC filings by the KCI entities, in 2009, Kinetic Concepts, Inc. received a subpoena from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Office of Inspector General. In 2011, following the completion of the government s review and its decision declining to intervene in qui tam actions described further below, the qui tam relator-plaintiffs pleadings were unsealed. 
 The government inquiry followed qui tam actions filed in 2008 by former employees against Kinetic Concepts, Inc. and KCI USA, Inc. (collectively, the KCI Defendants under seal in the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California. qui tam action (the Godecke case) was dismissed in January 2022. In the remaining action (the Hartpence case), the complaint contains allegations that the KCI Defendants violated the federal False Claims Act by submitting false or fraudulent claims to federal healthcare programs by billing for 3M V.A.C. Therapy in a manner that was not consistent with the Local Coverage Determinations issued by the Durable Medical Equipment Medicare Administrative Contractors and seeks monetary damages. 
 In June 2019, the district court entered summary judgment in the KCI Defendants favor on all of the relator-plaintiff s claims. The relator-plaintiff then filed an appeal in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. Oral argument in the Hartpence case was held in July 2020. The appellate court issued an opinion in August 2022 reversing the decision of the district court and remanding the case for further proceedings. The district court held a status conference in January 2023 during which no case deadlines were set; the litigation remains in a pre-trial stage. The KCI Defendants filed a renewed motion for summary judgment in March 2023. In July 2023, the parties filed a joint status report notifying the court of the parties agreement to mediate the matter in November 2023. 
 As a result of a mediation held in November 2023, the relator-plaintiff and KCI reached an agreement in principle to settle the case and resolve all the remaining claims in this action, including the dismissal of the relator-plaintiff s complaint with prejudice, subject to the agreement of the government and the parties negotiation and agreement of all remaining terms of the settlement. The KCI Defendants and relator-plaintiff have jointly requested that the court continue to hold in abeyance any hearing on the KCI Defendants pending Renewed Motion for Summary Judgment and any further proceedings in this case, to allow the parties to confer with counsel for the government and negotiate the remaining terms of the settlement agreement. The KCI Defendants and the relator-plaintiff submitted an updated status report to the court during January 2024 and further status reports in July and September 2024. Under the terms of the Separation and Distribution Agreement, Solventum has agreed to indemnify 3M for liabilities related to this matter, to manage the litigation, and pay for related legal expenses.

 Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 
 The following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the Company s unaudited condensed consolidated and combined financial statements and corresponding notes elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. The following discussion and analysis provides information management believes to be relevant to understanding the financial condition and results of operations of Solventum Corporation Solventum, or the Company for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. For a full understanding of our financial condition and results of operations, the below discussion should be read alongside the Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations included in the Company s Registration Statement on Form 10 as filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC on March 11, 2024, which became effective on March 13, 2024 (the Information Statement ). This discussion contains forward-looking statements that are based upon current expectations and are subject to uncertainty and changes in circumstances. Our actual results could differ materially from the results contemplated by these forward-looking statements due to a number of factors, including those discussed below and elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, particularly in Risk Factors. Actual results may differ materially from these expectations. See Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements. 
 All amounts discussed are in millions of U.S. dollars, unless otherwise indicated. Certain columns and rows within tables may not add up due to the use of rounded numbers. 
 Unless the context otherwise requires, references to Solventum and the Company refer to (i) 3M s Health Care Business prior to the Spin-Off as a carve-out business of 3M with related condensed combined financial statements and (ii) Solventum Corporation and its subsidiaries following the Spin-Off with related condensed consolidated and combined financial statements. 
 Transition to Standalone Company 
 Solventum utilized allocations and carve-out methodologies through the date of the Spin-Off to prepare historical combined financial statements and condensed combined financial statements. The condensed combined financial statements herein for periods prior to the Spin-Off may not be indicative of the Company s future performance, do not necessarily include the actual expenses that would have been incurred by Solventum, and may not reflect our results of operations, financial position, and cash flows had we been a separate, standalone company during the historical periods presented. 
 In particular, Solventum benefited from 3M s long operating history, reputation and well-known brand. Following the separation, Solventum is operating under its own brand, and accordingly may be negatively impacted due to the loss of benefits conferred by 3M s brand recognition and reputation. In addition, the debt obligations incurred by Solventum in connection with the separation will adversely affect its profitability and could affect its ability to use its cash flow for investing in the business, strategic transactions, including mergers and acquisitions, and returning capital. See Note 1, Organization and Basis of Presentation to the condensed consolidated and combined financial statements and Item II, Part 1A Risk Factors for additional information. 
 Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations MD A is designed to provide a reader of Solventum s financial statements with a narrative from the perspective of management. Solventum s MD A is presented in the following sections:

 Operating Segments and Sales Change Information 
 Solventum manages its operations in four business segments: MedSurg, Dental Solutions, Health Information Systems, and Purification and Filtration. 
 References are made to organic sales change, which is defined as the change in net sales, absent the separate impacts on sales from foreign currency translation and acquisitions, net of divestitures. Other, as comprised in the tables below, includes acquisition and divestiture-related activities. Acquisitions include non-health care related supply agreements that conveyed from 3M to the Company at Spin-Off and sales from new supply agreements with 3M that commenced at Spin-Off. Divestiture impacts include lost sales from the Company s dental anesthetics business that was sold in August 2023 as well as lost sales of certain health care businesses retained by 3M India in connection with the Spin-Off. Solventum believes this information is useful to investors and management in understanding ongoing operations and in analysis of ongoing operating trends.

 In the United States both total sales and organic sales increased. Organic growth was led by MedSurg and Health Information Systems. 
 In International, both total sales and organic sales decreased. Foreign currency translation negatively impacted total growth. Organic growth decline was led by MedSurg, partially offset by growth in Purification and Filtration. 
 
 Managing currency risks 
 Prior to April 1, 2024, Solventum indirectly participated in 3M s centrally managed hedging program, which utilizes a number of tools to manage currency risk including natural hedges such as pricing, productivity, hard currency, hard currency-indexed billings, and localizing source of supply. 3M also used financial hedges to mitigate currency risk. Starting in the second quarter of 2024, Solventum established its own hedging program. Refer to Note 10 for additional details. 
 The stronger U.S. dollar had an immaterial worldwide impact on sales for the third quarter of 2024 compared to the same period last year. The stronger U.S. dollar had a negative worldwide impact on sales of less than 1 percent in the first nine months of 2024 compared to the first nine months of 2023. Net of the Company s hedging strategy, foreign currency negatively impacted earnings for the third quarter and first nine months of 2024 compared to the same periods last year.

 Costs of Product 
 Costs of product includes manufacturing, engineering and freight costs. 
 Costs of product, measured as a percent of sales of product, increased in the third quarter of 2024 when compared to the third quarter of 2023. The increase was driven by increased costs due to the impact of higher costs on inventory sourced under the master supply and transition manufacturing agreements with 3M and due to the cost of other transition support provided by 3M. 
 Costs of product, measured as a percent of sales of product, increased in the first nine months of 2024 when compared to the first nine months of 2023. The increase was driven by increased costs due to the impact of higher costs on inventory sourced under the master supply and transition manufacturing agreements with 3M and due to the cost of other transition support provided by 3M. These costs were partially offset by a sales price benefit. 
 Costs of Software and Rentals 
 Costs of software and rentals includes compensation-related costs associated with installation, training and maintenance for our software products, and depreciation, maintenance and refurbishment cost and freight costs related to our hardware rental units. 
 Costs of software and rentals, measured as a percent of sales of software and rentals, increased during the third quarter of 2024 as compared to the same period last year due to the impact of lower rental equipment revenue. Costs of software and rentals, measured as a percent of sales of software and rentals, were flat for the first nine months of 2024 as compared to the same period last year driven by higher software sales offset by higher compensation costs and lower rental revenue.

 SG A, measured as a percent of total net sales, increased in both the third quarter and first nine months of 2024 when compared to the same periods last year. The increase in both periods was driven by higher compensation, including equity- based awards, and higher costs associated with both initial stand-up and ongoing operations to support a standalone company.

 Interest expense, net includes interest accrued on debt obligations, offset by interest income from cash and marketable securities. Interest expense, net increased in both the third quarter and first nine months of 2024 as compared to the same periods last year due to interest incurred on the February 2024 issuance of senior notes and March draw on the senior term loan credit facilities. Refer to Note 8 to the financial statements for more information. This increase was partially offset by interest earned from cash and marketable securities held during the period. 
 
 Other expense (income), net includes the non-service component of periodic pension cost, investment gains and losses, and currency-related impacts from foreign currency translation. Other expense (income), net decreased slightly for the third quarter of 2024 as compared to the same period last year. Other expense (income), net increased for the first nine months of 2024 as compared to the same period last year resulting from charges associated with the substantial liquidation of foreign operations completed as part of our separation from 3M.

 Performance by Business Segment 
 Note 14 to the audited combined financial statements within the Company s Information Statement provides an overview of Solventum s business segments. In addition, disclosures relating to Solventum s segments are provided in Note 15 to the accompanying condensed consolidated and combined financial statements. We manage our operations in four business segments. The reportable segments are MedSurg, Dental Solutions, Health Information Systems, and Purification and Filtration. Our Chief Operating Decision Maker evaluates segment operating performance using net sales and business segment operating income. 
 
 Corporate and Unallocated 
 In addition to the four business segments, the Company assigns certain costs to Corporate and Unallocated, which is presented separately in Note 15 to the condensed consolidated and combined financial statements. Corporate and Unallocated includes amortization of acquired intangible assets, restructuring and related charges, benefits or costs related to capitalized manufacturing variances, Spin-Off and separation related costs and other net costs that the Company chose not to allocate directly to its business segments. Spin-Off and separation related costs include any costs incurred as part of our separation from 3M and costs to setup operations as a standalone Company, including system implementations, manufacturing relocation, legal entity separation, certain equity awards granted as part of the Spin-Off, profit mark-ups on transition service arrangements with 3M and other one-time costs. 
 Corporate and Unallocated also includes sales and cost of sales related to product supplied to 3M and other supply agreements related to legacy 3M non-health care business that were assumed by the Company at Spin-Off. Because Corporate and Unallocated includes a variety of miscellaneous items, it is subject to fluctuation on a quarterly and annual basis. 
 Corporate and Unallocated net operating loss increased in both the third quarter and the first nine months of 2024 when compared to the same period last year as the Company had higher Spin-Off and separation related costs.

Financial Condition and Liquidity 
 The strength and stability of Solventum s operating model and strong free cash flow capability provides financial flexibility and enables the Company to invest through business cycles. Historically, Solventum generated positive operating cash flows and a majority of such cash flows were transferred to 3M as part of 3M s cash pooling arrangements, the effect of which is presented as Net parent investment in our condensed combined financial statements. 
 Upon completion of the Spin-Off, Solventum has ceased participation in 3M's cash pooling arrangement and our cash and cash equivalents are held and used solely for our own operations. The Company's capital structure, long-term commitments and sources of liquidity will change significantly from historical practices. For additional detail regarding changes to our capital structure, refer to the section entitled Description of Material Indebtedness in Solventum's Information Statement. 
 
 Debt and Credit Facilities 
 On February 16, 2024, the Company entered into a five-year 2.0 billion unsecured revolving credit facility expiring in 2029, an 18-month senior unsecured term loan facility of 500 million and a three-year senior unsecured term loan facility of 1.0 billion (collectively, the Facilities ). In March 2024, the Company withdrew 1.48 billion under the Facilities. The funds from the Facilities were transferred to 3M as partial consideration for the Spin-Off. 
 On February 27, 2024, Solventum issued 6.9 billion of Senior Notes in preparation for the payment of partial consideration to 3M Company in connection with the Spin-Off. 
 In August 2024, the Company repaid 200 million of the outstanding principal amount from the 18-month senior unsecured term loan credit facility. 
 Refer to Note 8 for more information. 
 Commercial Paper 
 On March 4, 2024, the Company entered into a commercial paper program that allows it to issue up to an 2.0 billion aggregate principal amount of short-term notes to finance short-term liabilities. Any such issuance will mature within 364 days from date of issue. There was no commercial paper outstanding as of September 30, 2024.

 Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities 
 As of September 30, 2024, Solventum had 772 million of cash and cash equivalents, of which approximately 570 million was held by the Company s foreign subsidiaries and approximately 202 million was held in the United States. These balances are invested in bank instruments and other high-quality fixed income securities. As of December 31, 2023, Solventum had 194 million of cash and cash equivalents, of which approximately 150 million was held by the Company s foreign subsidiaries and 44 million was held in the United States. The increase from December 31, 2023 resulted from both cash retained by the Company at Spin-Off and operating cash generated by the Company subsequent to the Spin-Off. 
 
 Cash Flows 
 Cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities are provided in the tables that follow. Individual amounts in the condensed consolidated and combined statements of cash flows exclude the effect of exchange rate impacts on cash and cash equivalents, which are presented separately in the cash flows. Thus, the amounts presented in the following operating, investing and financing activities tables reflect changes in balances from period to period adjusted for these effects. 
 
 Cash Flows from Operating Activities: 
 Nine months ended September 30, (Millions) 2024 2023 Cash Flows from Operating Activities Net income 448 1,074 Adjustments to reconcile net income to net cash provided by operating activities Depreciation and amortization 405 422 Postretirement benefit plan expense 30 31 Stock-based compensation expense 87 32 Gain on business divestitures (56) Deferred income taxes (93) (99) Changes in assets and liabilities Accounts receivable 14 (24) Due from related parties 
 200 Inventories (99) (7) Accounts payable 200 48 Due to related parties 
 (393) All other operating activities 167 (53) Net cash provided by operating activities 966 1,368 
 
 In the first nine months of 2024, cash flows provided by operating activities decreased compared to the first nine months of 2023 primarily due to lower net income, partially offset by payments from related parties. The benefit in accounts payable is largely offset by amounts due to related parties as the Company reimburses 3M for certain procurement activities managed through 3M's IT systems. In addition to this procurement activity, due to related parties also includes cash paid to 3M for operating transactions with Solventum entities prior to the Spin-Off and the net impact of payables and associated payments related to transition agreements with 3M. 
 
 Cash Flows from Investing Activities: 
 Nine months ended September 30, (Millions) 2024 2023 Cash Flows from Investing Activities Purchases of property, plant and equipment (253) (202) Proceeds from sale of business 60 Net cash used in investing activities (253) (142) 

Purchases of property, plant and equipment increased in the first nine months of 2024 as compared to the first nine months of 2023. The increase is primarily driven by the timing of investment spend. The Company is focused on investments to support growth, renewal and maintenance programs, environmental health services, and relocating manufacturing operations currently co-located within 3M facilities.

 Cash Flows from Financing Activities: 
 Nine months ended September 30, (Millions) 2024 2023 Cash Flows from Financing Activities Repayment of debt (200) Net transfers to 3M (8,247) (1,248) Proceeds from long-term debt, net of issuance costs 8,303 Other net 8 2 Net cash provided by (used in) financing activities (136) (1,246) 
 
 Repayment of debt is related to the August 2024 repayment of 200 million outstanding principal from the 18-month senior unsecured term loan credit facility. 
 Proceeds from debt of 8.3 billion were related to the first quarter issuance of 6.9 billion in senior notes and 1.5 billion in senior term loan credit facilities. The proceeds from these financing transactions were transferred to 3M in connection with the Spin-Off transaction, other than the amounts retained in order to achieve the 600 million retained cash target. 

Material Cash Requirements from Known Contractual and Other Obligations: 
 Solventum s material cash requirements from known contractual and other obligations primarily relate to the following, for which information on both a short-term and long-term basis is provided in the indicated notes to the condensed consolidated and combined financial statements and the audited combined financial statements included in the Information Statement: 
 Tax obligations Refer to Note 9 to the audited combined financial statements and Note 7 to the unaudited condensed consolidated and combined financial statements. 
 Debt Refer to Note 8 to the unaudited condensed consolidated and combined financial statements. 
 Commitments and contingencies Refer to Note 11 to the audited combined financial statements and Note 11 to the unaudited condensed consolidated and combined financial statements. 
 Operating leases Refer to Note 12 to the audited combined financial statements. 
 Solventum purchases the majority of its materials and services as needed, with no unconditional commitments. In limited circumstances, in the normal course of business, the Company enters into unconditional purchase obligations with various vendors that may take the form of, for example, take or pay contracts in which the Company guarantees payment to ensure availability of certain materials or services or to ensure ongoing efforts on capital projects. The Company expects to receive underlying materials or services for these purchase obligations. To the extent the limited amount of these purchase obligations fluctuates, it largely trends with normal-course changes in regular operating activities. Additionally, contractual capital commitments represent a small part of the Company s expected capital spending.

 Cautionary Note Concerning Forward Looking Statements 
 This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, including Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in Part I, Item 2, contains or incorporates by reference statements that relate to future events and expectations and, as such, constitute forward-looking statements that involve risk and uncertainties. Forward-looking statements include those containing such words as anticipates, believes, could, estimates, expects, forecasts, goal, guidance, intends, may, outlook, plans, projects, seeks, sees, should, targets, will, would, or other words of similar meaning. 
 
 All statements that reflect Solventum s expectations, assumptions or projections about the future, other than statements of historical fact, are forward-looking statements, including, without limitation, forecasts relating to discussions of future operations and financial performance (including volume growth, pricing, sales and earnings per share growth and cash flows) and statements regarding Solventum s strategy for growth, future product development, regulatory clearances and approvals, competitive position and expenditures. Forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and are subject to risks, uncertainties, and changes in circumstances that are difficult to predict. Although Solventum believes that the expectations reflected in any forward-looking statements it makes are based on reasonable assumptions, it can give no assurance that these expectations will be attained and it is possible that actual results may differ materially from those indicated by these forward-looking statements due to a variety of risks and uncertainties. Such risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to:

 unexpected events, such as those related to the COVID-19 public health crisis; 
 operational execution risks; 
 damage to our reputation or our brands; 
 risks from acquisitions, strategic alliances, divestitures and other strategic events; 
 Solventum s business dealings involving third-party partners in various markets; 
 Solventum s ability to access the capital and credit markets and changes in Solventum s credit ratings; 
 exposure to interest rate and currency risks; 
 the highly competitive environment in which Solventum operates and consolidation in the healthcare industry; 
 reduction in customers research budgets or government funding; 
 the timing and market acceptance of Solventum s new product and service offerings; 
 ongoing working relationships with certain key healthcare professionals; 
 changes in reimbursement practices of governments or private payers or other cost containment measures; 
 Solventum s ability to obtain components or raw materials supplied by third parties and other manufacturing and related supply chain difficulties, interruptions, and disruptive factors; 
 legal and regulatory proceedings and legal compliance risks (including third-party risks) with regards to antitrust, Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) and other anti-bribery laws, environmental laws, anti-kickback and false claims laws, privacy laws, tax laws, and other laws and regulations in the United States and other countries in which Solventum operates; 
 potential liabilities related to a broad group of perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances, collectively known as PFAS

 climate change and measures to address climate change; 
 security breaches and other disruptions to information technology infrastructure; 
 Solventum s failure to obtain, maintain, protect, or effectively enforce its intellectual property rights; 
 pension and postretirement obligation liabilities; 
 any failure by 3M to perform any of its obligations under the various separation agreements in connection with the separation and distribution; 
 any failure to realize the expected benefits of the separation, and/or that the separation will not be completed within the expected time frame, on the expected terms or at all; 
 a determination by the IRS or other tax authorities that the distribution or certain related transactions should be treated as taxable transactions; 
 expected financing transactions undertaken in connection with the separation and risks associated with additional indebtedness; 
 the risk that incremental costs of operating on a standalone basis (including the loss of synergies), costs of restructuring transactions and other costs incurred in connection with the separation will exceed Solventum s estimates; and

 management s attention and the impact on relationships with customers, suppliers, employees and other business counterparties. 
 The above list is not exhaustive or necessarily set forth in the order of importance. Forward-looking statements are based on certain assumptions and expectations of future events and trends, and actual future results and trends may differ materially from historical results or those reflected in any such forward-looking statements depending on a variety of factors. Solventum assumes no obligation to update or revise such statement, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, except as required by applicable law. 
 Important information as to these factors can be found in this document, including, among others, Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations under the headings of Overview, Financial Condition and Liquidity and annually in Critical Accounting Estimates. Discussion of these factors is incorporated by reference from Part II, Item 1A, Risk Factors, of this document, and should be considered an integral part of Part I, Item 2, Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. For additional information concerning factors that may cause actual results to vary materially from those stated in the forward-looking statements, see our reports on Form 8-K filed with the SEC from time to time and the Company's Registration Statement on Form 10, including the amendments thereto, as filed with the SEC. 
 
 Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 
 Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Risks: 
 Solventum faces transactional exchange rate risk from transactions with customers in countries outside the United States and from intercompany transactions between affiliated entities. Foreign currency exchange rates and fluctuations in those rates may cause fluctuations in cash flows related to foreign denominated transactions. The Company is also exposed to the translation of foreign currency earnings to the U.S. dollar. 
 3M enters into foreign exchange forward contracts to hedge against the effect of exchange rate fluctuations on cash flows denominated in foreign currencies. While part of 3M, Solventum indirectly benefited from 3M s hedging activities and was allocated a proportion of the realized gains or losses on these contracts. However, the benefits and costs realized from these contracts may not reflect the benefits and costs Solventum would have incurred as a standalone company for the periods presented. 
 Concentration of Credit Risk: 
 Solventum s sales are not materially dependent on any single customer. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023, no one individual customer or group of affiliated customers represented more than 10 percent of the Company's total sales. At September 30, 2024 no customers represented more than 10 percent of the Company's total accounts receivable balance and at December 31, 2023, one customer accounted for approximately 10 percent of Solventum s total accounts receivable balance. Credit risk associated with the Company s accounts receivable is representative of the geographic, industry, and customer diversity associated with the global businesses. 
 Commodity Prices Risk: 
 Solventum manages commodity price risks through negotiated supply contracts and price protection agreements. The Company does not participate in material commodity hedging activity. 
 
 Item 4. Controls and Procedures 
 a. The Company carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of its management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of the Company s disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in the Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(e)) as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based upon that evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that the Company s disclosure controls and procedures are effective. 
 b. There was no change in the Company s internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the Company s most recently completed fiscal quarter that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company s internal control over financial reporting.

 Disclosure Under Iran Threat Reduction and Syria Human Rights Act of 2012 
 
 As part of its intellectual property IP protection efforts, 3M has obtained and maintains patents and trademarks in Iran. Certain of these patents and trademarks are now owned by Solventum s affiliate Solventum Intellectual Properties Company, but registered title has not yet been assigned to Solventum Intellectual Properties Company. As authorized under 3M s specific license granted by the Office of Foreign Assets Control, during the three months ended September 30, 2024, a third-party IP service provider/counsel paid on behalf of 3M a renewal fee of 130 to the Iran Intellectual Property Office s account with Bank Melli, which was designated pursuant to Executive Order 13224, to maintain a trademark owned by Solventum that has registered title held by 3M. Solventum did not direct this activity and understands that 3M plans to continue these IP rights protection activities as authorized under its specific license.
