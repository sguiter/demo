 million shares of common stock, including the underwriters over-allotment, at a price of per share. Concurrent with this offering, the Company s senior management purchased an additional shares through a private placement, also at per share. The Company s investment objective is to maximize both current income and capital appreciation through debt and equity investments. The Company directly and indirectly invests primarily in leveraged middle market companies in the form of senior secured loans, financing leases and, to a lesser extent, unsecured loans and equity securities. From time to time, we may also invest in public companies that are thinly traded. On April 1, 2022, we acquired SLR Senior Investment Corp., a Maryland corporation SUNS ), pursuant to that certain Agreement and Plan of Merger (the Merger Agreement ), dated as of December 1, 2021, by and among us, SUNS, Solstice Merger Sub, Inc., a Maryland corporation and our wholly-owned subsidiary Merger Sub ), and, solely for the limited purposes set forth therein, SLR Capital Partners, LLC (the Investment Adviser ). Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, Merger Sub merged with and into SUNS, with SUNS continuing as the surviving company and as SUNS s wholly-owned subsidiary (the Merger and, immediately thereafter, SUNS merged with and into us, with us continuing as the surviving company (together with the Merger, the Mergers ). In accordance with the terms of the Merger Agreement, at the effective time of the Merger, each outstanding share of SUNS s common stock was converted into the right to receive shares of our common stock (with SUNS s stockholders receiving cash in lieu of fractional shares of our common stock). As a result of the Mergers, we issued an aggregate of shares of our common stock to former SUNS stockholders.

 days, for which market quotations are readily available and deemed to represent fair value under GAAP, at such market quotations (unless they are deemed not to represent fair value). A market quotation is readily available for a security only when that quotation is a quoted price (unadjusted) in active markets for identical investments that the Company can access at the measurement date, provided that a quotation will not be readily available if it is not reliable. If the Company anticipates using a market quotation for a security, it will also monitor for circumstances that may necessitate the use of fair value, such as significant events that may cause concern over the reliability of a market quotation. We attempt to obtain market quotations from at least two brokers or dealers (if available, otherwise from a principal market maker or a primary market dealer or other independent pricing service). We utilize mid-market pricing as a practical expedient for fair value unless a different point within the range is more representative. If and when market quotations are deemed not to represent fair value, we may utilize independent third-party valuation firms to assist us in determining the fair value of material assets. Accordingly, such investments go through our multi-step valuation process as described below. In each such case, independent valuation firms, that may from time to time be engaged by the Board, consider observable market inputs together with significant unobservable inputs in arriving at their valuation recommendations. Debt investments with maturities of days or less shall each be valued at cost plus accreted discount, or minus amortized premium, which is expected to approximate fair value, unless such valuation, in the judgment of the Investment Adviser, does not represent fair value, in which case such investments shall be valued at fair value as determined in good faith by or under the direction of the Board. Investments that are not publicly traded or whose market quotations are not readily available are valued at fair value as determined in good faith by or under the direction of the Board. Such determination of fair values involves subjective judgments and estimates. 

 With respect to investments for which market quotations are not readily available or when such market quotations are deemed not to represent fair value under GAAP, the Board has approved a multi-step valuation process each quarter, as described below: (1) our quarterly valuation process begins with each portfolio company or investment being initially valued by the investment professionals of the Investment Adviser responsible for the portfolio investment; 

 (2) preliminary valuation conclusions are then documented and discussed with senior management of the Investment Adviser;

 excise tax on this income. The Company will accrue excise tax on such estimated excess taxable income as appropriate. 

 (f) Book and tax basis differences relating to stockholder distributions and other permanent book and tax differences are typically reclassified among the Company s capital accounts annually. In addition, the character of income and gains to be distributed is determined in accordance with income tax regulations that may differ from GAAP. 

 (g) Distributions to common stockholders are recorded as of the record date. The amount to be paid out as a distribution is determined by the Board. Net realized capital gains, if any, are generally distributed or deemed distributed at least annually. 

 (h) In accordance with Regulation S-X and ASC Topic 810 Consolidation , the Company consolidates its interest in controlled investment company subsidiaries, financing subsidiaries and certain wholly-owned holding companies that serve to facilitate investment in portfolio companies. In addition, the Company may also consolidate any controlled operating companies substantially all of whose business consists of providing services to the Company. 

 (i) The accounting records of the Company are maintained in U.S. dollars. Any assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated into U.S. dollars based on the rate of exchange of such currencies against U.S. dollars on the date of valuation. The Company will not isolate that portion of the results of operations resulting from changes in foreign exchange rates on investments from the fluctuations arising from changes in market prices of securities held. Such fluctuations would be included with the net unrealized gain or loss from investments. The Company s investments in foreign securities, if any, may involve certain risks, including without limitation: foreign exchange restrictions, expropriation, taxation or other political, social or economic risks, all of which could affect the market and/or credit risk of the investment. In addition, changes in the relationship of foreign currencies to the U.S. dollar can significantly affect the value of these investments in terms of U.S. dollars and therefore the earnings of the Company. 

 (j) In accordance with ASC 835-30, the Company reports origination and other expenses related to certain debt issuances as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of the debt liability. Applicable expenses are deferred and amortized using either the effective interest method or the straight-line method over the stated life. The straight-line method may be used on revolving facilities and/or when it approximates the effective yield method. 

 (k) The Company may enter into forward exchange contracts in order to hedge against foreign currency risk. These contracts are marked-to-market by recognizing the difference between the contract exchange rate and the current market rate as unrealized appreciation or depreciation. Realized gains or losses are recognized when contracts are settled. 

 (l) The Company records expenses related to shelf registration statements and applicable equity offering costs as prepaid assets. These expenses are typically charged as a reduction of capital upon the sale of shares or expensed, in accordance with ASC 946-20-25. 

 (m) Investments that are expected to pay regularly scheduled interest in cash are generally placed on non-accrual status when principal or interest cash payments are past due days or more days or more for equipment financing) and/or when it is no longer probable that principal or interest cash payments will be collected. Such non-accrual investments are restored to accrual status if past due principal and interest are paid in cash, and in management s judgment, are likely to continue timely payment of their remaining principal and interest obligations. Cash interest payments received on such investments may be recognized as income or applied to principal depending on management s judgment. 

 (n) The Company defines cash equivalents as securities that are readily convertible into known amounts of cash and so near their maturity that they present insignificant risk of changes in value because of changes in interest rates. Generally, only securities with a maturity of three months or less would qualify, with limited exceptions. The Company believes that certain U.S. Treasury bills, repurchase agreements and other high-quality, short-term debt securities would qualify as cash equivalents.

 on gross assets up to of the Company s total net assets as of the immediately preceding quarter end and on gross assets that exceed of the Company s total net assets as of the immediately preceding quarter end. For purposes of computing the base management fee, gross assets exclude temporary assets acquired at the end of each fiscal quarter for purposes of preserving investment flexibility in the next fiscal quarter. Temporary assets include, but are not limited to, U.S. Treasury bills, other short-term U.S. government or government agency securities, repurchase agreements or cash borrowings. The performance-based incentive fee has two parts, as follows: one part is calculated and payable quarterly in arrears based on the Company s pre-incentive fee net investment income for the immediately preceding calendar quarter. For this purpose, pre-incentive fee net investment income means interest income, dividend income and any other income (including any other fees (other than fees for providing managerial assistance), such as commitment, origination, structuring, diligence and consulting fees or other fees that we receive from portfolio companies) accrued during the calendar quarter, minus the Company s operating expenses for the quarter (including the base management fee, any expenses payable under the Administration Agreement (as defined below), and any interest expense and distributions paid on any issued and outstanding preferred stock, but excluding the performance-based incentive fee). Pre-incentive fee net investment income does not include any realized capital gains or losses, or unrealized capital appreciation or depreciation. Pre-incentive fee net investment income, expressed as a rate of return on the value of the Company s net assets at the end of the immediately preceding calendar quarter, is compared to the hurdle rate of per quarter annualized). The Company pays the Investment Adviser a performance-based incentive fee with respect to the Company s pre-incentive fee net investment income in each calendar quarter as follows: (1) no performance-based incentive fee in any calendar quarter in which the Company s pre-incentive fee net investment income does not exceed the hurdle rate; (2) of the Company s pre-incentive fee net investment income with respect to that portion of such pre-incentive fee net investment income, if any, that exceeds the hurdle rate but is less than 2.1875 in any calendar quarter; and (3) of the amount of the Company s pre-incentive fee net investment income, if any, that exceeds 2.1875 in any calendar quarter. These calculations are appropriately pro-rated for any period of less than three months. The second part of the performance-based incentive fee is determined and payable in arrears as of the end of each calendar year (or upon termination of the Advisory Agreement, as of the termination date), and equals of the Company s cumulative realized capital gains less cumulative realized capital losses, unrealized capital depreciation (unrealized depreciation on a gross investment-by-investment basis at the end of each calendar year) and all net capital gains upon which prior performance-based capital gains incentive fee payments were previously made to the Investment Adviser. For financial statement purposes, the second part of the performance-based incentive fee is accrued based upon of cumulative net realized gains and net unrealized capital appreciation. No accrual was required for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company recognized and , respectively, in base management fees and and , respectively, in performance-based incentive fees.

All debt obligations would be considered Level 3 liabilities and would be valued with market yield as the unobservable input. Quantitative Information about Level 3 Fair Value Measurements The Company typically determines the fair value of its performing debt investments utilizing a yield analysis. In a yield analysis, a price is ascribed for each investment based upon an assessment of current and expected market yields for similar investments and risk profiles. Additional consideration is given to current contractual interest rates, relative maturities and other key terms and risks associated with an investment. Among other factors, a significant determinant of risk is the amount of leverage used by the portfolio company relative to the total enterprise value of the company, and the rights and remedies of our investment within each portfolio company. Significant unobservable quantitative inputs typically used in the fair value measurement of the Company s Level 3 assets and liabilities primarily reflect current market yields, including indices, and readily available quotes from brokers, dealers, and pricing services as indicated by comparable assets and liabilities, as well as enterprise values, returns on equity and earnings before income taxes, depreciation and amortization EBITDA multiples of similar companies, and comparable market transactions for equity securities.

Report of Independent Regi stered Public Accounting Firm 
 To the Stockholders and Board of Directors 
 SLR Investment Corp.: 
 Results of Review of Interim Financial Information 
 We have reviewed the consolidated statement of assets and liabilities of SLR Investment Corp. (and subsidiaries) (the Company), including the consolidated schedule of investments, as of September 30, 2024, the related consolidated statements of operations and changes in net assets, for the three-month and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the related consolidated statements of cash flows for the nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, and the related notes (collectively, the consolidated interim financial information). Based on our reviews, we are not aware of any material modifications that should be made to the consolidated interim financial information for it to be in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. 
 We have previously audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated statement of assets and liabilities, including the consolidated schedule of investments, of the Company as of December 31, 2023, and the related consolidated statements of operations, changes in net assets, and cash flows for the year then ended (not presented herein); and in our report dated February 27, 2024, we expressed an unqualified opinion on those consolidated financial statements. In our opinion, the information set forth in the accompanying consolidated statement of assets and liabilities, including the consolidated schedule of investments, as of December 31, 2023, is fairly stated, in all material respects, in relation to the consolidated statement of assets and liabilities, including the consolidated schedule of investments, from which it has been derived. 
 Basis for Review Results 
 This consolidated interim financial information is the responsibility of the Company s management. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 
 We conducted our reviews in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. A review of consolidated interim financial information consists principally of applying analytical procedures and making inquiries of persons responsible for financial and accounting matters. It is substantially less in scope than an audit conducted in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB, the objective of which is the expression of an opinion regarding the financial statements taken as a whole. Accordingly, we do not express such an opinion.

 Overview 
 SLR Investment Corp. (the Company, SLRC, we or our ), a Maryland corporation formed in November 2007, is an externally managed, non-diversified closed-end management investment company that has elected to be regulated as a business development company BDC under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the 1940 Act ). Furthermore, as the Company is an investment company, it continues to apply the guidance in the Financial Accounting Standards Board Accounting Standards Codification ASC Topic 946. In addition, for U.S federal income tax purposes, the Company has elected to be treated as a regulated investment company RIC under Subchapter M of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the Code ). 
 On February 9, 2010, we priced our initial public offering, selling 5.68 million shares of our common stock. Concurrent with our initial public offering, Michael S. Gross, our Chairman, Co-Chief Executive Officer and President, and Bruce Spohler, our Co-Chief Executive Officer and Chief Operating Officer, collectively purchased an additional 0.6 million shares of our common stock through a private placement transaction exempt from registration under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. 
 We invest primarily in privately held U.S. middle-market companies, where we believe the supply of primary capital is limited and the investment opportunities are most attractive. Our investment objective is to generate both current income and capital appreciation through debt and equity investments. We invest primarily in leveraged middle-market companies in the form of senior secured loans, financing leases and to a lesser extent, unsecured loans and equity securities. From time to time, we may also invest in public companies that are thinly traded. Our business is focused primarily on the direct origination of investments through portfolio companies or their financial sponsors. Our investments generally range between 5 million and 100 million each, although we expect that this investment size will vary proportionately with the size of our capital base and/or with strategic initiatives. Our investment activities are managed by the Investment Adviser and supervised by our board of directors (the Board ), a majority of whom are non-interested, as such term is defined in the 1940 Act. SLR Capital Management, LLC (the Administrator provides the administrative services necessary for us to operate. 
 In addition, we may invest a portion of our portfolio in other types of investments, which we refer to as opportunistic investments, which are not our primary focus but are intended to enhance our overall returns. These investments may include, but are not limited to, direct investments in public companies that are not thinly traded and securities of leveraged companies located in select countries outside of the United States. 
 Recent Developments 
 On November 6, 2024, the Board declared a quarterly distribution of 0.41 per share payable on December 27, 2024 to holders of record as of December 13, 2024. 
 Investments 
 Our level of investment activity can and does vary substantially from period to period depending on many factors, including the amount of debt and equity capital available to middle market companies, the level of merger and acquisition activity for such companies, the general economic environment and the competitive environment for the types of investments we make. As a BDC, we must not acquire any assets other than qualifying assets specified in the 1940 Act unless, at the time the acquisition is made, at least 
 53 

Table of Contents 

70 of our total assets are qualifying assets (with certain limited exceptions). Qualifying assets include investments in eligible portfolio companies. The definition of eligible portfolio company includes certain public companies that do not have any securities listed on a national securities exchange and companies whose securities are listed on a national securities exchange but whose market capitalization is less than 250 million. 
 Revenue 
 We generate revenue primarily in the form of interest and dividend income from the securities we hold and capital gains, if any, on investment securities that we may sell. Our debt investments generally have a stated term of three to seven years and typically bear interest at a floating rate usually determined on the basis of a benchmark Secured Overnight Financing Rate SOFR ), commercial paper rate, or the prime rate. Interest on our debt investments is generally payable monthly or quarterly but may be bi-monthly or semi-annually. In addition, our investments may provide payment-in-kind PIK income. Such amounts of accrued PIK income are added to the cost of the investment on the respective capitalization dates and generally become due at maturity of the investment or upon the investment being called by the issuer. We may also generate revenue in the form of commitment, origination, structuring fees, fees for providing managerial assistance and, if applicable, consulting fees, etc. 
 Expenses 
 All investment professionals of the Investment Adviser and their respective staffs, when and to the extent engaged in providing investment advisory and management services, and the compensation and routine overhead expenses of such personnel allocable to such services, are provided and paid for by the Investment Adviser. We bear all other costs and expenses of our operations and transactions, including (without limitation): 
 the cost of our organization and public offerings; 

the cost of calculating our net asset value, including the cost of any third-party valuation services; 

the cost of effecting sales and repurchases of our shares and other securities; 

interest payable on debt, if any, to finance our investments; 

fees payable to third parties relating to, or associated with, making investments, including fees and expenses associated with performing due diligence reviews of prospective investments and advisory fees; 

transfer agent and custodial fees; 

fees and expenses associated with marketing efforts; 

federal and state registration fees, any stock exchange listing fees; 

federal, state and local taxes; 

independent directors fees and expenses; 

brokerage commissions; 

fidelity bond, directors and officers errors and omissions liability insurance and other insurance premiums; 

direct costs and expenses of administration, including printing, mailing, long distance telephone and staff; 

fees and expenses associated with independent audits and outside legal costs; 

costs associated with our reporting and compliance obligations under the 1940 Act and applicable federal and state securities laws; and 

54 

Table of Contents 

all other expenses incurred by either the Administrator or us in connection with administering our business, including payments under the Administration Agreement (as defined below) that will be based upon our allocable portion of overhead and other expenses incurred by the Administrator in performing its obligations under the Administration Agreement, including rent, the fees and expenses associated with performing compliance functions, and our allocable portion of the costs of compensation and related expenses of our chief compliance officer and our chief financial officer and their respective staffs. 

We expect our general and administrative operating expenses related to our ongoing operations to increase moderately in dollar terms. During periods of asset growth, we generally expect our general and administrative operating expenses to decline as a percentage of our total assets and increase during periods of asset declines. Incentive fees, interest expense and costs relating to future offerings of securities, among others, may also increase or reduce overall operating expenses based on portfolio performance, interest rate benchmarks and offerings of our securities relative to comparative periods, among other factors.

 Critical Accounting Policies 
 The preparation of consolidated financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements, and revenues and expenses during the periods reported. Actual results could materially differ from those estimates. We have identified the following items as critical accounting policies. Within the context of these critical accounting policies and disclosed subsequent events herein, we are not currently aware of any other reasonably likely events or circumstances that would result in materially different amounts being reported. 
 Valuation of Portfolio Investments 
 In December 2020, the SEC adopted Rule 2a-5 under the 1940 Act addressing fair valuation of fund investments. The rule sets forth requirements for good faith determinations of fair value, as well as for the performance of fair value determinations, including related oversight and reporting obligations. The rule also defines readily available market quotations for purposes of the definition of value under the 1940 Act, and the SEC noted that this definition will apply in all contexts under the 1940 Act. The Company complies with the Rule 2a-5 valuation requirements. 
 We conduct the valuation of our assets, pursuant to which our net asset value is determined, at all times consistent with GAAP and the 1940 Act. The Board will (1) periodically assess and manage valuation risks; (2) establish and apply fair value methodologies; (3) test fair value methodologies; (4) oversee and evaluate third-party pricing services, as applicable; (5) oversee the reporting required by Rule 2a-5 under the 1940 Act; and (6) maintain recordkeeping requirements under Rule 2a-5. 
 It is anticipated that in respect of many of the Company s assets, readily available market quotations will not be obtainable and that such assets will be valued at fair value. A market quotation is readily available for a security only when that quotation is a quoted price (unadjusted) in active markets for identical investments that the Company can access at the measurement date, provided that a quotation will not be readily available if it is not reliable. If the Company anticipates using a market quotation for a security, it will also monitor for circumstances that may necessitate the use of fair value, such as significant events that may cause concern over the reliability of a market quotation. 
 Our valuation procedures are set forth in more detail in Note 2(b) to the Company s consolidated financial statements. Determination of fair value involves subjective judgments and estimates. Accordingly, the notes to our consolidated financial statements express the uncertainty with respect to the possible effect of such valuations, and any change in such valuations, on our consolidated financial statements.

Revenue Recognition 
 The Company records dividend income and interest, adjusted for amortization of premium and accretion of discount, on an accrual basis. Investments that are expected to pay regularly scheduled interest and/or dividends in cash are generally placed on non-accrual status when principal or interest/dividend cash payments are past due 30 days or more (90 days or more for equipment financing) and/or when it is no longer probable that principal or interest/dividend cash payments will be collected. Such non-accrual investments are restored to accrual status if past due principal and interest or dividends are paid in cash, and in management s judgment, are likely to continue timely payment of their remaining interest or dividend obligations. Interest or dividend cash payments received on investments may be recognized as income or applied to principal depending upon management s judgment. Some of our investments may have contractual PIK income. PIK income computed at the contractual rate, as applicable, is accrued and reflected as a receivable up to the capitalization date. PIK investments offer issuers the option at each payment date of making payments in cash or in additional securities. When additional securities are received, they typically have the same terms, including maturity dates and interest rates, as the original securities issued. On these payment dates, the Company capitalizes the accrued interest or dividends receivable (reflecting such amounts as the basis in the additional securities received). PIK generally becomes due at the maturity of the investment or upon the investment being called by the issuer. At the point the Company believes PIK is not expected to be realized, the PIK investment will be placed on non-accrual status. When a PIK investment is placed on non-accrual status, the accrued, uncapitalized interest or dividends is reversed from the related receivable through interest or dividend income, respectively. The Company does not reverse previously capitalized PIK income. Upon capitalization, PIK is subject to the fair value estimates associated with their related investments. PIK investments on non-accrual status are restored to accrual status if the Company again believes that PIK is expected to be realized. Loan origination fees, original issue discount, and market discounts are capitalized and amortized into income using the effective interest method. Upon the prepayment of a loan, any unamortized loan origination fees are recorded as interest income. We record prepayment premiums on loans and other investments as interest income when we receive such amounts. Capital structuring fees are recorded as other income when earned. 
 The typically higher yields and interest rates on PIK securities, to the extent we invested, reflect the payment deferral and increased credit risks associated with such instruments and that such investments may represent a significantly higher credit risk than coupon loans. PIK securities may have unreliable valuations because their continuing accruals require continuing judgments about the collectability of the deferred payments and the value of any associated collateral. PIK income has the effect of generating investment income and increasing the incentive fees payable at a compounding rate. In addition, the deferral of PIK income also increases the loan-to-value ratio at a compounding rate. PIK securities create the risk that incentive fees will be paid to the Investment Adviser based on non-cash accruals that ultimately may not be realized, but the Investment Adviser will be under no obligation to reimburse the Company for these fees. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, capitalized PIK income totaled 1.4 million and 6.1 million, respectively. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, capitalized PIK income totaled 2.7 million and 8.9 million, respectively. 
 Net Realized Gain or Loss and Net Change in Unrealized Gain or Loss 
 We generally measure realized gain or loss by the difference between the net proceeds from the repayment or sale and the amortized cost basis of the investment, without regard to unrealized appreciation or depreciation previously recognized, but considering unamortized origination or commitment fees and prepayment penalties. The net change in unrealized gain or loss reflects the change in portfolio investment values during the reporting period, including the reversal of previously recorded unrealized gain or loss, when gains or losses are realized. Gains or losses on investments are calculated by using the specific identification method. 
 Income Taxes 
 SLRC, a U.S. corporation, has elected to be treated, and intends to qualify annually, as a RIC under Subchapter M of the Code. In order to qualify for U.S. federal income taxation as a RIC, the Company is required, among other things, to timely distribute to its stockholders at least 90 of investment company taxable income, as defined by the Code, for each year. Depending on the level of taxable income earned in a given tax year, we may choose to carry forward taxable income in excess of current year distributions into the next tax year and pay a nondeductible 4 U.S. federal excise tax on such income, as required. To the extent that the Company determines that its estimated current year annual taxable income will be in excess of estimated current year distributions, the Company accrues an estimated excise tax, if any, on estimated excess taxable income. 
 Recent Accounting Pronouncements 
 The Company considers the applicability and impact of all accounting standard updates ASU issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board. ASUs not listed were assessed and either determined to be not applicable or expected to have minimal impact on its consolidated financial statements.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 
 Results comparisons for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023 are presented below: 
 Investment Income 
 For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, gross investment income totaled 59.8 million and 176.8 million, respectively. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, gross investment income totaled 59.6 million and 169.5 million, respectively. The increase in gross investment income for the year over year three and nine month periods was primarily due to the growth of the SSLP portfolio as well as an increase in average index rates. 
 Expenses 
 Net expenses totaled 35.4 million and 104.3 million, respectively, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, of which 14.0 million and 41.7 million, respectively, were base management fees and performance-based incentive fees and 18.9 million and 55.3 million, respectively, were interest and other credit facility expenses. Other general and administrative expenses totaled 2.6 million and 7.4 million, respectively, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024. Over the same periods, 41 thousand and 0.1 million of performance-based incentive fees were waived. Net expenses totaled 36.3 million and 101.3 million, respectively, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, of which 13.8 million and 40.6 million, respectively, were base management fees and performance-based incentive fees and 19.9 million and 53.0 million, respectively, were interest and other credit facility expenses. Other general and administrative expenses totaled 2.7 million and 8.2 million, respectively, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023. Over the same periods, 0.2 million and 0.4 million of performance-based incentive fees were waived. Expenses generally consist of management and performance-based incentive fees, interest and other credit facility expenses, administrative services fees, insurance expenses, legal fees, directors fees, transfer agency fees, printing and proxy expenses, audit and tax services expenses and other general and administrative expenses. Interest and other credit facility expenses generally consist of interest, unused fees, agency fees and loan origination fees, if any, among others. The decrease in expenses for the year over year three month periods was primarily due to lower interest expense from a decrease in average borrowings as well as a decrease in the spread and index rates on borrowings. The increase in expenses for the year over year nine month periods was primarily due to higher interest expense from an increase in average borrowings as well as an increase in incentive fees due to comparatively higher investment income. 
 Net Investment Income 
 The Company s net investment income totaled 24.3 million and 72.5 million, or 0.45 and 1.33, per average share, respectively, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024. The Company s net investment income totaled 23.4 million and 68.2 million, or 0.43 and 1.25, per average share, respectively, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 Net Realized Loss 
 The Company had investment sales and prepayments totaling approximately 224 million and 447 million, respectively, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024. Net realized losses over the same periods were 2.7 million and 2.5 million, respectively. The Company had investment sales and prepayments totaling approximately 206 million and 473 million, respectively, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023. Net realized losses over the same periods were 31.0 million and 29.8 million, respectively. Net realized losses for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 were primarily due to the exit of our investments in NSPC Holdings LLC and NSPC Intermediate Corp. Net realized losses for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 were primarily related to our investment in American Teleconferencing Services, Ltd. 
 Net Change in Unrealized Gain (Loss) 
 For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, net change in unrealized gain (loss) on the Company s assets totaled 0.4 million and 3.1 million, respectively. Net unrealized gain for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily due to appreciation in the value of our investments in KBH Topco, LLC, Outset Medical, Inc. and Bayside Parent, LLC, among others, partially offset by the reversal of previously recognized unrealized appreciation on our investments in Neuronetics, Inc. and Alimera Sciences, Inc. as well as depreciation in the value of our investment in SLR Equipment Finance and Logix Holding Company, among others.. Net unrealized gain for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily due to appreciation in the value of our investments in KBH Topco, LLC, SLR Credit Solutions, Outset Medical, Inc. and Bayside Parent, LLC, among others, partially offset the reversal of previously recognized unrealized appreciation on our investment in Alimera Sciences, Inc. as well as by depreciation in the value of our investments in SLR Equipment Finance, SOINT, LLC and RQM+ Corp., among others. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, net change in unrealized gain on the Company s assets totaled 34.5 million and 14.4 million, 
 63 

Table of Contents 

respectively.

Net unrealized gain for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 is primarily due to the reversal of previously recognized unrealized depreciation on our investment in American Teleconferencing Services, Ltd. as well as appreciation in the value of our investments in Alimera Sciences, Inc., among others, partially offset by depreciation in the value of our investments in Oldco AI, LLC (f/k/a AmeriMark), SLR Credit Solutions and KBT Topco, LLC, among others. 
 Net Increase in Net Assets From Operations 
 For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company had a net increase in net assets resulting from operations of 22.0 million and 73.1 million, respectively. For the same periods, earnings per average share were 0.4 and 1.34, respectively. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, the Company had a net increase in net assets resulting from operations of 26.9 million and 52.8 million, respectively.

 LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES 
 The Company s liquidity and capital resources are generated and generally available through its Credit Facility and SPV Credit Facility, the 2024 Unsecured Notes, the 2025 Unsecured Notes, the 2026 Unsecured Notes, the 2027 Unsecured Notes and the 2027 Series F Unsecured Notes (each as defined below and, collectively, the Debt Instruments ), through cash flows from operations, investment sales, prepayments of senior and subordinated loans, income earned on investments and cash equivalents, and periodic follow-on equity and/or debt offerings. As of September 30, 2024, we had a total of 393.2 million of collective unused borrowing capacity under the Credit Facility and SPV Credit Facility, subject to borrowing base limits. 
 We may from time to time issue equity and/or debt securities in either public or private offerings. The issuance of such securities will depend on future market conditions, funding needs and other factors and there can be no assurance that any such issuance will occur or be successful. The primary uses of existing funds and any funds raised in the future are expected to be for investments in portfolio companies, repayment of indebtedness, cash distributions to our stockholders, or for other general corporate purposes. 
 Debt 
 On April 1, 2022, we entered into an assumption agreement (the CF Assumption Agreement ), effective as of the closing of the Mergers. The CF Assumption Agreement relates to our assumption of the revolving credit facility, originally entered into on August 26, 2011 (as amended from time to time, the SPV Credit Facility ), by and among SUNS SPV LLC (the SUNS SPV ), a wholly-owned subsidiary of SUNS, acting as borrower, Citibank, N.A., acting as administrative agent and collateral agent, and the other parties thereto. Currently, subsequent to an August 30, 2024 amendment, the commitment under the SPV Credit Facility is 275 million. The stated interest rate on the SPV Credit Facility is SOFR plus 2.25 -2.75 with no SOFR floor requirement, and the current final maturity date is August 30, 2028. The SPV Credit Facility is secured by all of the assets held by SUNS SPV. Under the terms of the SPV Credit Facility and related transaction documents, we, as successor to SUNS, and SUNS SPV, as applicable, have made certain customary representations and warranties and are required to comply with various covenants, including leverage restrictions, reporting requirements and other customary requirements for similar credit facilities. The SPV Credit Facility also includes usual and customary events of default for credit facilities of this nature. At September 30, 2024, outstanding USD equivalent borrowings under the SPV Credit Facility totaled 165.1 million. 
 On April 1, 2022, we entered into an assumption agreement (the Note Assumption Agreement ), effective as of the closing of the Mergers. The Note Assumption Agreement relates to our assumption of 85 million in aggregate principal amount of five-year, 3.90 senior unsecured notes, due March 31, 2025 (the 2025 Unsecured Notes and other obligations of SUNS under the Note Purchase Agreement, dated as of March 31, 2020 (the Note Purchase Agreement ), among SUNS and certain institutional investors. Interest on the 2025 Unsecured Notes is due semi-annually on March 31 and September 30. Pursuant to the Note Assumption Agreement, we expressly assumed on behalf of SUNS the due and punctual payment of the principal of (and premium, if any) and interest on all the 2025 Unsecured Notes outstanding and the due and punctual performance and observance of every covenant and every condition of the Note Purchase Agreement to be performed or observed by SUNS. 
 On January 6, 2022, the Company closed a private offering of 135 million of unsecured notes with a fixed interest rate of 3.33 and a maturity date of January 6, 2027 (the 2027 Series F Unsecured Notes ). Interest on the 2027 Series F Unsecured Notes 
 64 

Table of Contents 

is due semi-annually on January 6 and July 6. The 2027 Series F Unsecured Notes were issued in a private placement only to qualified institutional buyers. 
 On August 16, 2024, the Company closed on Amendment No. 3 to its August 28, 2019 senior secured credit agreement (the Credit Facility ). Following the amendment, the Credit Facility is now composed of 620 million of revolving credit and 140 million of term loans. Borrowings generally bear interest at a rate per annum equal to the base rate plus a range of 1.75 -2.00 or the alternate base rate plus 0.75 -1.00 . The Credit Facility has a 0 floor, matures in August 2029 and includes ratable amortization in the final year. The Credit Facility may be increased up to 800 million with additional new lenders or an increase in commitments from current lenders. The Credit Facility contains certain customary affirmative and negative covenants and events of default. In addition, the Credit Facility contains certain financial covenants that, among other things, require the Company to maintain a minimum stockholder s equity and a minimum asset coverage ratio. At September 30, 2024, outstanding USD equivalent borrowings under the Credit Facility totaled 501.0 million, composed of 336.8 million of revolving credit and 140.0 million of term loans. 
 On September 14, 2021, the Company closed a private offering of 50 million of unsecured notes with a fixed interest rate of 2.95 and a maturity date of March 14, 2027 (the 2027 Unsecured Notes ). Interest on the 2027 Unsecured Notes is due semi-annually on March 14 and September 14. The 2027 Unsecured Notes were issued in a private placement only to qualified institutional buyers. 
 On December 18, 2019, the Company closed a private offering of 125 million of unsecured notes with a fixed interest rate of 4.20 and a maturity date of December 15, 2024 (the 2024 Unsecured Notes ). Interest on the 2024 Unsecured Notes is due semi-annually on June 15 and December 15. The 2024 Unsecured Notes were issued in a private placement only to qualified institutional buyers. 
 On December 18, 2019, the Company closed a private offering of 75 million of unsecured notes with a fixed interest rate of 4.375 and a maturity date of December 15, 2026 (the 2026 Unsecured Notes ). Interest on the 2026 Unsecured Notes is due semi-annually on June 15 and December 15. The 2026 Unsecured Notes were issued in a private placement only to qualified institutional buyers. 
 Certain covenants on our issued debt may restrict our business activities, including limitations that could hinder our ability to finance additional loans and investments or to make the distributions required to maintain our status as a RIC under Subchapter M of the Code. At September 30, 2024, the Company was in compliance with all financial and operational covenants required by the Debt Instruments. 
 Cash Equivalents 
 We deem certain U.S. Treasury bills, repurchase agreements and other high-quality, short-term debt securities as cash equivalents. The Company makes purchases that are consistent with its purpose of making investments in securities described in paragraphs 1 through 3 of Section 55(a) of the 1940 Act. From time to time, including at or near the end of each fiscal quarter, we consider using various temporary investment strategies for our business. One strategy includes taking proactive steps by utilizing cash equivalents as temporary assets with the objective of enhancing our investment flexibility pursuant to Section 55 of the 1940 Act. More specifically, from time to time we may purchase U.S. Treasury bills or other high-quality, short-term debt securities at or near the end of the quarter and typically close out the position on a net cash basis subsequent to quarter end. We may also utilize repurchase agreements or other balance sheet transactions, including drawing down on the Credit Facility, as deemed appropriate. The amount of these transactions or such drawn cash for this purpose are excluded from total assets for purposes of computing the asset base upon which the management fee is determined. We held a face amount of 325 million in cash equivalents as of September 30, 2024.

(1) As of September 30, 2024, we had a total of 393.2 million of unused borrowing capacity under our revolving credit facilities, subject to borrowing base limits. 

Under the provisions of the 1940 Act, we are permitted, as a BDC, to issue senior securities in amounts such that our asset coverage ratio, as defined in the 1940 Act, equals at least 150 of gross assets less all liabilities and indebtedness not represented by senior securities, after each issuance of senior securities. If the value of our assets declines, we may be unable to satisfy the asset coverage test. If that happens, we may be required to sell a portion of our investments and, depending on the nature of our leverage, repay a portion of our indebtedness at a time when such sales may be disadvantageous. Also, any amounts that we use to service our indebtedness would not be available for distributions to our common stockholders. Furthermore, as a result of issuing senior securities, we would also be exposed to typical risks associated with leverage, including an increased risk of loss. 
 We have also entered into two contracts under which we have future commitments: an investment advisory and management agreement (the Advisory Agreement ), pursuant to which the Investment Adviser has agreed to serve as our investment adviser, and an administration agreement (the Administration Agreement ), pursuant to which the Administrator has agreed to furnish us with the facilities and administrative services necessary to conduct our day-to-day operations and provide on our behalf managerial assistance to those portfolio companies to which we are required to provide such assistance. Payments under the Advisory Agreement are equal to (1) a percentage of the value of our average gross assets and (2) a two-part incentive fee. Payments under the Administration Agreement are equal to an amount based upon our allocable portion of the Administrator s overhead in performing its obligations under the Administration Agreement, including rent, technology systems, insurance and our allocable portion of the costs of our chief financial officer and chief compliance officer and their respective staffs. Either party may terminate each of the Advisory Agreement and Administration Agreement without penalty upon 60 days written notice to the other. See Note 3 to our Consolidated Financial Statements. 
 On July 31, 2017, the Company, NEFPASS LLC and NEFCORP LLC entered into a servicing agreement. NEFCORP LLC was engaged to provide NEFPASS LLC with administrative services related to the loans and capital leases held by NEFPASS LLC. NEFPASS LLC may terminate this agreement upon 30 days written notice to NEFCORP LLC. 
 On October 7, 2022, the Company committed 50 million to SSLP and entered into a servicing agreement. SSLP engaged and retained the Company to provide certain administrative services relating to the facilities, supplies and necessary ongoing overhead support services for the operation of SSLP s ongoing business affairs in exchange for a fee.

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 
 From time to time and in the normal course of business, the Company may make unfunded capital commitments to current or prospective portfolio companies. Typically, the Company may agree to provide delayed-draw term loans or, to a lesser extent, revolving loans or equity commitments. These unfunded capital commitments always take into account the Company s liquidity and cash available for investment, portfolio and issuer diversification, and other considerations. Accordingly, the Company had the following unfunded capital commitments at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively:

Table of Contents 

The Company controls the funding of these commitments and may cancel them at its discretion. 
 The credit agreements governing the above loan commitments contain customary lending provisions and/or are subject to the respective portfolio company s achievement of certain milestones that allow relief to the Company from funding obligations for previously made commitments in instances where the underlying company experiences materially adverse events that affect the financial condition or business outlook for the company. Since these commitments may expire without being drawn upon, unfunded commitments do not necessarily represent future cash requirements or future earning assets for the Company. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company had sufficient cash available and/or liquid securities available to fund its commitments and had reviewed them for any appropriate fair value adjustment. 
 In the normal course of business, we invest or trade in various financial instruments and may enter into various investment activities with off-balance sheet risk, which may include forward foreign currency contracts. Generally, these financial instruments represent future commitments to purchase or sell other financial instruments at specific terms at future dates. These financial instruments contain varying degrees of off-balance sheet risk whereby changes in the market value or our satisfaction of the obligations may exceed the amount recognized in our Consolidated Statements of Assets and Liabilities.

Tax characteristics of all distributions will be reported to stockholders on Form 1099 after the end of the calendar year. Future quarterly distributions, if any, will be determined by the Board. We expect that our distributions to stockholders will generally be from accumulated net investment income, net realized capital gains or non-taxable return of capital, if any, as applicable. 
 71 

Table of Contents 

We have elected to be taxed as a RIC under Subchapter M of the Code. To maintain our RIC tax treatment, we must distribute at least 90 of our ordinary income and realized net short-term capital gains in excess of realized net long-term capital losses, if any, out of the assets legally available for distribution. In addition, although we currently intend to distribute realized net capital gains i.e. , net long-term capital gains in excess of short-term capital losses), if any, at least annually, out of the assets legally available for such distributions, we may in the future decide to retain such capital gains for investment. 
 We maintain an opt out dividend reinvestment plan for our common stockholders. As a result, if we declare a distribution, then stockholders cash distributions will be automatically reinvested in additional shares of our common stock, unless they specifically opt out of the dividend reinvestment plan so as to receive cash distributions. 
 We may not be able to achieve operating results that will allow us to make distributions at a specific level or to increase the amount of these distributions from time to time. In addition, due to the asset coverage test applicable to us as a business development company, we may in the future be limited in our ability to make distributions. Also, the Credit Facility may limit our ability to declare distributions if we default under certain provisions. If we do not distribute a certain percentage of our income annually, we will suffer adverse tax consequences, including possible loss of the tax benefits available to us as a RIC. In addition, in accordance with GAAP and tax regulations, we include in income certain amounts that we have not yet received in cash, such as contractual payment-in-kind income, which represents contractual income added to the loan balance that becomes due at the end of the loan term, or the accrual of original issue or market discount. Since we may recognize income before or without receiving cash representing such income, we may have difficulty meeting the requirement to distribute at least 90 of our investment company taxable income to obtain tax benefits as a RIC. 
 With respect to the distributions to stockholders, income from origination, structuring, closing and certain other upfront fees associated with investments in portfolio companies are treated as taxable income and, accordingly, distributed to stockholders. 
 Related Parties 
 We have entered into a number of business relationships with affiliated or related parties, including the following: 
 We have entered into the Advisory Agreement with the Investment Adviser. Mr. Michael S. Gross, our Chairman, Co-Chief Executive Officer and President, and Mr. Bruce J. Spohler, our Co-Chief Executive Officer, Chief Operating Officer and board member, are managing members and senior investment professionals of, and have financial and controlling interests in, the Investment Adviser. In addition, Mr. Shiraz Y. Kajee, our Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer, serves as the Chief Financial Officer for the Investment Adviser, and Mr. Guy F. Talarico, our Chief Compliance Officer and Secretary, serves as Partner, General Counsel and Chief Compliance Officer for the Investment Adviser. 

The Administrator provides us with the office facilities and administrative services necessary to conduct day-to-day operations pursuant to our Administration Agreement. We reimburse the Administrator for the allocable portion of overhead and other expenses incurred by it in performing its obligations under the Administration Agreement, including rent, the fees and expenses associated with performing compliance functions, and the compensation of our chief compliance officer, our chief financial officer and their respective staffs. 

We have entered into a license agreement with the Investment Adviser, pursuant to which the Investment Adviser has granted us a non-exclusive, royalty-free license to use the licensed marks SOLAR and SLR . 

72 

Table of Contents 

The Investment Adviser may also manage other funds in the future that may have investment mandates that are similar, in whole or in part, with ours. For example, the Investment Adviser presently serves as investment adviser to SCP Private Credit Income BDC LLC, an unlisted BDC that focuses on investing primarily in senior secured loans, including non-traditional asset-based loans and first lien loans, SLR HC BDC LLC, an unlisted BDC whose principal focus is to invest directly and indirectly in senior secured loans and other debt instruments typically to middle market companies within the healthcare industry, and SLR Private Credit BDC II LLC, an unlisted BDC focused on first lien senior secured floating rate loans. In addition, Mr. Gross, our Chairman, Co-Chief Executive Officer and President, Mr. Spohler, our Co-Chief Executive Officer and Chief Operating Officer, Mr. Kajee, our Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer, and Mr. Talarico, our Chief Compliance Officer and Secretary, serve in similar capacities for SCP Private Credit Income BDC LLC, SLR HC BDC LLC and SLR Private Credit BDC II LLC. The Investment Adviser and certain investment advisory affiliates may determine that an investment is appropriate for us and for one or more of those other funds. In such event, depending on the availability of such investment and other appropriate factors, the Investment Adviser or its affiliates may determine that we should invest side-by-side with one or more other funds. Any such investments will be made only to the extent permitted by applicable law and interpretive positions of the SEC and its staff, and consistent with the Investment Adviser s allocation procedures. On June 13, 2017, the Investment Adviser received an exemptive order that permits the Company to participate in negotiated co-investment transactions with certain affiliates, in a manner consistent with the Company s investment objective, positions, policies, strategies and restrictions as well as regulatory requirements and other pertinent factors, and pursuant to various conditions (the Exemptive Order ). If the Company is unable to rely on the Exemptive Order for a particular opportunity, such opportunity will be allocated first to the entity whose investment strategy is the most consistent with the opportunity being allocated, and second, if the terms of the opportunity are consistent with more than one entity s investment strategy, on an alternating basis. Although the Investment Adviser s investment professionals will endeavor to allocate investment opportunities in a fair and equitable manner, the Company and its stockholders could be adversely affected to the extent investment opportunities are allocated among us and other investment vehicles managed or sponsored by, or affiliated with, our executive officers, directors and members of the Investment Adviser. 
 Related party transactions may occur among us, SLR Senior Lending Program LLC, SLR Senior Lending Program SPV LLC, SLR Credit, Equipment Operating Leases LLC, KBH, Loyer Capital LLC, SLR Business Credit, SLR Healthcare ABL and SLR Equipment. These transactions may occur in the normal course of business. No administrative or other fees are paid to the Investment Adviser by SLR Senior Lending Program LLC, SLR Senior Lending Program SPV LLC, SLR Credit, Equipment Operating Leases LLC, KBH, Loyer Capital LLC, SLR Business Credit, SLR Healthcare ABL or SLR Equipment. 
 In addition, we have adopted a formal code of ethics that governs the conduct of our officers and directors. Our officers and directors also remain subject to the duties imposed by both the 1940 Act and the Maryland General Corporation Law. 
 Item 3. Quantitative and Qua litative Disclosures About Market Risk 
 We are subject to financial market risks, including changes in interest rates. Uncertainty with respect to interest rates, inflationary pressures, risks in respect of a failure to increase the U.S. debt ceiling or a downgrade in the U.S. credit rating, the war between Ukraine and Russia, certain regional bank failures, an inflationary environment, the ongoing war in the Middle East and health epidemics and pandemics introduced significant volatility in the financial markets, and the effects of this volatility have materially impacted and could continue to materially impact our market risks. Because we fund a portion of our investments with borrowings, our net investment income is affected by the difference between the rate at which we invest and the rate at which we borrow. As a result, there can be no assurance that a significant change in market interest rates will not have a material adverse effect on our net investment income. In a low interest rate environment, including a reduction of SOFR to zero, the difference between the total interest income earned on interest earning assets and the total interest expense incurred on interest bearing liabilities may be compressed, reducing our net interest income and potentially adversely affecting our operating results. Conversely, in a rising interest rate environment, such difference could potentially increase thereby increasing our net investment income. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, certain investments in our comprehensive investment portfolio had floating interest rates. These floating rate investments were primarily based on floating SOFR and typically have durations of one to three months after which they reset to current market interest rates. Additionally, some of these investments have floors. The Company also has revolving credit facilities that are generally based on floating SOFR. Assuming no changes to our balance sheet as of September 30, 2024 and no new defaults by portfolio companies, a hypothetical one percent decrease in SOFR on our comprehensive floating rate assets and liabilities would decrease our net investment income by five cents per average share over the next twelve months. Assuming no changes to our balance sheet as of September 30, 2024 and no new defaults by portfolio companies, a hypothetical one percent increase in SOFR on our comprehensive floating rate assets and liabilities would increase our net investment income by approximately six cents per average share over the next twelve months. However, we may hedge against interest rate fluctuations from time to time by using standard hedging instruments such as futures, options, swaps and forward contracts subject to the requirements of the 1940 Act. While hedging activities may insulate us against adverse changes in interest rates, they may also limit our ability to participate in any benefits of

certain changes in interest rates with respect to our portfolio of investments. At September 30, 2024, we had no interest rate hedging instruments outstanding on our balance sheet.

We may also have exposure to foreign currencies through various investments. These investments are converted into U.S. dollars at the balance sheet date, exposing us to movements in foreign exchange rates. In order to reduce our exposure to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, we may borrow from time to time in such currencies under our multi-currency revolving credit facility or enter into forward currency or similar contracts. 
 Item 4. Control s and Procedures 
 (a) Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 As of September 30, 2024 (the end of the period covered by this report), we, including our Co-Chief Executive Officers and Chief Financial Officer, evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) of the 1934 Act). Based on that evaluation, our management, including our Co-Chief Executive Officers and Chief Financial Officer, concluded that, as of September 30, 2024, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective and provided reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed in our periodic SEC filings is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. However, in evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, management recognized that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives, and management necessarily was required to apply its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of such possible controls and procedures. 
 (b) Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
 Management has not identified any change in the Company s internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the third quarter of 2024 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company s internal control over financial reporting.

CODE OF BUSINESS CONDUCT 
 Introduction 
 Ethics are important to SLR Investment Corp. SLR , our , us , or we and to its management. SLR is committed to the highest ethical standards and to conducting its business with the highest level of integrity. 
 All officers, directors and employees of SLR, its investment adviser, SLR Capital Partners, LLC (the investment adviser and its administrator, SLR Capital Management, LLC (the administrator are responsible for maintaining this level of integrity and for complying with the policies contained in this Code of Business Conduct (the Code ). If you have a question or concern about what is proper conduct for you or anyone else, please raise these concerns with any member of SLR s management, or follow the procedures outlined in applicable sections of this Code. 
 Purpose of the Code 
 This Code applies to SLR s principal executive officer, principal financial officer or principal accounting officer, or persons performing similar functions (collectively, the Covered Officers each of whom is set forth in Appendix B), as well as any other officers, directors and employees of SLR, the investment adviser or the administrator (collectively, with the Covered Officers, the Covered Persons ). The Code is intended to: 
 help Covered Persons recognize ethical issues and take the appropriate steps to resolve these issues; 

deter ethical violations; 

assist Covered Persons in reporting any unethical or illegal conduct; and 

reaffirm and promote our commitment to a corporate culture that values honesty and accountability. 

All Covered Persons, as a condition of employment or continued employment, will acknowledge in writing that they have received a copy of this Code, read it, and understand that the Code contains our expectations regarding their conduct. 
 Conflicts of Interest 
 Covered Persons must avoid any conflict, or the appearance of a conflict, between their personal interests and our interests. A conflict exists when a Covered Person s personal interest in any way interferes with our interests, or when Covered Persons take any action or have any interest that may make it difficult for them to perform their job objectively and effectively. 
 Although typically not presenting an opportunity for improper personal benefit, conflicts arise from, or as a result of, the contractual relationship between SLR and its investment adviser and administrator. As a result, this Code recognizes that the Covered Officers will, in the normal course of their duties (whether formally for SLR or for the investment adviser or administrator of which the Covered Officer is an employee, or for both), be involved in establishing policies and implementing decisions which will have different effects on the investment adviser, administrator and SLR. The participation of the Covered Officers in such activities is inherent in the contractual relationship between SLR and the 
 1 

investment adviser and administrator and is consistent with the performance by the Covered Officers of their duties as officers of SLR. 
 Thus, if performed in conformity with the provisions of the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the Investment Company Act ), such activities will be deemed to have been handled ethically. In addition, it is recognized by the Board of Directors that the Covered Officers may also be or in the future become officers or employees of one or more other investment companies covered by this or other Codes. 
 Other conflicts of interest are covered by the Code, even if such conflicts of interest are not subject to provisions in the Investment Company Act. The following list provides examples of conflicts of interest under the Code, but Covered Persons should keep in mind that these examples are not exhaustive. The overarching principle is that the personal interest of a Covered Person should not be placed improperly before the interest of SLR. 
 For example, a conflict of interest probably exists if: 
 A Covered Person causes us, the investment adviser or the administrator to enter into business relationships with the Covered Person or a member of his or her family, or invest in companies affiliated with the Covered Person or a member of his or her family; 

a Covered Person uses any nonpublic information about us, the investment adviser, the administrator, our customers or our other business partners for his or her personal gain, or the gain of a member of his or her family; or 

a Covered Person uses or communicates confidential information obtained in the course of his or her work for the Covered Person s or another s personal benefit. 

Corporate Opportunities 
 Each of us has a duty to advance the legitimate interests of SLR when the opportunity to do so presents itself. Therefore, Covered Persons may not: 
 take for themselves personally opportunities, including investment opportunities, discovered through the use of their position with us, the investment adviser or the administrator, or through the use of either s property or information; 

use our, the investment adviser s or the administrator s property, information, or position for their personal gain or the gain of a family member; or 

compete, or prepare to compete, with us, the investment adviser or the administrator. 

Confidentiality 
 Covered Persons must not disclose confidential information regarding us, the investment adviser, the administrator, our affiliates, our lenders, our clients, or our other business partners, unless disclosure is authorized or required by law. Confidential information includes all non- public information that might be harmful to, or useful to the competitors of, SLR, our affiliates, our lenders, our clients, or our other business partners. 
 2 

Fair Dealing 
 Covered Persons must endeavor to deal fairly with our customers, suppliers and business partners, or any other companies or individuals with whom we do business or come into contact with, including fellow employees and our competitors. Covered Persons must not take unfair advantage of these or other parties by means of: 
 manipulation; 

concealment; 

abuse of privileged information; 

misrepresentation of material facts; or 

any other unfair-dealing practice. 

Protection and Proper Use of Company Assets 
 Our assets are to be used only for legitimate business purposes. Covered Persons should protect our assets and ensure that they are used efficiently. 
 Incidental personal use of telephones, fax machines, copy machines, personal computers and similar equipment is generally allowed if there is no significant added cost to us, it does not interfere with any Covered Person s work duties, and is not related to an illegal activity or to any outside business. 
 Compliance with Applicable Laws, Rules and Regulations 
 Each Covered Person has a duty to comply with all laws, rules and regulations that apply to our business. Highlighted below are some of the key compliance guidelines that must be followed. 
 Insider trading . It is against the law to buy or sell securities using material information that is not available to the public. Individuals who give this inside information to others may be liable to the same extent as the individuals who trade while in possession of such information. Covered Persons must not trade in our securities, or the securities of our affiliates, our lenders, our clients, or our other business partners while in the possession of inside information. 

Whistleblower protections . It is against the law to discharge, demote, suspend, threaten, harass, or discriminate in any manner against an employee who provides information or otherwise assists in investigations or proceedings relating to violations of federal securities laws or other federal laws prohibiting fraud against shareholders. Covered Persons must not discriminate in any way against an employee who engages in these whistleblower activities. 

Investment Company Act requirements . A separate code of ethics has been established to comply with the Investment Company Act of 1940 and is applicable to those persons designated in such code. 

Document retention . Covered Persons must adhere to appropriate procedures governing the retention and destruction of records consistent with applicable laws, regulations and our policies. Covered Persons may not destroy, alter or falsify any document that may be relevant to a threatened or pending lawsuit or governmental investigation. 

3 

Please talk to any member of senior management if you have questions about how to comply with the above regulations and other laws, rules and regulations. 
 Equal Opportunity, Harassment 
 We are committed to providing equal opportunity in all of our employment practices including selection, hiring, promotion, transfer, and compensation of all qualified applicants and employees without regard to race, color, sex or gender, religion, age, national origin, handicap, disability, citizenship status, or any other status protected by law. With this in mind, there are certain behaviors that will not be tolerated. These include harassment, violence, intimidation, and discrimination of any kind involving race, color, religion, gender, age, national origin, disability, or marital status. 
 Accuracy of Company Records 
 We require honest and accurate recording and reporting of information in order to make responsible business decisions. This includes such data as quality, safety, and personnel records, as well as financial records. 
 All financial books, records and accounts must accurately reflect transactions and events, and conform both to required accounting principles and to our system of internal controls. No false or artificial entries may be made. 
 Retaining Business Communications 
 The law requires us to maintain certain types of corporate records, usually for specified periods of time. Failure to retain those records for those minimum periods could subject us to penalties and fines, cause the loss of rights, obstruct justice, place us in contempt of court, or seriously disadvantage us in litigation. 
 From time to time we establish retention or destruction policies in order to ensure legal compliance. We expect Covered Persons to fully comply with any published records retention or destruction policies, provided that Covered Persons should note the following exception: If any Covered Person believes, or we inform any Covered Person, that our records are relevant to any litigation or governmental action, or any potential litigation or action, then the Covered Person must preserve those records until we determine the records are no longer needed. This exception supersedes any previously or subsequently established destruction policies for those records. If a Covered Person believes that this exception may apply, or has any questions regarding the possible applicability of that exception, he or she should contact our Chief Compliance Officer. 
 Political Contributions 
 No funds of SLR may be given directly to political candidates. Covered Persons may, however, engage in political activity with their own resources on their own time. 
 Media Relations 
 We must speak with a unified voice in all dealings with the press and other media. As a result, our Co-Chief Executive Officers are the only contacts for media seeking information about SLR. Any requests from the media must be referred to our Co-Chief Executive Officers. 
 4 

Intellectual Property Information 
 Information generated in our business is a valuable asset. Protecting this information plays an important role in our growth and ability to compete. Such information includes business and research plans; objectives and strategies; trade secrets; unpublished financial information; salary and benefits data; lender and other business partner lists. Covered Persons who have access to our intellectual property information are obligated to safeguard it from unauthorized access and: 
 Not disclose this information to persons outside of SLR; 

Not use this information for personal benefit or the benefit of persons outside of SLR; and 

Not share this information with other Covered Persons except on a legitimate need to know basis. 

Internet and E-Mail Policy 
 We provide an e-mail system and Internet access to certain of our employees to help them do their work. Covered Persons may use the e-mail system and the Internet only for legitimate business purposes in the course of their duties. Incidental and occasional personal use is permitted, but never for personal gain or any improper use. Further, Covered Persons are prohibited from discussing or posting information regarding SLR in any external electronic forum, including Internet chat rooms or electronic bulletin boards. 
 Reporting Violations and Complaint Handling 
 Covered Persons are responsible for compliance with the rules, standards and principles described in this Code. In addition, Covered Persons should be alert to possible violations of the Code by SLR s, the investment adviser s or the administrator s employees, officers and directors, and are expected to report a violation promptly. Normally, reports should be made to one s immediate supervisor. Under some circumstances, it may be impractical or feel uncomfortable raising a matter with a supervisor. In those instances, Covered Persons are encouraged to contact our Chief Compliance Officer who will investigate and report the matter to our Co-Chief Executive Officers and/or Board of Directors, as the circumstance dictates. 
 Covered Persons will also be expected to cooperate in an investigation of a violation. 
 Anyone who has a concern about our conduct, the conduct of an officer of SLR, its investment adviser or its administrator or our accounting, internal accounting controls or auditing matters, may communicate that concern to the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors by direct communication with our Chief Compliance Officer or by email or in writing. All reported concerns shall be forwarded to the Audit Committee and will be simultaneously addressed by our Chief Compliance Officer in the same way that other concerns are addressed by us. The status of all outstanding concerns forwarded to the Audit Committee will be reported on a quarterly basis by our Chief Compliance Officer. The Audit Committee may direct that certain matters be presented to the full board and may also direct special treatment, including the retention of outside advisors or counsel, for any concern reported to it. 
 All reports will be investigated and whenever possible, requests for confidentiality shall be honored. And, while anonymous reports will be accepted, please understand that anonymity may hinder or impede the investigation of a report. All cases of questionable activity or improper actions will be reviewed for appropriate action, discipline or corrective actions. Whenever possible, we will keep confidential the 
 5 

identity of employees, officers or directors who are accused of violations, unless or until it has been determined that a violation has occurred. 
 There will be no reprisal, retaliation or adverse action taken against any Covered Person who, in good faith, reports or assists in the investigation of, a violation or suspected violation, or who makes an inquiry about the appropriateness of an anticipated or actual course of action. 
 For reporting concerns about SLR s, its investment adviser s or its administrator s conduct, the conduct of an officer of SLR, its investment adviser or its administrator, or about SLR s, its investment adviser s or its administrator s accounting, internal accounting controls or auditing matters, please use the following means of communication: 
 ADDRESS:	SLR INVESTMENT CORP. 500 Park Avenue, 3rd Floor New York, NY 10022 
 In the case of a confidential, anonymous submission, Covered Persons should set forth their concerns in writing and forward them in a sealed envelope to the Chairperson of the Audit Committee, in care of our Chief Compliance Officer, such envelope to be labeled with a legend such as: To be opened by the Audit Committee only. 
 Sanctions for Code Violations 
 All violations of the Code will result in appropriate corrective action, up to and including dismissal. If the violation involves potentially criminal activity, the individual or individuals in question will be reported, as warranted, to the appropriate authorities. 
 Application/Waivers 
 All the directors, officers and employees of SLR, its investment adviser and its administrator are subject to this Code. 
 Insofar as other policies or procedures of SLR, its investment adviser or its administrator govern or purport to govern the behavior or activities of all persons who are subject to this Code, they are superseded by this Code to the extent that they overlap or conflict with the provisions of this Code. 
 Any amendment or waiver of the Code for an executive officer or member of our Board of Directors must be made by our Board of Directors and disclosed on a Form 8-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission within four business days following such amendment or waiver.

principle: (i) ordinarily, you will be deemed to have a Pecuniary Interest in all Securities owned by members of your Immediate Family who share the same household with you; (ii) if you are a general partner of a general or limited partnership, you will be deemed to have a Pecuniary Interest in all Securities held by the partnership; (iii) if you are a shareholder of a corporation or similar business entity, you will be deemed to have a Pecuniary Interest in all Securities held by the corporation if you are a controlling shareholder or have or share investment control over the corporation s investment portfolio; (iv) if you have the right to acquire equity Securities through the exercise or conversion of a derivative Security, you will be deemed to have a Pecuniary Interest in the Securities, whether or not your right is presently exercisable; (v) if you are the sole member or a manager of a limited liability company, you will be deemed to have a Pecuniary Interest in the Securities held by the limited liability company; and (vi) ordinarily, if you are a trustee or beneficiary of a trust, where either you or members of your Immediate Family have a vested interest in the principal or income of the trust, you will be deemed to have a Pecuniary Interest in all Securities held by that trust. If you have any question about whether an interest in a Security or an account constitutes a Pecuniary Interest, you should contact the Chief Compliance Officer. 

U. Reportable Fund. The term Reportable Fund means (i) any Fund for which Adviser serves as investment adviser; or (ii) any Fund whose investment adviser or principal underwriter controls Adviser, is controlled by Adviser, or is under common control with Adviser. As used in this definition, the term control has the same meaning as it does in Section 2(a)(9) of the Investment Company Act. 

V. Reportable Security. The term Reportable Security means all Securities other than Non-Reportable Securities. Reportable Securities include Broad-Based Securities, municipal securities and any other securities not specifically included in the definition of a Non-Reportable Security.

X. SEC. The term SEC means the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. 

Y. Securities Act. The term Securities Act means the Securities Act of 1933, as amended.

 AA. Supervised Person. The term Supervised Person means (i) any partner, member, officer or director of SLR Capital, or other person occupying a similar status or performing similar function; (ii) any employee of SLR Capital; (iii) any U.S. consultant who has been contracted by SLR Capital for more than ninety (90) days; and (iv) any other person who provides advice on behalf of SLR Capital and is subject to SLR Capital s supervision and control.

The prohibition extends not only to public officials, but also to corporate clients and other private parties. 

The Adviser prohibits its personnel from requesting or accepting bribes and other improper financial advantages, as well as offering them. 

The Adviser maintains written policies, procedures and internal controls reasonably designed to comply with anti-bribery laws (the Anti-Bribery Program ). The Anti-Bribery Program includes a risk assessment process, education and training, review and approval processes, due diligence procedures, accounting processes and independent testing processes. The Adviser expects all of its agents and vendors to (i) maintain policies and procedures applicable to their circumstances and proportionate to the risks they face and (ii) to act at all times in a manner consistent with the Adviser s anti-bribery policies. 
 Personnel who engage in or facilitate bribery, or who fail to comply with all applicate anti-bribery laws, regulations, and the Adviser s anti-bribery and related policies, may be subject to disciplinary action. The Adviser reserves the right to terminate immediately any business relationship that violates the Adviser s anti-bribery policies. 
 The Adviser will conduct targeted email reviews, discussion of the policy will be conducted in code of ethics training. Any exceptions to the policy will be reported to Management.

IV. PERSONAL INVESTMENT AND TRADING POLICY 

A. General Statement 

SLR Capital is committed to maintaining the highest standard of business conduct. 
 SLR Capital and its Supervised Persons must not act or behave in any manner or engage in any activity that (1) involves or creates even the suspicion or appearance of the misuse of material, nonpublic information by SLR Capital or any Supervised Person or (2) gives rise to, or appears to give rise to, any breach of fiduciary duty owed to any Client or investor. 
 In addition, the Federal Securities Laws require that investment advisers maintain a record of every transaction in any Security, with certain exceptions, as described below, in which any Access Person acquires or disposes of Beneficial Ownership where the Security is or was held in an account over which the Access Person has direct or indirect influence or control. Given the current size of its operations, SLR Capital has chosen to require reporting of transactions, as well as pre-approval of certain transactions, for all Supervised Persons (subject to the specific exceptions in the Code), rather than only Access Persons. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Disinterested Directors are not subject to the preclearance and reporting requirements of the Code. However, with respect to the Company s securities Disinterested Directors must transact during the window periods as described in Appendix VII of this Code of Ethics and subsequently report the transaction detail to the Company on the day of the transaction. 
 SLR Capital has developed the following policies and procedures relating to personal trading in Securities and the reporting of such personal trading in Securities in order to ensure that each Supervised Person satisfies the requirements of this Code. 
 B. Requirements of this Code 

1. Duty to Comply with Applicable Laws. 

All Supervised Persons are required to comply with the Federal Securities Laws, the fiduciary duty owed by Adviser to its Clients, as applicable, and this Code. 
 2. Insider Trading Controls 

All Supervised Persons are required to comply with the Insider Trading Policies and Procedures adopted by the Adviser and the BDC which appears as Appendix VII of this Code of Ethics and is incorporated herein by this reference. 
 3. Duty to Report Violations. 

Each Supervised Person is required by law to promptly notify the Chief Compliance Officer or designee in the event he or she knows or has reason to believe that he or she or any other Supervised Person has violated any provision of this Code. If a Supervised Person knows or has reason to believe that the Chief Compliance Officer has violated any provision of this Code, the Supervised Person must promptly notify the Chief Financial Officer and is not required to notify the Chief Compliance Officer. 
 SLR Capital is committed to fostering a culture of compliance. SLR Capital therefore urges you to contact the Chief Compliance Officer or designee if you have any questions regarding compliance. You will not be penalized and your status at SLR Capital will not be jeopardized by communicating with the 
 A- 5 

Chief Compliance Officer. Reports of violations or a suspected violations also may be submitted anonymously to the Chief Compliance Officer or designee. Any retaliatory action taken against any person who in good faith reports a violation or a suspected violation of this Code is itself a violation of this Code and cause for appropriate corrective action, including dismissal. 
 4. Supervised Personnel to be Supplied Copies, and Furnish Acknowledgements of Receipt of the Code of Ethics and Any Amendments Thereof. 

SLR Capital will provide all Supervised Persons with a copy of this Code and all subsequent amendments. By law, all Supervised Persons must in turn provide written acknowledgement to the Chief Compliance Officer or designee of their initial receipt and review of this Code, their annual review of this Code and their receipt and review of any subsequent amendments to this Code. 
 C. Restrictions on Supervised Persons Trading in Securities 

1. Generally.

 Sales of Reportable Securities (other than Broad-Based Securities) by Supervised Persons require advance preclearance approval, in writing, by a Compliance Officer together with the specific approval of both Partners. 
 All Supervised Person personal trading in Securities (other than Broad-Based Securities) is subject to the following further requirements and/or restrictions. 
 (a) Any transaction in a Security subject to the Restricted List of issuers maintained by SLR Capital is strictly prohibited. 

(b) Any transaction in a Security which the Supervised Person knows or has reason to know is being purchased or sold, or is being considered for purchase or sale, by or on behalf of a Client is prohibited until the Client s transaction has been completed or consideration of the transaction is abandoned. A Security is being considered for purchase or sale the earlier of (i) when a recommendation to purchase or sell has been made and communicated or (ii) the Security is placed on Adviser s research project lists or, (iii) with respect to the Supervised Person making the recommendation, when the Supervised Person seriously considers making such a recommendation. 

(c) No Supervised Person may engage in a transaction in a Security, which includes an interest in a Fund, if the Supervised Person s transaction would otherwise disadvantage or appear to disadvantage a Client or if the Supervised Person would inappropriately profit from or appear to so profit from the transaction, whether or not at the expense of the Client. For the avoidance of doubt, this prohibition applies to any Security held, at the time of a personal transaction, in any Client account . 

(d) Any transaction in a Security during the period which begins three days before and ends three days after any Client has traded in that Security is prohibited, unless approved by a Compliance Officer. 

(e) No matched purchases and sales, or sales and purchases, in the same Security 

A- 6 

within a thirty-day period may be transacted without the advance approval of a Compliance Officer. This is requirement is reviewed on a first-in, first-out basis. This means that a security that is already in someone s portfolio may be sold within thirty-days of a purchase if certain shares of that security were in the portfolio prior to the thirty-day period. 

(f) Personal account trading must be done on the Supervised Person s own time without placing undue burden on SLR Capital s time. 

(g) No personal trades should be undertaken which are beyond the financial resources of the Supervised Person. 

(h) For the avoidance of doubt : 

(i) Supervised Person Transactions in Broad-Based Securities are subject to the reporting, but not the preclearance requirements of this Code. 

(ii) Supervised Person Transactions in Reportable Securities other than Broad-Based Securities are subject to both the preclearance and the reporting requirements of this Code.

(a) You may not hold, and you may not permit any other person or entity to hold, on your behalf, any publicly traded Reportable Securities in which you have, or by reason of a Supervised Person Purchase Transaction (as hereinafter defined) will acquire, a Beneficial Ownership Interest, except through an account of record with the Adviser maintained with a bank or registered broker-dealer custodian (a custodian or a registered investment adviser.

A Compliance Officer will then ask you to complete and sign a written notice to the account custodian or investment adviser (the forms of which are attached as Appendix IV and Appendix V hereto) which discloses your affiliation with the Adviser and requests that duplicate hard copies of trade confirmations and periodic statements reflecting all holdings and transactions within the account be promptly and confidentially sent to the attention of the Chief Compliance Officer. 1 A Compliance Officer will review and, upon approval, transmit the notice to your account custodian or 

1 In lieu of using the referenced Appendices requesting the forwarding of hard-copy confirmations and account statements, the Adviser will ordinarily ask, if feasible, that the account custodian agree to establish an automatic electronic feed of all account holding and transaction activity to the Adviser s area of the Personal Trade Compliance Center PTCC online cloud system which the Adviser has licensed from Compliance Science, Inc.

investment adviser. 

3. Transactions of Immediate Family Members. 

There is a presumption that a Supervised Person can exert some measure of influence or control over accounts held by members of such person s Immediate Family sharing the same household. Therefore, transactions by Immediate Family members sharing the same household are subject to the policies herein. A Supervised Person may rebut this presumption by presenting convincing evidence, in writing, to the Chief Compliance Officer and request an exemption to one or more policies herein. All exemptions must be approved by the Chief Compliance Officer, in writing. 
 4. The following are Exempt Transactions that do not require preclearance by a Compliance Officer: 

(a) Any transaction in Securities in an account over which a Supervised Person does not have any direct or indirect influence or control (such as a fully discretionary managed account through a registered investment adviser) except for IPOs and private securities. To rely upon this exemption, Supervised Persons must provide: (1) information about a trustee or third party manager s relationship to the Supervised Person (i.e., independent professional versus friend or relative; unaffiliated versus affiliated firm); (2) periodic certifications regarding the Supervised Persons influence or control over trusts or accounts (or obtain the certification from the third party manager or trustee when requested); and (3) when requested, reports on holdings and/or transactions made in the trust or discretionary account to identify transactions that would have been prohibited pursuant to the Code of Ethics, absent reliance on the reporting exemption. 

(b) Purchases of Securities under Automatic Investment Plans (such as an employer-sponsored 401(k) plan). 

(c) Purchases of Securities by exercise of rights issued to the holders of a class of Securities pro rata, to the extent they are issued with respect to Securities in which a Supervised Person has a Beneficial Ownership Interest.

The following procedures shall govern all transactions in which a Supervised Person or their immediate family members sharing the same household will sell (a Supervised Person Sale Transaction or acquire (a Supervised Person Purchase Transaction together with Supervised Person Sale Transaction , a Supervised Person Transaction a Beneficial Ownership Interest and which are subject to the requirement of securing advance preclearance approval, in writing, by a Compliance Officer.

The determination that a Supervised Person may unfairly benefit from, or that a Supervised Person Sale may conflict with or appears to be in conflict with, a Client Transaction will be subjective and individualized, and may include questions about the timely and adequate dissemination of information, availability of bids and offers, and other factors deemed pertinent for an individual Client transaction or series of transactions. It is possible that a disapproval of a Supervised Person Sale could be costly to a Supervised Person or members of a Supervised Person s family; therefore, each Supervised Person should take great care to adhere to SLR Capital s trading restrictions and avoid conflicts of interest or the appearance of conflicts of interest. 
 Any disapproval of a Supervised Person Sale Transaction shall be in writing. A Supervised Person may appeal any such disapproval by written notice to the Partners within two business days after receipt of notice of disapproval.

 A report documenting the above review and any exceptions noted will be prepared by the Chief Compliance Officer and circulated to the Partners within 60 days of the end of the quarter in which the reports were received. 
 Review of submitted holding and transaction reports will include not only an assessment of whether the Access Person followed all required procedures of this Code, such as preclearance, but may also: compare the personal trading to any restricted lists; assess whether the Access Person is trading for his or her own account in the same securities he or she is trading for Clients, and, if so, whether the Clients are receiving terms as favorable as the Access Person receives; periodically analyze the Access Person s trading for patterns that may indicate abuse, including market timing; investigate any substantial disparities between the quality of performance the Access Person achieves for his or her own account and that he or she achieves for Clients; and investigate any substantial disparities between the percentage of trades that are profitable when the Access Person trades for his or her own account and the percentage that are profitable when he or she places trades for Clients.

 In accordance with SLR Capital policies and procedures, please indicate whether you maintain private investments over which you have influence or control and in which any private investments are held in which you have a Beneficial Ownership Interest. 1 The term private investment is typically defined as an intangible investment and is very broadly construed by SLR Capital. Examples of private investments may include equity in a business or company, a loan to a business or company, an investment in a hedge fund or limited partnership, or securities held in your home or in a safe deposit box. Examples of investments that generally are not considered private investments are your primary residence, vacation home, automobiles, artwork, jewelry, antiques, stamps, and coins.

1 You will be considered to have a Beneficial Ownership Interest in an investment if you have a Pecuniary Interest in the investment. You will be considered to have a Pecuniary Interest in an investment if you, directly or indirectly, through any contract, arrangement, understanding, relationship or otherwise, have the opportunity, directly or indirectly, to profit or share in any profit derived from a transaction in the investment. The term Pecuniary Interest is construed very broadly. The following examples illustrate this principle: (i) ordinarily, you will be deemed to have a Pecuniary Interest in all investments owned by members of your Immediate Family who share the same household with you; (ii) if you are a general partner of a general or limited partnership, you will be deemed to have a Pecuniary Interest in all investments held by the partnership; (iii) if you are a shareholder of a corporation or similar business entity, you will be deemed to have a Pecuniary Interest in all investments held by the corporation if you are a controlling shareholder or have or share investment control over the corporation s investment portfolio; (iv) if you have the right to acquire equity security through the exercise or conversion of a derivative investment, you will be deemed to have a Pecuniary Interest in the investment, whether or not your right is presently exercisable; (v) if you are the sole member or a manager of a limited liability company, you will be deemed to have a Pecuniary Interest in the investments held by the limited liability company; and (vi) ordinarily, if you are a trustee or beneficiary of a trust, where either you or members of your Immediate Family have a vested interest in the principal or income of the trust, you will be deemed to have a Pecuniary Interest in all investments held by that trust.

 INSIDER TRADING POLICIES AND PROCEDURES 
 I.	BACKGROUND 
 All personal securities trades are subject to these Insider Trading Policies and Procedures. However, compliance with the trading restrictions imposed by these procedures by no means assures full compliance with the prohibition on trading while in the possession of inside information, as defined in these procedures. 
 Insider trading -- trading Securities while in possession of material, nonpublic information or improperly communicating such information to others -- may expose a person to stringent penalties. Criminal sanctions may include a fine of up to 1,000,000 and/or ten years imprisonment. The Commission may recover the profits gained, or losses avoided, through insider trading, obtain a penalty of up to three times the illicit gain or avoided loss, and/or issue an order permanently barring any person engaging in insider trading from the securities industry. In addition, investors may sue seeking to recover damages for insider trading violations. 
 These Insider Trading Policies and Procedures are drafted broadly and will be applied and interpreted in a similar manner. Regardless of whether a federal inquiry occurs, SLR Capital views seriously any violation of these Insider Trading Policies and Procedures. Any violation constitutes grounds for disciplinary sanctions, including dismissal and/or referral to civil or governmental authorities for possible civil or criminal prosecution. 
 The law of insider trading is complex; a Supervised Person legitimately may be uncertain about the application of these Insider Trading Policies and Procedures in a particular circumstance. A question could forestall disciplinary action or complex legal problems. Supervised Persons should direct any questions relating to these Insider Trading Policies and Procedures to a Compliance Officer. A Supervised Person must also notify a Compliance Officer immediately if he or she knows or has reason to believe that a violation of these Insider Trading Policies and Procedures has occurred or is about to occur. 
 Any capitalized terms used but not defined in the Insider Trading Policies and Procedures shall have their respective meanings as defined in the Code of Ethics of SLR Capital. 
 II.	STATEMENT OF FIRM POLICY 
 A.	At all times, the interests of SLR Capital s Clients must prevail over the individual s interest. 
 B.	Buying or selling Securities in the public markets on the basis of material, nonpublic information is prohibited. Similarly, buying and selling securities in a private transaction on the basis of material, nonpublic information is prohibited, except in the limited circumstance in which the information is obtained in connection with a private transaction with an issuer of securities, in which case the private transaction itself is permitted. A prohibited transaction would include purchasing or selling (i) for a Supervised Person s own account or one in which the Supervised Person has direct or indirect influence or control, (ii) for a Client s account, or (iii) for Adviser s inventory account. If any Supervised Person is uncertain as to whether information is material or nonpublic, he or she should consult the Chief Compliance Officer. 
 E.	Disclosing material, nonpublic information to inappropriate personnel, whether or not for consideration, i.e., tipping, is prohibited. Material, nonpublic information must be disseminated on a need to know basis only to appropriate personnel. This would include any confidential discussions 
 VII- 1 

Appendix VII 

 between the issuer and personnel of Adviser. The Chief Compliance Officer should be consulted should a question arise as to who is privy to material, nonpublic information. 
 F.	Assisting anyone transacting business on the basis of material, nonpublic information through a third party is prohibited. 
 G.	In view of the Gabelli Co./GAMCO Investments, Inc. SEC proceeding, it is clear that when a portfolio manager is in a position, due to his official duties at an issuer, to have access to inside information on a relatively continuous basis, self-reporting procedures are not adequate to detect and prevent insider trading. Accordingly, neither Adviser nor an Adviser employee may trade in any securities issued by any company of which any Adviser employee is an employee or insider. All Supervised Persons must report to the Chief Compliance Officer or designee any affiliation or business relationship they may have with any issuer (a form of which is attached as Appendix A hereto.) 
 H.	Supervised Persons should understand that if SLR Capital becomes aware of material, nonpublic information about the issuer of the underlying securities, even if the particular Supervised Person in question does not himself or herself have such knowledge, or enters into certain transactions for clients, SLR Capital will not bear any losses resulting in personal accounts through the implementation of these Insider Trading Policies and Procedures. 
 I.	It is the Company s policy that Supervised Persons may purchase or sell Company securities only during the window period that generally begins on the second business day after the Company publicly releases quarterly or annual financial results and exten ds until the 15th day of the last calendar month of the quarter in which the results are announced (or such shorter or longer time that may be designated by the Chief Executive Officer of the BDC CEO or the Chief Operating Officer of the BDC COO and the CCO). However, the ability of a Supervised Person to engage in transactions in Company securities during window periods is not automatic or absolute. Circumstances may prevent or delay or accelerate the opening of the window period or cause the window period to be shortened or lengthened. Further, no trades may be made even during a window period by an individual who possesses material, nonpublic information, other than in accordance with a previously approved Trading Plan. 
 Notwithstanding the foregoing, Supervised Persons may also purchase or sell Company securities pursuant to a Trading Plan. As used herein, the term Trading Plan shall mean a pre arranged trading plan adopted in accordance with and meeting all of the requirements of Rule 10b5-1(c) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, that has been approved by the Company s Chief Compliance Officer. A Trading Plan may only be entered into, modified or terminated (i) prior to expiration by Supervised Persons at a time they would otherwise be permitted to purchase or sell Company securities, and (ii) with the prior approval of the Company s Chief Compliance Officer. Each Supervised Person shall be responsible for ensuring compliance with the requirements of Rule 10b5-1(c) with respect to any Trading Plan they may enter into, modify or terminate prior to expiration, notwithstanding the prior approval thereof by the Company s Chief Compliance Officer. 
 In addition, the Adviser may, subject to regulatory restrictions, award Restricted Stock Units RSUs representing discretionary bonuses as part of an employee deferred compensation plan (the award during a closed window period provided that (1) the Adviser, the CEO and the COO are not in possession of material non-public information MNPI ); (2) the award does not require a purchase of Company securities on the open market but instead represents a transfer or potential transfer of Company securities then held by the Adviser; and (3) the CCO approves the award in advance. To the extent an award represents non-discretionary compensation, the RSUs may only be awarded in open window periods at a time when the Adviser, the CEO and the COO are not in possession of MNPI. 
 VII- 2 

Appendix VII 

 H.	 The following reviews principles important to these Insider Trading Policies and Procedures: 
 1.	What is Material Information? 
 Information is material when there is a substantial likelihood that a reasonable investor would consider it important in making his or her investment decisions. Generally, information is material if its disclosure will have a substantial effect on the price of a company s Securities. No simple bright line test exists to determine whether information is material; assessments of materiality involve highly fact-specific inquiries. However, if the information you have received is or could be a factor in your trading decision, you must assume that the information is material. Supervised Persons should direct any questions regarding the materiality of information to the Chief Compliance Officer or designee. 
 Material information often relates to a company s results and operations, including, for example, dividend changes, earnings results, changes in previously released earnings estimates, significant merger or acquisition proposals or agreements, major litigation, liquidation problems, and extraordinary management developments. Material information may also relate to the market for a Security. Information about a significant order to purchase or sell Securities, in some contexts, may be deemed material; similarly, prepublication information regarding reports in the financial press may also be deemed material. In addition, non-public information about one issuer may be material to a second issuer in the same or a related industry. 
 2.	What is Nonpublic Information? 
 Information is nonpublic until it has been disseminated broadly to investors in the marketplace. Tangible evidence of this dissemination is the best indication that the information is public. For example, information is public after it has become available to the general public through a public filing with the Commission or some other government agency, or available to the Dow Jones tape or The Wall Street Journal or some other general circulation publication, and after sufficient time has passed so that the information has been disseminated widely. If you believe that you have information concerning an issuer which gives you an advantage over other investors, the information is, in all likelihood, non-public. 
 3.	Identifying Inside Information. 
 Before executing any trade for oneself or others, including Clients, a Supervised Person must determine whether he or she has access to material, nonpublic information. If a Supervised Person believes he or she might have access to material, nonpublic information, he or she should: 
 a.	Immediately alert the Chief Compliance Officer or designee, so that the applicable Security is placed on the Restricted List. 
 b.	Not purchase or sell the Securities on his or her behalf or for others, including Clients (except in the limited circumstance in which the information is obtained in connection with a private transaction with an issuer of securities, in which case the private transaction itself is permitted). 
 c.	Not communicate the information inside or outside of Adviser, other than to the Chief Compliance Officer or designee (or, in the limited circumstance of a private transaction with an issuer of securities, to Supervised Persons within Adviser involved in the transaction with a need to know the information). 
 The Chief Compliance Officer will review the issue, determine whether the information is material 
 VII- 3 

Appendix VII 

 and nonpublic, and, if so, what action Adviser should take. 
 4.	Contacts With Public Companies. 
 Contacts with public companies may represent part of Adviser s research efforts and Adviser may make investment decisions on the basis of its conclusions formed through these contacts and analysis of publicly available information. Difficult legal issues may arise, however, when a Supervised Person, in the course of these contacts, becomes aware of material, nonpublic information. For example, a company s Chief Financial Officer could prematurely disclose quarterly results, or an investor relations representative could make a selective disclosure of adverse news to certain investors. In these situations, Adviser must make a judgment about its further conduct. To protect oneself, Clients, and Adviser, a Supervised Person should immediately contact the Chief Compliance Officer if he or she believes he or she may have received material, nonpublic information. 
 5.	Tender Offers. 
 Tender offers represent a particular concern in the law of insider trading for two reasons. First, tender offer activity often produces extraordinary movement in the price of the target company s securities. Trading during this time is more likely to attract regulatory attention, and produces a disproportionate percentage of insider trading cases. Second, the Commission has adopted a rule expressly forbidding trading and tipping while in possession of material, nonpublic information regarding a tender offer received from the company making the tender offer, the target company, or anyone acting on behalf of either. Supervised Persons must exercise particular caution any time they become aware of nonpublic information relating to a tender offer. 
 III.	INSIDER TRADING PROCEDURES APPLICABLE TO ALL SUPERVISED PERSONS 
 The following procedures have been established to aid Supervised Persons in avoiding insider trading, and to aid Adviser in preventing, detecting and imposing sanctions against insider trading. Every Supervised Person must follow these procedures or risk serious sanctions, including dismissal, substantial personal liability and criminal penalties. If a Supervised Person has any questions about these procedures, he or she should consult the Chief Compliance Officer or designee. 
 A.	 Responsibilities of Supervised Persons. 
 All Supervised Persons must make a diligent effort to ensure that a violation of these Insider Trading Policies and Procedures does not either intentionally or inadvertently occur. In this regard, all Supervised Persons (other than Disinterested Directors) are responsible for: 
 (a)	Reading, understanding and consenting to comply with these Insider Trading Policies and Procedures. Supervised Persons will be required to sign an acknowledgment that they have read and understood the Compliance Manual and therefore their responsibilities under the Code; 
 (b)	Ensuring that no trading occurs for their account, for any account over which they have direct or indirect influence or control or for any Client s account in Securities included on the Restricted List, or as to which they possess material, nonpublic information, regardless of the Securities being included on the Restricted List (except in the limited circumstance in which the information is obtained in connection with a private transaction with an issuer of securities, in which case the private transaction itself is permitted); 
 (c)	Not disclosing inside information obtained from any source whatsoever to 
 VII- 4 

Appendix VII 

 inappropriate persons. Disclosure to family, friends or acquaintances will be grounds for immediate termination and/or referral to civil or governmental authorities for possible civil or criminal prosecution; 
 (d)	Consulting the Chief Compliance Officer or designee when questions arise regarding insider trading or when potential violations of these Insider Trading Policies and Procedures are suspected; 
 (e)	Ensuring that Adviser receives copies of confirmations and statements from both internal and external brokerage firms for accounts of Supervised Persons and members of the Immediate Family of such Supervised Persons sharing the same household; 
 (f)	Advising the Chief Compliance Officer or designee of all outside business activities, directorships, or ownership of over 5 of the shares of a public company. No Supervised Person may engage in any outside business activities as employee, proprietor, partner, consultant, trustee officer or director without prior written consent of the Chief Compliance Officer, or a designee of the Chief Compliance Officer (a form of which is attached as Appendix A hereto); and 
 (g)	Being aware of, and monitoring, any Clients who are shareholders, directors, and/or senior officers of public companies. Any unusual activity including a purchase or sale of restricted stock must be brought to the attention of the Chief Compliance Officer or designee. 
 B.	 Security. 
 In order to prevent accidental dissemination of material, nonpublic information, personnel must adhere to the following guidelines: 
 Inform management when unauthorized personnel enter the premises. Lock doors at all times in areas that have confidential and secure files. Refrain from discussing sensitive information in public areas. 
 Refrain from leaving confidential information on message devices. Maintain control of sensitive documents, including handouts and copies, intended for internal dissemination only. 
 Ensure that faxes and e-mail messages containing sensitive information are properly sent, and confirm that the recipient has received the intended message. 
 Do not allow passwords to be given to unauthorized personnel. 
 IV.	SUPERVISORY PROCEDURES 
 Supervisory procedures can be divided into two classifications prevention of insider trading and detection of insider trading. 
 A.	 Prevention of Insider Trading 
 To prevent insider trading, the Chief Compliance Officer or designee should: 
 1.	Maintain a Restricted List which includes the name of any company, whether or not a client of Adviser, as to which one or more individuals at Adviser has a fiduciary relationship or may have material information which has not been publicly disclosed. The Restricted List is maintained by the Chief Compliance Officer and his or her designees. The Chief Compliance Officer or such other Compliance Officer as may be designated shall be responsible for: (i) determining whether any particular 
 VII- 5 

Appendix VII 

 securities should be included on the Restricted List; (ii) determining when Securities should be removed from the Restricted List; and (iii) ensuring that Securities are timely added to and removed from the Restricted List, as appropriate, no less frequently than on a quarterly basis. 
 2.	Answer questions regarding SLR Capital s policies and procedures; 
 3.	Resolve issues of whether information received by an officer, director or employee of SLR Capital constitutes Inside Information and determine what action, if any, should be taken; 
 4.	Review these Insider Trading Policies and Procedures on a regular basis and update them as necessary; 
 5.	When it has been determined that a Supervised Person has Inside Information: 
 (a)	Implement measures to prevent dissemination of such information other than to appropriate Supervised Persons on a need to know basis, and 
 (b)	Not permit any SLR Capital employee to execute any transaction in any securities of the issuer in question by rejecting any pre-clearance requests (except in the limited circumstance in which the information is obtained in connection with a private transaction with an issuer of securities, in which case the private transaction itself is permitted); 
 1.	Implement a program of periodic reminder notices regarding insider trading; 
 2.	Confirm with each trader no less frequently than quarterly whether there are any issuers for whom Adviser has Inside Information; and 
 3.	Compile and maintain the Restricted List of securities in which no Supervised Person may trade because Adviser as an entity is deemed to have Inside Information concerning the issuers of such securities and determine when to remove securities from the Restricted List. 
 B.	 Detection of Insider Trading 
 To detect insider trading, the Chief Compliance Officer or designee should: 
 1.	Review daily confirmations and quarterly trading activity reports filed by Supervised Persons; and 
 2.	Promptly investigate all reports of any possible violations of these Insider Trading Policies and Procedures. 
 C.	Special Reports to Management 
 Promptly upon learning of a potential violation of SLR Capital s Insider Trading Policies and Procedures, the Chief Compliance Officer or designee shall prepare a written report to management providing full details, which may include (1) the name of particular securities involved, if any, (2) the date(s) SLR Capital learned of the potential violation and began investigating; (3) the accounts and individuals involved; (4) actions taken as a result of the investigation, if any; and (5) recommendations for further action. 
 VII- 6 

Appendix VII 

 D.	General Reports to Management 
 At least yearly, the Chief Compliance Officer will prepare a written report to the management of Adviser setting forth some or all of the following: 
 1.	A summary of existing procedures to detect and prevent insider trading; 
 2.	A summary of changes in procedures made in the last year; 
 3.	Full details of any investigation, whether internal or by a regulatory agency, since the last report, regarding any suspected insider trading, the results of the investigation and a description of any changes in procedures promptly by any such investigation; and
